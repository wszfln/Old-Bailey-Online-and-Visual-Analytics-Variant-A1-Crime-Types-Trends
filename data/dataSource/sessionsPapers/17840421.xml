            ; on the first of November, between the hour of eight and nine in the evening; I went out to fetch some candles, I left nobody at home but my little girl, a twelve-month old; I locked the door, and after I had locked it, I tried it by the knocker, and I am sure it was fast, and the windows were fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure they were fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay out? - Almost ten minutes; when I returned, I perceived the door about a quarter of a yard open; I was quite stagnated, knowing that I had locked the door; and as I stood, I heard a rattling within; I was going to step into the house, and I drew back my foot, and at that instant three men came out of the house; I stepped a little way down the court, and they all run out, and I run after them and cried, stop thief! and I saw one of them, which was the prisoner, had my property in a bag; I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Was he stopped at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>How long after he run out of the court was it, that he was stopped and brought back? - About twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Where was he stopped; I think it was in Hatton Garden, he was brought back to me in about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you lose sight of him? - At the corner of the court.</p>
               <p>What light was there in the court? - There is a lamp over our door.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you to observe the faces of the men that came out of your house? - No further than I stood at the door when they all rushed out; I should know the other two men if I saw them; the prisoner was the first that came out.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to say positively, that the man that was brought back to you, was the same man that you saw come out of your house? - I believe him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Then can you, seeing a man run past you, in the instant when you are a good deal frightened and flurried, take upon you to swear to the man? - I believe him to be the man, so far as the light over the door enabled me to see him.</p>
               <p>But you cannot undertake to swear positively that it is the same man? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Were your things brought back? - Yes, they were brought back with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who brought him and the bag back? - The constable, his name is Griffiths.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner in Hatton Garden, on the first of November, between eight and nine; I was coming down Hare-street Hill, and I heard the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner running with this bundle under his arm, I pursued him, and as soon as I got up to him he dropped the bundle; I never lost sight of him; that was about twenty yards from the end of the court where the prosecutrix lives.</p>
               <p>Did you observe two other men run? - No, I saw none but him.</p>
               <p>Did you see him drop the bag? - Yes, I saw him drop it, he dropped it in Summer's street, about twenty yards from the corner; I did not see the bag picked up.</p>
               <p>You are sure that is the man that dropped the bag? - I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt at all that he was the man that dropped the bag? - I have no doubt at all that he was the man that dropped the bag.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270004"/>What did he say when you stopped him? - He said I am not the thief; I took him to Mr. Griffiths, on Hare-street Hill.</p>

               <p>Court. Was there any tinder in it? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you know then? - By the smell of it; I took him down to Mrs. Oldfield's and this bag was brought to Mrs. Oldfield's house; it was there when I brought the man there; I desired Mrs. Oldfield to take care of the bag while I took the prisoner to Bridewell; nothing particular passed going there; the prosecutrix said, she believed the prisoner was the man that went out of the house.</p>
               <p>What did he say to the charge that was made against him? - He pleaded that he was not the man.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner? - Because I knew him, I had seen him before.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you do with the bag? - I gave it to Mrs. Oldfield.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oldfield. The last witness brought the bag to me, and I laid it on the table till Mr. Griffiths came back, and it is the same he brought, and they are the same things that are in it now which were delivered to Griffiths; this petticoat I know by an iron mould, and several things, it is my own making.</p>
               <p>How did the door appear to be broke? - It was unlocked, and the lock spoiled.</p>

               <p>Court. Relate what you know of your own knowledge against the prisoner? - On the 24th of May, I fastened my door at past twelve at night, there was a difference between my husband and me, and I believe the prisoner knew that I was alone; I live in <placeName id="t17840421-2-crimeloc8">Eyre-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Where were your lodgers at night when you fastened up your door? - They were all in bed, they have a private door, the lodgers come in by the passage door; I am sure they were all gone to bed; and when I came out in the morning, my shop door next the street was open, the street door was fast, and the lock of the shop door was spoiled.</p>
               <p>When you alarmed your lodgers, what became of the man? - He made off when I slammed the door, he put his hand to his right breeches pocket, and felt his pocket, he took nothing out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>What did you lose? - There were twelve pounds of tallow candles, a pound of tea, and the other things in the indictment, the till was taken away; the till and the tea cannisters were found again.</p>
               <p>Were any of them ever found on the prisoner? - Never.</p>
               <p>What light had you when this man came in? - There was light enough to see what I had to do, and I was three minutes looking at him when he came; if I was a dying I think I must own him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him to my knowledge before.</p>
               <p>How came you to say, in the beginning of your evidence, that you believed he knew you was alone? - He had been frequently about the neighbourhood, as I have been informed, I might have seen him, but not to know him.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you first heard the noise of this breaking of the glass, before you saw this man come into your room? - It was a long time, it was totally dark at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270006"/>Then it most be a long while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What hour did you get up? - About three in the morning, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to swear quite positively, that the prisoner was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you got any of your things again? - I have got none of my property, only the man seemed to hang about the neighbourhood, and I wish he was at liberty, but I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was your shop door fastened that night? - Bolted and locked, the lock was picked, nothing was forced, the bolts got undone by being shook.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, Mr. Akerman's books will prove where I was on the 24th of May, I was in Newgate from some time in March till the July sessions, then I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Newman. Was this man in your custody? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Townsend. Yes, my Lord, he was, he was left for the opinion of the twelve Judges.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am as innocent of that other affair as I am of this, only through that woman persuading the people, and I hope such a woman as this will be made an example of.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, if I had not been in such an unhappy place, my life would have been sworn away.</p>
               <p>Court to Townsend. Was that the man that lay in the p rison from March to July? - Yes, my Lord, I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. You should certainly be more careful in swearing positively to the persons of men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, here is the Sessions-paper, and it appears that a man of the name of

               <p>Was it the same man you had seen before? - Yes, I saw him go on a gentle trot, till he came to a coach that was standing a few doors off; I went across and caught him, he had thrown the carcase down into the place they call hell, where the pump is.</p>
               <p>Did you see him throw it down? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Jury. What coloured coat had he on at that time? - I think it was an olive green.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts did you meet her? - At Charing-cross, she took me to this Nash's house, in Johnson's-court, Charing-cross, and we had several basons of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Did you go into a room by yourselves? - Yes, and we were afterwards shewn to a different room, a bed room.</p>
               <p>How long were you in the first room before you were shewn to the bed room? - I believe about two hours, drinking brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Were you and she alone all that time? - Yes, except the waiter.</p>
               <p>What quantity might you drink! - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you several bowls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you sober when you first met with the woman? - Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>But I suppose, by the time you had drank this brandy and water, you had got tolerably drunk? - I was stupid, muddled, and sleepy.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the door locked or not? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Where was your money when you went to bed? - In my breeches pocket, and my box in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Was your money loose, or in a purse? - My money was in a purse.</p>
               <p>Was it all in one purse or more? - All in one purse.</p>
               <p>Which side pocket? - My right side pocket.</p>
               <p>Where did you put your breeches when you undressed? - I did not pull my breeches off.</p>
               <p>Were you undressed all but your breeches? - I threw off my coat and waistcoat, and shoes.</p>
               <p>You fell asleep then? - Yes, the prisoner was with me, and when I awaked at two o'clock, she was gone and my money.</p>
               <p>It was dark when you awaked, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you found yourself alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon did you miss your money and your box? - I could not see to reckon it till daylight; then I came down and told the landlord.</p>
               <p>What had you left? - Five guineas and some silver, I had twenty guineas in the whole.</p>
               <p>Was your purse left? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you get up in the morning? - About seven.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was two when you first awaked? - I heard the clock go; I fell asleep again; I knew that my money was gone, but I could not tell how much till day-light.</p>
               <p>Did you examine your pocket when you first awaked? - Yes, my purse was out of my pocket, and I could not find it, but when it was daylight I found it on the pillow, and my watch along with it.</p>
               <p>How came you to have so large a sum of money about you? - I was lately come from Gibraltar; I lost fifteen guineas and my snuff box.</p>
               <p>Have you any other reason for suspecting this woman then her having been with you? - No, she owned to Justice Hyde, that she had three guineas and a half that was my money, that she took out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her own that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That could not be true? - No, I had no money in my waistcoat pocket, except halfpence.</p>
               <p>Had you taken out your purse while you was in her company? - Yes, I believe I did, for to pay for my bed.</p>
               <p>Had you paid your reckoning? - No, not till the next day.</p>
               <p>What did you pay for your bed and not your reckoning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you recollect giving the waiter the purse to take the money, it was four shillings you paid for your bed, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270009"/> Mackay, and you did pay your reckoning all but three shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>How long did they stay in that room? - I believe it might be about two hours; I did not see the gentleman that night, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>How much had they to drink? - Six or seven bowls of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - The prisoner went away.</p>

               <p>Was she with him in the bed room? - I do not know; in the morning the man came down stairs, and told me he had twenty guineas in his pocket, and out of that fifteen were gone, and he judged the prisoner had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Did he take any steps to recover the money again? - He went after the prisoner on the Saturday, but could not hear of her, he took her some days afterwards, I do not know the day.</p>
               <p>Did you take no steps yourself, for the honour of your house, to get this man his money again? - I went with this man over the water, where we were informed the prisoner lodged, but she was gone away.</p>
               <p>Is the waiter here? - No, Sir, I have not seen him for a day or two after this affair happened, he went away.</p>

               <p>How long has this woman used your house? - About two years, and always a very honest body.</p>
               <p>I think that you gentlemen that keep these kind of houses, should be answerable for the honestly of the women that come into them; I wonder you did not pay this money? - We never encourage any such thing, it will happen so sometimes.</p>
               <p>Have you any other custom for your tavern but the custom these poor women bring you? - Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>What licence have you? - A wine licence.</p>

               <p>I went with the prosecutor to Mr. Nash's house, we had several bowls of liquor, but into the bed room I did not go; the prosecutor gave the waiter the purse to take care of; I said I did not like to stay with him all night, as he had given the waiter his purse; as I came down stairs, I saw Mr. Nash and the waiter together, since that the waiter has had money; I left a handkerkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270010"/> of mine with Mr. Nash in the bar, I went and asked for my handkerchief, it was not there, and the gentleman had it in his pocket; Mr. Nash said he must take it out of his bar. I never told Mr. Hyde any such thing, and he would not say it if he was here; I had no more than two half crown pieces; a person was to have come to my character, one Mr. Ravenscroft, who lives over the way, but I did know of my trial coming on.</p>

               <p>I am a gentleman's servant; I have known the prisoner about three months before he was taken; I was walking along Leicester-fields with the prisoner one day, and he told me he had found two gold rings in a piece of paper, and one he pulled out, a plain gold ring, which that gentleman shewed just now, and he asked me to go in and see if it was gold; they told me it was, and they said they would not buy it; I went into another shop, and they told me it was not gold; upon that, he gave me the ring, and I carried it to my mother, and it was pawned by her for half a crown; I was taken up after that, and then I went with the constables to my mother, and she brought it down in the morning, and it was delivered up to the high constable; he asked me to go in and sell the mill, and the man knew the gentlewoman that I lived with, and he stopped the things; it was Mr. Elliott, opposite Swallow-street; that was at another time.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that windmill, and see whether it is the same? - Yes, it was broke in the same manner then.</p>
               <p>Court. How came that windmill from Mr. Elliott? - He brought it to Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I understood I should not be tried till Saturday; the prosecutor had a character with me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What was his character? - I understood he lived three years with Sir James Lake, but he had been some time out of service before I took him into my service.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe that this is his first fault? - Upon my word I do not know that it is not.</p>

               <p>Court. Let us hear them first.</p>
               <p>The witnesses examined apart at the request of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. THOMSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Somebody knocked at the door, the maid and I were in the parlour, a little after seven; the maid went and opened the door a little way, and a man said he had a letter of importance, and she looked at the directions, and she said it was not for her, nor any body there.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to hear or see what passed? - I heard it.</p>
               <p>Were the candles lighted at that time? - Yes, she was going to shut the door, and he said, no, hold, and then they pushed the door open, and in they rushed; they all came into the parlour first.</p>
               <p>How many were there? - Six, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How many did you see? - O, I do not know, I was frightened, I do not know how many I saw.</p>
               <p>How many came into the room where you was? - I cannot tell, there were several, I was too much frightened to count them, I was in the fore parlour.</p>
               <p>What did they do? - They walked backwards and forwards in the room, and I screamed out, and they held up a cutlass to my face, and threatened me if I did not hold my tongue; they did nothing but walk backwards and forwards, and guard me and my maid.</p>
               <p>What were the others doing the while? - Only one stood over me.</p>
               <p>Where was your maid? - She was in the same room; when she first let them into the passage, they put a gag into her mouth, and hurt her very much.</p>
               <p>After they rushed in, did she come back again into your room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she guarded in the same room that you was in, or in another room? - In the same room.</p>
               <p>How many of them were there guarding her and you? - Only two, the others went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing rifled in the room where you was? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did they remain up stairs? - I believe near three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Could you hear what they were doing up stairs? - I heard them very busy, pulling out all the drawers, and they did pull them out, and did a great deal before they went away, but I could only hear them tumbling the things about, and pulling open the drawers.</p>
               <p>Did they all go away together? - I believe so, I believe it was not quite eight when they were all gone.</p>

               <p>How long had you lighted candles before they came in? - About half an hour, it might be about twenty minutes after seven when they came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270013"/>Can you tell as to its being dark, did you light candles early that night? - Not earlier than usual.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - O yes, it was dark, a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Because the sun does not set at this time till after six, this was the 10th of March? - This was twenty minutes after seven; after they were gone, I went up stairs, and found all the drawers open; I went first into the fore room, over the parlour, that was the bedchamber.</p>
               <p>Were the drawers that you found open, in that chamber? - Yes, they were a double chest of drawers, and a low chest of drawers besides.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing else out of these drawers? - No, none of my clothes, they had not meddled with them, they told me they only wanted money; I missed one diamond ring, which was in a snuff box in my dressing glass drawer; I missed a silver net purse, with a crown piece and two half crown pieces in it; I missed them from my dressing box, with a pincushion at the top of it, in a low chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing else? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Where were the silver milk pot and the other things? - The silver milk pot, and the tea spoons and tongs were in a little green baise bag, pinned up in the drawers in the back parlour, in the bureau drawer.</p>
               <p>Was the bureau forced open? - They broke it open, in order to have found something else; they broke it with a pair of tongs, they came into the parlour and carried off the tongs, and so forced it open.</p>
               <p>Where were the salts, and the pepper castor, and the table spoons, and the watch and buckles taken from? - The table spoons were in a case with some silver handled knives and forks, that case was at the top of the chest of drawers in my bed-chamber, one of the salts was on the table in the room with me; I lost nothing out of that room but that one salt, that happened accidentally to be in the room with me, the other was in the back parlour, and they moved the salt out; the pepper castor was in the back parlour too, and the watch was hanging up by the chimney side in my bed-chamber, it was a gold watch in a black shagreen case.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at your indictment, Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, it says green in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thomson. The shoe buckles and knee buckles were in a black case, I suppose, in the low drawers.</p>
               <p>Where were the other shoe buckles? - They were in the bureau, in the back parlour, which they broke open, hoping to find something better.</p>
               <p>Where was the silver three-pence lost from? - That was in the little silver purse, with the crown piece and two half crowns.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your things again? - No, they are found.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you have any thing to say against him? - I cannot.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have been servant to Mrs. Thomson seven years, except two months; I have a letter in my pocket; on the 10th of March, between seven and eight, or about a quarter after seven, they knocked a gentle knock at the door, I was in the parlour with my mistress at work; I asked who was at the door; they said, there was a letter of importance, upon which I opened the door a little way, and they held their thumb on the direction of the letter, and I said it was not for us, because it was directed for Miss Young.</p>
               <p>Did they thrust the letter in? - Yes, they held it with their hand to the candle, and when I went to push the door with my hand and my knee, they thrust in; they said, stop, and in they all came.</p>
               <p>How many? - To the best of my knowledge there were six.</p>



               <p>What was the first thing you observed they did? - When they came I cried out, O, Lord Jesus, we shall all be killed! and one of them immediately seized me by the throat, and I felt several others about me; after that, I desired them to let me go into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270014"/> the parlour to my mistress, who was just come out of a fit of sickness, for I was afraid they would frighten her to death; with that, some cried out, cut them down, and others said, gag them, and I saw several gags in their hands.</p>
               <p>Do you know what gags are? - They were several pieces of wood, of different sizes; then the child screamed out violently, that they would not murder her aunt; and the washerwoman came out of the kitchen, and a man in short clothes met her on the stairs, and clapped her hand to her mouth, and desired her not to make a noise; and she said she would not, if he would let her go to us; and when she came in, the tall man said, take the child and quiet her, and be damned to you, and they let her take the child away; after that, three of them, as nigh as I can guess, left the room; with that, the prisoner at the bar and two others went away, and left one with a cutlass and another with a pistol in the parlour, and I thought I heard another in the passage, or at the street door, and I staid in the parlour; presently after that my mistress said there was a knock at the door, and I said I heard nobody, but my master would be home at eight o'clock; a man came into the parlour, with a short jacket, and breeches buttoned in, and took the parlour tongs and opened the desk, they stood all then by the side of the desk. A pair of steel buckles of my master's were found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay in the house? - As nigh as I can guess, about three quarters of an hour; I believe they had been there about a quarter of an hour when I said my master would be in at eight o'clock: the prisoner was the man that came in and took the candles off the table, and went to the desk in the back room.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a short jacket and fustian breeches buttoned in, and a hat very much over his face.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else over his face? - No, Sir, I did not know that there was any thing else over his face.</p>
               <p>Did not know! why you saw, did not you? - No, I did not see any thing over his face.</p>
               <p>As his hat was very much over his face, you could not see his face, could you? - When I saw him at the Rotation Office, with his hat very much over his face, he was a striking likeness of the man, I could see his nose, and mouth, and lips.</p>
               <p>Did he speak at all? - I never hard him open his lips.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him after? - The persons that took him came to me the day after, and we went the next day at eleven o'clock; this was on the Wednesday, and on the Friday we were appointed to see them; I knew him to be the same man that was in the house, and went backwards and forwards in the two rooms.</p>
               <p>When did you first know that the steel buckles had been found upon him? - The same afternoon the man came to us with the watch and the other things.</p>
               <p>When the men came, desiring you to come to the Rotation Office, did they bring the buckles with them? - I saw them at the Rotation Office.</p>
               <p>Before you had seen the man or after? - It was after.</p>
               <p>What dress was he in when you saw him at the Rotation Office? - He was dressed in a purple long coat, of a fine cloth, and a neckcloth about his neck.</p>
               <p>Had he his hat on when you first saw him? - Not when I first saw him, but it was a new hat, lined with blue.</p>
               <p>That was a very different dress? - It was, but I knew him.</p>
               <p>You go before me all the way, you will have it you know the man, and perhaps you do, but answer my questions; did you know him to be the same man when you first saw him? - I knew him to be the same man before his hat was put on; I immediately said, that was the man that was in the house, and that went into the back parlour; I saw him afterwards with his hat on twice, the Justice made him put it on; he would not have it put over his face, and he gave one of the runners a knock; it was put over his face, and I knew him perfectly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270015"/> well before it was put over; when it was put over his face, he appeared to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Court. Remember, child, here is a man's life at stake, and when you saw him at the Rotation Office he was very differently dressed. - I am very sure he is the man that was in the room, and that went into the back parlour, for he struck me the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>After they were gone you found the house had been rifled? - After they were gone out of the parlour, I thought they might be in the house, and I called out of the window; I found all the drawers entirely broken, and the cabinet broke open.</p>
               <p>(The letter produced, being a blank sheet of paper, directed to Miss Young, Islington.)</p>

               <p>Did you see him searched? - Yes, they took the plate out of his hand in the street, and some pieces of money out of his pocket in the public house; these steel buckles I took out of the prisoner's breeches pocket; I asked him how he came by them? he said he found them in a coach.</p>

               <p>Could you judge by their manner of walking, whether they spoke to another or not? - They were talking very loud as they went by, they seemed to be all in one company; Savre went by them, and turned round and came up to Jacobs and the prisoner; and Jacobs had this bundle in his hand, and I saw him move his hand towards the prisoner, and Sayer caught hold of the prisoner, and Jacobs run on; we pursued him, and M'Donald caught hold of the skirts of his coat, he had the bundle in his hand; then he run about twelve or fourteen yards; I took the bundle out of his hand; this is the bundle, I have had it locked up up ever since; here is a watch, a pair of salts, half a dozen tea spoons and a pair of sugar tongs.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270016"/>How came you to let Jacobs get away? - He broke out of the round house while we were gone to Islington to look for the prosecutor.

               <p>Prisoner. What time of night was this? - It was exactly nine, when we took them into a public house to search them.</p>

               <p>I lived in Drury Lane, and was going out to get some super, and there were five or six men going along, I was coming along, and they were shoving one another about; and as they were shoving one another about, I picked up these buckles; these men took me, and took me into a public house, and searched me.</p>
               <p>Sayer. My Lord, the buckles were in this paper and tied with a bit of string, and it was a very wet night, and there was no dirt on the paper.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were your buckles when you lost them tied up in a paper or were they loose? - I really forget whether they were loose, or in a paper, but I rather think in a paper.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What way of life have you been in? - I am a heel maker by trade.</p>
               <p>Have you worked at your trade till you was taken? - Yes, Sir, till I was taken bad, these men know when I was taken, I was not able to lift my hands to my head.</p>
               <p>Grubb. He pretended he was lame that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you prove where you was at this time? - I had nobody at home but my wife, I worked at the widow Barnes's, at Barbican, I had not been at work for almost a fortnight, I was not able to work.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to speak for you? - No, Sir, I was taken at such a disadvantage. that I had no time to get any body to come up.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is a burglary of a kind rather unusual, though very atrocious; the entry was obtained by artifice and by management, therefore there is no direct breaking; but inasmuch as the mischief is precisely the same, whether the entry is obtained by artifice, when the intention is to commit a felony in the house; as if they had actually broke open the door with a sledge hammer: the law constructs the obtaining the entry by a trick and artifice for the same purpose, to be precisely the same crime as breaking into the house: as to the mistake of the watch being in a green shagreen case, that might have been material if he had been charged with stealing nothing else. If therefore, the prisoner appears to you upon the evidence before you, to be one of the parties concerned in this burglary, which is a very daring and atrocious one, it will be your duty to find him guilty; but however daring and atrocious the outrage is, unless the evidence is such as to bring home conviction to your minds, that the prisoner was a party concerned in it, you will also think it your duty to acquit him.</p>

               <p>Were they all at home at the time you found the door open? - Yes, I went directly into my master's room the back parlour, and there were three of the drawers of the bureau drawn out, and the linen taken out.</p>
               <p>What things were usually kept there? - Shirts, stockings, handkerchiefs, and so on, we could not find which way they got in, I went into the fore parlour, and the sash was down, and I saw a little print of dirt close by the fore parlour window.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason now to know how they got in? - No other than that the sash was not fastened, I suppose they got in that way, and took the chain down and let themselves out. The things were found, and are in Court.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>About half past eight I came from the pay-table, then I went to my mother's, for if I have any thing to spare I give it to her, she was not at home, she chared at Lady Byron's in Somerset-street; there was a man stood against the wine vaults with this bundle, he asked me to give him a hand with it to Bond-street, and he would pay me any thing I required, I immediately took it on my back, and when I came to the corner of Bond-street I put it down as the man told me, then came up Mr. Randall, and he said, what have you got here, chips or shavings? I said, be it which it will, it does not belong to you. I have no friends here at present, I did not think my trial would have come on so soon.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, As to breaking there is a difficulty which is not explained to your satisfaction or mine; nobody knows how they got into the house, there are no marks of violence any where; there is a small circumstance that goes to make it more probable that it should be at the parlour window, but that I rather think falls short of satisfactory proof that they did get in that way; they might have got in by some way which excludes the idea of force used to obtain admission; as for instance, if a garret window was open, and they got in by the leads, or if they got in at any other open window by a ladder: it therefore seems to me upon the whole evidence, if you should be satisfied that the prisoner was concerned in this robbery, the safest and properest verdict for you to give will be, that he is guilty of stealing the things, but not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house.</p>

Did you go out? - I went to the door immediately, but I did not see any body but some children picking up the glass; I went up stairs, and in the drawing room there was a little cabinet removed, and some chair covers; we went up stairs, and we saw some sheets taken off the bed; we looked in every room about the house before we acquainted the gentleman of the house with it, and there was a great deal of dirt about the window, and there was a flint and steel found dropped in the area.</p>

               <p>Court. What may be the value of these things?</p>
               <p>Golightly. I should think they must be worth five pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, with respect to the burglary, there seems to be no precise evidence to bring that part of the charge home to the prisoner, or any body else; there is strong presumptive evidence, that whoever committed this robbery, got in at the drawing room window; but in order to make it a burglary, you should have precise proof that the window through which the thieves entered was shut at the time; of that there is no precise proof. She has valued the whole of the things at five pounds, but you will judge of the value; the gown only is deposed to particularly.</p>

               <p>Where do you sleep? - Up one pair of stairs; I heard some person go half way down the passage, and then down the kitchen stairs; I did not see who it was; then after that I came down stairs, and went to my master for the key of the door, and he gave me the key, I went down to open the door, it was shut at night, and when I found it, the bolts were undone; I let in some people and examined every room, and I found the prisoner in the necessary; I found the office window open, and the bolt of the outside shutter broke off, taken off, and it has not been seen since, and the inside shutter was wrenched off the hinges; I heard somebody go down the kitchen stairs, and I heard him walking about, about a minute or so before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it daylight then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know nothing further? - No, I found a dark lanthorn in the office where he broke in, and this piece of wax candle.</p>

               <p>Court. Is that coal cellar within the house? - There is an area about four or five feet wide between the house and the coal cellars.</p>
               <p>Can they get into the coal cellar without coming into the house at all from the area? - Yes, the coal cellar opens into the area.</p>
               <p>Were any of the doors of the house broke? - No, there were two holes made in the door, and another in the post to which it is fastened, but they had not got it open, they had not got into the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an attempt to commit a burglary, but it was discovered before it was committed, certainly we cannot consider the coal cellar on the other side of the area as a part of the dwelling house, there is therefore no proof of the burglary, though there was a clear attempt to commit it.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoners. Young men, you have by your conduct on this occasion brought yourselves to this bar, to be tried for your lives upon a capital indictment, and you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270023"/> have had the good fortune to escape, through being, (as I hope it will turn out happily for you) interrupted in the commission of an offence, which there is too much reason to fear, from the evidence, you have attempted to commit; I shall abstain from saying all I think on the subject, therefore, there being no other charge against you, and no intention of further prosecuting you, you will be discharged; and, I hope, the risk you have run of your lives on this occasion, together with the disgrace of being brought into this Court of Justice, will be a warning to you, and that you will be thankful to God for having escaped the punishment due to such a crime.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he stand in any posture that was in the act of receiving it? - He stood in the act of receiving it; when I came up to them, Bean stepped down to me, and asked me the way to Charterhouse Square.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you mean stepped down to you? - He walked off the steps, he was upon the steps before the door; then the other that had the tray dropped it down the area; then my companion catched hold of Bean, and said to me, these are thieves; I said, so they are, let us pursue them; Bean got from him, and Burridge jumped over the bars and run away; I and Logar pursued them.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take them? - We took them between fifty and sixty yards off.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of them? - Not at all.</p>

               <p>When she went up stairs to go to bed, did not you ask her how long you was to stay there? - No, she said nothing about how long I was to stay or nothing.</p>
               <p>Did Jones say any thing to you how long you was to stay? - I supposed no longer than the morning that we went to work.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her, why she supposed her husband would hurt her? - No.</p>
               <p>How did they live together before? - I do not know, I never was acquainted with them, I never was at their house above once or twice in my life.</p>
               <p>Would not you have thought it a very odd thing, if your wife had sent for a man to have come and staid in your house all night, while she and you were above stairs? - I do not know, it was something odd to be sure, I could give no account about it.</p>
               <p>Had you observed any thing remarkable about the man or the woman before that time? - No, the woman was always a very good sort of a woman.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was he? - A very good sort of a man all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Was he a sober man? - I never heard that he was given to drinking, I was not acquainted with them any otherwise than living neighbours by them.</p>
               <p>It seems to me, by your account, you might as well have lived a thousand miles off? - I never go to any body's house but my own, and that is best.</p>
               <p>Did you and he never meet at an alehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any alehouses in your parish? - There is two.</p>
               <p>Which house did you frequent? - Sometimes I had a pint of beer at the Goat.</p>
               <p>And did you never meet him there? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say this man's master's name was Horne? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how long he worked with him?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Horne is no master of mine.</p>

               <p>What answer did she make to that? - She said, no; he then said, come along and go to bed; so I got up, and said, neighbour, how do you do; and he said the same to me, how do you do; then she asked me to go along with them into their house.</p>
               <p>He being present? - Yes, he said come along and go to bed, let any body come, I do not care who comes; so I went along with them.</p>
               <p>Is that all he said at that time? - Yes; when we came to their house, there was another woman at the door, and we went and followed Walker and his wife in doors.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between that other woman and them before you went in? - As soon as we were in, he locked one door and fastened the other, and he said, says he, I want to settle affairs with my wife, and she will not resolve me; she said she would resolve him any thing that lay in her power.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the very words that she said? - Yes, them were the very words.</p>

               <p>I want you to put yourself in her place, and tell me the words that she said? - I do now; she said she would resolve him any thing that he asked her.</p>
               <p>But you know she must have said, I will resolve you? - Yes, she said, I will resolve you as far as lays in my power.</p>
               <p>Did she say husband, or my dear, or any expression of that kind? - No, she did not; so he wanted to go to bed, and she took the coals up, and he went to bed, and she went up stairs with him, and warmed his bed, I believe.</p>
               <p>Leaving you and the woman below? - Yes, she came down again when he was in bed, and told this other woman and us, that how he had drawn his knife upon her six weeks ago in bed, before that time, and on the Wednesday night before that in bed.</p>
               <p>That is the last Wednesday night you mean before you was there? - Yes, and he had drawn his knife on her on the Thursday morning following, and said he would give her time to say her prayers, and then he would kill her; then Samuel Woods came to the same house.</p>
               <p>Was that all that she said at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she say how it happened he did not kill her? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her how she saved herself? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her what they had quarrelled about? - No, I asked her no questions at all concerning the affair she told me about.</p>
               <p>Had you no curiosity to know what should make the man draw his knife upon the woman? - No; then Samuel Woods came, and she asked him if he would be so good to go down to the overseers, because they had promised her that they would send somebody, and they had not sent any body to put in the house.</p>
               <p>For what? - Because she was afraid to be in the house when there was nobody else in the house but they and the children.</p>
               <p>Why was she afraid to be in the house, did she say? - I cannot tell, she did not resolve me any thing about that.</p>

               <p>What became of the other woman? - She went home.</p>

               <p>Then the woman went to bed you say? - Yes, and in about two hours and a half after this, Walker came down stairs in his shirt, and said, what, my lads! to the other man and me; so I said, what do you come down stairs without your clothes for; he never spoke no more, he went up stairs again, and in about two hours and a half after this, as nigh as I can guess, he says to his wife, Nan, who is to pay these two men?</p>
               <p>Did not you drop in sleep in all this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you sit talking to one another, or what? - I cannot say that we did not speak to one another, but we heard every word that was said; she said, do not make yourself uneasy, they will be paid I warrant you; so Walker says to his wife, says he, Nan, you must satisfy them; says she, do not make yourself uneasy, go to sleep if you can, you have not had any a good while; Mr. Morton will satisfy them; and in about a minute or two before the accident happened, he says, Nan, where is the pot?</p>
               <p>How long did they lay after this before he said that? - About two hours.</p>
               <p>What two hours more? - Yes, and she said, shall I reach it you, and he said no, and there was not another word more spoke, till she began screaming out, and from the time she began screaming out, they were down stairs in a very short time, and this other man and I went to the stairs foot, and they both came down directly upon us, I laid hold of his left hand, and said, Walker, what are you at, what is the matter with you? he never spoke, and when we released him from her, she dropped all along upon the ground.</p>
               <p>How was he holding her then? - With his arm round her neck that I laid hold on, so she dropped, and he stamped his left foot on her.</p>

               <p>Did he speak to her, or do any thing to her out of doors before she got up? - No, he did not touch her then as I saw, she got up and fell down again; there is a hurdle on the right hand side of the door, and

               <p>Did he say any thing when he had lighted the candle, or when he was looking into the drawers? - He walked about the house, and came and looked into his wife's face as she sat on the ground, and, says he, Nan, what beest dead? he said, says he, I told thee how I would serve thee, but thee wouldst not be ruled; says he, you nasty dirty hussy, and he called her in that manner, says he, you meant to kill me, now I believe I have killed you.</p>

               <p>She made no answer then to what he said about her trying to kill him? - No, Sir, I never heard any answer to that, that was the last that she said.</p>

               <p>Did he appear to you, during all this time, to be sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any strong liquors? - No, only a little ale and bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>How much might he drink? - I cannot tell, he drank several times, as much as the rest.</p>
               <p>How much was drank amongst you all? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How much do you apprehend you drank to your own share? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Were you all sober? - Yes, I staid there till eight o'clock, and then he was taken to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Who was he taken to there? - Mr. Fellows.</p>

             the Tuesday morning following.</p>
               <p>What became of him then? - Then he was brought to London.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the constable's house after he returned from Uxbridge? - Yes, Sir, I was with him all night, the Sunday night, and the Monday following.</p>
               <p>How did he behave? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Was he very quiet and orderly? - Very quiet, and did not offer to interrupt any body or any thing.</p>
               <p>Did he talk to you much? - No, Sir, the landlord of the house fetched him a bed down stairs, and he laid down upon it, and slept, as far as I know, all night, only in the middle of the night he wanted to get up.</p>
               <p>Did he talk at all about what had happened? - No, Sir, not in the night.</p>
               <p>Well, in the next day? - Yes, Sir, people asked him how did, and he answered to them and said, not half bad enough.</p>
               <p>What did he mean by that? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him what he meant by it? No.</p>
               <p>Did any body talk to him about what he had done? - Yes, a great many people, they asked him if he was not sorry for what he had done, and he would not speak to a great many.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him answer any body to that question? - No, Sir, I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270032"/>Did you ever hear him say, in answer to that, whether he was or was not sorry for what he had done? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long had you known the man before this thing happened? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Have you been often in his company? - Yes, several times, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>At his house? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>What aged woman was his wife? - I cannot tell, I have not been in the place above four years.</p>
               <p>How did they live together? - They lived together very well, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to live in friendship with each other? - Yes, Sir, as far as ever I saw.</p>
               <p>You know it is easy, if you was often at his house, to see whether either of them was of a quarrelsome temper, or whether they quarrelled with each other, or were upon good terms? - I never saw them when I was in the house, but I have heard her cry out many times when I was in my own house, I lived next door to him till within a fortnight.</p>
               <p>What sort of cries? - Cry out, O Lord, her head, or her arms, or her shoulders, or such a matter as that.</p>
               <p>Did you live nearer than Branch? - Yes, their chimney piece and mine were close together, and the two doors were not above three yards apart.</p>
               <p>Then you was near enough to hear a great deal that passed between these people when you was not in their house; did they live in bad terms, quarrelling, or in friendship together? - Whenever I was in their house I never heard them have a word amiss.</p>
               <p>I am not asking you that you know, I ask you when you was not in the house? - I never heard any words pass, only she would cry out.</p>
               <p>Did you hear nothing before that that led to it? - No.</p>
               <p>What did she complain of? - I never heard her say.</p>
               <p>But at the time that she cried out, could not you understand from her expressions what it was she was complaining of? - No, Sir, not at all, she was a woman that was very still woman, and hardly ever went to any body's house but her own, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Kept company with nobody, I suppose? - Nobody at all, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Did she take care of her children? - Yes, Sir, as much as any woman did, for all that ever I saw or knew.</p>
               <p>Was their house well taken care of and kept clean? - Yes, Sir, as clean as most poor people's houses are.</p>
               <p>Did she seem an industrious sober woman? - Yes, no woman more so, I believe, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man or a single man? - A married man.</p>
               <p>Your wife lived the next door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many children have you? - One.</p>
               <p>How long have you been married? - Little better than twelve months.</p>
               <p>Was he a sober man? - Yes, Sir, a very sober man, as far as ever I heard, any further than having a pint of beer and away.</p>
               <p>What tempered man was he? - I cannot say what his temper was.</p>
               <p>Was he a quarrelsome man? - I never knew nor saw any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell whether he was a good tempered man? - No, Sir, I cannot indeed.</p>
               <p>Have you any notion what it was he took amiss of his wife? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You cannot guess what it was? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had any thing passed before this happened that could give you any guess what it was he took so ill of his wife? - No, Sir, I know nothing at all of it any further.</p>
               <p>How long before this happened had you seen him? - This was the Thursday night, I had not seen him since the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Had you spent any time with him? - No further than we spoke together.</p>
               <p>How long before this accident happened was it that you heard her cry out of her head or her shoulders? - It might be quarter of a year, or it might be more, or it might be less.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270033"/>Where did you see him the Saturday night before? - At his own door.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be in health then? - Yes, Sir, as well as ever he was, as far as I saw.</p>
               <p>You took no notice of any thing extraordinary about him? - No, Sir, not at all.</p>
               <p>Had he ever talked at any time that you have observed, in any thing of a wild way? - No, Sir, I never heard him talk no other ways than as another man does.</p>

               <p>Then by your account I do not find that you had any suspicion that he was not in his right mind? - No, Sir, I had no suspicion as any thing was the matter with him not before the accident was.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful to me, my friend, when the woman talked of sending for the overseer, to desire that he would send somebody to be with them, as you know they had lived upon good terms, and had not quarrelled, that you did not ask the cause? - No, Sir, I could not think any thing about it.</p>
               <p>What could you suppose the overseer should be applied to for? - God knows, Sir, I do not know.</p>
               <p>They did not want money? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Then according to your account you had no suspicion that the man was out of his mind? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You had never seen any thing to lead you to suppose so? - No, Sir, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Does any thing occur to the Jury, I should be glad to have all possible assistance in this case, it is one of the most extraordinary cases I ever met with.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you go out of friendship or did you expect to be paid? - The overseer sent word down by

               <p>You know nothing of it earlier than that? - On the Monday before this happened, the woman, Walker's wife, spoke to me as I was going by the door, the mischief happened on the Friday, and she desired me to come over and speak to her husband, she said, she did not know what was the matter with him, and I came over and asked him, says I, Walker, what is the matter with you, and he replied, I do not know, I am very much troubled, but I do not know what is the reason of it; I asked him, if he did not know what troubled him? and he said, no, he had never done any body harm, and he did not know what was the reason of it; I told him to go to work, and see if he would not be better, and I afterwards saw him and his wife go together.</p>
               <p>Where? - They set out I imagined to go to work, I saw his wife return in about half an hour afterwards without hi m, and I asked her if he was gone to work, and she said, yes; and I never heard any more of them till the morning I was called up, which was on 5th of March, between two and three o'clock, I was in bed, and I was called up, I came to the window, and

               <p>A clasp knife open and a little bloody? - Yes, the deceased was not dead at that time, and I ran home for a horse to go for a surgeon, and while I was getting that and returning, the deceased was dead; I immediately got assistance and secured the prisoner, and took him up to the other constable's house, and kept him there till about eight o'clock in the morning; then we took him to Uxbridge, to Mr. Fellows's, and he said, he could not commit him till the Coroner's inquisition, the other constable took him Uxbridge, and I went for the Coroner, he was not at home, but he came on the Monday following, the 8th of March, and he took the inquisition, I was examined there and bound over, I took the prisoner to Newgate on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between you and him at any time that was remarkable? - When I seized him with another man, he said, I will not hurt you, you may do what you please; I had not the handcuffs with me, but I got a cord and pinioned his hands, and I went home for the handcuffs.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing about it afterwards? - Not that day, but the day I was going to Uxbridge with him, I asked him if the handcuffs pinched his hands, and he replied, it is no matter about my hands, if they were pulled off, after what I have done; I heard no more, I went down from Uxbridge to the Coroner's, I went to see him once at the other constable's house, and told him to think of his latter end, and he asked me for a book that was down at his house, I asked him what book it was, and he said it was The Sincere Word of God; I went down to his house, and found the book, and carried it to him, and he thanked me; the other constable brought him in the chaise to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him often before this thing happened? - Yes, as passing by him; I saw him at work about a fortnight before.</p>

               <p>How did he look? - He looked very well, but rather disturbed that something troubled him.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice of his countenance, his eyes, whether there was any wildness? - I did not take notice that there was any wildness.</p>

               <p>If it had happened to you to have thought of calling upon the overseer, and sent an apothecary to this man, probably the losing of a little blood, and a little medicine would have saved all this? - Yes, my Lord, but I did not think that there was any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270035"/> thing, but somewhat had troubled him; I did not know whether it was in his family, he did not say what.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any coolness between him and his wife? - No, my Lord, they seemed very agreeable.</p>
               <p>Jury. During the time that you had the prisoner in your custody, did he shew any marks of insanity? - No, I was very little with him.</p>
               <p>Court. There is something a little ambiguous in that, he might not shew marks of violent insanity, yet there might be a great deal more to be collected from that, than this man could observe; they are apt to think no man insane that does not do outrageous things; but we must collect his insanity from the fact - his mind seems to have turned to one object.</p>

            , and coming back down to this Mr. Walker's house, I met Mr. Tromper the constable coming down on horseback; I went down to the prisoner's house, and saw she was nigh upon death, and the governor of the workhouse, or Mr. Tromper, I cannot be sure which, said, that the church-warden should be there, I asked for a horse, and I would go and fetch him, and I went on Mr. Tromper's horse to the church-warden and called him up between three and four, and told him what had happened, and he told me to secure the man, and he would come up in the morning; when I returned from there I found the woman was dead, and carried up stairs, and the prisoner was taken care of, and carried to the King's Arms; when they took him away, the officer took an inventory of the goods, and asked me to go to see for some of the deceased's friends, and I went to her brother, and he came with me up to the King's Arms, and went into a room where

               <p>What did her brother say to him? - I do not know, Sir, there was very little discourse, the man seemed to cry mightily, they both cried one against the other, Walker and his wife's brother; I did not remember her brother said any thing, I sat by him, and I said, Walker, are not you sorry for what you have done? you have taken your wife's life away, and your own will be taken away, and your two children will be left destitute to the world; he cried very much, but made no answer.</p>
               <p>You had seen something of the woman before the accident happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - She came to me on the Thursday evening, as nigh as I can guess, about seven, to my own house, and says, Mr. Wood, I should be glad if you would go in doors and sit along with me, for my husband wants to go to bed, and shut up the doors, and I am afraid to go with him; she said Mr. Morton had promised to send somebody to be with her that night, but they were not come, I said I had not had my supper yet, and another thing, says I, I really do not chuse it, for to tell you the truth, I am afraid, and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270036"/> the prisoner Walker came into my house after his wife.</p>

               <p>That was all that passed till the prisoner came in? - Yes, when he came in, he says, Nan, what do you mean by serving me in this form, you seem to be afraid of a man, you did not use to be; and he made her answer again, that he would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>What did she say to him? - I do not remember she made any answer to him, and I said, Walker, if you hurt your wife you hurt yourself, and I entreated him to sit down and make himself easy, but he was not willing; and he said to me, I want her at home, I have got some business to settle with her; so I says to this Jones that was in my house, go along with them, and I will come to you as soon as I have had my supper; when I had had my supper, I went, and when I came to the house the street door was shut fast, but Jones or somebody let me in, I cannot say which; when I came in, they told me he was gone to bed, and I went to the foot of the stairs and called to him, and said, Walker, what be you in bed, and he said, yes; then I went down to the overseer, Mr. Morton.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to the overseer, who sent you? - The woman told me that she had been to him, and he had promised her to send somebody to her; he was not at home, then I went to the governor of the workhouse, to ask him if he had seen Mr. Morton, or had got any body to be along with Mrs. Walker; he said he did not know that he had; Mr. Morton had been about the village to try to get somebody to sit up with him in the house, and that he would satisfy any body that would sit up with him; then from there I went back to the prisoner's house, and the woman met me at the door, and asked me if I had done any thing for her, that was, whether I had got any grant for any body to be with her that night; I told her, yes; and she says to me, I wish you would sit up with

               <p>What was you to sit up for? - I do not know, there was somewhat I imagined.</p>

               <p>What did you understand to be the matter? - It seemed from what I thought, I cannot say any further, that this man must certainly have made some attempt to do something that he should not do with this woman, or else she would not be afraid to be with him by herself.</p>
               <p>If he had made any attempt upon her, the constable should have been sent for rather than the overseer, and she should not have been left in the house along with him. - That would certainly have been the right way; I was with Walker on the Tuesday before the accident, I heard he was not well, and I went to his house, when I came into his house, there was nobody but a young lad besides himself, and I asked him how he did, and he said he was very poorly, that he was in a very poor way; and I asked him what was the matter, and he said he could give me no account; and he went about the house trembling, the man seemed in a great flurry in his behaviour, as far as I could see, he walked backward and forwards; I asked him the reason, he said he was in a great flutter, and it came upon him at times, and then he got better when the fluttering went off, and he cried, and told me that he should be hanged, and that the neighbours said he bewitched people, and so he went on in that form in that discourse; and I told him there was no such thing, he must not fill himself up with such fancies, and he cried, and said that he had never done nobody no harm, and his wife was to have him away in a cart, and he was to be hanged; I tried to persuade him off of any thing of the kind of such nonsensical talk; his wife was gone to Mr. Morton's, I believe, at that time, and he seemed to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270037"/> in a great flurry because his wife was not in the way; and he asked me if I would go and fetch his wife, I told him to make himself easy, she would not be long before she was back again, and he still seemed to be very uneasy; at last I said, well, Mr. Walker, if you are willing, I will go and see for your wife, and I went out into the yard which comes into the street, and I saw her coming down the street, and I went and told him she was coming, and she came in while I was there, into the house, with a man with her, which she had been up to get to be with him that night.</p>

               <p>Because you have told us he was uneasy and impatient because she was not at home; did not he ask her where she had been, or what the man was brought for? - To the best of my knowledge he never spoke at all; then I went away.</p>

               <p>Before that time, how did he and his wife live together? - I never lived nigh enough to know any thing of their affairs in their living way.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was he, was he a quiet man? - As nigh as ever I knew in my life, I never knew any misbehaviour of the man.</p>

               <p>Did he ever drop any thing of being jealous of her? - I never heard any thing of that in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - No.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts did she pick it up? - By the screen in the house.</p>
               <p>Is that near the stairs? - About a couple of yards from the stairs.</p>

               <p>Was it in such a place, that if it had fallen on the stairs, it might have rolled there? - No, it was as if it had been thrown out from a person's hand.</p>

               <p>You lived very near these people? - Yes, I never heard any dispute between them in my life, she was as extraordinary a good sort of a woman as ever was in the world I believe.</p>
               <p>What sort of a tempered man was he? - I cannot say, I never had no great talkings with him, I never heard him in a passion in my life.</p>
               <p>Not a quarrelsome man? - No Sir, not that I ever heard.</p>
               <p>You said you saw him on the Thursday morning? - I saw him come home, and he went in doors.</p>

               <p>Did she describe in what manner? - Yes, she said he got up an end in his bed about twelve on the Wednesday night, and he pulled his knife out of his pocket, and he opened it, and he took hold of her arm, and pulled her up an end in her bed, and said, damn you, you bitch, I will give you time to say your prayers; then I never heard any more of them till the morning that he had killed her.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her then, that he was mad? - No Sir, I did not think he was mad, I never saw him any ways mad, he spoke as well as any man in the world, and was digging in the garden the day before he killed her in the night.</p>

               <p>He had not the character of being an ill-natured, malicious man? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner stands indicted for the wilful murder of Ann his wife, by stabbing her in the breast with a clasp knife, giving her thereby a mortal wound, of which she instantly died; he is also charged on the coroner's inquisition: and the result of a very long examination is, that unquestionably, this man has been the occasion of the death of his wife, and that it has happened in the manner described in this indictment, by his giving her not one only, but no less than four stabs in the breast and body, one of which proved mortal, and of which she did in effect instantly die; and the fact being thus clearly proved against him, unless it is established in his favour that he did this under such an impression, and in such a state of mind that ought not to make him answerable for what he has done, unquestionably he is guilty of the crime of wilful murder imputed to him; for he that intentionally, with a degree of deliberation, uses such a weapon in such a manner, must do it for the purpose of depriving the party of life, therefore it is wilful in the strongest sense of that word; therefore the crime stands fully proved against him, unless there can be collected from the circumstances that are in the evidence, something which will amount to a defence for him, by shewing that though his hand was guilty of the crime, his heart was free from it; and the whole care is brought to turn upon a single point, whether this man, at the time he committed this outrage upon his wife, was in his right mind or no, whether he did it from motives of wickedness and malice towards her, or whether he did it under the impression of some distemper of mind which had deprived him of the use of his reason; in which case, though his hand committed the offence, in the consideration of law as well as upon the plain principles of reason and justice, no crime can be imputed to him in doing it.</p>

               <p>I state this to you on the outset, that I may turn your attention to that which is really the question, because there can be no question that he gave these wounds, and if in his right mind, that he has been guilty of a very foul murder, for which he is justly answerable to the laws of his country; on the other hand, if you should really see reason to collect from the evidence, that at the moment he committed the act, he was not in possession of himself, that he was not in possession of his right senses, and of his right mind, but that it was done under the pressure of some disorder of mind, occasioned by something that you and I cannot get to the bottom of, that will make him nothing more than a mere instrument in the hands of Providence, and he not at all answerable to the laws of God or man for what he has done, any more than the simple knife could be answerable that gave the fatal blow: the general outlines of the case led one to have a considerable degree of suspicion, that there would some such point as this arise in the cause, and after I have stated to you the particular evidence, I will endeavour to collect for your use, what those circumstances are that seem most strongly to bear to this point, upon which you are to exercise your judgment, whether the man was in his right mind: the first witness examined was

                  Joseph

            , and then added] as far as the narration went, he told the story pretty well, but when I came to examine him to the circumstances, which the story told by him naturally led me to enquire after, I never found a man either so perfectly uninformed, or from whom it was so impossible to extract any thing; it was a singular circumstance related by him that this woman should come to him the first time in her life, to ask him to come and sit up in the house, but it did not strike him as at all extraordinary, he did not ask a question at all about it, when asked he was contented to go, and when there he was contented to stay; in short, nothing could be got from him; however that which could not be got from him, has been got from the other evidences; the next is a more intelligent man by far, one

            , he says [here the learned judge summed up the evidence of Jones and the rest of the witnesses, and then added] Gentlemen, this is the whole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270043"/> of the evidence; the prisoner contents himself with saying he was not at at all sensible that he had killed his wife, that he did it in a state unconscious of what he was doing; and it is from this evidence, and some of the circumstances that are stated in it, that you will be to collect as I told you, the only point which remains in any degree doubtful on this inquiry, and upon which the fate of this man depends; that is, whether at the time he gave these mortal wounds, he was in his right mind or no; against the man, the general tranquility of his behaviour, his conversing with the people like another man, and eating and drinking, and appearing to be conscious of what he had done, endeavouring to justify it, and accusing her of having behaved ill to him; these are all of them circumstances that seem to denote that he was in possession of himself, that he knew what he was doing, that he meant to do it, and that he did it on motives of malice urging him to revenge, for some injury that he had received, or was to receive from her; and there is one circumstance beyond that against him, namely, the circumstance that one of the witnesses had frequently heard her cry out O my head, or my shoulder, or my arm; but whether that was owing to any ill usage received from him, or to an accidental hurt, or to pains in her head or her arms, which might make her cry out, the witness could not tell; however, they all agree in his favour, that she was a very extraordinary good kind of a woman, not likely to give him any cause of a quarrel, and he not a quarrelsome man, and that they lived in a state of good understanding together; this leads one to expect to find, that this unfortunate event did arise from something singular and extraordinary, and not to be accounted for in any way in which people ordinarily account for those dreadful acts of violence, which are committed either from deep malice, or revenge for injuries supposed to be received, or at least from some sudden transports of revenge, for some ill usage received: you find it is most certain from this state of the evidence, that for some days before this woman came to her end, the man had not been so well, and in the same orderly state that he used to be; it is a fact that is beyond all contradiction I think, that the woman was conscious that there was something amiss with him, that she had made complaints to the overseer that there was something wrong, that it was dangerous for her to be in the house with him; and these were not complaints expressive of resentment for ill-usage offered by him to her, for brutality, or any thing for which he should be punished; for she seemed to have tenderness to him to the last; she chose on the last night to go to him, to sleep with him, but if he had treated her as brutal men do women that they have in their power, one would have thought, having men in the house, she would not have gone to bed to him. The constable Tromper seems to me to be an evidence of great credit, and he says, on the Monday at the desire of the woman, he went to talk with the man, she having told him he was not well; there was something the matter with him, she did not know what! - She found him not well, and she had been alarmed with him before: Tromper spoke to him and found him in a condition which should have alarmed him; he complained he was troubled in his mind, he did not know why, but he was, he could not tell what was the matter, but he was troubled and uneasy; I am satisfied that if at that time the state of the man's body had been examined into, he would have been found to have had a fever upon him; I have not a doubt but it was a nervous fever that had seized his spirits: Tromper advised him to compose himself, and go to his work; accordingly the man did. The evidence of what passed on the Tuesday, which is given to you by 
               <persName id="t17840421-13-person222">
                  Samuel

                  </persName>
            , is still more particular; for, on the Tuesday between eight and nine, Wood had heard that the man was not well, he went to his house to speak to him, and at that moment you find the woman was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270044"/> gone to the overseer; at that time the woman must have a very strong impression on her mind, that he was not well, and not fit for her to be in the house with alone, and she actually brought somebody with her. The conversation he held with the man that night, was the conversation of a man whose brain was touched, that his neighbours said he had bewitched them, and he should be hanged, and then he talked of his wife's fetching him away in a cart, and that he should be hanged, and all the man could do would not pacify him; he was very uneasy because his wife was not then at home, and she came in with Provender, and he went away without saying one single word; that strikes me as a very singular circumstance: On the Wednesday the woman complained of his having frightened her, and again on the Thursday; and I am sorry to observe that the overseer did his duty very ill, for after these alarms he ought to have done more a great deal than leaving a blind message with the governor of the work-house; his duty would have been to have gone instantly to have seen the man; his duty would have been to have employed a person of skill to have looked at him; the man might have been saved, the woman might have been saved, and all this mischief prevented. In that manner, however it was, and this poor woman gets the two men to sit up, and in the course of that night this fatal accident happened, and it seems to me, as far as I can judge from the result of the evidence, to have happened under the effect of some disorder that had seized the man, and affected his spirits, and deprived him to a certain degree of reason, and that particularly rendered him suspicious, among other people, of his wife; she had been driven to take some care of herself by applying to the overseer; and nothing alarms a man, who has any symptoms of insanity about him, so much as the idea of being taken care of as an insane man; there is nothing that impresses them with so much terror, and there being no medical man present that I know of, I take upon me to say so, it having fallen within my own knowledge, nothing alarms them so much, nothing irritates them so much, as the idea of being treated as insane: I account for the sulky manner in which the man went away when Provender came, and on the next night he followed the woman, persuaded her to go back, but submitted in a a sulky way, and said she might have who she would, and went to bed in a kind of fullenness. If having his mind distempered, affected, disturbed, and deranged; if his madness was pointed against his wife in consequence of their having taken these measures which were fit for her to take, but which he was not in a humour to bear; if he conceived rage against her under that impression of mind, and under that impression did this fatal act, he certainly ought not to be considered as a man in his sober senses; but it is the unhappy effect of the distemper that was upon him; and I think we should not do justice to the case, considering the character of the woman, considering the manner in which they had lived together for a long while; the woman an extraordinary woman; the man, a quiet, sober, inoffensive man, if we did not look for something extraordinary to account for this tragedy; and if you do find symptoms of disorder, of disease, by which the man was apparently affected on the Monday, and on the Tuesday, by which that fatal act was committed; and if those expressions of rage and resentment against the woman is to be accounted for most naturally by his conceiving a wild prejudice against her, for her having brought people into the house to guard her and her children; that is a very different thing to that wilful and deliberate thing which the law calls murder: - Where men suffer their passions to get the better of their reasons, and do in transports of rage commit this crime, they must answer for the consequences; but rage which is the effect of distemper, is brought upon them by the act of God, and not by themselves, and they are not answerable for what they do in those moments. Gentlemen, upon the result of as careful an examination as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270045"/> could make, it appears to me, that this was the unhappy effect of rage against this woman, conceived in consequence of distemper of mind, brought on by disease, and that under that impression the violence was committed. The man's afterwards coming to his senses will not alter the nature of the case, if it was committed under the impression of insanity, and the mind disturbed and deprived of its powers of governing the man: he is not answerable, and you must find your verdict, Not Guilty: Indeed he is either guilty of the crime of wilful murder, or he is a mere machine; but if you think that this was all artifice, and there was no disorder, that he did it cooly and deliberately, to satisfy some purpose of his mind, then he is guilty of the murder; but if it is, as I confess it appears to me to be, the effect of insanity, you must then find him not guilty.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of April, about eight o'clock, me and another person were riding down Leigh-street, Red Lion-square, and we saw a young fellow come out of Mr. Gray's parlour window, I spoke to the gentleman that was along with me, and as I spoke, Hall opened the window, and the prisoner Birmingham jumped out; there were pallisadoes before the window, Hall was in the street and had hold of the shutters, Hall opened the window shutter, and then Birmingham came out.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark? - Yes, it was candle-light.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - About three yards.</p>
               <p>How did you distinguish their faces? - It was quite a moon-light night, I could distinguish them by the light of the moon; Hall did not attempt to run away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Council. Did Hall stop? - I crossed over to him, and bid him stop.</p>
               <p>And he stopped immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many minutes might it be? - Not many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hall. He swore that I had hold of the shutter the first time, and the second time he said I was near it, but I had not hold of it.</p>
               <p>When you was before the Justice of Peace, did not you swear that he stood near the window, not that he touched it, or much less that he opened it? - If I did I must say false, for he opened it, and held it for the other man to come out.</p>
               <p>Was you examined twice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the Justice admit him to bail? - Not when I was present.</p>

               <p>You are sure the sash was shut down? - Yes, I shut it down in the morning, and it was not opened at all, it sticks out when it is not fastened, any body can tell that it is not fastened.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen this is a capital offence if proved, the facts must be either actually breaking the house by violence, or a constructive breaking, which will be construed, in point of reason and justice, the same as if there was an actual force and breaking of it; for no man has a right to say you have not secured your house in a proper manner, if your door is only upon the latch, lifting that up is as much a burglary as breaking the door to pieces! for the same reason it is determined that if a sash be shut down, the lifting it up is burglary, for no man has a right to say, you should have fastened your house better, if you do not I will come in at every room in your house; another thing is, if a burglary is committed, or intended to be committed, if persons are not in the house, but go there with intent to help and assist, they are equally guilty of the burglary with the person that gets into the house: I cannot help thinking but this girl's going out of doors and pushing the window shutter too, might be a lure and temptation for getting in, as there was nothing but a sash to throw open to obtain access into the house: there is no evidence to shew you, that after the time this girl pushed this window too, and shut the outside door, that any body went into that room. If the prisoner Birmingham was in the house, then the matter for your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270048"/> consideration is, with what intent he went in there; it was night and the candles were lighted, it was about eight o'clock; the sun is down about thirty-two minutes after six, but then there is an hour for the twilight, and if you could distinguish men's faces by the daylight or the twilight, it is not so completely night as to constitute the crime of burglary; but Ibbetson does positively swear that all the light that enabled him to see the faces of the prisoners was the moonlight: with respect to Hall he never was in the house, and the only consideration is, whether he was there as an accomplice with, and joining in the felonious intent, supposing you think there was one, and whether he was aiding and assisting in carrying that intent into execution; if you believe Ibbetson, Hall certainly must be considered as a principal in aiding and assisting Birmingham to attempt to carry their illegal proceedings into execution, for if he opened the window for one, or shut it again, and opened it for another, in order that they might make their escape, and if so, though not in the house, yet aiding and assisting, he is as much guilty as if in the house himself; but as he was not in the house, you must have the stronger evidence to satisfy you that he was an accomplice; he has called two people to his character, and has a very good character; if you are satisfied that Birmingham got into this house through the window, or broke the house to get in, then he is guilty of the burglary, and if you think the other man was there aiding and assisting him, then he is guilty also; but if you think he was not there as aiding and assisting the prisoner Birmingham, in that case you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>In whose custody was he then? - I believe Cox was the man who had hold of him.</p>

               <p>Was the man that you found in custody of Cox, the same man that you saw come out of the house, and run down Lillypot-lane? - I strictly believe it was him, I cannot say to the identity of the person, I particularly remember he had a brown great coat on, and the man that was taken had a brown great coat on; when I first came down to see them in custody, there was rather a dispute which way they should bring the prisoners, I told them to follow me to the prosecutor's, the prosecutor was asked if that was the man that struck him, he immediately answered it was the man, he could swear to him.</p>

               <p>Court. Because this boy has been telling us he had hold of his coat before you laid hold of him? - The prisoner was upon the full run, and from his running so fast, I rather conceived him to be the thief.</p>
               <p>Was there at that time any boy near him? - I did not see any boy, I have had some talk with the boy after he told me he was near him and put up his stick, or something, and he he was frightened and let go his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barton. Did you see any stick in my hand? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any imprecation? - I made use of no imprecation, I told you, I apprehended you was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you use any such expression as this, I will be damned if I let you go? - No, my Lord, that I am conscious I never did; when I first met the prisoner, I am confident there was no boy laid hold of him, the boy mentioned the circumstance to me, and I was rather uneasy in my mind, I went to the boy's master and had some conversation with him, and the boy then said he believed he was at some yards distance when I stopped him, but prior to my stopping him when he was coming down the lane, he caught hold of his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You did not see any boy till some time afterwards? - I saw a boy have hold of the prisoner Barton's coat, when I came to the corner of Staining-lane.</p>

             I found three pick-lock keys, and on the other I found a tobacco box which contained tinder, several pieces of matches, and three silver spoons.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were the spoons? - In another pocket.</p>
               <p>In what pocket? - In his coat pocket, but which I do not recollect exactly.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these spoons as soon as you found them? - I put all the things in my pocket together, there was no constable came in with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>When did you produce these spoons afterwards? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Not till the next day? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body that you had found spoons in his pocket? - No, I did not know that there was any occasion.</p>
               <p>One of the gentlemen has told us that when you had taken something out of his pocket, you put it into your pocket without shewing it? - I put every thing else in my pocket in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Were not the matches in the tobacco box? - No, nothing but tinder, I gave the things to the constable, Mr. Fletcher; there was a crow when I searched them, I delivered the crow and the rest of the things to Mr. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freers. I beg leave to know if he delivered up all the things, it is a satisfaction to my mind?</p>
               <p>Harvey. I delivered up every thing excepting the spoons, knowing they were the only pieces of property belonging to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270059"/> prosecutor, and as there was no constable brought in with them, I did not deliver them to any body, I carried the spoons to my own apartment in the compter, there they were safe, when the constable came I did not deliver them to the constable the next day, but the person came that saw me take them, and I went immediately and fetched them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you deliver up every thing to the constable that you took from the prisoner? - I delivered up every thing.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether now you have delivered up every thing that you received from the prisoners? - I have most certainly.</p>
               <p>Because it looks very much like a manoeuvre, when they were discovered to deliver them up? - It was no discovery at all, there were ten or twelve people that were present at my searching them, that saw me take the spoons and every thing else from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Freer. Have you any more reason for suspecting that man's conduct? - I was conscious I saw him take something else out of his pocket, but I could not ascertain what.</p>
               <p>Court. He says the other people saw what it was? - I saw him take something out of the pocket, but I could not ascertain what it was, I did not ask him, it seemed to be close clasped in his hands, I saw every thing but the spoons.</p>

               <p>My Lord I was that evening in St. Martins Le Grand, it was my way home to go down Monkwell-street, coming down I saw two men run swiftly by me down Noble-street, and I saw these three keys drop, I picked them up and run after them, and one turned up a court in Noble-street, and I thought I saw the other man by him, and I run after him; in Falcon-square a man came up and stopped me, I said I did not know any thing about the matter, he jumped upon me and threw me down, he got up again and said he would secure me for a thief, so he brought me back to this man's house, as for that iron crow I know nothing about it, I never had it in my hand, I have friends here.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Burne called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BARTON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came from Richmond with a barge that evening, I came to Queenhithe and I made the barge fast to go to Finch-lane, coming along I heard the cry of stop thief, and that gentleman accosted me and said he believed I was the thief, because I was the foremost person, that is all that I know.</p>
               <p>How came you by these spoons? - I know nothing at all concerning the spoons.</p>
               <p>Nor the tobacco box? - Yes, I own to that, I had it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How came you by tinder in your tobacco box? - It is a necessary that I make use of on board the barge, I had witnesses last week and yesterday, I had two when I was called up last night on my trial, and they went away, and are not here now, I know nothing of this prisoner, I never saw him before; as to that man swearing that he look the spoons from me it is false.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270060"/>Court. He is a witness who is above all suspicion, who says he saw the man take something from you which he concealed and put into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, for the boy I am afraid he has been instructed that it would be of service to him to go so far as he has done, with respect to some future explanation.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, that there was a burglary by two men is proved to a demonstration, I think, because the door was safe at half past eight, or a quarter before nine, and very soon afterwards the street door and parlour door were open, and the parlour door forced, and things taken out of the drawers of the bureau in that parlour, and when three spoons were actually missing, there can be no doubt but somebody had found means to enter that house by some false key, for the purpose of plundering the house, and had gone some length towards doing it, for the spoons were actually taken away, and the moving the things but an inch is a feloniously taking; the taking the things out of the drawer, and laying them down with intention to convey them away, is a felonious taking, and there is no doubt but the two men who run down stairs, one of whom struck Delport, were the thieves; the only question is, whether the prisoners are the men, Burne is sworn to by the prosecutor as the man that struck the blow; and in confirmation of his evidence, this blow being struck with iron, you find when B urne was apprehended in Falcon-square, he threw something from him which appeared to be an iron crow, he had pick-lock keys in his pocket, one of which actually opened Mr. Delport's door, but the circumstance of the crow sticks to him: I think there is no doubt with respect to Burne; the evidence is different with respect to Barton, Mr. and Mrs. Delport, and Whittingham, do not take upon themselves to swear to Barton, but each say he was in a light coloured great coat, and the evidence is, that Barton had on a light coloured great coat, and he was taken running in the same track, and when taken to the compter and searched, there was found upon him, if you believe the Jew, three silver tea-spoons, which tea-spoons are positively sworn to by the prosecutor; and the prisoner judges well for himself in saying that he knew nothing of the spoons, as he did not get rid of them, and he tells you that the Jew swore falsely; the real complexion of the Jew's conduct is, that he had a wish to finger these spoons, that I am very much inclined to believe, but though he did not deliver them before, he did deliver them, and how should he come by them, he was a prisoner himself before, and Mr. Freer saw him take something from the prisoner Barton, which he did not shew to them, but put in his pocket, he produced the spoons the next day; I think now it would be too much to entertain any serious doubt whether these spoons were found on the prisoner Barton, and if they were found upon him, it is better evidence than fifty people swearing to the identity of his person.</p>

               <p>Court. It has a spring lock? - Yes, I am sure that I shut it, I tried with my hand after I had shut it, I did not come home till it was all over, and they had taken the men into custody and carried them into the publick-house, I saw nobody till these men were taken to the compter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peat, Council for Prisoners. Did not you say before the Justice that you had double locked the door? - No, I said I had pulled it too, and put my hand against it.</p>

               <p>I came home on the 31st of March before my wife, and I found the casement open and the door open, and I went in and found the screen that we have round our fire place was put a little backward, and I saw a light on the outside over the chamber, and I heard the trampling of feet over head, and I thought it was my dame as I call her, and I called at the stairfoot and said, halloo dame, says I, is it you, which is my usual way of talking, and no answer was made me, I called the second time, halloo dame, are you coming down, no answer, and then they immediately rushed down stairs, then I thought there were some thieves in the house, or somebody that there should not be, and I made away to the door, and got it in my hand, and jammed it fast, and they were both pulling up against me to get by me.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between the hours of eight and nine, while we were pulling together one against the other, one of them, but I cannot say which, struck me with this stick, as I suppose, for I was cut over the knuckles to make me quit my hold of the door, and one of them says, damn him, cut his hands off.</p>
               <p>Do you know which said that? - No, it is out of my power.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing in their hands to cut your hands off with? - Not that I can tell, then I made an alarm, and many people came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270063"/> about with pokers and tongs, and one thing or another, and when they found they were overpowered, and that the house was beset, they went into a little cellar that we have, and there they were taken.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the two men that run down against you at the door? - It was dark my Lord, I could not swear that, but these are the two men that were taken in my cellar.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of that, there is no way of coming to my house but at the front door, there is no yard, no backside to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. It was the outside of the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal alarmed and frightened? - Yes, any body would.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether any persons went in but those of your neighbours then? - I know nothing more, I went up stairs, and they had got an apron, and spread in the room and taken out these little trinkets and things, they were not all worth one shilling I suppose, which they had taken out of this drawer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barber. They were in the drawer before.</p>
               <p>What was there in the apron? - A half handkerchief, and a piece of a cap, and a bit of linen, these things were in the drawers when I went out, and they were all shut but not locked, the apron belonged to one of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Did you examine the drawers immediately before you went out? - I had taken some of my things out before that day, I saw them, and had them in my hand.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure that the two prisoners are the two men that they brought up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them to the Justice's? - Yes, I attended the sitting Alderman next day, I know nothing more, I was examined before the Alderman, I gave the same account then as I do now.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. When we were examined before the Alderman, that gentleman who says now we were taken out of the house, said, my young fellows, we will have a good weeks work out of each of you.</p>

               <p>Why, is there a latch? - It is an iron latch.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, there is no difference in point of law between breaking a pane of glass and breaking open a house; but to be sure in point of enormity of offence there is a very substantial difference; therefore, you would not incline to press a fact of this sort beyond what it does necessarily import; the boy says he heard the cracking of the glass while he was listening to the singing; he did not see it done; somebody else might have broke the window, and if after this pane of glass had been broke, one of these boys had taken the things out, he would have been Guilty of stealing them, but not of breaking and entering the house; therefore, perhaps you will think it sufficient if you find them Guilty of stealing, but not of breaking and entering the dwelling house.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of counsel for the prosecutor, the indictment as you have heard, imputes to the prisoner the commission of a capital offence, I shall not detain you at this hour of the night with a long speech in opening the prosecution, the circumstances of the case are extremely short, and I am afraid extremely conclusive, and it will be your duty to decide upon it: the prosecutor is a <rs id="t17840421-24-viclabel139" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

Gentlemen, if these circumstances are proved to your satisfaction, you must of necessity find the prisoner Guilty; but on the other hand, I for one shall be extremely happy, if you should have any serious doubt in the case, and I assure you I shall not at all lament if you can find any ground to acquit the prisoner.</p>

            , the prisoner dealt a great while at my shop, she was there on Saturday the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At what time? - She was there in the morning, and bought two pieces of beef of me, which she agreed and paid for before she went out of the shop; I asked her if she should went any thing more, she told me to save her a sweet bread; after she was gone I found my money was gone: the gentleman that lived facing me, desired me to mark some money, he marked twenty-one shillings and one guinea with his own name; I put that money on one side, in my side pocket, in a separate pocket, not my common pocket.</p>
               <p>Had you that money in your pocket when the prisoner came to your shop in the evening? - I put the money in my pocket; she dealt with me for a sweet bread and a bit of veal, and paid me with two of those very marked shillings; I am very sure I had not given them in change, I had them in my pocket when she came in, I saw the mark upon them; I then said to her, now I have caught you, I took her into the kitchen and searched her, and found nineteen shillings that were marked in the morning, and one guinea, which, with two shillings she gave me, made up the whole money: she said she had them in change at the grocer's; as to the guinea, she could not say any thing of it.</p>
               <p>(The two shillings produced.)</p>
               <p>- LANDY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a neighbour of Mrs. Hollingsworth's, she was telling me the affair what had happened, she gave me twenty-one shillings and a guinea, I took them backwards to the anvil and marked them with this punch, which I had never used before, it is what I mark lancets with in common, but it is a new mark, it never had struck any thing before; those are two of the shillings I marked.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did you mark them? - About half past eleven in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hollingsworth. You have a good deal of business on the Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You took a good deal of money in the course of that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270071"/>And changed a good deal? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you gave none of those twenty-one shillings in change in the course of that day? - Yes, because I did not put it in my pocket apron, I put it in my side pocket.</p>
               <p>Do not you take change out of that pocket as well as the other? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you put no other money in that pocket as well as the other? - No.</p>
               <p>- CARR sworn.</p>
               <p>I was present when the prisoner was at Mrs. Hollingsworth's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When was that? - In the evening of the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>What passed in your observation? - When I came in, the prisoner at the bar and Mrs. Hollingsworth were standing together, the prisoner took two shillings to pay Mrs. Hollingsworth, and rubbed them as if they were dirty; says the prosecutrix, are not you a bad woman, you have robbed me several times, but now I have caught you: we took her backwards into the back room, there were several neighbours present, there were nineteen shillings and a guinea, and I think two or three shillings besides; I asked her how she came by them; says she I had them in change; I asked her how she came by the guinea, and she said nothing to that; she was a going to put something in her bosom, and it was a glove, and there were three guineas and some silver in it; Mrs. Hollingsworth said, if the money is mine, there is one guinea black of the tail side, and when she saw it, she said she would swear to the guinea; the shillings all bore the same mark.</p>
               <p>- WARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody, Mr. Carr delivered me the money.</p>
               <p>Court to Carr. Was that money the same you had from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Council. My Lord, I waved asking any questions till the money was produced. Mrs. Hollingsworth, you said you put this particular silver that was marked, into a particular pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say you suspected the prisoner, did not that put you on your guard? - No, Sir, I wished to catch the prisoner out.</p>
               <p>You had no particular suspicion of her at all? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of it, for my husband changed a ten pound note on the Friday, and I received money of him to pay away, and he gave it me, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you that person here that you took it of? - No, my Lord, I cannot, he is not in town.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who all gave her a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did you see the prisoner take any thing from your pocket? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carr. I only want to inform the Court -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If you wish to say any thing against the prisoner, I do not wish to call you.</p>
               <p>Court. You do very right Mr. Garrow, it would not be proper now.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar came the 2d of April to my house, and asked for a lodging, he brought some meat in his hand, he said, he had been making particular enquiry about me, my wife broiled his meat for supper, he went to bed about dusk, I was busy at work; when I came in I told my wife he locked more like a thief than any thing else; he behaved very well that day and the next night; which was Saturday night, he went to bed very soon, and he got up that night and went out, my wife heard him.</p>
               <p>You did not hear him? - No, I did not, on Sunday the I got up very early, he had opened the door, one of which was locked and barred; when I got up I found the door open where he slept, I thought he was a thief, and the things were taken that is mentioned in the indictment, and from the mantle-piece over the tap-room he had taken a very large brass pestle and mortar, and a pair of large candlesticks, I searched a little further in my hurry before I had any clothes upon me; he bespoke a bit of bacon to keep him the next week, instead of which he had stolen all the bacon, and there was a parcel of pieces of linen put up in an old pillow case; there were three beds in the room he slept in, he had one to himself, one was empty, and the other a poor old man of fourscore laid in, there were four sheets and two blankets; when I came down in the morning, the door was unlocked, and he gone, and all the things gone, and the door shut after him, it was unbolted, the bar down, and the bolts drawn; I happened to go to Brentford market, and saw the prisoner; I found none of the things, the prisoner was taken up on the Tuesday following, about eleven, I took him near Turnham Green, going into the country; I took him to the Pack-horse; the first thing I said was, here you are, I have been many a mile after you, and I will swear to you, he said nothing, but hung down his head.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of March, about 7 o'clock I was standing at my door, I keep a publick house opposite the new Sessions House Clerkenwell-green? I saw the prisoner Taylor, leading a mare, and the other prisoner Hobbs was then on the pavement, he said, bring it this way, we shall get more for it here than any where else; they led her down to Hockley in the Hole, to one Paris, a horse boiler, I saw them both standing at the gate, I then returned back to my own house from there, and called up my wife, and I went back and saw Mr. Paris coming, for where they boiled them is down Black-boy Alley, says I, Mr. Paris there is a horse that is in your yard that is a stolen one, says he, the servant has sent for me to look at him; I went with him and the mare stood there, and the men were over at the public house, I desired Paris to ask them some questions, the prisoner Taylor said, he brought it from Hornsey, and that there was no fear of his buying the mare, for she was worn out and broken winded, and very apt to lay down under a load. Mr. Paris said, if they could bring any body to prove that they came honestly by the mare he would buy her, the prisoner Hobbs said if you will go with me into Saint John's-street, I will bring witnesses, they went into Saint John's-street and returned, I stood with the other not taking any notice that I was an officer, Paris returned, says he, Mr. Seasons this young man bears a good character, I said I was not satisfied, I returned and told the prisoner Taylor, says I, young man this is a stolen mare, and the man is in custody, says he, I did not steal it myself but it was Hobbs that stole it.</p>

               <p>What did you tell him would be the consequence if he told you the truth? - In order to get it out of him whether it was so or not, I told him that if the horse was stolen to go away, and he got up instantly, that was while Hobbs was gone with Paris, I then took the prisoner Taylor to my house, I saw Paris coming down I could see him out of my door, I handcuffed Taylor and took him to New Prison, I met Paris with Hobbs, says I, Mr. Paris take hold of him, it is a stolen house I put them both into New Prison, I went and acquainted the Magistrates with what had passed, and they both owned that the horse was a stolen horse.</p>
               <p>Did they say where they had stolen him? - They said they took him from Finchley Common, I asked them who it belonged to they said they did not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any promises or threats made use of? - None, only what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes, I went to seek after the owner of the horse, and at Holloway turnpike I saw a man, who directed me to several people that were drinking, and when I told them, they said, they should as soon have thought of the best people in the country being guilty as them, they gave them a very good character, and upon that character I hope I shall be called.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner return the blow? - No, he said he had rather drink with you than fight, and I will give it up to you, by that time there came up two soldiers and another man together, who said fight it out my lads, and we will see fair play and treat you with a shillings worth, with that they both stripped into their buff to fight.</p>

               <p>How did they fight? - I heard no words pass, but after that they seemed pretty sociable, and were going away together, and after that came up two soldiers and a gentleman, and the gentleman said, fight it fairly, and I will give you a shillingsworth; after sometime I saw the deceased come up, and take away his clothes, but what happened after that I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I know nothing concerning the matter, I am only bound over to carry on the prosecution for the parish.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here that examined the deceased, to know the cause of his death? - Yes, the surgeon is here.</p>
               <p>- LESLIE sworn.</p>

               <p>Court. I suppose you know nothing of the fact further than examining the body of the deceased? - No, I examined the body very strictly; I examined the head, and there was no kind of violence, but on the breast, between the belly and breast, near the heart, there were different bruises, like as if it was the knuckles of a hand; there might be about five or six, I examined him further, and found he was troubled with a rupture, but that was not the occasion of his death, that was in a perfect state; I opened the body, and when I opened the body in the internal part of the belly, I found a large portion of coagulated blood, and I went to the breast to see if I could find any thing there, it was perfectly clear of blood, but by the different contusions of the lungs, they were bruised sufficiently.</p>
               <p>Did you discover what vessels were broke? - In the belly I examined the vessels, and there I found one particular vessel was broke, my opinion therefore is, that he could not respire freely, but died in a very languishing state, and I am of opinion that these bruises were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say, any further than I am a stranger in this place, and came here for my wages, I never was here in my life before.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this case does not seem to be attended with much doubt or difficulty; it is proved by the surgeon, that the bruises which this man received were the probable cause of his death, therefore the prisoner has by these bruises been the occasion of this misfortune; but the circumstances of the case exclude all idea of premeditated malice, or of that general malignant disposition which the law will construe into murder; it is the effect of a quarrel, intirely set on foot by the deceased; the deceased followed them with a declaration, he would give them both a good licking, and the answer of the prisoner in New Rag-fair was a peaceable one, saying, shipmate, do not use me ill; notwithstanding which, the deceased struck him; but even after that the prisoner declined fighting, and said he would rather drink with him than fight; and so it seems they would have parted, if some malignant people had not encourag ed them to fight again; that appearing clearly upon the evidence, you cannot altogether acquit the prisoner of blame, though clearly the case does not go further than manslaughter, nor is it a very unfavourable case of that kind.</p>

               <p>When the prisoners was apprehended, they were brought to the watch-house, and each of these bundles were given into my charge as from the different prisoners; when the examination was on the Thursday the evidence was remanded till the next day, and he was admitted an evidence; and I went with the other and apprehended Clayton; this pistol was delivered into my charge, I unloaded it, and there was a charge in it half way; first we drew up one charge of powder and pieces of lead, then another charge of powder and another piece of lead.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look particularly at that handkerchief that was found in Clayton's pocket. - It is my property, I have the fellow to it.</p>
               <p>You can only say you believe it to be your property? - I do not suppose there are two more such handkerchiefs in the city of London, I had seven in one piece, they are India; I can swear to all the linen except one shirt.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the robbery, I was coming down Holborn, and that man and another man was talking together with bundles under their arms, and that man tapped me over the shoulder, and asked me where he could get a coach, he said he was a stranger, we went in and had a glass, he threw down a guinea; and as we were going to Smithfield his apron came loose, he desired me to lay hold of this bundle while he tied his apron up, and as he was tying his apron up, some men crossed immediately, he threw the bundle down and run away; I looked back for that man, and he was gone; they caught hold of me, and said they would cut me down; I let the bundle fall: if I had been guilty of the robbery I should certainly have ran away as well as the rest. That is not the handkerchief he took from me; I had been seven years abroad.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Todd called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Tell the Court in your own way what you know of this boat of coals? - About twelve or one, the two prisoners and me took a sculler out of the house where we lodge, No. 48, Palmer's-street, Ratcliff-highway, and went down to New Crane-stairs, the bottom of New Gravel-lane, when we came there we found a boat adrift, we all three stepped into her, and put the sculls into her, and rowed up to Wapping-new-stairs, and finding there was no coals there, we rowed down again, and found this boat of Mr. Wright's, and stepped into her, and made the boat fast, and handed the coals out; we were rowing for shore, and seeing a wherry go past, we were dubious; we went in between some craft as they should not see us, and Mr. Spate saw us, and we all three jumped out of the boat, and he ran after us, and he said to Tuckey, what you will not leave your old tricks; we all went into a light craft and shoved her on shore;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270087"/> we were all aprehended the same morning about eight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Was it light or dark? - It was moonlight.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Spate never was within five or six yards of you, was he? - He was a top of some craft strand, and we were jumped into a wherry that was under it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER TUCKEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We went to Deptford, and got a cast, and we saw this boat adrift, and the man came and took us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Tuckey called two witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER GARDENER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This young man lodged in the same house as I did, and there was a merry-making, and he asked me to go along with him down to Deptford, to see his acquaintance home, and I went with him, and coming back, we got a cast over the water, and we saw this boat loaded with coals, the waterman put us into the boat, and we rowed her on shore.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I <rs id="t17840421-33-deflabel195" type="occupation">go to sea</rs>

               <p>Tuckey. I will send him into the country, down to my friends, my Lord, he is a young fresh boy, led away with bad people.</p>

               <p>About a fortnight ago one of my servants informed me there were two silver spoons missing, and on further examination I found there were six missing in all, of a particular set, that happened neither to have arms nor cypher on them, but which were very easily known, from a slaw in the mould in which they were cast; the prisoner had been three months in my service, but had been sent away, but came very often to my house, he had been discharged about the 26th or 25th of November; he came to me in August; he came to see his fellow servants frequently, and on the day the spoons were missed I was told he was in the house; a pawnbroker who is here I was informed had five of these spoons, he had taken up the prisoner before, but he was discharged as nobody had appeared against him.</p>

               <p>I am a Pawnbroker in Berwick-street Soho, I have five table spoons; on the 8th of April the prisoner at the bar brought two silver spoons, he told me he wanted the same money on these as he had on three before, and on enquiring I found that there had been three table spoons taken of him, I asked him what he was, he said he was a gentleman's servant, he said he lived in Oxford-street at the Crown alehouse, I went there and asked the landlord if the prisoner did lodge there, and the prisoner said to the man you know I do lodge here, I said to the man tell me whether he does or not, the man said he comes here, but he does not lodge here; then not being satisfied with him I took him down to the Magistrates in order to find out the owner of the spoons, and he was remanded till the evening, he gave an account of several gentleman's families that he had lived in, and he was discharged on some persons undertaking to produce him when he should be called for.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Napier deposed to the spoons, and said he was perfectly satisfied as far as it was possible to identify any thing of that kind.</p>

            's I went up Holborn, and a man asked me to buy a bargain, I thought as I was a servant out of place if I could get a shilling or two it would be a very good thing, I went in with him he had some nice muslin.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this? - It was at a publick house.</p>
               <p>Court. What publick house? - I should know the sign if I was to see it again, it went down two steps, he asked me five guineas for them, says I that is too much I will give you three pounds; the man said he would not take it, he stopped me as I was going out, and I told him I would give him three pounds and sixpence for them, and he said I should have them, I meant to make them a present to my brother who is in business at Bath; but money running short I was forced to pledge the spoons, and I told the pawnbroker I bought them.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell the pawnbroker you lived at that publick house? - That was where I lived when I was out of place, and there I could be met with at any time.</p>
               <p>Court. Now call your wit nesses? - My witnesses are not come, I have sent for them, they told me they would come as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>Court. You have amused us now for two days with that story.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the difficulty with respect to the marks of the spoons might have been material in the prisoner's favour, if he had given any account of the manner how he came by them; as to the story of buying them of a Jew, you know the manner how he came by them; but, a Jew does not part with silver for less than the value; it will be a question whether the whole of the capital part of the indictment is proved, the value of all these five spoons taken together might possibly amount to more than 40 s. but there is reason to suppose that they were stolen at different times, indeed it appears with certainty from the pawnbroker's account that they were not all taken at one time, and it would not be a reasonable thing to add up these three felonies together, in order to increase the prisoner's charges.</p>

               <p>When did he come? - Not till the 6th of March, and then he brought this other dozen, I immediately stopped him and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>These are the same gloves that Mr. Jennings has spoke to, and you received of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, they have not been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Court. This man is indicted as an accessary after the fact; is there any evidence against this woman? - Only her owning that she stole them at the office, the man told where he got them, that the prisoner gave them to him in consequence of which we sent to the woman prisoner, they cohabited together at first they said they were married, then they said they were not.</p>
               <p>How did your conversation arise? - The Justice asked her where she got them.</p>
               <p>I want to know the very words, did you say any thing to her that it would be better for her to confess? - No promise of any favor.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I think the Justice in general put the question to her, the Justice asked her how she came by them, and she said she had stole them of Mr. Jennings, and the last dozen she had stole that week, the man was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Jennings there at the time? - Yes, and she said this of her own accord in the manner that has been mentioned, I asked her when she stole the last dozen, and she said the last week.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any promises whatever that she should not be prosecuted, or any thing of that kind? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ALLPORTS DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord it is a false indictment, for I was used so ill at the Justices that I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270092"/> know what I said, I never was before a Justice before in my life.</p>
               <p>Jury. This woman works for you? - She did at that time work for me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CARROL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I called at the appointment of this woman, she asked me to dispose of these things, and she would pay me for my afternoon's work, she told me she bought them which I believe she did, I know she used to deal in such things, I know no more of it than that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jennings. I understood they were man and wife, she always went with me by the man's name, they lived together, but when she come before the Justice, the Justice wanted to sift out where and when she was married, and it came out she was not married; these gloves are completely finished and must have been taken from papers of three or four dozens together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Allport. I have not sent for any witnesses yet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Carroll. I am poor and have no acquaintance in town.</p>

            , the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, he was in the street off the pavement, between Grocer's-alley and the Old Jewry; there was a pole of a coach just before.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his posture at the time? - He came stooping, and clapped his hand to his knee; when he dropped it I picked it up.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I gave it to Mr. Booth.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When the purse was put into your hands, did you open it to see what was in it? - No.</p>
               <p>What was done with it? - It was given to the constable.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was coming through the city the day that Mr. Pitt was coming to dine at Grocer's-hall, we were about two thousand in company, standing and walking, there was a great crowd of people; I saw the prosecutor running, with his bundle over his head; says he, I have lost my money; a man came and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270095"/> laid hold of me; I suppose they judged because I was meanly dressed I took it; I am as innocent of it as any gentleman here in Court.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A <rs id="t17840421-46-deflabel269" type="occupation">shoe-maker</rs>

                        targets="t17840421-46-defend646 t17840421-46-deflabel269"/>; I have been but a fortnight in England, I came from Ireland.</p>
               <p>You are not an Irishman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of Ireland? - Broadie, in the county of Meath; I have nobody to speak for me, without it is your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. You should have stood your own friend when you had it in your power.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the only doubt that arises in my mind upon the case is this, he is charged with having assaulted this man, and with having taken this purse by force and violence from his person; now whether it was a fact of that nature, or whether it was what I dare say the prisoner meant it should be, a picking of pockets only; I think that is the material question on this case, for there seems to be no doubt but he had a great share in the mischief, whatever it was: now if he laid hold of the man's bundle behind, and so pressed him backwards by force, and so took the purse out of his pocket, I think the indictment is proved, and it will constitute a robbery, because it is a forcible taking from the person; on the other hand, if when the prisoner was in the crowd, the prosecutor was thrown back, and his pocket was picked, that would be stealing, but it would not be robbery, because to make it a robbery, there must be some degree of force used on the person of the man from whom the property was taken; the prosecutor says, that force was used by the prisoner, and by some person who threw him back; if he did, that is as I told you, robbing him; if it was the other way, that would not be a robbery, but stealing; therefore, you will take that single point into your consideration: if you agree with the prosecutor, and think he was sufficiently attentive to what passed, to be able to know with certainty that the prisoner was the man that actually threw him back by his bundle, then you will find him Guilty of this indictment as here charged: if you think, from the situation he describes himself to be in, and the crowd that was there, that part is not sufficiently made out to your satisfaction, you may acquit him of the robbery, and find him Guilty of stealing only.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not the crowd press you? - He pressed me himself, he stood at my shoulder, as this man may do now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you on the pavement or the highway? - On the pavement.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was the coach wheel to the pavement? - As close as it could get once.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you actually clear that the prisoner

             the weight over you purposely, or was he pressed upon you? - There was no other man standing behind him, he was as near the house as he could get.</p>

               <p>Jury to Eames. Did not you say it was between Grocer's-alley and the Old Jewry? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was he stooping towards your pocket? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Which arm had the other hold of? - They got me round them, and the other person stood on my left side and this on my right.</p>
               <p>Had this man his other arm round you? - No, after they had picked my pocket the other that was with him separated, and this person struck me.</p>

               <p>Then it could not by any possibility be near you pocket? - It was his left arm that was near my pocket, they were not arm in arm as people walk in the street, only crossed within his arm, and they were both behind me.</p>

               <p>I am a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being in Covent Garden at the time the prosecutor has described? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you observe him? - I was standing there to see the election, I went to see Mr. Fox as I had heard talk of him, the prisoner stood next to me, the gentleman looked and looked, and at last he collared a man, that man goes away from him, he came back again and caught hold of the prisoner, says he you must be an accomplice with the other man, says the prisoner if I have done any thing amiss search me, the prisoner said he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270103"/> go away, the prosecutor took the prisoner, there was nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say then that when this gentleman first collared the other, the prisoner was not with him? - The prisoner was on this side, and I was in the middle.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was not with the other man? - He did not hold the other man nor was he near him, there were several together.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath Sir will you swear that? - I went to the Justice and told the same story there.</p>
               <p>Will you swear now that the prisoner and the other man were not together when you first saw them? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The witness here has said he mentioned the same thing before the Justice, he came into the room, the Justice would not suffer him to speak, he gave no account before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Constable. Not a word, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Bachara. I told the Justice the very same.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was not suffered to speak.</p>
               <p>Jury to Bachara. What are you? - A hatter by trade.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if these two people were together upon the business of picking pockets, and you believe that they shoved this gentleman up jointly, for the purpose of getting an opportunity of picking his pocket, and that they followed him for that purpose, and one of them got his hand into his pocket and the felony was compleated, the other being present and assisting at the time, the man whose hand was not in his pocket was equally guilty with the man whose hand was in; if you are clearly satisfied from the evidence, that he was actually aiding and assisting the others, in the attempt to pick the gentleman's pocket, you will find him Guilty; but whether the evidence under all the circumstances is sufficiently clear and certain to satisfy your minds of that, is a question for your determination.</p>

               <p>I was the patrol belonging to Aldgate within, and as I was going down Bevis Marks, on Saturday the 16th of April, I heard the cry of thieves! thieves! murder! murder! and at the corner of Castle-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270104"/> I saw two men, which are the prisoners; they never was out of my sight, I saw them stand at the corner of Castle-street, all in a timidating affair.</p>
               <p>Court. How? - As if they had been doing something amiss.</p>

               <p>Describe what you mean? - Seeing me come up, they stood in a sort of posture of defence, Hawes made a blow at me with his cutlass, without my speaking a word; I had a bludgeon which I carry, says I, are you good at that, then I made a blow at him with my blugeon, as hard as ever I could, then he and I missed him; I found myself in danger, and let my bludgeon fall, and drew my cutlass and attacked him again; when they found I was so resolute they ran away; I immediately cried out, stop thief! as loud as I could, and followed them very closely; Hawes the prisoner struck at me with a cutlass, I ran after them about three parts of Castle-street, but the short one, Hawkins, fired a pistol, not at me, it was directed forwards: Hawes was my object, because he made a blow at me, and just as he had got to the kennel, a gentleman tripped him as he run, and he fell down; another man assisted me and stood over him; I was afraid he had some fire-arms, he said he had not, he said for God's sake spare my life I did not fire the pistol; the other I never saw afterwards; I took Hawes, he never was out of my sight five yards, the other got off at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you know that the other prisoner was the man that was with Hawes? - I did not see him till he was brought to the Compter, I cannot swear to him: when Hawes was taken, he was searched, and nothing was found upon him; when I returned again from the Compter, I came back to go my rounds as usual, I saw Mr. West as I came to the spot where I attacked them first, and I said, Sir, you was not one that was robbed? and he said, yes, it was me that was robbed; when I came to the watch-house, I told the story to the constable and several others, and they directed the watchman to look for a pistol and a watch chain, that that gentleman had been robbed of, and he found the chain, as he told me, close to the place where they attacked me; they first attacked me the corner of Castle-street, in Bevis-marks; Kelton gave me the chain, I have had it in my possession ever since; this cutlass was found in Castle-street, when we came from the Compter.</p>

               <p>Was it light enough in the evening for you to see both their faces plain enough? - It was not very light, but one of them had a ribband round his head.</p>

               <p>Court to West. Did you see any more than the three men near you at the time? - No, my Lord, I was under so great agitation of mind I did not see any more.</p>
               <p>Could a man have been so near you, as Solomon says he was, and you not see him? - I do not know how that might be, because this side was against the wall, and the man had hold of my collar, and he held a cutlass over my head.</p>
               <p>Jury to Solomons. Whether he came up to Mr. West's assistance? - I saw nobody before I heard the cry of murder and thieves; first that I heard was murder!</p>

               <p>Was your handkerchief in that pocket, or had you taken it out? - I believe not, he took my handkerchief out, and he shook his hand at me, I followed him down a little way, and he whipped into a publick-house, I had my gold watch and a great deal of money, I was afraid to go after him.</p>
               <p>Did you say he shook the handkerchief at you? - He did my Lord, by way of ridicule, or to let the two girls see he had taken it, I saw him go into a publick-house, I cannot tell the name or the sign, I went and got some assistance, and came to take him, and the women said to me, the person you want is not here, I looked round backwards and forwards, and I saw him through a glass door stuck up between two water butts in the yard, upon that I and three more went round and took him to Justice Walker's.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure he is the man you saw with your handkerchief in his hand? - Yes, when he was taken before Justice Walker, they called him by his name, I knew him well.</p>

             a stick out of his coat with a large knob, and struck at every person that was like to be in his way to stop him, particularly at a child he struck at, that was likely to be in his way; I was out of breath, I could run no further, he was brought back to my shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the person that was brought back was the man that you saw? - That I positively swear to, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Had he the same clothes on? - It is so like, I believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>(The cotton deposed to.)</p>
               <p>How near was he to your shop when he dropped them? - Ten or twelve yards, he went towards Henrietta-street, and turned down a little court.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other man? - Nothing at all, when I returned, he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the bludgeon in Court? - The constable has it, but has not brought it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was only a penny-stick.</p>
               <p>Constable. It was a holly stick, with a hook at the top.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it a walking stick? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I live opposite Mr. Hussey; on Saturday afternoon, about a quarter to five the two prisoners came up to his door, and looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270112"/> at his goods, they were under the shop board, they pulled at them, but they were tied, and they went away, my man in the shop told me of it, I told him I saw it myself, and in about five minutes after they returned, the man in the jacket, Stevens, took out a knife and cut the string, they were gone some time, I am almost positive they went to buy a knife, I am a cutler by trade, and I am sure they went to buy a knife, for the knife found on them never had been used before; when they had cut the string, the milk woman came to the prosecutor's door, and prevented them carrying them off then; while they were gone I called out to my opposite neighbour, and told him to be upon his guard, for they would certainly be there again presently, as they had been once and tried the goods, and a second time, and cut the string, in about three or four minutes they passed the door, and came where the goods were; they went up close to the goods, and Stevens took the goods from the bulk, and put them into the apron of the other, and walked off with them; this I saw. The prosecutor and his servants went out when they heard the cry of stop thief, the prisoners run down a little alley, and I pursued Stevens, and Mr. Hussey pursued the other; in a few minutes the mob brought the other man to the door; I am sure to both the prisoners, positively so, I saw them four times in the whole.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Vansittart, this box coat was taken away last Sunday night, the 18th of this month, from the stable, it was hanging on a peg; I never knew the prisoner before; I saw my coat not a quarter of an hour before I missed it, it was a little before twelve at night, he got into the stable with a key; the post-boy came in with the carriage and saw the coat; this is my property; I locked the stable door and went to bed.</p>
               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I left the stable about five minutes, and I heard somebody come down the yard, I got up, and I opened the door gently, and I saw a man open Mr. Vansittart's door, I heard some hay rattle, and I watched him; I saw him go in, and I called assistance; I went in and he was behind the door; he said he came to lay down; while we stood round him, I saw him throw something away, this is the key we found among the litter, on the Tuesday after we found another key<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270113"/> among the dung, which is this, we found it cleaning the stable, it had not been totally cleaned out since the fact.</p>
               <p>When had it been cleaned out before? - On Saturday night, I did not see it then: after we took the man we sent for the coachman, he was gone to his master's house, and when he came the coat was behind the door where the prisoner stood; this linen cloth hung on a nail behind the door, it was taken out of his pocket at the watch-house; here is another key that was found on the Wednesday following, in the same stable.</p>
               <p>Which of the keys opened the door? - That that was found on the Tuesday, it will open most of the doors in the yard.</p>
               <p>Court to Graves. Where had you hung up your great coat? - On the farther side of the stable, not behind the door.</p>

I saw something at the bottom of the lining of the prisoner's coat, and I drew forth a silk handkerchief, which was mine; I have the spoon and handkerchief here, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner six years, he came backwards and forwards where I lived; I went out in the afternoon when the robbery happened, and came home about nine in the evening; the spoons were taken out of my box, the key was in my box, but the box was not locked, it was last Monday three weeks, the room was locked, but the prisoner had the liberty to come in the room; he used to come and see the young woman that lodged in the same room; the key was left in the one pair of stairs, and our room was the two pair of stairs; I did not miss them till the constable came the next morning, and brought the prisoner with him and the spoons, I looked in my box, and they were not there.</p>
               <p>- THOMPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 6th of April, the prisoner brought two spoons to pledge, at Mr. Faws, in Fleet-market, he had a very mean appearance, they suspected he had stole them, and we secured the spoons; when he owned whose they were, we took the man into custody, and went with him to the prosecutrix; he acknowledged he had the spoons from there; the young man pleaded he had a right to take them out, he said he had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270117"/> right to every thing in that room; he thought that every thing that was in that room belonged to that young woman.</p>

               <p>I went to see this woman, I went into the room to see what was left for me, I saw the spoons, I went and pledged them, and the man stopped me, I understood that every thing in the room was her's, I did not know that the other woman had a box there; I frequently have had a key whenever I thought proper, I will be judged by the young woman herself.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did he know you lodged in that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could he have mistaken your box for the other young woman's? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. In what manner did he detect her? - He came in and said, Madam, I believe you have a card of lace; she said, what do you mean by that, I have no card of lace, she took her plate and wanted to be off, and in the scuffle the card of lace dropped from her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see it drop from her? - It could not drop from any body else.</p>
               <p>In what manner did you see it drop? - I saw it on the ground, dropped from her as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the card of lace close to her feet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near? - Right under her feet, my passage is but very small, it might be a quarter of a yard from her, she was partly over it, it was just at the edge of her petticoats.</p>
               <p>How near is that to the compter? - My passage is not quite four feet, therefore it must be pretty close to the compter; I had but one shutter down, it was Good Friday.</p>
               <p>Where were you when you saw the card laying on the ground? - I was looking from behind the compter at the struggle between the man and her.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was that that drew your attention? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you did not look particularly before that? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this card of lace laying opposite to where the shutter was open, or at a distance from it? - At a distance from it.</p>
               <p>The shutter was open and down from the end from the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270118"/>Then there was no opening from the compter to the floor of the shop where the card of lace was laying? - No.</p>
               <p>How was the woman dressed at the time? - She had the same cloak on as she has now, I supposed her to be a neighbour, I knew her by sight perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Was the card of lace open, or in what state? - Not opened at all, it was pinned, the boxes were put on the compter, but the laces were not taken out, not all of them, they were put into the boxes again.</p>
               <p>Could the card of lace catch to her cloak, or clothes? - I think it almost impossible.</p>
               <p>What passed afterwards? - I took her into the parlour, and two women in my house rummaged her, and nothing was found upon her, not even a halfpenny in money.</p>
               <p>You are sure she asked you for change before? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And she had no money? - None at all.</p>
               <p>What did she say in respect to this card of lace? - She begged my pardon, and went down on her knees, and hoped I would forgive her, and that she never did any thing of the like before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You say she was rummaged before by these two women? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>There was no money found on her? -</p>
               <p>She told you she could not pay you without change? - Yes; she said the cheese-monger would not open the door to her; I do not know what she might do when she was out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Did she not appear at first a good deal alarmed? - She was alarmed at the first moment.</p>
               <p>A good deal, as any other honest woman must be; being so alarmed, she begged your pardon, and went down on her knees? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Might not one of these cards accidentally catch to her cloak, which you see is a large one; was it not extremely possible that the confined way in which the card was shewn, it might have fallen off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shutters of your shop windows were all shut? - Yes, I have a glass door to that passage.</p>
               <p>So that the whole light that you had in order to shew those goods by, and in order to make all the observation necessary on the subject was that that came from the shop door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your first attention was attracted by the struggle between the man and the woman, the man charged her with having a card of lace, consequently you did not observe at that time the compter? - I saw my boxes were safe, I put them behind the shutter at the time the struggle was, I did not look befoee the strugle.</p>
               <p>So that whether the Card of Lace might have been dropped there, from her first going out or after you cannot say? - I saw it on the floor.</p>
               <p>You cannot affect to say it droped from her unless by supposition? - I did not see it drop from her.</p>
               <p>This passage was vastly confined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the man that observed her? - In the back shop.</p>
               <p>Is there any glass there? - No, it is a shop in the yard.</p>
               <p>How could he tell she had a card of lace? - It was from the information of my woman servant, she was standing at the door that looks into the shop on one side of her.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hatton, I remember the prisoner being in my master's shop, I was scowering the parlour, and my master was shewing some single edged black lace, and there was some conversation which I did not mind, but I heard her ask for some double edged lace, she said she thought it would be better sewed on and plaited in half plaits, I went and stood at the parlour door even with the shop, there was nobody in the shop besides, I could see my master and this woman, she could not see me, I saw her take her hand and take a card of lace out of the box and put it down on the ompter, my master turned himself round to reach the doubled edged lace, and she clapped her right hand on this card and concealed it under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Did you see her do that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270119"/>You are sure you saw her do that? - Yes, I did, then I went up stairs to my master's son and told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind what you told him, you was scowering the back parlour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not attending to what you told us what you saw passing in the shop? - No.</p>

               <p>How is it then that you know all this about hats and single edged lace and double edged lace? - As hearing her and not being a common thing, I got up and stood up at the door.</p>
               <p>What is there so uncommon in asking for double edged lace? - There was an edging to be sewed upon it, she was looking upon the singled edged lace.</p>
               <p>How could you know that? - I heard what the woman said.</p>
               <p>I fancy you scower in a very different way from the rest of your sex, they generally make a noise? - Yes, but when I heard I got up and looked.</p>
               <p>The shop door was pretty dark, was not it? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>What light had it? - The sun light over the door, and the shop door it was almost as light as this Court.</p>
               <p>You saw this woman take up a card of lace, did not she take up many? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she treated this the same as the rest? - No, she did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Might it not be brushed down by the cloak? - No, because at that part of the compter there was no lace, I did not struggle with her at the time, I only questioned her.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she ever come to your shop? - Yes, on the 16th of March, between four and five, she came in alone, she asked to look at some neck handkerchiefs, accordingly I shewed her several different pieces, and she objected to the price of them, presently came in some more ladies, and asked to look at some British muslins, and while I turned round to get the muslin, the woman went out of the shop, and said she would call again; when I brought the papers of muslins, I missed a piece of handkerchiefs, I said she had got them, and I run after her immediately, and brought her back, she was, I suppose, about fifty yards on the other side of the way, I took her into the parlour, and sent for a constable, I sent to the Poultry Compter; she laid one piece of handkerchiefs upon the counter, and one she dropped on the floor, I only missed one piece, but she had two, I am sure she had it, I did not see her drop a piece, but I saw her lay this one on the counter.</p>
               <p>Did not you observe where she took that piece from that she put on the counter? - I do not know, she took it from underneath her cloak.</p>
               <p>When you stopped her, did you tell her what you wanted? - No, I told her to come back.</p>
               <p>Had you seen this piece before? - I cannot say with certainty.</p>
               <p>When did you see this piece on the ground, after she was brought into the parlour, or before? - Before she went into the parlour, she went into the parlour directly, I was not there half a minute, I found this piece on the ground just after she came in, and she was then in the shop close by the piece, I believe she went in first, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether the piece was on the ground before she came into the shop, when you went out after her? - No, I am sure it was not, because she was so high up.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of seeing whether it was on the ground when she entered into the shop? - I concluded she dropped it, but I did not see her drop it.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to her about the other piece that she put on the counter? - No, I did not, I sent for a constable directly, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the piece to the parlour? - It was about five yards, our shop is about ten yards long, the pieces I shewed her were close to to the door.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the piece she dropped on the ground? - Three, and there were ten in the other piece.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts on the counter was it that she put the other piece? - Near the other piece.</p>
               <p>Describe to me how she did it? - She took it out from under her cloak, and chucked it down.</p>
               <p>She did it in an open manner, and not slid it down to prevent you from seeing her? - No.</p>
               <p>These pieces, one of which was on the ground, and the other you saw her put on the ground? - I shewed her one, but how she came at the other I do not know; one piece that she stole I shewed her; the first piece, they were my master's property, I have private marks on them.</p>

               <p>I was in this shop, me and my sister went in to buy a piece of muslin, the prisoner was then in the shop looking at neck handkerchiefs, she said they were too dear for her and did not buy, and immediately the boy put the paper down with the muslin unopened, he missed a piece of handkerchiefs, he jumped over the counter and went after the woman and brought her back, that was the prisoner as I believe, but I cannot be sure, she begged for God's sake to have mercy upon her, she never did so before, we said we had nothing at all to do with it, we did not belong to the shop, then the boy took her into the parlour, and she had a piece of handkerchief I heard, and what I think he said she had stole them, she took them from between her cloak and the child.</p>
               <p>Did you see her do that? - I think I saw her take them from between her cloak and the child, but whether she gave them to the boy, or laid them down I cannot tell, the boy took but one piece at first, but when he had her in the parlour he said there was two pieces, I did not observe the piece drop from her, I heard the boy say he had picked up a piece, I do not know what she did with the piece when she took it from between the cloak and the child, she was in the shop when we first went in, she was looking at some handkerchiefs near the door, she went out as soon as we went in.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of March, between three and four in the afternoon, I was sent for to Mr. Webster's to take charge of a woman that had stole some things, the woman was in the parlour, and these two ladies, the woman was upon her knees begging for God's sake to forgive her, the ladies said they had nothing to do with it, but it was a sad thing that people must be robbed of their property by such vile wretches as she; I took the prisoner to the Compter.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to look at a common neck handkerchief, and set my child down on the counter by the handkerchiefs, I looked at some, they were too dear, I being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270123"/> a poor woman, I went out and got some distance from the shop, the boy came after me, I went back with him, I did not know I had got any thing belonging to them about me, I took and shook my child, and they were between my cloak and my child's coats.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to speak for you to give you the character of an honest woman? - I have not a friend in the world; my husband is a taylor, he was gone into the country to look for work.</p>
               <p>Court. If you were an honest woman, there are people that know you, you might have a character? - There was several people to come to speak for me, they told me my trial was not to come on till Monday.</p>

            : Gentlemen, the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner are short. The prosecutor on Thursday the 5th of February was walking along St. James's-street, Covent-garden, when he was accosted by a person he did not know, and they got into conversation; they soon stopped, and stooped and picked up something, which upon examination proved to be a purse; he immediately said to the prosecutor. I have been so fortunate as to pick up a purse, and you are intitled to half of it; the prosecutor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270125"/> who has returned from Gibraltar, was highly pleased with his good fortune, and fell into the trap; they went into a house, and were soon followed by the prisoner; and when he came in, says he, Gentlemen, has any thing extraordinary happened; no, nothing extraordinary, only a purse found; says he to the man, did you find it, was that gentleman in company with you? yes; Oh! then he is intitled to half certainly; to be sure, no doubt of it: one end of this purse contained a receipt from some eminent jeweller, for two hundred and ten pounds, paid for a brilliant diamond cluster ring; and in the other end of the purse was this diamond ring; pray, says the prisoner to the other man, have you any money; says he to the prosecutor, have you any money; says he, I have none about me; perhaps you have got some at home; yes: so they all three got into into a coach, and away they went to this man's lodgings at Chelsea; he had only twenty guineas and four doubloons; it was then proposed, Sir, you have the ring and I have this twenty guineas and four doubloons; and, Sir, I will have the ring myself, and return you one hundred pounds for your share, and proposed to meet the prosecutor at the Chequers; the poor man, mightily pleased, called at the Chequers, and might have waited from that time to this, for neither of the gentlemen ever appeared; application was made to Bow-street, and those gentlemen described who were very well known there, and Mr. Moor was taken into custody, he affected to return part of the money, the poor man would gladly have received it, and 13 l. odd was given back, the remainder was not paid; and the Magistrate told him, you cannot do it, the justice of the country requires that this man should be brought to justice: Gentlemen my Lord will tell you that this is a complete robbery; for wherever a person makes use of a fraud to get into their possession the property of others, fraud will not excuse the felony; these very cases have been submitted to the twelve Judges, they have determined this offence to be a complete felony: Gentlemen, the next question will be for you to judge, whether the prisoner was or was not concerned with the other man, and whether it was not a scheme to rob and plunder the first man that they met with; the prisoner goes into a public house and interferes as an innocent man would not have done; then goes into the coach to this man's lodgings at Chelsea, and comes away with the other man, then when he is taken up he offers to make restitution, these are for your consideration: If he is connected with the other, he is equally guilty of the felony; of that there cannot be a doubt in point of law, but if the facts do not warrant your verdict of Guilty, in that case you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>Had either of you desired him to enquire into the business? - Not a word, he said to the gentleman, have you no money? no, I only brought a guinea and half to London with me, and my supper and my bed, and a friend drinking with me, I have very little left; says he, I shall have plenty tomorrow; says I, if you have not money, you had better advertise the ring; no, no, says he, we must not advertise it; I should have bought such a ring to have made a present to Lord Derby; as I do not want money, I will give you your share if you can be content till to-morrow, nine o'clock; the prisoner says to me, have you any money; I said I had none about me; have you any at home; I told him I had; can you get it if we go home with you; to be sure I can, says I; how much money do you think you have at home; I do not doubt but I have forty or fifty pounds at home; that will just do, says he, we will have a coach and we will go; we went all three in a coach, and went up to my lodging; Moore staid behind, the other man and me went up to my quarters, and sat down and drank share of a shilling's worth of punch; when I got the money, we left Moore in the Five Fields, but he was at the Cheshire Cheese when we came down, I put down the money, twenty guineas and four doubloons, the other man put it in his purse, and gave me the ring, and desired me to meet him the next morning at nine o'clock, that he would return me that money, and give me one hundred pounds for my share of the ring, which accordingly I did, I went the next morning, and waited there till four in the afternoon, but never saw the two strangers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How long did they stay in the house at Chelsea after you gave them the twenty guineas? - Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they go away together? - Both went away together, they would hardly stay to drink the punch I had treated them with; after that I gave information at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Look at that man, was that the man? - That was one of them.</p>
               <p>When he was taken up; what did he say to you? - When I went into the room, I told the constable that was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you give the first information in Bow-street, where did you find this man? - I found him in a publick-house; I knew him directly, he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he was the man, he was sorry for it, he would make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270127"/> it up, and get me the money if he could.</p>
               <p>Court. What publick-house was it? - I do not know, he said he was sorry he had taken me in, but he would make friends and get me my money back again if he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your answer to my friend's last question was, that he was the man, that he was sorry for it; then you mended your evidence, and said he was sorry for taking you in? - I do not recollect I said he took me in.</p>
               <p>That is very material? - My Lord, I mean nothing but to be correct.</p>
               <p>You see when my friend asked you what passed between you when you first saw him, you said that he was sorry for it, then you do not recollect at all, that he said that he was sorry he had taken you in? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you charge him with doing? - I desired that he would get me my money.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you say when you first saw him? - I told him to his face, and the constable that took him, that that was the man that was in company when I was defrauded of my money.</p>
               <p>And like an honest man, and feeling for your loss, the prisoner said, I am sorry for it? - I cannot tell what was his answer rightly, I know he said something to that purpose, that he was sorry, and would get me the money if he could.</p>
               <p>I believe he was as good as his word, and did endeavour to get you the money? - I do not doubt but he did, he strove very much.</p>
               <p>You yourself proposed that a jeweller should be sent for, and the money divided? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Consequently you very voluntarily parted with your twenty guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have told us very freely too, that this man did not take the money, the other man took it from you? - The other man took it from me.</p>
               <p>My friend asked you if you met them the next morning; your answer was more correct, you said he gave me the ring, and appointed me to meet him; but it might be an omission? - I should have said them, because they both promised to meet me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Moore promise to meet you? - Yes, I think so, to the best of my knowledge, but I will not positively say; they were both to meet there, because we were to give him a guinea apiece; therefore he must be there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it excludes the possibilty of his sharing in the plunder.</p>
               <p>Court. That may be rather a stronger inference than we may draw.</p>
               <p>You went the next day to this place at Charing Cross? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did you never leave the ring with any body before you went to Bow-street? - Indeed I did, I believe General Boyd and his lady had it; I cannot tell who had it.</p>
               <p>To whom did you give it? - I gave it to my son-in-law

            .</p>
               <p>Court. When was that? - I cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>Recollect as near as you can? - I dare say it was four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Before the prisoner was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might your son-in-law have it? - I believe he had it a day.</p>
               <p>He returned it to you? - Yes; my son, as I have heard, gave it to General Boyd, I cannot tell what came of it when it was out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Did you make a mark upon it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You are but very little acquainted with cluster diamond rings? - I am not, I never saw one before.</p>
               <p>And never may again perhaps? - I hope not.</p>
               <p>When the ring was produced by the stranger out of the purse, you took it for granted it was a cluster diamond ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is only from the information of somebody else that you can guess that it is not a diamond cluster ring? - It is not.</p>
               <p>If I were to ask you upon your oath, and from your own knowledge, could you tell me whether this is a diamond ring or not? - I could not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270128"/>Then the ring may have been changed, having no mark and you having no judgment in brilliants, it is possible? - I do not think my son-in-law or General Boyd would change it.</p>
               <p>But otherwise you have no mark, no guess, no possibility of knowing whether it was the same? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw the prisoner in the street, previous to your going into the public house? - No.</p>
               <p>He was not in the public house when you first went in? - He came after we came in.</p>
               <p>While you were reading this paper, and examining that identical ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, was there any thing that induced you to think that that man at the bar and the other are at all acquainted? - To speak my opinion, I really took them to be strangers, I did indeed.</p>
               <p>I believe when you were picked up in the street you had a note of some value in your pocket? - Yes, I had a two hundred pound note in my pocket.</p>


               <p>Did you or did you not give that note of two hundred pounds to the prisoner to get it discounted? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How many days had it to run? - Three or four days; the prisoner went out, and came back and delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>The two hundred pound note that had but two or three days to run was better to steal than twenty guineas; my friend asked whether they did not come away together? - They walked away together, or run, they were out of my sight in five minutes; I left the house when they left it.</p>
               <p>Did you not invite the prisoner to go to Chelsea? - No, for the prisoner proposed when he found I had some money at home, to take a coach and go.</p>
               <p>I believe you are not much a loser by this fraud, taking for granted for a moment, that neither you nor I know that this ring is not worth sixpence, I believe you are not much loser from the fraud? - Upon my word I am, where is my four doubloons?</p>
               <p>Have you or have you not a note for the remainder? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never had? - There was some kind of a note that the prisoner drew out there; he returned me the money about ten hours after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>What is that note for? - For value receceived.</p>
               <p>His note is for a part of this balance? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>You had a note of Moor delivered to you? - I did not destroy it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will find in the course of the witnesses, that Mr. Field accepted of the note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was there, and burnt before all our faces: I believe I did read it, but I did not keep it in my possession half a minute, it was given to one Buckery, he was the person who was to keep it.</p>
               <p>You had no idea of prosecuting this man till it was put into your head at Bow-street? - I do not know whether I had or not.</p>
               <p>Was it not from the advice of the runners of Bow-street that you brought this prosecution? - I do not think it was; Sir Sampson Wright and Mr. Bond sent down some of his people, and took us all prisoners.</p>
               <p>For what? - I was not a prisoner three minutes, every one in the house was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did not Sir Sampson Wright say he would send you to Bridewell if you did not prosecute? - I told him I wanted to go over to Ireland, and he told me I should not go, I should stay and prosecute the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect writing any letter to the prisoner, since he has been in custody on this subject? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What might have been the purport of that letter? - I have forgot.</p>
               <p>Was it not to obtain satisfaction that unless the notes were taken up, and satisfaction made, you would prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will find that the day I was taken into custody, that same ring was seen in the possession of a private soldier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you not recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270129"/> sending to your wife by a common soldier? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you send to your wife for the ring? - I cannot tell whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that it was locked up? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your being at the publick house with the Constable, on the day the 13 l. was paid, and then sending to your wife for the ring? - What the day the prisoner was taken up, upon my word I believe it was, I cannot recollect rightly.</p>
               <p>Then by whom did you send? - The person is not here, he was a Serjeant.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure this is the ring that he brought you? - I think I could.</p>
               <p>By what marks? - I did not mark it.</p>
               <p>It depends you know very much on the honesty of that man, whether he might not have changed it or no? - It certainly does.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to put another question to Mr. Field.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Send the question to me in writing.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect correctly whether the guinea apiece was to be given the next day, or that it was not given at

               <p>Who proposed meeting the next day? - The other man and Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>Now this note of yours, the 200 l. note, what kind of note was it? - It was a note from the paymaster to the agent.</p>
               <p>Which they could not get discounted? - I do not know whether they could or not.</p>
               <p>As to the ring, is that the same? - I really believe this is the same ring, I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of the receipt being the same? - None, that is the receipt.</p>
               <p>When the man was taken up, he proposed paying you some money and giving you a note, what was that for? - For the remainder of the sum he had got from me.</p>
               <p>Did he ever pretend to you that he had not received any money? - Yes Sir, he told me he had received no money, he offered to get all he could for me.</p>
               <p>What was the purport of this note he gave you? - I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you are an acquaintance of Mr. Field's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time receive from Mr. Field authority to settle the business which is the subject of this enquiry? - Yes, I live at Chelsea, in Jews-row, at the King's head, very nigh the prosecutor, when the prosecutor was swindled out of his money, I knew nothing at all of it till it was over, when he was going into the country he left an order for me to settle the matter for him, and receive what money I could get, he was then going to his officer to settle some matters in the regiment that he left unsettled behind him.</p>
               <p>Was there in consequence of that authority any negociation between you and any other person for the purpose of settling for him? - He was not gone when an order came up to Chelsea for me to go down and settle it, therefore I took him with me to settle it.</p>
               <p>What passed at the meeting in settling it, and who were there present? - There was the prisoner Moor, a Constable of the name of Rhodes, a Serjeant, and Mr. Field.</p>
               <p>What passed? - When we went in, the Constable asked Mr. Field if he knew the prisoner Moor, and he told him he did, and Mr. Moor said I am the man, Field said I want my money, to which Moor answered I have not the money to give, I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Was there any money paid at all to Field? - Yes, there was 13 l. in my presence, some odd shillings, with a bill of Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270130"/> Foster's likewise, which was given in balance for the rest.</p>
               <p>In balance for what? - In balance for 35 l. I think for 20 guineas and 4 doubloons, 13 l. he got, and some odd shillings, and a note of Mr. Foster, a note of hand for 19 l. it was made in my name, that I was to receive the money for Mr. Field, it was a note of hand from Moor the prisoner for 19 l. that note was delivered to me for Mr. Field as a Trustee for him, i t was made over in my name, it made up the whole sum as far as I knew.</p>
               <p>What became of that note? - We destroyed it as we thought it was of no use, Mr. Field was satisfied with what balance he had got, as the man could not raise any more money, and we were all going away, there was a party came from Bow-street, by whose means I know not, and they apprehended the whole and took them to Bow-street, and Mr. Field was obliged to go with us, it was all settled.</p>
               <p>It was all over then, when that party came and fetched you, and the note was destroyed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When you was in company, what had the constable to do then? - Moore was in custody, then he was charged with dropping the ring.</p>
               <p>What else? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Yes, it must be something else? - Field charged him with being in company with another man, which had defrauded him of some money; the other man was charged with taking away the money, but he charged this with being an accomplice in taking it.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - I am sorry for it; says the other I want my money; says he, I have it not to give you; he had not got the money at first, he sent out and collected thirteen pounds; I did not hear what the Justice said.</p>

               <p>Court. That was with respect to the things in the basket? - Yes, I asked him the name of the man, he said he never saw him till yesterday, he did not know his name, nor where he was to be found, I told him he should come along with me.</p>

               <p>Has the box been out of your sight? - It has.</p>
               <p>In whose hands? - When I brought the prisoner to London, I brought the box with me, and put a chain round it, and put a padlock round that, and locked it besides, it was taken to Mr. West and Thomas by a porter, it might be nine or ten days out of my sight, I thought it was as safe as if it was in sight, it was locked up by me, and I unlocked it at Guildhall, and locked it again, they were then taken to Mr. Thomas's house by one of his servants, and this morning I saw them at Mr. Thomas's, they were never out of my sight till they were locked up.</p>

               <p>Court. Let the chest be opened.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. I suppose you have looked over these things? - I have.</p>
               <p>Are there among these things any of them so marked that you can positively swear to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pick out a few of those that you can speak with the most certainty of.</p>
               <p>Constable. These are the articles that were found on his person.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor deposes to a great many of the articles.)</p>
               <p>Court. You never sold any of these goods to this man or his brother? - No, I never saw the brother that is talked of here, till I took them up.</p>
               <p>Have you looked over the rest of the goods, and do you believe them to be your property? - Yes, I believe all the other things to be ours, except one single article.</p>
               <p>(Hutchins deposes to part of the property as his own work.)</p>

               <p>I bought this hair of different people in London, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you produce who you had these things from? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to your character, or to any fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rose. He had a certificate of the churchwardens and inhabitants where he lived, but we cannot produce that.</p>
               <p>Jones. I have made an enquiry of several people in the town of Worcester, and they speak well of him, that he was a very honest lad; his master in the country was a very bad master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rose to Jones. Has he a wife and family? - I believe he has at Leominster.</p>

               <p>Had they the appearance of silver at that time? - They had, but they were not silver, they were covered with clock face silver, I found two stamps in the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Where are they? - I delivered them to the Assay Master.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Field. Did Mr. Clarke see me do any thing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were the prisoners? - The prisoner Field stood by the window, and Hogg at the table, they was a buckle on the table, and in the window was the stamps and the colouring.</p>

               <p>I am Assay Master to the Goldsmith's Company, I have got the impression of a Lion, and likewise the initials of the workman's name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How came they into your custody? - They were given me by Mr. Clarke, the Lion is passant, the two letters are I. I.</p>
               <p>What else have you? - The spoon, there is the mark of the Lion upon it.</p>
               <p>Is it silver? - No, I think there may be the quantity of one penny weight in a pound of metal, there are five buckles of the same quality, of one penny weight in the pound.</p>
               <p>Is this the Company's mark? - No, but the resemblance that is made in imitation of the Company's mark, might impose upon any one, but those who were critically versed in things of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. These are the same I gave the Assay Master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had they the appearance more of silver then, than they have now? - Yes, they had much more the appearance of silver then, the air will take off the silver in a very short time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>About three weeks ago, I met the two prisoners, and they asked me if I could pledge a ring for them, I took the ring from Field, it appeared to be garnets set in gold, they desired me to ask 4 s. for it but the pawnbroker refused to let me have so much upon it, when I came out I told Field, he said damn it, I have something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270141"/> that will do, and he took out a pair of buckles, and went in with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When was this? - It was about a month ago, Field came out and told Hogg he had got seven shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other prisoner by at that time? - Yes; they asked me if I would drink, I told them I would; they asked me if I would go home with them, I said I would go with them; I went to Hogg's house, and he asked me what I thought of these buckles, Field asked me the same question, I said I did not see them, and I could not say much about them, he said, don't you think they are silver? I said, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Field go with you to Hogg's house? - Yes; my Lord, he then went to the cupboard, and pulled out a piece of rag with two bits of iron, they seemed to be like files; Mr. Field withdrew, and Hogg said I will tell you the use of it, and he made the impression of a lion upon the buckles and upon a spoon, and he said, if I could meet with any metal buckles and bring them to him, he would make it an advantage to me; one of those stamps was broke in the using, and one was shorter than the other, two or three days after I saw them again, and they said if I would call on them, I could do them much service, and it would be an advantage to me, I was to go to Field's house, but that night I went and laid an information in Bow-street, I was sent to Mr. Reynolds, and he sent me to Mr. Clarke, I went to this place some minutes before Mr. Clarke came, I saw the prisoner stamp the mark on some buckles, he made the mark, and then delivered them to Field.</p>
               <p>(The Buckles produced.)</p>
               <p>Are these the buckles you saw him mark? - These are them I saw him mark before I came out, they were all coloured as well as marked, Hogg marked them, and Field rubbed them over to have the appearance of silver, and threw them in water, they desired me to go and fetch an engraver, instead of that I went to Mr. Clarke, as Field did them he let them drop in the pail.</p>
               <p>Did that change the colour? - Yes, it changed them white, I saw two buckles stamped and a spoon, one of the stamps was broke in the marking.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Was you ever convicted for some offence or other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it for? - It was for an affair where I lived.</p>
               <p>What did the court in that case? - I have been on board the lighter.</p>
               <p>For how long time? - Three years.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - No. 37, Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>- HURD, Pawnbroker, sworn.</p>
               <p>This man came in, and brought a hoop garnet ring.</p>
               <p>Court. You had it from one of the prisoners? - I had, it was from the man in the red coat.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to doubt it was him? - No, it was him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.</p>
               <p>You say you remember this ring being brought in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not lend any money on it? - No, I tried the ring, and found it was base metal, I said take the ring and go about your business; the buckles were brought me by Field, I verily believe it was him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hogg called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Field called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>
