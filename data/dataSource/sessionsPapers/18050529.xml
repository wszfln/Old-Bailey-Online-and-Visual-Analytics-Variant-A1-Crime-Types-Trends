             sworn. - I am a servant to Mr. Reynolds, a printer, who lives opposite to Mr. Howis; I saw the prisoner take a ham from Mr. Howis's shop on the 27th of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and put it into the cart, and wrapped it up in some matting; the ham was close by the side of the door; I saw him go back into the shop, and speak to the young man, and then he returned to the cart and took the ham from the cart, and wrapped it up in the matting and put it under his arm, and went away with it; I informed Mr. Howis of it; he went in search of him, but could not find him; when he returned back, Mr. Howis sent for me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. About half past twelve o'clock I was standing with the cart at Charing-cross; my master came down to me, and ordered me to go to Mr. Frisby Howis to load the cart; I stood with the cart before the shop a quarter of an hour; the gentleman came to the door, and I asked him how long it would be before he could get the goods to load; he said a quarter of an hour; I asked leave to go and get a pint of beer and a bit of bread and cheese; instead of going for that I went up to the whip-maker and fetched my whip.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the ham? - A. I never touched any thing of the kind, nor had the least thought about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopwoman to Mr. Macaulay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming into your master's shop on the 6th of May? - A. Perfectly well, it was between three and four o'clock, and another lady with her; the prisoner enquired of the boy to look at some British lace; he was the only one in the shop; I was in the adjoining room; the door being open, I heard every thing, and by the glass I saw every thing, that passed; he shewed her a draw of British lace; they did not approve of that; she asked to look at some real lace; the boy shewed her a draw of real lace; she did not make choice of what he shewed her; he went to the window to fetch a card from there; she did not approve of that, but she made choice of one in the drawer, and agreed with him for seventeen yards, which he cut off for her; she had not money to pay for the whole of the lace; she desired it might be put by and she would call the next day; she gave the boy one shilling and sixpence towards the payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any lace? - A. We did not miss any at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a quantity of lace lying about the counter? - A. None, but what was in the drawer, she and the other woman sat upon two stools by the side of the counter, and the drawer was between the two women; the prisoner was the person that cheapened the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman offer to buy any? - A. I believe the lace that was to be bought was for the other; I believe it was the prisoner that gave the one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she intoxicated at all? - A. It appeared to me so; she had a very odd behaviour with her, and had a great deal of action with her hands; they were very genteel people, and very well dressed; the other woman had on a white dress and long sleeves, and a feather in each of their hats.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them appeared to be most dealing for the lace? - A. The prisoner was the person that cheapened.</p>
               <p>- KINCADE sworn. - I live in Fort-street, in the old Artillery-ground; I am a silk manufacturer; on the 6th of May, about half past five, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290004"/>assed the prisoner at the bar in White-Lion-street; she was apparently very well dressed; she being very much intoxicated, abused the passengers as they went along; it attracted my attention, seeing a woman so well dressed, and so very abusive, that I crossed the way, to see who or what she might be; knowing where the beadle of the district lived, I went and knocked at his door, and he came down; I sent for an officer by him, and immediately gave him charge of this woman on suspicion that she was a shop-lifter.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you? - A. This lace, with this ticket, which appeared to be a shop-mark, was hanging somewhere under her clothes, with the ticket to it; I ordered her to be taken to Worship-street, I gave particular charge that she should not drop the lace; I went with her to the office, and it was taken from her there; there was another card of lace which the officer took from her at the Office.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the headboroughs of Norton-Falgate; I was fetched from my house, about half past five o'clock, on the sixth of May, to take the prisoner in charge, on suspicion of her being a shop-lifter, by Mr. Kincade; I asked her if she had any lace about her; she said, yes, it was her own, and if I, or any body took it away from her, she would swear a robbery against them; I took her to the next place to the Office, the Office being shut up, and there she dropped the two cards of lace; I picked up one, and Mr. Kincade picked up the other.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he quit your service? - A. On the night he committed the robbery, on the Thursday in Passion-week, I do not recollect the day of the month; I believe he left my house about half after nine in the evening; at nine o'clock I rang the bell, and the prisoner answered me; at half an hour after nine I rang again, and upon no person answering, I was surprized and went down, and I found there was no person below stairs; I then went up stairs and called; I found no servant above stairs neither; in a short time afterwards, there was a ring at the bell; I went down and opened the door; it was the house-maid; I reprimanded her and she said the prisoner had induced her to go; I found the prisoner was absent; he did not return that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing upon his being gone? - A. In consequence of what the servant-maid told me, I missed all the plate, chest and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that plate in use in the course of that day? - A. The chest of plate was in my room the whole course of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked at the contents of the chest that day? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had several articles of plate in use that day? - A. No, none that were in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen them in the chest? - A. I believe about three weeks before I put them in the chest myself; I keep those in my own bedroom that are not in common use; I lost both these that were in common use and in the chest, except a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this did you make any enquiry after the prisoner? - A. I did; on Sunday I found he had been with Soley, a milkman, on Lisson-green; I traced him by that means.</p>

               <p>Q. You know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you? - A. Yes, on Thursday evening, about ten minutes past ten o'clock; he came and called my wife and me; we were all in bed; I opened the door; I was in my shirt; he came inside of the house; he said to my wife, Mrs. Soley, I am now come to take my leave of you; he said he was going into the country; - he told my wife he had made her a present of an old coat or two, and some things, that he should not take away; he said where he had left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him? - A. No, not when he came to my house; he asked my wife if she would consent for me to go as far as Bishopsgate-street; he said, if you will dress yourself, and come over the other side of Lisson-green, I have got a hackney coach; I dressed myself, and went;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290005"/>there was nobody with the coach but the coachman and him; he went into the coach, and asked me to ride a little way with him; I got into the coach with him, and I saw two boxes in the coach; he drove on down Oxford-road; the coachman, when he came into Oxford-road, said he must feed his horses, and he would advise him to take another coach, as the horses could not go so far as Bishopsgate-street; he told the coachman to get him a post-chaise; the coachman got him one, and the post-chaise was put alongside, and the boxes were put out of the coach into the post-chaise; the helper that came with the post-chaise shifted the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you touch them? - A. No; then I shook hands with him, and told him I would rather go home, as he had got a post-chaise; he pressed very much for me to go along with him, and I agreed to go to Islington turnpike; when I came there I shook hands with him, and parted, and wished him a pleasant journey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him tell the postillion where to drive to? - A. Yes, to Waltham-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was to go farther? - A. He told the post-boy he was going on to Cambridge; with that we went on Friday morning to the place where he told us for the clothes; we went to two or three places, we did not understand the right shop, and we never got the clothes.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A. At Puckeridge, twenty-seven miles from Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you come through Waltham-cross to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar? - A. That is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a public-house? - A. Yes, the Crown and Coffin, at Puckeridge; he came to my house on the Friday before Easter, before dinner, in a post-chaise, alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he bring with him? - A. I was not present at the moment he alighted; I believe the post lad had brought the boxes into my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were not present; you did not see the boxes taken out of the chaise? - A. No; I saw the boxes in my parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many boxes? - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about the boxes? - A. No, nothing particular; I went to the parlour-door, and made my obedience to him, and he asked for a pot of ale; the servant fetched the ale; then he asked for something to eat; I told him I had nothing cooked, there was bread and butter, and bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any directions about these boxes? - A. He said he would take a bit of dinner, and after dinner he went and took a walk, and came back to tea; after he drank tea he went out of doors, and going out of doors he heard there was a post-chaise to let; he went and hired the post-chaise, and the post-chaise was brought up to the door; he took the white deal box with him.</p>
               <p>Q. That was one of the three boxes? - A. Yes; he said he was going to Cambridge, and he said, would I have the goodness to take care of the other two boxes till he returned again; he said he believed he should come back on the Sunday morning, but he did not return till the Sunday evening; then the deal box was brought back, and he said he was going to London on the Monday morning, and he wanted something out of the other two boxes, and the middle box of the three was brought down stairs for the gentleman to take out whatever he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you call it the middle box? - A. Because there was one smaller, and the white deal box was larger.</p>
               <p>Q. He took something out, did he? - A. Yes, I went into the parlour to light him, and I saw him open the large deal box, and in shifting his box I saw some silver candlesticks and two silver branches; I saw them in the room, I suppose they were taken out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him take any thing out of the box? - A. I did not particularly see that; however I saw them in the room on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him open the deal box, but you do not recollect seeing him take any thing out? - A. Yes, I saw them in the box afterwards; there were some silver candlesticks, and two silver branches.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they silver? - A. Apparently silver, I thought they were silver; they were such as I never saw before, and there were some silver spoons; I never remarked any thing else; he said he was going to take a neckcloth for his own use; he took the middle box, and the other box, and locked them up; he asked me to be so kind as to take care of them till he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lock up both the boxes? - A. The little box was locked; he locked the other box, and one box he took into his bed-room, and the other two, the lad, who was in my house, took them up into my bed-room; he staid on the Sunday night, and went off in the morning before I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that he desired you to keep these boxes till he returned? - A. Yes, I have told you so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the large box? - A. They were both put into my bed-room, and one he took to London with him; that was the middle box.</p>
               <p>Q. The other two were kept in your bed-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290006"/>Q. How long were they kept in your bed-room? - A. The Monday happened to be a fair-day; I locked up my room door, and put the key in my pocket, and in the evening he returned again from London about tea-time; I changed but very few words with him, being busy; I asked him how he did after his journey; he told me he was going his journey for Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Q. He still left his boxes with you? - A. Yes, they were still in the same place where he left them, in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you are quite sure they are the same boxes that he left? - A. O yes, that I am very sure of; I bid him good afternoon, and went about my business; in the course of the evening, Mr. Rivett and Mr. Dennis came into my house; I stood at the bar-door; they asked me if the landlord of the house was at home; I told them, yes; they asked me if they could speak to him; I said, yes; Mr. Dennis said to me, are you the landlady; I said, yes; he then said, I shall be glad to speak to you in a private room.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that a man had left two boxes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you show him the boxes? - A. I told him they were in my bed-room; I went up stairs with both the gentlemen by myself, and unlocked the bed-room door, and shewed them the boxes; Mr. Dennis looked at the deal box, and put his hand upon it, and said that was his box, and he could swear to it; it rather confused me, and I said, if it is your's, I should like to have somebody as a witness to see you take these things from me, for fear I should be brought into trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered the box to Mr. Rivett and Mr. Dennis? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner afterwards? - A. I heard his voice when Mr. Dennis and Mr. Rivett returned with him; he never came into my house after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood you to say, when the person came in the chaise the first time, you were not then at the door? - A. I was not present, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw the boxes was in your parlour, and that gentleman was in the same room with the boxes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present at the time to see that any boxes were taken out of the chaise? - A. I do not recollect seeing them taken out of the chaise; he is the gentleman that gave them into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body else might have brought them there for what you know? -</p>

               <p>Q. When did he come to your house? - A. On Good Friday night, he came in a post-chaise from Puckeridge; he changed the chaise at my house to go to Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Q. It is only one stage from Royston to Cambridge? - A. It is thirteen miles; my chaise took him to Cambridge; he had this deal box that is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the box? (the box produced) - A. This is the box that he took with him to Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he return to your house? - A. On Saturday night, he brought the box with him; he had a chaise of me on Sunday morning to go down to Cambridge again; he returned from Cambridge in my chaise on Sunday evening, with the box, again; he took a fresh pair of horses to go to Puckeridge; he told me he was short of money, and requested that I would lend him some; he told me that he was going to London, and he should there receive money, and he would pay me for the chaise; I told him I did not like to do any thing in that way; he said he had plenty of property, and he would leave me more than double the amount of it; he unlocked that box, and gave me out a silver bread-basket, which I gave to Mr. Dennis when he came down.</p>

A one-pound note; he paid me the one-pound note, and for the chaise as well; then he went to-bed; when Mr. Dennis and Mr. Rivett came, they brought the box to my house; he had taken the box to Puckeridge; Mr. Dennis asked the prisoner whether he had any plate at my house; he said, no; I said I had a bread-basket before the prisoner; I produced the bread-basket, and Mr. Dennis said it was his; they took the prisoner with them, and I gave the bread-basket to Mr. Dennis.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Public-office, in Bow-street: On Monday, the 15th of April, I went with Mr. Dennis to Puckeridge; I found these boxes in Mrs. Patmore's bed-room; Mr. Dennis identified this box to be the box that he lost; he wished very much to see the contents of it; he recognised it immediately he came into the room; we asked Mrs. Patmore if she had the key; she said she had, and immediately she gave it up, and it was unlocked; she had only this one key.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Patmore.) Did the prisoner give you the key of that box? - A. Yes; the reason of his giving me the key was, he said it had been lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290007"/>in the course of his travelling; he came back with it, and when he was going away, he said, I wish you to have the goodness to take care of this key; I put it in my right-hand pocket, and directly Mr. Dennis came to me, I said, Mr. Aldrich gave me the key.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rivett.) You opened the box? - A. Yes, and there were several articles of plate, which Mr. Dennis identified to be his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they there now? - A. Yes; we went after the prisoner, and took the box with the plate with us; the others were left at Mrs. Patmore's; I have had the care of this box ever since; I have kept the box under lock and key; I have had the key likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Having found the box, you and Mr. Dennis took a chaise, and went on to Royston? - A. Yes; I apprehended the prisoner in bed; Mr. Dennis asked him what he had done with all his plate, as there was a great deal missing out of this large box; the prisoner replied he had pledged some; I asked him where the duplicates were; the prisoner replied they were locked up in a box at Puckeridge; we had taken his keys from him, and when we came to Puckeridge, he found the key that opened the smaller box; he pointed out where the box and the duplicates were.</p>
               <p>Q. He shewed you the box himself? - A. He did; the box was brought to him at the chaise-door.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the duplicates where he shewed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the prisoner into custody at Royston? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing about the bread-basket? - A. Yes; Mr. Dennis asked if there was any plate there, and the landlord immediately answered he had a silver bread-basket; he gave it to Mr. Dennis; I have had it in my possession ever since Mr. Dennis gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Is that the bread-basket that was produced to you at Royston? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of that? - A. I do not know; I believe the weight is upon it; I think it weighs thirty-two ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, and tell us whether it is worth about forty shillings? - A. No doubt of that, and here are two silver candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but the greatest part of them were deposited in the trunk? - A. They were deposited by me; there was a great deal more that was deposited, which are at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Court. The pawnbroker must deliver it up.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Young's husband? - A. He is a City porter, she takes in washing; in searching about the house, we found several things which I produce; I then insisted upon searching the prisoner's pockets, which she resisted, and said I should not; in struggling, I was obliged to pull them off before I could search them; I found in the pockets a gold ring and forty-two duplicates, part of which is Mr. Robinson's property; we then searched Mrs. Young's trunks, and there we found some of Mr. Robinson's property; the prisoner said she had put them there herself; I then took her to Lambeth-street Office, where she confessed that she had pledged those things at Mr. Spinkes's, in Gracechurch-street, and that they were her master's property; I then told her that her master had lost some rings, which were very valuable; she said, she knew nothing more than what she told me.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Spinkes, No. 2, Gracechurch-street; I produce a waistcoat, a napkin, and a handkerchief, pledged for six shillings, pledged on the 25th of March.

               <p>Q. Whose flour was it? - A. Mr. Richardson's; it was in a stable belonging to him, the prisoner was carman; there might be seventeen or eighteen pounds in the stable, he took part of it, which is in the bag here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you had it in your custody ever since? - A. Yes, locked up.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you pretend to say that flour is your master's property? - A. I saw him take it from under the straw.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the place where your master keeps flour? - A. Certainly it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither can you swear to the colour of the flour? - A. I cannot swear to the colour of the flour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What quantity was there? - A. The whole that was under the straw was seventeen or eighteen pounds, out of which I saw him take just so much flour as is in this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your master missed any flour? - A. We could not tell that; I saw the place where it was taken from, there was some spilt upon the ground.</p>

               <p>Merryman's defence. I had been to the warehouse, and I met my brother accidentally; I told him I wanted to buy a gown against Whitsuntide; I asked him to go into this shop with me, and I there looked at some prints; I asked him if he would take so much off for the gown; he said, how much was I going to pay; he could not take less than half a crown a yard; I bid him two shillings and four-pence; he said how many yards did I want; I said, six and a half; in measuring the piece, he shoved that piece from the counter; I directly picked it up, and this gentleman here came up from behind me, and said, I had dropped it; (that is the very truth about it) he said he had lost about twenty or thirty pounds that week; and he would make me pay for all.</p>
               <p>Beals called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Thursday, the 9th of May, I had been drinking very much the whole day; about eleven o'clock at night I went home to my own lodgings; I went up stairs, and instead of going into my own bed-room I went into the servant-maid's; I sat down by the hearth; on the table was a gown belonging to the prosecutor's wife; the daughter came into the room, and not knowing it was me, alarmed the people in the house, supposing I was a stranger; the prosecutor's wife and daughter said I was there with intent to steal something; I was in the dark; I did not know that there was such a thing as a gown on the table; while I lodged in the prosecutor's house, I always paid him justly; there were several articles missing which were laid to my charge, in consequence of my being in the room; there were several other lodgers in the house; I think they had as good right to suspect them as me, as the door was always open.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you say about the bag? - A. It is my own; it is my first wife's bag.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I will swear positively that bag is mine, it is pieced at the top, it was made by my mother.</p>

               <p>Q. How far did she go with the child? - A. About three yards, and the child walked with her; I then went up to her, and said, you hussey, you, how came you to steal that child away from the door; she said she was only going to take the child to shew her the way to Covent-Garden market.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - A. She attempted to run away, but the people having increased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290012"/>they took her to the watch-house, and I took care of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she lame as she is now? - A. Yes, she had a stick and a little black dog; she was very black, and in a dirty state.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to you on the 13th of April last? - A. I do; she came for a furnished apartment; she asked what apartments I had to let; she looked over every room in my house; she fixed upon the front parlour, and the bed-chamber over it; she was to pay me twenty shillings per week for these rooms; she told me that she came from Sunderland, and that she and her husband were going to settle in the West-Indies, and she would take these rooms for three months certain; I asked her to give me a reference for their character; she told me she was a stranger in London, and could give no reference, and that she would go back to her husband, who was on board a ship, and probably he had some acquaintance in London. She gave me three shillings, and desired that I would order in some coals for her use; she took my address, and went away; she came back in the course of two hours, and then told me she could give me a very respectable reference to a Mr. Pilkington, in Cornhill; she told me her name was Wilson, and Mr. Pilkington would give me any satisfaction that I would require; she asked me if she might go into the bed-room, and refresh herself; I went with her, and put up my bed-furniture while she was in the room; I left her in the chamber; she then came out of the room, and said, might she lay herself down for an hour, for she was very much fatigued; I made no answer; she went in immediately, and shut the bed-room door; I left a friend of mine in the charge of the house sitting in the parlour; I went to Cornhill to look for Mr. Pilkington.</p>

               <p>Q. How far might that be from your house? - A. About a mile and a half; I could not find any person of that name in Cornhill; I returned, and I asked for her, and my friend that I left in the house told me that she went out, and said that she would return in an hour; I then went into the bed-chamber, in which I left her, and found that the bed was completely stripped of all the furniture; the whole of the curtains and trimmings, and the sheets, were gone. Upon this I went to a friend, and they advised me to give information at Bow-street Office; I saw no more of her till I saw her at the Public-office, in Bow-street, which was about eight days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no part of your property there then? - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any part of your property?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290014"/>- A. I had a letter from an officer in Bow-street, informing me where some of my property was pledged; I went to Bow-street, and the officer came with me to the Minories, to a pawnbroker's there, where my property was found; this was about three weeks afterwards; I saw my bed-furniture there; another pawnbroker had the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q.Are both these pawnbrokers here? A. One is here that had the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the bed-furniture and trimmings to be your own? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the woman? - A. No; I had taken the description of her down so many times, I was sure I should know her; I went to the shop, and went into one of the private boxes; I there saw the prisoner at the bar; I said to her, how do you do, Mrs. Wilson; she said her name was not Wilson, I must be mistaken; I said I was quite sure that she was the person that had been so frequently described to me; I said, let me look at your hand, and by her nails and every other description I was positive; she denied it. I said, I must search you, I am sure you are the woman; I searched her, and found only one duplicate, as I can recollect, upon her; the duplicate was to Collins's, the same shop, for a gown or petticoat; I gave it back to her; I asked her before I went to the Office where she lived; she said she did not live any where, she had no lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know where any part of the things were pledged? - A. Mr. Collins intimated the circumstance to me, and said that there was a man, who was a carpenter, who had been at work in his shop, which induced me to think it was the husband of the prisoner; it appeared that he had been afraid to come out, and said that his wife was lost; I went to the house, and there I saw Mr. Cureton. After being committed several times for re-examination, she told me the bed-furniture was pledged at Matthews's, in the Minories, and Mr. Collins likewise told me of a Jew, who had bought some duplicates, and had fetched some things out; I went to Solomons, the Jew; he said he had six or seven duplicates, which he gave me to look at; one of the duplicates were for the sheets, I took the direction of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Solomons would not part with the duplicate? - A. No; the sheets were pawned for fifteen shillings; I left them a summons to produce them the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the place where these duplicates pointed out? - A. Yes, to Mr. Collins's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.

If my prosecutrix had given me a little time, I would have replaced them, I had got good work coming in.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The Monday before the Saturday she was apprehended, she said she had received two pounds ten shillings, she paid me one four shillings.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Church-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290017"/>Shoreditch: On Friday, the 10th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, a man brought a chair to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man at the bar? - A. Yes, I think he looks like the man; he was dressed different.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be the man? - A. Yes; I keep a broker's shop, he brought a chair, and asked my man whether he would buy it of him; my man called me out, and he offered the chair to me; I told him I did not buy chairs in the shop without I knew the people; he told me I need not fear buying it, it was his own, his father had left him two chairs a year and a half ago, he would wish to keep one, and the other he had no use for, he wished to sell that; I asked him where he lived; he said he lived at No. 6, Brick-lane; I told him one of my men should go to Brick-lane, and if he lived there I would buy it of him; he asked five shillings for the chair, and said the man might go with him; and going out of the door, he said, it was not his chair, it was his brother's, and he lived in Drury-lane, his brother lived in Brick-lane; I said I would have nothing to do with it; I told him it would be doing him justice to send for an officer; I sent for an officer, and Vickery came and took charge of him.</p>
               <p>- VICKERY sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street; I was coming past at the time they called me in; I asked him where he lived, and he told me, in Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane; I asked him where he got this chair from, and he told me that his father left him two chairs, and his father formerly lived in Drury-lane; I then took him to the Office, and found he was a soldier in the East-London Militia; the next day the chair was seen by the prosecutor, and he identified it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the day this affair happened, I was on duty on the morning; I went home to dinner, and coming along Brick-lane I met a man with a chair on his head; he asked me to buy the chair; he said he had been moving, and he had half-a-crown given him, and that chair being an odd one, he said I should have it for three shillings; I bid him half-a-crown and a glass of gin; he took it; I offered it for sale to get my money back; I asked her five shillings for it, I told her I bought it of a person in Brick-lane, I told her my father was dead, and my brother had a chair like it, and I lived in Hartshorn-court.</p>
               <p>(The chair produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) Are you very sure that the the things which form the subject of the present indictment were at your house on the day that she left your house - A. Every stitch was, upon my oath; she had left me to fold them; she has taken twenty-five pounds worth of things of mine; I am quite sure they are all mine, every one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever authorized this woman to pledge any of these things to accommodate your sisster? - A. My sister never wanted: I always allowed her so much a week.</p>

             nursed my child for three days and a half; on this day fortnight she went out in the afternoon, and in about half an hour afterwards Elizabeth Robinson brought my child home; she went away and returned in about half an hour, and brought me a pair of ear-rings; she asked me if I would keep them for about half an hour; I told her I would not; she said they were her's, she could not keep them in her ears; she put them on my child's frock and went away; she came the next morning for the ear-rings; I asked her what she wanted with them; she said she wanted to pawn them; I told her I dare say they were not her's, and she should not have them. My husband fetched Harper, the officer, and gave charge of her. She is about fifteen, I believe.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Bow-street: I took the prisoner at the bar on the first of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, at the New Hummums coffee-house, Covent-Garden; the waiter told me he suspected him having something about him that was not his own; I searched him, and found a pair of tea-tongs, a silver salt-spoon, and a silver tea-spoon; they were claimed by Mr. Moule; there is the name at full length on them all three; information was sent to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290020"/>the Rainbow; he said he hoped I would not take him into custody, if I did it would be the ruin of him; I found a number of other things upon him. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury, my defence will be short; I shall not detain the Court long; I had been out the day this offence was committed, and had drank very freely; I was in a state of intoxication, and I had an appointment to meet a gentleman at the Rainbow coffee-house upon some business; I went there in order to meet the person; the person that I was to meet called upon me, after I had ordered the tea, and said that he had made a mistake in the house that I was to meet him at; it was another house, which was the Hummums; the things mentioned in the indictment were found on me I will admit of; but how they came on me, or in my pockets I know not; I was in such a state of intoxication that I was not able or capable of knowing what I was about; and in the morning, when the officer came to me in the watch-house, I did not even know the charge that was against me; I never was charged with a criminal matter in my life before; this is the first time that ever I was brought into a Court, therefore I shall humbly beg leave to throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Humphreys.) Had he the appearance of a man intoxicated? - A. No, I thought him mean and shabby.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Akess.) At the time you were called upon to take the prisoner into custody, did he appear intoxicated? - A. Not at that time; in taking him to the watch-house he wished to make himself appear so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it real intoxication or pretended? - A. It appeared to me pretended, I do not think he was drunk at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the first of May, (I was waiter to Mr. Brown) the prisoner came into the coffee-room, between the hours of nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask for? - A. He asked for nothing at all; he walked down the coffee-room and returned to the fire-place, and from the fire-place to the bar; then he stood with his back to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the pepper-box stood that you charge him with? - A. It was only my suspicion at first; the pepper-box, in the course of the afternoon, had been used; I had removed it to the side-board; we usually put it, there after the business is over.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the side board within the reach of the persons in the coffee-room? - A. Yes; I saw him look wildly round the coffee-room; I was standing in a dark part of the coffee-room and I saw the prisoner go out; there is a communication from the coffee-room to the passage leading to the hotel, where he had passed this side board, where there was a vast deal of plate extended; on his going out I thought I perceived that he put his hand over; whether he took any thing I could not just then inform myself; I am positive that he put his hand over; I arose from my seat immediately, and followed him as gently as I could, and in the middle of the passage, I being tall overlooked his shoulder, and saw this pepper-castor in his hand; I immediately laid hold of him; he still held this pepper-castor in his hand for about two minutes; then he threw it from him; I took him into custody, and searched him in the hall of the hotel in the side of his pocket I saw a muttineer; I put my hand into his pocket, and there I found the spoons; then I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pepper-box which he threw away your master's? - A. Yes, I resigned it up to my master; I am positive this is the pepper-box; here is a mark underneath, which was marked by Mr. Akess.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I can only say in my defence as I did before, that I was in a real state of intoxication, and did not know that I was in the house, nor for what I was put into the watch-house, till the officer came to me in the morning; I beg leave to ask Coleman, the waiter, (I recollect so much as that), whether he remembers, at the time the officer was sent for, that he made use of this expression, that when I went out a thieving I ought to go out sober.</p>
               <p>Coleman. Upon my word I did not; you had then a wild look with the eye, as you have at this time; he was drest at that time as he is now, exclusive of his having his great coat on and buttoned high up.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he intoxicated? - A. I cannot say; to the best of my judgement he was not. On the following day he was more intoxicated than on the over night: on the over night he walked as steady as myself into the coffee-room; I went immediately to Mr. Moule; the bar-maid said she had lost these things.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar - On the twenty-seventh of February did you see him? - A. I did, I saw him at my shop, it is dated on the back of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A.About twenty minutes past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was light? - A. Yes, I was returning from my office, and the prisoner at the bar was at my shop, bargaining with my partner; he purchased two silk handkerchiefs; I went behind the counter, to give my partner assistance, and the prisoner at the bar gave me the note in question.</p>
               <p>Q. What price was the two handkerchiefs? - A. It was either 12 s. or 12 s. 6 d, I will not be positive; the prisoner gave the note into my hand and I held it up to the light it was a note of five pounds apparently, and I conceived it to be a bad one, as I thought; I was not certain myself, I went up stairs to my wife who was ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the note and you thought it was a bad one - did you do any thing by way of knowing whether it was bad or not? - A. Yes, I went out leaving him in the shop and took the opinion of a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out, and your belief was confirmed? - A. Yes, my friend confirmed me in my opinion; I went to a banker's, in Barner-street, and they proved it to be a forged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any Police-office? - A. I did; there was no constable there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any constable come to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having spoken for a constable did you return home? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at this note? - A. That is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him there, what passed between you and him? - A. I shut the door upon the prisoner; I told the prisoner I suspected it to be a forged note; he said he was very sorry for it, and if I would go with him to Tottenham-court-road he had plenty of friends there, who would give me a good one, in lieu of the one in question; I told him it was out of my power; he then took the watch out of his pocket, and said he would leave it, and return the next day and satisfy me; I told him I had nothing more to do with it, it rested then with the Magistrate, I should have nothing further to do with it, the law must take its course.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the note, and that note had not been out of your custody till you delivered it to the man who took the prisoner in custody? - A. No, I put his hat on his head (the constable never came to my house, I was going from my house, when I met the constable); I took hold of him by the arm, and took him myself till we came to Blenheim-steps, where the constable met us, and I delivered him to the constable, who, with myself, conveyed him to Marlborough-street; he made no resistance after he got out of the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he make any resistance before he got out of the shop? - A. Not forcible resistance; he begged and prayed that I would let him go; we took him to the Office, and he was examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What time were you gone from your shop, from your first going out? - A. I might be gone a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it natural to suppose this man to be gone for a quarter of an hour with this note, that if I knew it to be a forged note that I should not have gone.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not to talk and argue upon it; at present you must confine yourself to ask questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to making any resistance, you cannot say I ever did.</p>
               <p>Court. He said you made no forcible resistance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290022"/>you only begged and prayed in the shop, and no resistance at all out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor). Did you give him a general reason for your going out of the shop? - A. I told the prisoner I had not sufficient change in the house, I would go out and get it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any person come afterwards for that bonnet that was so marked? - A. Yes, the prisoner; I am positive of it; on Monday, the 25th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he came? - A. He asked for the bonnet that had been ordered; I knew him, because he had been once before for a bonnet for the same person, whom I then knew by the name of Thompson; he asked for the bonnet, and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he pay you for it? - A. A five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. Here is my own handwriting; I wrote Thompson, February; I put it 24 by mistake, it was on the 25th; I perfectly recollect it was Saturday she came, and it was fetched on Monday; I then gave him four pounds in change, and he gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I think I heard you say you endorsed the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endorse that note in my presence? - A. I did; I put the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you intend to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an inspector of Bank notes - I am going to shew you the Bank note in question - take that in your hand and tell us whether it is a forgery; first, the one that was given to Mr. Rhodes? - A. The whole of this is a forgery.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Be so good as to tell the Jury what you mean by the whole of its being a forgery? - A. I mean the paper is not the Bank of England paper, nor is it the engraving of the Bank of England; neither has it the water-mark, nor is it the signature of our cashiers, nor of any of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whom does that appear to be the signature of upon the face of that note? - A. It does not appear to be the signature of the Bank, we have no cashier that signs any 5 l. notes in that name at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now going to put into your hand that uttered to Mr. Thompson? - A. This note is of the same texture, and of the very same description, as the other note.</p>
               <p>Q. By that you mean it is the same sort of paper, and the same writing? - A. It is a strip of the same paper and the same writing, and it is a facsimile of the other first note; they are both from one plate.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now going to give you the other 5 l. note uttered to Mrs. Pudephat? - A. This note is of the same kind of paper, from the same plate, but a different signature to the others, we have no cashiers in that name; they are all from the same plate; it is a forged note.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you are the engraver to the Bank of England? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take these three notes in your hand - Look at that note uttered to Mr. Rhodes? - A. It is altogether a forgery; this is a forgery also of the same kind, and in every respect; it is from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the note uttered to Mr. Thompson - Look at that which was uttered to Mrs. Pudephat? - A. This is a forgery, in every respect the same as the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Are every one from the same plate? - A. From the same plate, the same paper, and the same ink. (The notes read in Court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I must acknowledge I uttered these notes; I sent to the Bank, and Mr. Winter attended me in Newgate; I candidly told him the manner in which I got these notes; I passed three before that one to Mr. Rhodes; I knew it not to be forged. Can it be supposed that I, knowing these 5 l. notes to be forged, would have continued in the shop, when he was away from the shop a full quarter of an hour; I left on the other side of the counter, and the door open. I acknowledge I had the notes; I found the pocket-book, and I uttered the notes, but I knew them not to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness to call in your behalf? - A. I have not; with respect to the notes I found them; they did not belong to me, but through my partner's distressing me to the last shilling, I passed them; I must acknowledge my dishonesty that I did not advertise the book in which they were found; to say that I knew they were forged, I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. You are one of the constables of the London-Dock? - A. I am; Colston took from his pocket three pounds of almonds and some figs by my order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He was very sorry for what he had done he said; he had taken some to eat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Calvert's defence. I only took a few, with intent to eat them, not to have done any thing else with them.</p>
               <p>Colston's defence. I only took a few to eat, I had no idea of the quantity.</p>
               <p>Johnson's defence. A part of this warehouse was occupied to deposit goods, subject to the duties of the Excise, and under my care; the remaining part of the warehouse on the same floor, was appropriated for housing of fruit of various kinds; this fruit was exposed to view, and thirty or forty people, in the course of the day, came in to examine, and participate as they thought proper; the servants of the warehouse were in the warehouse from the moment it was unlocked to the time it was locked up, and I never heard them take the least exception; that not being any concern of mine, I did not think it necessary while there were people there who had the care of them; nor did I interfere in any respect whatever any farther than my own duty compelled me, and I am sure that my superiors will say, that in every thing where I have acted under them, I have ever given a faithful account of the trust they have been pleased to repose in me; with respect to the business that is now depending before the Court, I had no knowledge whatever when it took place, nor was I in the least apprized of it till six o'clock in the evening; I had locked up the warehouse, and was going to the Excise-office in Thames-street to finish my business of the day, which I was obliged to do, when I was informed at the gate of the London Dock what had occurred, and that I must be detained, in consequence of being in the warehouse at the time; I walked about the Dock, and enquired of some of the gentlemen in the most exalted stations, thinking they could inform me for what cause I was in detention, and none of them could inform me. If they had suspected any unwarrantable power of that kind, they knew where I was; instead of which, an hour and a half elapsed before I knew any thing of it; and then I was about to leave the premises. They did not think it was necessary to search me, nor was I searched, till I was conveyed to the Police office, when the Magistrate desired me to do it. There was nothing found on me belonging to these warehouses but the book and the key of the warehouse, and what I could call my own; if there had, they no doubt would have mentioned it. I am now brought into this Court, charged with being accessary to what I know not, was not, nor never did I, on my own account, dare to take a liberty of the kind, either within the walls of the London Dock, or any other part, with the property that was committed to my care. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I have that consolation that there is no misconduct whatever can be attached on my part; at least, I trust so; as such I humbly leave my case to the consideration of the Judge and the Jury.</p>
               <p>Johnson called four witnesses, Colston four, and Calvert one, who gave them a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I was married to the deceased on Oct. 16, 1787, and she went from me on the King's birth-day last to cohabit with the prisoner; on last Tuesday morning, between three and four o'clock, she came to my watch-box (I am a watchman,) she asked me if I had seen the prisoner; she said she would go home, signifying to the prisoner's house, and I saw no more of her that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her afterwards? - A. On the same day she was with me in <placeName id="t18050529-38-crimeloc208">Little Chesterfield-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was he sober, or how? - A. He was not sober, nor much advanced in liquor; he said he would serve me the same, or any body that seemed to take her part.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was this? - A. I believe it was past twelve; then the deceased came out of the tap-room with me, and said she was very hungry, she said she would get something to eat; then we went from the Globe to the Nottingham Arms; I believe it was near three o'clock when we went away from there; we had some eggs and two pints of beer there, and at the Globe we had a pint of ale between three of us; we went home from the Nottingham Arms about three o'clock; I saw what temper the prisoner was in; I advised her to stay with me till his passion was over; I persuaded her to lay down, I being a watchman, and having been up all night.</p>
               <p>Q. She was perfectly sober, was not she? - A. Yes, she was sober; we went to-bed at near four o'clock in the afternoon; I went to sleep directly, I was tired, I had had no rest from the Saturday till the Tuesday; about half past six, or near seven o'clock, I awoke by a violent shriek, and when I looked up I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to-bed did you fasten your door? - A. I locked it, and by the request of the deceased I put the key on the table, in case the prisoner came, that he should not come in; when I awoke by the shriek, I observed the prisoner standing by my bed-side, on the side my wife laid; I observed the prisoner standing in this attitude (in a boxing posture) over the deceased; I immediately jumped up, and seized him; we had a great scuffle, and we fell down two or three times together in the fire-place, and once across the foot of the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife in bed at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of you fall, so as to fall upon her? - A. We both fell down on the floor together; I saw the complexion of the deceased change, and her lips turn black; the moment I got up I called for the people to come in, and to get medical assistance (the door being open,) and for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you called where was the prisoner? - A. Seated in a chair, he never attempted to escape; in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, the surgeon came; he ordered a pail of boiling water, and what he thought necessary; the prisoner asked the surgeon if she was dead, and he said, yes; I bathed her feet with hot water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the surgeon inquire whether any body had struck the deceased? - A. I do not recollect, I was in such trouble then; after this the peace-officer came, and secured us both.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time do you recollect whether any blow was given to the deceased? - A. Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased, after you awoke, explain to you, or in the hearing of the prisoner, what was the occasion of her shriek? - A. She neither so much as sighed or breathed after I awoke.</p>
               <p>- MOTT sworn. - I am a surgeon: On Tuesday, the 28th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was called by two women, who are witnesses in Court, to go to the deceased, understanding from them the deceased had received some injury. When I came into the room, I saw the deceased lying on the outside of the bed; on examining the body, I found little or no signs of life; I bled the deceased in the neck; I attempted to bleed her in the arm and on the temple, but without success; I directed her legs to be bathed in warm water, but without effect, the deceased being too far gone to be recovered by the means that I made use of; I then inquired what had been done, by the people standing at the door, or how the deceased came by her death. The prisoner was sitting in the chair near the window; I asked the husband, in the hearing of the prisoner, whether the woman had been struck; the husband said he had done it, pointing to the prisoner, who was sitting in the chair; I then asked the prisoner whether he had struck her; he said, O yes, I have done it, striking his forehead with his hand; I asked him where he had struck her; he said, Oh! I know nothing about it, waving his hands; I then said, you must secure this man, and send for a constable; he said, Oh, certainly I will be secured, and several expressions of the same effect; I then left the house, he made no attempt to escape. In about three quarters of an hour I was sent for again by one of the officers of Bow-street, they imagined she was alive; I examined her, but found no symptoms of life. On Wednesday, by the direction of Mr. Lee, the Magistrate, I opened the body, although I found no marks of violence on the exterior of the body, but on opening the cavity of the chest I found abundant marks of bruises or concussion; there was extraversated blood in the minute vessels of the parts in the cavity of the chest; I found no other marks of violence within the body but that, and from that I suspected there had been some injury done to some more vital part; I then proceeded to examine the head; I opened the head, and found a great deal of blood again, extraversated over the surface of the brain, which I do imagine to be the immediate cause of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290027"/>her death - I do believe that the blood found on the surface of the brain was owing to the violence done to her chest - I do believe a blow may be so given as to cause death, although no external marks should appear: the parts being covered by blankets and a sheet, the injury might have been sufficient to destroy the woman's life, without these appearances on the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blow appear to have been given? - A. On the right side of her breast; I found no outward marks, I found evident marks of injury within; the blow given on the side, occasioned a violent spasm of the heart, or more important organs of life, that would be sufficient to force the blood so upon the vessels of the brain, as to produce the appearances that were seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are of opinion that the blow on the breast caused that extraversated blood on the brain, and that blow was the cause of her death? - A Certainly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is not possible that a person awoke from her sleep by the breaking in of the door, and finding a man standing by the bed-side, might not that surprize occasion the appearances in the head as you found in that head? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if they might, what should you have said was the cause of her death? - A. I then should have said that the appearances on the brain was the cause of her death from sudden fright, or sudden surprize; I should have considered these symptoms sufficient to produce death, but then I cannot account for the symptoms which appear on the side; stating it in the light in which your Lordship has stated it, I should have considered those symptoms sufficient, had I not found those which I had seen in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you say, the symptoms in her head were the immediate cause of her death? - A. They were the immediate cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard of a case of two persons fighting, and one dying in the fight, yet it appearing most probable, and to a degree of certainty, that that death was not occasioned by a blow, but through an apoplectic fit? - A. I have heard of such a case; I do not believe the deceased to be subject to that disease, she being of a thin habit of body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do no persons of a thin habit of body die of an apoplexy? - A. We are taught to believe that a person of a full habit of body is more apt, and persons of a thin habit of body seldom if ever die of an apoplexy, except they labour under some disease, as in most inveterate cases of scurvy they may die of an apoplexy, but not in a healthy state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Whether or no she might not have so laid on the bed, that trending upon her, or falling upon her, might not have the same effect as a blow? - A. Certainly.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You live in the same house with the husband of the deceased? - A. Yes; I had just come home from work, I had sent my little girl down for a light; the prisoner at the bar put his head into my room, and asked me which was Smith's room; I pointed to Smith's room-door, upon which the prisoner knocked very loud at it; I did not hear any answer returned; he cried out, Smith, Smith, get up and come out, if not, I will come in, I will break the door open; he pushed the door open with both his hands; the first thing that I heard was a very heavy fall, that shook all the things in my room; I looked into Smith's room, and Smith and he were fighting; he was under the prisoner. I called my landlady; she asked the prisoner what had brought him there, he had broke all her crockery; I never saw the woman till I saw her dead; the prisoner said if she was dying, he would die with her; he went to the bed, and kissed her; he was not sober when he went into the room, but he was sober when he knew the woman was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Your room is just opposite to their's? - A. There is nothing between the two rooms but the wainscoting.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could hear any noise in that room? - A. I could indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And the first noise you heard was like something falling down? - A. It was; I heard the crockery break, then I went and saw them fighting.</p>
               <p>- DUDLEY sworn. - Q. You are the owner of this house, in which the deceased's husband lived in? - A. Yes, when I went up I saw the two men scuffling, the table was overturned, and the crockery was all broken; they were both from the bed when I saw them; I saw a woman lying on the bed; Smith said it was his wife; he went to the bed side, and said, he has killed her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The moment I went into the door I enquired of the woman that lived on the same floor, whether they were at home or not; the little girl came by with a candle a-light at the present time; I took the candle and perceived them lying together on the bed, through the hole of the door; I knocked and called for them to open the door, and they neither of them spoke; immediately I pushed the door open; the deceased saw me coming into the room, and she made a bit of an alarm to her husband; he jumped up immediately on the bed, and immediately struck at me; as soon as he got off the bed we got into a skirmish, and in our scuffling we both fell athwart the woman; we had several ups and downs in the room; no further I have to say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

He said he carried meat about the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did it turn out to be? - A. Fifty-two pounds weight of salt; he told me he bought it at Mr. Hawkins's, in Bishopsgate-street, and a young man in the shop served him; I asked him if he should know the young man again; he said he should; I lodged the prisoner in the watch-house, and went to Mr. Hawkins's, and brought the young man with me; I asked the prisoner if that was the young man who served him with the salt; he said, yes; the young man said he did not serve him with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to be of the same quality as that in the bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the warehouse? - A. Yes, two bags of salt that were brought there and filled with salt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. I take it for granted if there were any holes in the sack, the salt would fall on the man's trowsers, and different parts of him, he carrying of it: are you sure that that on his knees was of the same quality as that which was inside of the bag? - A. The quantity was so little I could not be certain.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the day I was taken I had been a portering for a man of the name of John Brown, who lived at the upper end of Brick-lane; he had a sack that he used to keep salt in; he told me to sew the sack about the bacon; the sack was nearly full of salt, it clung to my trowsers; I carried it on my shoulders till I went to Billingsgate with it; and after I came back, I bought a quartern of salt at Hawkins's; I gave the bag to that boy; he had a sack of salt, some of it was sewed up with this bacon, and the remaining part was put in my bag; I was coming home with this sack of salt when this gentleman took me in Somerset-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes; the prisoner was a servant and a waiter; I hired him as a servant, to do every thing that I told him to do; if I ordered him to brush me a pair of shoes, and he refused to do it, I would have discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been a servant and a waiter? - A. I believe a twelvemonth last March.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information did you call to your assistance Mr. Holdsworth? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of that and Mr. Holdsworth, mark any money? - A. One seven-shilling piece, one dollar, a half-crown, five shillings, and a sixpence; I marked them on Saturday, the 25th of May, and went in the evening to the Mansion-house and gave it to Mr. Holdsworth: On Sunday I left my house at one o'clock, and my sister went with me; I returned about five minutes before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that was received, where was it put? - A. In a little bowl that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other waiter but the prisoner? - A. A porter: On Sundays he takes money when the other is at dinner; when I returned home I turned out all the money that was in that bowl into a half-pint bason; before I went out in the morning I counted out five guineas in small change; I took the half-pint bason with the money up stairs; I counted the money over twice; my first object was to know what was taken; I counted out the five guineas that was left: On the second time of going up stairs I missed the dollar and the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen that marked dollar and the sixpence? - A. Yes, I knew it to be the same that I had marked; I took the prisoner up stairs with the Marshal into my room; he said he was honest, and he was very much surprized that he was charged with a theft; he suffered himself to be searched; he said the sixpence was given to him, and he had given the dollar to his sister that evening; she wanted one, and he had put in five shillings for it; I said to him, I shall soon convince you of that; there is no more than one shilling in the bowl that I had marked and put in the bowl in the morning; I went with the officer to his sister, and she gave the dollar to the officer in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290031"/>presence; I knew it to be the same that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner was your waiter and your servant; if he had refused to have brushed your shoes you would have discharged him? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay taxes for your servants - Do you pay for him as a waiter or servant? - A. A waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. You would rather pay one guinea instead of two; now we find what sort of a servant he was - Did he pay you or you him? - A. He.</p>
               <p>Q. How much a year did he pay you for being your waiter? - A. He pays me 120 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. And finds himself in every thing - A. Yes, he finds himself in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pays you for the honour of blacking your shoes 120 l. a year - You marked a dollar and some money of your own, and gave it to Mr. Holdsworth? - A I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came home at night, you did did not look into the bowl and count it; you put it into a half-pint bason and went up stairs? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were anxious to know whether you had been robbed, and like a candid and respectable man you called and said to the prisoner, give me an account? - A. He could not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that to be an answer to my question, or do you think I am so silly as to take it - Did you when you came home, and before you charged him with any theft whatever, did you ask him what money he received in the course of that day, and put it down? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any question whatever, as to the money he had received that day, till you had put him into Mr. Holdsworth's custody? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This man was entrusted to receive money and give change, was he not, from this bowl? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What money he received from a customer, if he wanted change he would resort to the bowl for change? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you say, I have lost five shillings to day; what money have you received, what money have you given in change - A. I left out five shillings in the morning, and I put in half a guinea; this was about eleven o'clock at noon I made up this money; I did not come down stairs till one and I found the five shillings safe.</p>
               <p>Q. This was one o'clock - How many people came into your house from one o'clock till nine o'clock you cannot tell - Was there any gold there? - A. He had changed a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. In addition to the five guineas? - A. He had changed a one pound note from the bason.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you went out, how much money did you leave? - A. Five guineas, in half guineas, seven shilling pieces, dollars, half-crowns, and shillings and sixpences, in the bason.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home how much money was there in the whole? - A. When I came home I counted one pound seven shillings, and five shillings of this money was taken before I left the house, and one pound I apprehend was spent by Mr. Holdsworth's party.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot know what money was paid; you found an addition to your money of one pound seven shillings, and what was given in change for that one pound seven shillings you do not know? - A. There were two 1 l. notes he had given change for; one was changed while I was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOLDSWORTH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the City Marshal? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Lewis deliver any marked money to you? - A. He did, on Saturday evening, a 7-shilling piece, a dollar, a sixpence, a half-crown, and 5 s. I directed Tipper and Stanton to to be there; I gave Tipper a seven-shilling piece and 3 s. and Stanton had the dollar and the sixpence; when Mr. Lewis was up stairs, and the prisoner with him, I told the prisoner that he had received a dollar; he admitted it; he said he had put five shillings in the bowl in lieu of it; he had given the dollar to his sister; I desired him to empty his pocket, in doing which he threw out three sixpences; one of the three was one I had received from Mr. Lewis, and another of the sixpences was a sixpence I gave to him to take three pence out; he said that the sixpence that was given to him marked, was the sixpence that I gave to him to take three pence out, that was not so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When the prisoner was asked about the dollar, he said it is very true, his sister wanted the dollar of him, and he put five shillings in the bowl for it, the value of more than twenty shillings was in the bowl? - A. The identical money was all in the bowl but the dollar and the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. A waiter will find it more convenient to have small change in his bowl than large - He had put five shillings in the bowl, in lieu of the dollar? - A. I think it is more handy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What had you? - A. A bottle of wine four shillings and sixpence, and afterwards a pint of wine two shillings and three pence; I gave the prisoner three pence.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q.(To Prosecutor.) When you charged the prisoner with the dollar, did he not say he had given you five shillings in lieu of it? - A. Yes; in looking over my money there was only one shilling that had my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not probable, in consequence of much money being taken, that these identical shillings might have been given to customers in change? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Court. You have hit the bird in the eye; he might have given three or four of the shillings when they came for change.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned home, in what situation did you find your house? - A. I found my door open and my drawers had been broke open, and all my money taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the lock of your door had been picked that goes into the alley? - A. Not the outer door that goes into the alley; that door was open, and so was my parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left that door locked when you went out next the alley? - A. No, I left that door open, on account of my lodgers going up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out did you leave any of your lodgers in the house? - A. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd; they were in the house the whole of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there when you returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the outer door open - What was the next observation that you made? - A. The passage door was open and my parlour door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your parlour door open? - A. I double locked it, the lock had been picked, the door had not been damaged at all.</p>
               <p>Q. On going into the room did you miss any thing? - A. I lost all the money I had in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put that money? - A. I had locked it up in a drawer belonging to a chest of drawers in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there many drawers belonging to it? - A. It has three large drawers, and two little ones.</p>
               <p>Q. In which of these drawers was your money? - A. In one of the upper little drawers; they went into the shop, and took a basket of copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what sort of money it was that you missed from this drawer? - A. I missed the guineas, the half-guineas, seven-shilling pieces, a dollar, shillings, and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the gold and silver amount to that was taken? - A. I had counted ten guineas in guineas, and twenty half-guineas, and I counted eight pounds in silver; I cannot say justly how many in shillings; I counted it on Saturday night; I had so many seven-shilling pieces, I cannot say how many, and five pounds of copper in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was it contained in the shop? - A. It was put into a half-sieve basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the parlour open into the shop? - A. Yes; on coming home I missed all that money which I counted on the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any Bank-notes? - A. Two Bank-notes of one pound each; they were in the drawer with the silver in a decanter stand; the gold part of it was in a green silk purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the prisoners - look at either of them? - A. I know neither of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that you saw either of them before? - A. No, but my daughter came home, and found one of the young men in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughter come home? - A. No; she came home before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Garland. Q. Did you not say on the last examination that you took part of the sieve out of the fire that was burnt? - A. I went up in the one pair of stairs with Mr. Ray, and there I saw on the fire the appearance of a basket that had been burnt there, and it struck me that that was the basket that my copper and my money was in; I only thought so, I could not swear to ashes you know; that I mentioned at the Office, but not here.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he stay then, that you might know him again? - A. Not long; he had a light coat on and the same buttons then as he has now, and his hat was off when he came out of the room; I did not see any more of him when he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. What next did you see? - A. Then Mr. Kendrick came, and then he collared that young man, Garland; it was a very little time after he came from the parlour door that I screamed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on Sunday, the 28th of April, any thing at or near Mrs. Curtis's door? - A. I was at home on the Sunday evening, and Mrs. Curtis's little girl came and called to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A. I cannot justly say, it might be about eight o'clock; Mrs. Curtis's little girl asked me whether her mother was come home; I told the little girl I did not know that she was out; she said her mother had been out to dine, and she had come home and found all the doors open; I told the little girl to get a light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, was it? - A. It was near dark, and Mrs. Williams came into the garden to get some stockings and things she had been hanging out there in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose garden? - A. Mrs. Curtis's garden; and the little girl asked Mrs. Williams to go with her to the door to see whether they could see any body in the house, or about it; I was informed that they looked in at the door, but saw no person; I went up to my own room again; in or about five minutes afterwards, Mrs. Curtis's little girl cried out very loudly; I ran down, and seized a person in the passage close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person? - A. The prisoner, Garland, in the light coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it exactly that you seized him in the passage, how near to Mrs. Curtis's door? - A. About two yards in the short passage that leads into the long passage which goes up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him two yards, you say, from the door? - A. Not more than two yards from the door; he said, I do not look like a thief, come to the light.</p>
               <p>Q. You had done something, or said something, before that? - A. I had seized him by the collar; then he said, I do not look like a thief, come to the light; he said that I should know him again; he pulled off his hat, and stood in this manner (witness holding his head up,) quite upright, facing me so; I did not see him have any bundle, or any thing of that sort; he referred me to Mr. Faulkner for his character; he said he was well known in the neighbourhood of Chiswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man with him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had no bundle with him? - A. No bundle at all to appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body search him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to search him? - A. I cannot tell you; but the reason why I suffered him to go away was, by seeing he was a genteel young fellow, and his saying he was no thief, and the like of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you let him go away? - A. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept him about ten minutes, and then let him go? - A. Yes, in the presence of several people in the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came afterwards to be apprehended? - A. No.</p>

The prisoner ran out after me, and took me into that same public-house he came out of; I think the publican's name is Harrison; we had some rum or brandy and water together at this public-house; I told him I was going to see a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you can be sure, from what you can recollect, that on the 28th of April, you were with him at half after eight, or any other time? - A. It must be between that and a quarter before nine o'clock; he was with me from that time till half after nine o'clock, and we had two shillings-worth of brandy and water together, and smoked our pipes together.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I do not live up at Shoreditch church; I live in Long-alley, near Primrose-street.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hanson.) How far is that from Whitecross-street? - A. Primrose-street is a little way from Whitecross-street, just through Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Long-alley - How far is Long-alley from where you were with him that evening? - A. It is not above a quarter of a mile; I do not think it is a quarter of a mile to it, it is not above.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember what clothes I had on? - A. A brown coat, the under coat I believe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This drab coat was in pledge at the time, at Mr. Lucock's, in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You may call any body to prove it? - A. I have not got any body to prove that at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking them? - A. He was a lodger, therefore I suspected him; I sent to the different pawnbrokers, and found four shirts at Mr. Perkins's and two at Mr. Prentice's.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you found any of your things? - A. Only my shirt hasp on the prisoner; I asked him how he came by it; he said he bought it at Brentford fair. (The shirt buckle produced by the officer and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. You never found any of the notes, nor traced them any where? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is that that is your property? - A. Yes, that is my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you venture to swear to this? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The day your box was broke open the prisoner went out with you; and when you went out the box was safe, and when you came home you found your box broke open? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What wages have you? - A. Fourteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he was committed that you borrowed a seven shilling-piece of him? - A. No, not a seven shilling-piece, it was half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of this expression, that you would thank him to lend you this money, that you were quite broke down - How long was it before this? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you and the prisoner a quarrel about a week or ten days ago? - A. Rather longer.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been beating an old man of the name of Langdon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he quarrelled with you about your beating an old man? and this breast buckle which you have sworn to, he told you he bought it at Brentford fair; he wore it publickly, and while he was sleeping in the same bed with you; and you have lost these notes you say, and you had only fourteen shillings a week? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his going along with you to Marlborough-street, with another man, and they taking their oaths, that they were not the men that robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you saw this breast-buckle in his breast, which he told you he bought at Brentford-fair, and then you had him apprehended - Is that so? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - On the 20th of May the prosecutor came to me to take the prisoner into custody; he believed he was the man who stole the property, by seeing the breast-buckle in his possession; I went to the Black Horse and asked him for the breast-buckle, which he at first refused, saying, he had bought it at Brentford-fair. I produce 4 l. 10 s. which he had in his possession, one Bank note, of 1 l. three guineas, and a seven-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Look at that Bank note - Can you read? - A. No, I cannot tell whether it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to borrow half a crown of this man while you had this money? - A. My brother was a baker; he and I had a horse, which we sold for 8 l. then I had 4 l. I had one of my own, an old mare, which I sold for four guineas; and then I had a little poney which I sold for 2 l. then I had 8 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two pounds? - A. There were ten shillings more of this money.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you borrowed the half-crown? - A. I do not exactly know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you went to the office? - A. A good bit.</p>

I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290044"/>prisoner walking about on the leads for some time; about seven o'clock in the evening he had a chisel in his hand, and was marking the lead out; sometime afterwards I saw him folding the lead up; but I did not see him take it away.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you first saw him, did you see whether the lead was all fixed to the dwelling-house? - A. I saw that the lead was all there when he was marking it out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell Mr. Stenson of it? - A. On Tuesday; the reason I did not inform Mr. Stenson at the time, I knew he was a lodger; I did not know but he might be repairing the place, not knowing his business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could not take it down four pair of stairs without being observed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been there to empty dirty water, I and every one in the house had free access there; he saw the pail, and the water that I had been emptying, and as for the noise that he heard, it was occasioned by the bed-post I had been cleaning on the top of the roof.</p>
               <p>Beale. I did see the pail, and the water had been slopped down.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) What is the value of that lead which is taken away? - A. Above a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. Only that he lodged in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life is he in? - A. I do not know; I should like to know; his wife said he was a porter to an oil-shop; he lodged with me from the 28th of last November.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken? - A. He was taken on Tuesday afternoon; he slept in the house that night; I went up on the top of the house that night; after the lead was taken off; there were several people of the house up there; there was a fire at Mr. Griffin's house, a neighbour; I went up to see fire, and the prisoner was up there then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was on the top of the house when Mr. Beale first mentioned about the lead being cut off; here is this woman swears, that she saw me marking off the lead, when there is a parapet wall runs above the roof; let alone this, her room is only three stories high, and our garret is four stories, and where this lead is torn away is under the parapet; it is impossible that she could see the lead taken from it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 25th of May I went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Compton-street, and found these articles; I produce them; here is a tin tea-pot, a candlestick-tinder-box, a screw-driver, a footman, a hand-saw, and a pen-knife. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did not know but these articles, that are now produced against me, was booked to me; the first thing that I had of my prosecutor was a wire guard; I asked him for that; and told him I thought it would suit me, to prevent the child from the fire; I agreed to give 5 s. for it; that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290046"/>previous to my having these articles; two or three days elapsed; I had then a pantheon stove, it was a second hand one, I thought it would answer my purpose, and I got the foreman of the yard to put that stove in a little order to be sent home; he did so; after I had it sent home, in looking over the book, which is my employment, I found that I was debted with that stove, the moment I saw that, I debted myself with the wire guard; after that I had a tin sauce-pan, which came to three shillings and threepence, which I believe one of the shopmen debted me with; after that I had a slop-pail, which I was debted with; then there were other things that I was debted with, and there was this footman; I had that on the Monday; my dinner hour being two o'clock, I brought it down in the front shop, and said to Mr. Selby, there are two or three articles, I will thank you to book these with them, and I will pay you for them altogether; two or three days elapsed, and I had the candlestick and tea-pot, and I brought them down in the shop in the same manner; I did not know but what I was debted with them, except the pen-knife, which is my own; he has sworn it is his; I cannot help myself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. None of our people knew that he had took any of these things.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he leave the bill with you then? - A. No, he did not; I told him that was not the bill that he shewed me before; he had shewed me one before for a thousand pounds, when I let him out of jail, I had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came on the 19th of April he shewed you another, what was that first bill? - A. It was nearly the same sort of a bill; it was three days over due, when he shewed it me in January, and that he shewed me in April was due in July to come; he told me that the bill he shewed me in January was paid; I told him I would endeavour to get the bill discounted, on condition that he would take some goods; he said he had no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the bill coming due next July? - A. Yes, he told me that he had lent the Duke of Leinster four thousand pounds in cash, and he had four of these bills; he asked me when he should call again; I told him he might call in two or three days; he called at that time and I told him my friend was not in town, he must call again in two or three days more; he called in two or three days more; I told him that I had asked my friend concerning it, and it was such a heavy bill he would not discount it; he then said he had seen a person of the name of West in great distress, and had given him half a guinea, he had formerly told me that that man had nearly ruined him by drawing bills on each other. On the 19th of April he tendered me the bill; prior to that I had sent him word, that if the bill was a just bill, I would try and get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any agreement made between you, upon what terms the bill should be discounted? - A. Two hundred pounds worth of goods, and five hundred pounds money; I told him I was afraid I should not be able to procure so much money; he said four hundred pounds money and two hundred pounds goods and the remaining four hundred pounds should be settled by two or three bills, payable at three or four month's date.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire to have the bill for any purpose? - A. I said, sir, I am going to take this bill of a thousand pounds; I should like to let a friend of mine have it, to know if the signature was right: I asked him to go with me to a friend of mine, who knew the hand-writing; he said, no, he would go and get a pint of ale, while I went to enquire about the signature of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the bill with you for that purpose? - A. He did; I went to Mr. Ogleby, and, in consequence of what Mr. Ogleby said, I went to Lord

            , and there I saw the Duke's daughter; I believe she is about eighteen years old; she said that was never her father's writing; after that I went to the Police office and saw Mr. Conant; in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290050"/>brought into the office; I remained there till he came; I produce the bill, it has been in my keeping ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of January did you know him to be in confinement? - A. Yes, I was a creditor to a bill of thirty pounds, he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he set at liberty on paying you your whole demand? - A. Partly; I took ten pounds, and the custody was about four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You had entered an action upon him? - A. A detainer was lodged, while he was in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Was that a debt of his own, payable by him, or any body else? - A. A bill of his acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. In January he was let out of the Fleet; this bill was presented to you after that; you knew his situation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the bill was presented, you went into a negociation, after you knew that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And it terminated that your friend declined, therefore you gave it up? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you afterwards sent to him, not he to you? - A. I did, I believe it might be two or three weeks afterwards; I sent to him that I thought I had a friend; I had a channel that I could get it discounted; I was going to take part gold and part money of the refiners; I am in the habit of doing it, when people will take goods out of the shop, and sometimes I deal with a Jew broker for the money; there are different channels to persons who do not keep a banker; I had the mode of doing it, and sent for him for that purpose, allowing the bill to be just; I had another reason, as well as the reason assigned; I am parish constable, and I spoke of the transaction to Mr. Conant, the Magistrate; Mr. Conant told me there was something of forged paper belonging to the Duke of Leinster, and he wished me to get it, to send to the relations of the Duke.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether having been informed that particularly from him, whether that was not the reason, and the only reason, that you sent to him to get the bill? - A. No, it was not; my reasons were more than one; and if the bill was just the man should have the money, he should have the bill discounted; if not, as I was a parish constable, the man might be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been under any embarrassments yourself? - A. I have been here, as many an innocent honest man before, about thirteen years ago; a poor man came to me one morning, a tailor, who made my clothes, and said he had taken an old gold watch of a foreigner; I was a journeyman then, and he wished to make money of part of it; I told him the best mode would be to sell the case, and have a metal case for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. The man from whom you had the watch was indicted-were you? - A. I went voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you sent to prison? - A. I certainly was sent to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. And certainly indicted, and certainly tried at the bar? -</p>
               <p>- CLEATHEROW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You live with the last witness? - A. I do, as a shopman and workman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 19th of April, do you recollect his coming to Mr. Sargeant's house? - A. I do, about ten o'clock, and there was some conversation about a bill; the prisoner brought the bill, for Mr. Sargeant to discount it for him; the prisoner produced the bill; Mr. Sargeant said he would wish to go to Mr. Ogleby, to see whether the bill was right or not; Mr. Sargeant said he would go to a friend and asked the prisoner if he chose to go with him: he refused it, and said he had walked a good way that morning. that he had come from Hampstead or Highgate, and was very dry; Mr. Sargeant told him, if he did not chuse to go with him, he would find a house in the street that sold good ale; Mr. Sargeant went, and the prisoner said he could drink a pint of ale, he would go and have it while Mr. Sargeant was out; he went out. The prisoner returned first, and Mr. Sargeant returned afterwards; Mr. Sargeant said he was not fully satisfied, he would go to another friend; Mr. Sargeant left the house a second time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did the prisoner stay after Mr. Sargeant went out the second time? - A. Till the officer fetched him; about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity, if he chose, to have gone away; there was nobody to hold him? - A.Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see him? - A. On the 4th of April; he did not call on me, I saw him at Garraway's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you how he came by that bill? - A. He did; I was afraid it came from a money broker; he said it was for goods sold to the Duke of Leinster, that they were delivered to

            ; I produced the letter then, and compared it in Hitchin's presence; the copy of the bill in the letter corresponded with the bill; I have got that letter about me; I asked him about that bill particularly; he having spoken to Mr. Hurd, he rather declined entering into the particulars of the other bills, which were not become due, (the bill read in Court.) I told him, before I could consider it a proper claim, it was necessary that he should give me the particulars of the consideration given for the bill; - he stated that he was entirely ignorant as to the purpose for which the money was borrowed; he said that 2000 l. were paid to the Duke on the day of the date of the bills, at the York coffee-house, in St. James's-street, in the presence of Davenport Sedley, and others, in bank-notes of two thousand pounds; he did not say who the other persons were, and he declined saying any thing about the bills but that over due; this was on February, the others were not due.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In point of fact you declined paying the first bill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give any hopes of paying the other bills? - A. None; I then gave positive answer at that time, and refused paying that bill till further satisfactory proof was given.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q In point of fact have any one of these bills been paid by the executors? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have known it? - A. I think I should.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You transact business for them? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>GENERAL OGLEBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Give me leave, sir, to ask you where you live? - A. At Grosvenor-place in town, and at Wimbledon in the country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I do not know, sir, whether you are interested in the personal estate? - A. Not in the personal estate; in the real estate, by my wife's jointure, to the amount of three thousand a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you are interested contingently? - A. It is precisely so, upon the charge of the land; no other way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. You married the Dutchess Dowager of Leinster, whose jointure is paid out of this estate; you were of course acquainted with the late Duke of Leinster? - A. Yes, intimately; he was at my house the day before he left London.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so obliging as to look at that bill (witness looking at the bill) Do you believe the signature, Leinster, to be the signature of the late Duke of Leinster? - A. I really think it is not the Duke's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const Q. Are you acquainted with the Dukes's hand-writing, so as to say you have no doubt of it? - A. I cannot say that I have; yet, I could not say that it is impossible that the Duke of Leinster wrote that, because a man may not write like himself at all times - In my own opinion it has not been written by him, I have reasons for thinking so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Look at that, that is the Duke's writing? - A. Certainly (a letter shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. That is prior to this? - A. If I were to go into the difference, I could point them out, if you desire it; if you press me I will; the Duke of Leinster, whenever he wrote a letter, he never 
               <persName id="t18050529-71-person641">drew</persName>
             a line under that signature; when he wrote a a frank, he did; I have every reason to believe that this is not his hand-writing; the two last letters of his name were generally written in a looser character, and rather sloping, and never finished.</p>
               <p>GENERAL ORMSBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Do you remember, in consequence of an application being made to you, going to Tindal-place? - A. I went to Tindal-place, Islington.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of appearance did that house exhibit? - A. The house is in a crescent, a short row;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290052"/>I think it is No. 16; when Mr. Hitchin's letter was sent to me by Lord

            , and knowing the number of the house, I dismounted and knocked at the door; there came out a woman; I asked if that was Mr. Hitchen's dwelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that letter, and see whether that is the letter by which you went to the house? - A. This is the letter which instructed me where to go. I thought it was 16, it is 13.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of appearance had the house? - A. The woman opened the door, and I asked her if she belonged to him; she said, I am his wife, will you walk in; I said by all means; she shewed me into a little room at the right hand, there I saw four girls, working at the needle; when I got into the room, I asked the woman for Mr. Hitchin; she said he was not at home; from the general appearance of the house it did not appear to be inhabited by any body of wealth; it was a little house; I have had the pleasure of being intimate with the Duke of Leinster from the year 1774; I was very intimate with him till the time he left Dublin; he was a particular friend of mine indeed; I left Ireland the beginning of last November; I had many conversations with him after he returned to Ireland: he died in October. He told me in Ireland that he rated his living; he confined himself to six thousand a year, and of late years his habits of living were much more moderate than they had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so familiarly acquainted with his hand-writing? - A. I do know as much about his hand-writing as I do about my own; I cannot know my own better than I do his; I was in the habit of corresponding with him; I have seen him write very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Leinster on that bill - Having looked at it carefully, is it your opinion that it is the Dukes's hand-writing; I do verily believe that it is not the hand-writing of the Duke; I cannot swear that it is not, but I verily believe, upon my oath, that it is not the hand-writing of the Duke; the prisoner at the bar shewed me another bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The letter which you looked at referred you to the house at Islington? - A. Yes, it was nearly the centre house of the Crescent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write him any note? - A. I was going to relate - I asked her when she thought he would be at home; I said, madam, give me a pen and ink; I wrote a note, and, in consequence of that note, the prisoner called on me the next day; I then said to him, sir, will you let me look at the bill; he took his pocket-book out and shewed me a bill, and when I saw it, I said, sir, this comes in a questionable shape; my thought was about the signature.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Did you say they were forged? - A. No, I said they were in a questionable shape. Upon that General Ross came in, and mixed with the party; this was at St. James's hotel; I believe this was in January last, when General Ross came in, I said, General Ross, this is the gentleman who says he has a demand upon the Duke of Leinster; I had a long conversation with the prisoner before General Ross came in; I said to him, I do think it right to communicate to you the conversation that I have had with this gentleman previous to your coming in; I then repeated the conversation, as my memory served me; then the prisoner began to talk to Sir

            , and in his conversation he appeared to be rather confused; in a little time after the prisoner left the room; before he left the room he said, sir, I will call upon you to-morrow, about this hour; he did call upon me the next morning, and he began charging me with severe language; he charged me with saying it was a fraud; why, said I, Mr. Hitchin, I cannot conceive that I said the word fraud; sir, said he, you did, you told me that it came in a questionable shape, and that it was a fraud; I said, upon my word, Mr. Hitchin, as well as my memory serves me, I do not think that I made use of that word; he said, sir, you did, and you embarrassed me that I did not know what I said; he still urged, and fixed it on me in so peremptory a manner, that I said, if you will have it so, put the cap on your own head, in the name of God; let it remain so. I said, how came you acquainted with the Duke; why, said he, sir, I never saw him but once, until I lent him the money; I was walking in the street, with a gentleman of the name of Sedley, and said he, he spoke to Sedley; I said, who is that; Sedley said, that is the Duke of Leinster whom I want you to lend four thousand pounds; I said, where did you lend him this money; we met at the York coffee-house, in St. James's-street; there Sedley and I went, and there I lent him the money. I said, it is a most extraordinary thing that could be advanced; not a third person mentioned in the bill to pay to the drawer a thousand pounds; if there was a third person, it would be a greater proof of its being a substantial bill; I said, it is a thing that astonishes me; I think he said he had drawn many bills of the same kind for large sums of money, and that it was the best way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time state what he had given to the Duke, by way of consideration for these bills? - A. I do not know any further than he paid him the money at the coffee-house all at one time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. In 1797, I commenced the corn and cheese trade, near Namptwich, in Cheshire. I imported a great quantity of corn from America and Holland, and various other places. I was very fortunate for a considerable time, and was at last worth seven thousand pounds, when all of a sudden it happened I had the loss of a vessel from Boston, laden with goods, shipped by Wainwright and Co. by which I lost three thousand pounds; I got account of the loss of the ship Sally, before I got an account of her lading, to get her insured by the underwriters; a short time after I heard of the loss of another vessel from London; she took fire at Ramsgate; by her I lost one thousand pounds; then I had the Friendship, bound to - , which was taken by the French, by her I lost two thousand six hundred pounds. In January, 1801, this made it necessary for me to stop, and I was made a bankrupt; in May, 1801, I delivered up in money and goods, to my assignees, sixteeen shillings in the pound; the assignees and creditors that were then present signed my certificate, and told me, if the remainder of the creditors living abroad did sign my certificate, they assured me then there was no doubt but that the other creditors would all sign, I then should not be molested, or put about by any thing that might come against me; I went down to Liverpool, a distance of thirty-six miles from my assignees, in the July following, immediately after finishing my last examination, and with reliance on their saying they would not hurt me, I commenced the corn and cheese trade again; I then dealt very largely, and shipped goods to Ireland, and reshipped corn to Liverpool; I was then successful and very well respected, and could have had credit to a great amount; at last I had a malicious person, who told my new creditors that I was a bankrupt, and that my former assignees would make me pay twenty shillings in the pound, and that the new creditors would not have a shilling in the pound; in consequence of that my new creditors fell upon me at once; most of my property was in Ireland; some at Waterford and some in Dublin; this was in the year 1802; at that time I owed five thousand one hundred and eighty-six pounds; some of my creditors, who did not know that I had been a bankrupt before, struck a new commission out against me; I was going to Ireland, in order to settle my debts for my new creditors, as I called them. On my returning from Ireland, immediately on finding myself a bankrupt, I came up to London, in the year 1802, and employed Mr. Hurd. When the second commission was superseded I applied to my creditors for a letter of licence, in order to satisfy my new creditors; after some time my creditors granted me a letter of licence for six months, in order that I might get this property; at the expiration of the six months I collected four thousand three hundred and sixty pounds fifteen shillings; during the time I was collecting this property my assignees were doing all in their power to get this property. In March, 1805, I got my certificate signed by a sufficient number of creditors, and during the time I was endeavouring to get my certificate signed, I did not wish to be squandering the four thousand three hundred and fifty pounds. I wished to keep it, in order to satisfy my new creditors when I got my certificate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290054"/>Court. Q. If I understand you right, you wanted to employ this money so as to have something to live on? - A. Yes, if I could do it without the knowledge of the assignees, I living in London; in consequence of that, at the time of the great loss of the West-India fleet, which you all must know was in April 1804, I thought it very possible to get five or six hundred pounds by purchasing a ship for that trade; I went down to Hull in May 1804, and ordered Messrs. Callendart to look out a ship, and let me know the price; they did look out one, which was the Thomas and Sally, the property of one Gledow (I have got the letter in Court,) I ordered him to buy her for four thousand three hundred and fifty pounds, the price that was agreed on. The price of vessels taking a rapid advance, made them run off from the bargain; they were to new sheath her, which they declining to do, made about five hundred pounds difference; the bargain broke off intirely. On my coming up to London in the beginning of June, I met with a gentleman of the name of Sedley, who had been introduced to me about half a year before by a gentleman in a coffee-house, whom I am now sorry to hear is a man of a very dishonest character. This Sedley is a gentleman who forces his conversation upon people, and he is in all appearance a gentleman-like man; he has a great deal to say for himself, and very seducing ways with him; we entered into conversation together, and our conversation led to the subject of the purchasing of the ship that I had been making at Hull; he said that he thought I might make more of the money, if I would be led by him, and more secret for myself; he invited me to his house, which made a respectable appearance indeed; he had two daughters elegantly dressed, and several gentlemen in the room. During the conversation he expressed himself to be acquainted with almost every great person in the kingdom - that he was acquainted with the Duke of Wexford, and the Duke of Leinster; he also shewed me letters from a number of them; he told me that the Duke of Wexford had applied to him for the loan of five thousand pounds; I told him if he was a good personal security, I should have no objection; I went with Sedley, according to appointment, to the hotel, the right hand going up St. James's-street; his Grace was then engaged in business we were informed, by whom he was sure to get supplied. When we came out of the hotel, Sedley and I stood at the door a few minutes, and a gentleman passed by, whom Sedley immediately saluted; he said to me, that is the Duke of Leinster, and if he is now wanting of money, we cannot possibly have a better security under heaven; he said, shall I ask him; I replied I had no objection, and he followed him immediately. The Duke, I, and Sedley, appointed to meet on the Monday following, on the 9th of July, at the York coffee-house in that street; on Monday, the 9th of July, previous to our meeting the Duke at the York coffee-house, Sedley called upon me at my lodgings in Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields; he said he came to know if I had made any inquiry respecting the Duke, and whether I would advance the money to the Duke; I told him I had made my inquiries, and that I would advance the Duke two or three thousand pounds. Soon after we arrived at the York coffee-house, at two o'clock, the Duke made his appearance at the York coffee-house, and after some conversation I agreed to lend the Duke four thousand pounds at six, eight, ten, and twelve months date; I desired Sedley to walk out of the room, in order that I might know what I was to have for the loan of four thousand pounds; the Duke agreed to give me five thousand pounds for the loan of it; I 
               <persName id="t18050529-71-person647">drew</persName>
             the four bills in question, and the Duke accepted them in the presence of this Sedley. Sedley having returned to me, I 
               <persName id="t18050529-71-person648">drew</persName>
             the four bills in the presence of this Sedley, and paid two thousand pounds, and the Duke directed me to call at Mrs. Howard's on the 13th; I was not prepared; I wrote a note, desiring his Grace to meet me at my house in two or three days, in order that he might receive the balance; his Grace was punctual to that appointment, and received the remainder, one thousand five hundred pounds, at my lodgings in Goodman's-field. Previous to my lending the Duke the four thousand pounds, Sedley assured me, that if I wanted money, he would get a gentleman or two, or a thousand, that would discount a bill at any time; he never did; in consequence of which we quarrelled very frequently, for I not only parted with all the money I had to the Duke, but troubled my friends to get the money discounted at what we call common interest. By Sedley disappointing me, I got arrested, and in a very short space there were eight hundred pounds against me; there were two writs against me besides, which you have heard in Court, that the officer took my word for, besides all the other actions. I had got these bills, and no person would discount them for me, and my friends whom I have here would not bail me; I owed better than five thousand pounds; all this while I had never satisfied my new creditors; my friends said it was no use to bail me, my other creditors might do the same, and I might be in prison all my life-time for my new debts; at the same time I had no doubt; I rested fully assured it was the Duke of Leinster who had accepted these bills, and I was convinced in my own mind that these bills would be paid when they became due; thus I buoyed myself up in the best manner I could. In this distressed situation I was cast into Newgate; I remained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290055"/>there till the 11th of January, when Sedley called upon me very frequently, and promised that he would get these bills discounted for me, which, on the contrary, he never did. When I was in the Fleet, finding by the London papers that his Grace was dead, and that he died in Ireland on the 20th of October, I wrote to Mr. Berrisford, the banker, in Dublin, and informed him that I had four bills of exchange, for which I had accommodated the late Duke of Leinster with money for them; they replied to my letter, as I was a stranger to them, they would thank me for a reference. On the 16th of January, I presented the bill at Thomas's hotel, where it was payable; the book-keeper informed me that they had no orders whatever; they informed me that Lord

I then called on Mr. Sargeant, in Jermyn-street; I shewed him the bill, and asked him if he knew of a notary who lived in that neighbourhood; he did tell me of one, but I did not go; Mr. Sargeant informed me that he worked for some of the family. On the next morning I received a letter from Mr. Ogleby's servant, saying that Lord Henry was either executor or guardian to the young Duke; I called several times on Lord Henry Fitzgerald at Miller's hotel, Jermyn-street, before I could have an interview with his Lordship. At length I saw him; I gave his Lordship the bill, and told him my business; he desired me to give him the particulars of the bill, as his solicitor was in Ireland on the business; I went home, and wrote a copy of the four bills and the transaction, and left them with the landlord of Miller's hotel. In a few days afterwards I wrote again to his Lordship, and then Lieutenant-general Ormsby called at my house, where I have lived ever since I came up to London, for better than three years.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to say you lived in Goodman's-fields? - A. Yes, in winter-time, it is too far to go to Islington, and then I live in the City. General

             left a note. I waited on him the next morning, in consequence of his saying it came in a questionable shape, and I being an innocent person, not supposing but it was a regular transaction with me and the Duke, it preyed on my feelings. I called the next morning to know what he meant by that expression, and if he did not say it was a fraud, it was the same thing as a fraud, as I had given a consideration for the bills. I called on my solicitor, Mr. Hurd, and desired him to write to Lord

             for the demand, which he did. I wrote to Lord Henry, desiring to know who was the solicitor employed in Ireland; I received a letter, and I waited on Mr. Trebeck, and my solicitor went along with me, as Mr. Trebeck did not wish to ask me any questions alone; he was not at home; the next morning, as I was going, I met Mr. Trebeck, and he informed me that the executors could not pay me till they were better informed; I met Mr. Trebeck in March, I think it was in Oxford-street. I desired my solicitor, on the very day I met Mr. Trebeck, to take out a writ to recover this money, and told him that I had a very able body of people to contend with, as I was informed by General Ormsby that he meant to file a bill against me to prove the hand-writing; I had entered my action in the Court of Common Pleas, on the 13th of March; I desired Mr. Hurd to retain three Counsel - one in the Common Pleas, one in the Chancery, and one in the Exchequer, being confident that I should have to prove the value given for the bills, and the hand-writing. I left the bill along with a friend of mine at Liverpool; I was offered several times eight hundred and nine hundred pounds for it; I would not take the money, not doubting the validity of the bill; I came up to London, and offered it to Mr. Sargeant; if I could have disposed of it by a trifling loss, I would; he said he should see his friend, and if I would call again, he would inform me. I did call again; he gave me an answer that he had seen his friend, and that his friend could not discount the bill, for cash was very scarce, even for bankers' bills; he went to Sedley after that, to know where I lived; Mr. Sedley wrote a letter to me by Mr. Sargeant's desire, saying that Mr. Sargeant would give eight hundred pounds, and two hundred pounds in goods for the bill. I thought if I could dispose of the bill to keep quiet a few fractious creditors, I would; I went to Mr. Sargeant, and I gave him the bill, I knew he was acquainted with the family; I went to a public-house to get a pint of ale, I had walked a long way that morning; he returned, and took me into a little room; he gave me a glass of liquor of some kind; he said, you had better tell me what is the lowest money you will take; I said I wanted to dispose of this bill to quiet a small number of my refractory creditors; he then said he would give me nine hundred and twenty pounds for the bill, and a five guinea watch for my wife; I was to pay the common interest for the nine hundred and twenty pounds; I waited in the shop till he sent the officer to take me.</p>
               <p>DAVENPORT SEDLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I have been acquainted with him eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, transact the business of lending money; you have been in that business? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290056"/>Q. Do you remember having any intercourse with the prisoner respecting money? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. The earlier part of July; in the earlier part of April, prior to then, I was applied to by the Duke of Leinster to enquire amongst my connection if I could borrow the sum of four thousand pounds; I had not an opportunity of finding out a person who had such a sum of money to lend. A similar application was made to me by the Duke of - . In consequence of that application I went along with him to the hotel, in St. James-street, to propose or offer a sum of money to a nobleman who had applied, that lived in the hotel; on our going together to the hotel, we received word from Lord - that the nobleman had been supplied with what he wanted; in consequence we left the house, and in getting out into the street we stopped some little time together to know which way each party was going; I was going over Westminster bridge, and while we were in conversation the Duke of Leinster happened to go by.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. On the 5th of July; he rather nodded and waved his hand to me, upon which I took my hat off and made a salute; I immediately observed to Mr. Hitchin that as the other nobleman, who wanted on a former occasion, had been supplied, probably the Duke would be glad to have the money; Mr. Hitchin desired me to offer it to him. I went after the Duke and mentioned the matter to him; I immediately returned with him, and in the presence of Mr. Hitchin, I mentioned the matter to the Duke. The Duke observed that he wanted money, and it would be particularly convenient to him to borrow at that time, upon which Mr. Hitchin requested a few days to consider of it, and they fixed upon a meeting four days afterwards, which was to have been at a coffee-house, almost opposite where we stood at that time, the York coffee-house in St. James's-street; we then parted, and at two o'clock, or near that hour, on the ninth of the same month, we again all met, and nobody else with us, as I can recollect, when a conversation ensued between Mr. Hitchin and the Duke; Mr. Hitchin said he had enquired about the Duke's solvency, or words to that effect, and that, as far as four thousand pounds went, he should have no objection to take his Grace's security, in bills of exchange, for he expected to convert them to that use, and that would answer his purpose equal to money, but that then he could not pay the whole amount, but should pay him down two thousand pounds, and in three or four days after he should settle the business with his Grace, in case a negociation should take place; at which moment Mr. Hitchin requested of me to retire for a few moments; I went into another part of the coffee-room while the Duke and Mr. Hitchin were in conversation, and remained till I was called to come forward, at which time Mr. Hitchin pulled out from his pocket-book four different bill-stamps, and began to draw one bill, and as soon as he had written the one thousand with an L before it, the Duke observed to him, as I am to have the balance of this money on the 13th, date your bills on that day, and come to me, I believe, to the best of my recollection, it was No. 7, Portland-road, or Portland-place; it was there he appointed Mr. Hitchin to come, and prior to my quitting the coffee-house, four bills of exchange of one thousand pounds each were drawn by Mr. Hitchin, upon the Duke of Leinster, payable at Thomas's hotel, in Berkley-square, which were dated on the thirteenth of July, to the best of my recollection, at six, eight, ten, and twelve months after date, payable to Hitchin or order, to which four bills I saw the Duke write Leinster, and he handed them over to Mr. Hitchin, upon which he took up some Bank notes that were lying by him: he counted them and turned them over, and said very well, or words to that effect; upon which Mr. Hitchin and I left the room, and went away. That is the whole sequel that I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine.. Q. You have first of all said, you have been in the habit of lending money; your business was in money transactions? - A I used to do so certainly, when I had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you had the last transaction? - A. I have not for these last seven or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably not, you have been in custody for the greater part of that time; I believe you have been in confinement for about seven months of that time? - A. I have, within that time for debt: I was brought first to Newgate, and from thence to the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and you were both together in the Fleet? - A. We certainly were; the last money transaction that I had was with a Mr. Haines, about a month or six weeks before I got arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. During your money transactions, had you ever occasion to advertise? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Never is actually wrong? - A. Not for these twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then twenty-five years ago you did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you go by? - A. No other name but my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an Irishman, are not you? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were last brought from Ireland you were brought in custody? - A. I was; it was on a fallacious charge; a charge that did not exist.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what may be the means of your subsistence? - A. From a great many sources indeed - One general source is, that I have had an intercourse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290057"/>between people who had money to lend, and people of fortune who wanted to borrow money; I have been engaged in mining down in Wales, near Pontipool; that I left off last February was a twelvemonth; I got some money by speculation in Wales; perhaps I got ten or fifteen pounds in a day; sometimes buying a load of coals, and sending them down the canal.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew who the particular man was who advanced the money? - A. I never did; I saw a parcel of Bank notes; some of two hundred pounds, which I understood to be so put into the hands of the Duke by Hitchin, and I saw the Duke of Leinster put into the hands of Hitchin bills to the amount of four thousand pounds; that he did in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody was by to see this transaction but yourself? - A. No, only us three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body had said there were other persons there, that is not true? - A. Certainly not, there were no more at the table; only us three.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
