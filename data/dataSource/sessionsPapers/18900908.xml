                  </hi>. I am the manager in London of the marine department of the National Fire and Marine Insurance Company of New Zealand, and of the South British Fire and Marine Insurance Company of New Zealand—I was also manager of the Adelaide Marine and Fire Insurance Company, which is now in liquidation—I was appointed manager in October, 1886; my office was at Jerusalem Chambers—there was an arrangement between the companies to share risks outwards to the Colonies—at the end of every month the policies of re-insurance were made, dividing the risks; that arrangement continued up to June with reference to two of the companies—the prisoner has been employed in the office for the last six years; he was head policy clerk—his duty was to write out policies, and to check them by seeing that proper stamps were on them, and that the necessary clauses were in the policies—the stamps vary according to the amount of the risk—that was with reference to outward voyage policies at any rate—this Policy of 6th April, 1890, No. 108,836A, made on behalf of the South British Company, has £3 12s. 9d. payable as stamp duty, and it bears stamps for £1 5s., £1, 2s. 6d., and 3d.—they are genuine stamps, two bearing date 15th February, 1887, and one 28th January, 1887—they have been used before on another paper—this letter of 11th April, 1890, is in the prisoner's writing—I did not authorise it to be written, and know nothing about it—I never received the £4 15 3d. mentioned here us received for spoiled stamps. (<hi rend="italic">This letter, written on paper of the South British Company, was addressed to the Comptroller of the Spoiled Stamp Department</hi>:—"This is to authorise the bearer, Mr. F. W. T, Oelrichs, to recover the spoiled stamps of the value of £4 15s. 3d. on policy forms</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080004"/>
               <p>of the above company.—Yours faithfully, S. Merriman"—my name was spelt wrongly—the prisoner was in no way authorised to recover money for spoiled stamps—I know nothing about this declaration which is signed by the prisoner; the receipt at the foot of it for £4 15s. 3d. for spoiled stamps is signed by him—the declaration is a Government form—one of the stamps is for £3 12s. 9d.—I produce thirty-one policies altogether, which have all been tampered with; there are two other policies missing; there should be thirty-three—all the other policies are in order—from eighteen of the thirty-one policies stamps have been removed, and on those eighteen other stamps have been put—upon the other thirteen of the thirty-one the stamps removed from the eighteen have been placed—about 24th June I saw two or three policies, after they were taken out of the clause-box, I believe—these two letters, dated 9th July, 1889, and 17th May, 1890, are in the prisoner's writing—they were not written by my authority—he has never accounted to me for the stamps he so claimed. (<hi rend="italic">The letter of</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th May, written on paper of the South British Company, Limited, authorised the bearer, Mr. F. W, T. Oelrichs, to recover spoiled stamps of the value of</hi> £2 <hi rend="italic">on policy forms of the company, and was signed S. Merriman</hi>)—this is a receipt for £2—the prisoner never accounted to me for it—the letter of July, 1889, refers, I believe, to £4 15s. 6d. which he has claimed—it refers to a stamp which had been obtained for a National Company's policy, No. 115,465A, dated 11th July, 1889, duty £4 15s. 6d.—it is stamped with five stamps amounting to £4 15s. 6d.—of that stamps for £4 5s. have been taken from other material; only the stamps for 10s. 6d. are right—in June this year I spoke to the prisoner about the tampering with these stamps, and said it was a very serious matter, and it would have to be investigated—he said he knew nothing about them, with the exception of one stamp, which had been pointed out to him by Mr. Wardell nearly a year ago—I said I should request him to write a letter, which I could read to the board—he wrote this letter:—"8th July, 1890—Sir—As I understand that my conduct in connection with the unfortunate stamp business is to be considered by the directors at their meeting to-morrow, I would beg that you place before them this, my explanation. As regards the occasion, about a year ago, when the faulty stamp was pointed out to me, my reason for not saying anything at the time to you was a fear of the consequences; the same having been passed by mo, my initials being on the policy, which I am very sorry for; but I still more regret that, notwithstanding increased care on my part, a stamp, but only one, passed me within the last few months, which has since been proved to be a wrong one. As an excuse I plead that I had not the slightest idea of what was being carried on, and would beg the board to take a lenient view of the matter, at the same time promising for the future to work with the utmost caution. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant, F. W. T. Oelrichs"—both the policies, with stamps value £4 5s. 3d. and £3 12s. 9d., are in the prisoner's writing, and several other of the thirty-one policies are in his writing—I believe they all bear his initials as being correct, and as having been examined—on or about 24th June I received a verbal communication from Mr. Nichols, a clerk in the office, and he showed me two policies which had been found in the clause-box, and the stamps of which had been tampered with—I made a report to my board—on 30th June I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080005"/>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> A clerk named Magrath had charge of all policy stamps under lock and key—he kept a monthly account of the stamps with the accountant—he was dismissed with two other clerks, about the end of May or June this year, for inattention to work—all three occasionally wrote out policies; I should say one was the regular policy-writer, and the other two assistants—one of them, Hanbury, was a very good writer—I cannot say if his handwriting was like yours; all your writings in a way were alike, but I never compared his with yours—when Magrath was leaving, a discrepancy in his balance of stamps was discovered—he was taxed with it, and made a confession—he said he had recovered spoilt stamps from Winchester House—he said nothing about Somerset House—he said he had recovered postage stamps, and appropriated them to his own use, without accounting to the company, that he had appropriated money to his own use on postage stamps—he was appointed in 1887—he did not admit it had teen going on for two or three years past, but I have since ascertained that it has—the matter was reported to the directors, and Magrath was requested to attend for two or three board days while the directors were considering his case—then he was requested to attend on a particular board day, but he never had the letter, as it was returned to me from the Dead Letter Office—it was not an open secret in the office that the board would overlook his matter; the board took legal advice, and were advised not to prosecute—I think Nichols found those other matters, and called my attention to them on the Tuesday before the board meeting—on Wednesday when I reported to them it made the matter look blacker for Magrath—suspicion rested on him on the Wednesday—he did not turn up at the board meeting on that day—I wrote on the Tuesday night to tell him to be in attendance next day; he was still in the company's employment—the letter was returned from the Dead Letter Office on Wednesday afternoon, after the board had left—he wrote a letter, which came on the Wednesday afternoon; it gave no address, and said he had given up his apartments—he never appeared at the office, and we did not know his address—he never came to offer any explanation—I am told he has been seen in the City—the old policies were kept where anyone could get at them—one of the amounts you are charged with recovering at Somerset House is for £2, which does not refer to these insurance policies—you simply had to get stamps from Magrath for the purpose of writing out a policy, spoil them and take them to Somerset House—you might have gone to the box itself and taken out stamps; if Magrath had balanced his account at the end of every month, as he ought to have done, he would have found deficiency if there had been deficiency—Magrath ought to have kept his accounts, so that we should know what stamps and money he ought to have, but he did not keep it properly, and there is considerable deficiency now for over three years—we had such confidence in you, that Magrath or anyone in the office would have given you stamps if you had asked for them—you had a great many policies to check, as well as writing out some; some days you had more than others—it was known in the office that detectives were at work in Somerset House; they came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080006"/>
               <p>to the office and examined most of our clerks—you made no attempt to get away—your character has been good for six and a half years—in every respect you gave me every satisfaction, and did your work well; I had no fault to find with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Magrath was a copyist, and had charge of the stamps—he was registered at Winchester House to recover for spoilt stamps, and therefore it was not necessary for him to get any special authority, such as these letters, from us—these authorities are in the prisoner's writing—when I communicated with the Inland Revenue I was not aware my name had been forged—I have never seen the letters, nor the declarations, nor receipts—the signature to the receipt for £2 to the South British Company is in the prisoner's writing—Magrath expressed great astonishment that the amount of the deficiency was so large—the Government puts the stamps on policies; they issue them with the stamp—we have a fresh stock every month—some stamps are embossed and some are adhesive—all the stamps removed in this way were adhesive, and could be taken off and used for any policies they liked—on this policy of 11th July, 1889, the stamps are of the date of 1887, and have been taken off a missing policy—the company have paid for new stamps, and instead of new stamps being used, stamps have been removed from other policies and put on to the right amount—the Government and the company have been defrauded—we send blank policy forms to the Government office to have stamps put on—the blue printing ought to go over and not under the stamp; if it goes under the stamp it shows the stamp was put on afterwards—Government officials would not put the stamp over it—we have £60 or £70 of stamps in stock—the penny stamp is dated 6th May, 1890, and the policy is of the 4th July, 1887—the stamp must have been cut off—the risks have run off these policies, and they are kept in a box together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> There was nothing to prevent Magrath from transferring a stamp from an old policy, and putting it on a fresh one; but you ought to have detected it—it was ascertained that he had been at our office on one or two occasions on Sunday; one of the clerks happened to be there once, when he was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the secretary's office, Inland Revenue Department, Somerset House—I am engaged in the assessment of duties on policies of marine insurance—I am well acquainted with the system of stamping—every marine insurance policy over 3s. 6d. has to be stamped, according to the amount of the insurance, at the Inland Revenue Office, before execution—people bring blank papers, and we stamp them at the office—we don't issue stamps which they can affix—I have examined these thirty-one policies, and I have prepared this statement as to them; it is correct—it shows the duties payable, and the stamps required—the first part has reference to eighteen policies which were stamped properly, but from which stamps have been removed—I found on the other thirteen policies the stamps corresponding individually in value to the stamps with which the eighteen ought to have been stamped—with the exception of two stamps, which are said to have been obtained from missing policies, the stamps correspond in amount and value—the policy of the South British Company, No. 101,127, of 14th February, 1887, the duty on which was</p>

               <p>£1 14s. 9d., now bears stamps for 9s. and 9d.—both those bear date 14.2.87, corresponding to the date of the policy—the stamp for £1 5s., the balance of duty, bearing date 4.2.87, has been altered to a stamp for five guineas, and attached to another policy, so that it is both transferred and forged—I came to the conclusion that stamps had been removed from the eighteen and transferred to the thirteen—the stamps on this policy of 6th March, 1890, 108,836A, have been removed from other papers—I came to the conclusion that one stamp for £1 5s., bearing date 27th June, had been removed from a policy of the Adelaide Company, No. 91,517, because it corresponds in date and value; and that two other stamps had been removed from policies No. 110,401 and No. 110,830 of the National Company—for the second and third of those penny stamps had been substituted to cover the vacant place where the stamps were taken from.</p>

I was junior policy clerk from October, 1883, to August, 1889—it was my duty to write out forms of policies under the prisoner's direction, and to see that stamps on the forms were correct—I wrote out these eighteen policies, and they were put into a basket for the prisoner to examine, and they bear his initials as having examined them—to the best of my belief they were properly stamped before they left my hands—I met the prisoner in the Bengal Restaurant on 12th July, and spoke to him about the unpleasantness that had taken place in the South British Company, and he said it had nothing to do with him, but they had taken the names of all the gentlemen in the office, and that mine had been taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The stamps have now been removed from these eighteen policies—they may have been tampered with after they left you—sometimes it was several days after we asked for the stamped policy forms that Magrath gave them to us—that was so in these particular cases—then he put them on the racks of your or my desk, where they were left for several days sometimes before we used them—it would be exceptional if we left them for two or three weeks before making out the policy; sometimes it might have been so—you had a locked desk—Magrath was authorised to issue a stamp on your slip for it—I was absent from the office through a relation being ill, and I was discharged by telegraph.</p>

D</hi>) I made inquiries into this case—on 7th and 10th July I saw the prisoner at Jerusalem Chambers, and drew his attention to the two policies 108,836A and 114,468A—he made this statement, which I took down in writing:—"I, Frederick William Theodore Oelrichs, say that for the past six years I have been in the employ of the South British and National Insurance Companies, of the above address, five years of which I have been policy clerk and examiner. It was my duty to examine all policies, whether made up by me or not. I used to receive all policies in the blank form after they had been duly stamped from Magrath. The policy No. 108,836A of the South British Company, produced, was duly filled in by myself, and the stands now upon it purporting to be of the value of £3 12s. 9d. are the same as were affixed when I received it from Magrath. It escaped my attention when examining the policy that the stamps were not genuine, and the first I knew of it was about ten days ago, when my attention was called to it by Mr. Merriman, who at the time pointed out other similar cases of fraud. At this time, however, Magrath had been dismissed. I remember the latter end of last year there was an occasion to refer to policy No. 114,468A, which was dated 4th February, 1889, and my attention was then called to a fictitious stamp affixed to that policy purporting to be of the value of £5 5s., and this stamp is now also in the same condition as when I received it from Magrath. I did not notice at the time I filled in the form that the stamp was not genuine, and, when it was discovered, I did</p>

The Reynolds were there three weeks—I had no occasion to complain of them—when Vaughan was in Reynolds' company the female prisoner went out of the room, and was out the whole time—I don't know that Reynolds was a scene shifter at a theatre—he told me so—I can't remember what time he came home on the Thursday; I was in bed; we were generally asleep when he came home—they were in the habit of coming home very late.</p>

I know all the prisoners—in consequence of information, for some little time prior to 21st July I kept observation both on 74, Webber Row, and 120, Cornwall Road, and also on the prisoners—I have seen them together; I made a note in my book of the occasions—on 15th July I saw Gabin go to 120, Cornwall Road, between seven and eight at night, I saw him leave shortly afterwards in company with Parks and Vaughan; they went to the Northumberland Arms, Northumberland Street, Strand, where they joined the other prisoners—on 17th July I saw Gabin, Parks, and Vaughan leave 120, Cornwall Road, between seven and eight in the evening, and go to the Glass House public-house in Stamford Street, Waterloo Road, where the two Reynolds were—on both occasions I was accompanied by Detective Cox—I kept observation on 74, Webber Road, where the Reynolds lived—I have seen the Reynolds go in and out there, also the boy Hall and another man—I have not seen the other prisoners there—on the morning of 20th July, about seven, I went with two other officers to Webber Row—I went through the front door, which was open, up to the first-floor front—I knocked at the door—someone called out, "Who is there?"—I replied, "Police; open the door"—I heard the noise of a window being raised—Detective Kamber went downstairs—Cox and I opened the door, as they refused—on getting into the room I saw the lad Hall getting out of the window—Reynolds was sitting on the side of the bed; the female was standing in the middle of the room dressing—I told them that we were police officers, and we should arrest them on suspicion of having stolen property in their possession, the proceeds of various burglaries—Reynolds said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "You have heard what I said: you will consider yourself in custody"—the female prisoner said, "A nice thing you have done with me, living with you, but I am not going away for you"—they dressed, and we conveyed them to Kennington Road Station, after locking up the room—we then returned and made a search—we found this new pair of boots, six new carpenter's rules, two other pairs of boots, which had been worn, three new sunshades, two sheets, one counterpane, two coats, two pairs of trousers, two paper knives, an ornament, a box containing a tooth brush, a piece of a silver albert, two fur muffs, a fur rug, four fur Victorias, one fur collaret, five pieces of fur, a silk sash, a piece of lace, two brushes, a card-case, three pairs of gloves, a revolver, a bunch of keys, also a box which has been since identified—various of these articles have been identified as having been stolen from six different premises between 23rd June and 18th July—Cox showed the revolver to Reynolds, and he said, "A b—good job it was not loaded, or we should have shot all of you dead as you came upstairs"—we put the property in the station, and at once went to 120, Cornwall Road; we got there about a quarter to eight—I went through the front door, which was open, to the first floor back room—the door was fastened, but not locked; the key was outside—I entered, and saw Vaughan and Parks lying on the bed partly dressed, and Gabin sitting by the side of the bed apparently asleep, dressed, but he had his boots off—we roused them up, and said we were police officers, and should arrest them on suspicion of being joined with others already</p>

               <p>in custody; they made no reply—I asked to whom the room belonged; no one answered—they were taken to Kennington Road Station—there they were again asked to whom the room belonged—Vaughan said, "I engaged the room"—I said, "We shall go back and search it"—we did so, and found five coats, three pairs of trousers, three vests, four pairs of boots, a razor, three brushes, a comb, a pair of spats, a barometer, a timepiece, two bottles of scent, four pawntickets, one packet of cards with a gentleman's name on them (Lieutenant B—, of Royal Navy), two coats, one umbrella, and a silk hat—the greater portion of that property has been identified as part proceeds of various burglaries between 23rd June and 18th July—when we had got all the prisoners together, they were formally charged on suspicion of stealing the various articles—Reynolds said, "You can only charge me with unlawful possession"—Vaughan and Parks said, "You ought to charge us with receiving"—they were then taken before the Magistrate and remanded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Constable</hi>). I was one of the officers who arrested the prisoners—a few days ago I received a communication from Parks, in consequence of which I went with Inspector Harvey to see him in prison—he was about to speak to us—Harvey cautioned him, and told him whatever he said we should take down in writing, and hand to the Treasury—we made no promises—he made a statement, which Harvey took down in writing—I asked if he was willing to sign it, and he signed it—this is the statement:—"I wish to give some information to the police, but I don't want my mates to know anything of it. The reason I wish to give it is because these here people deny all knowledge of me, and they refuse to do anything for me. I have wrote them letters, and they have not even answered them. Mr. Bob Stone, of the Dials, the second barber's shop, bought part of the furs for £8; the other half Mrs. Marks, of Great Wild Street, Drury Lane, bought for £8 10s. Mr. Stock or, jeweller, of Waterloo Road, bought the melton coat lined with fur for £8, and he also bought Lieutenant Blunt's gold medals for £3 15s. Mr. Edwards, a bootmaker, in a turning off Great Queen Street, next to a paper shop, bought forty-seven pairs of boots for £8. They were stolen from a Mr. Amsden, Leicester Square, about 4th July last, by Percy Vaughan (or Harrington). I was not concerned with him in that job. The seventy pairs of boots stolen from Dicks, Holborn, what we are charged with, were actually packed up by Vaughan, Gabin, and myself. Reynolds and the boy were outside keeping watch. They were sold to Edwards for £10. Vaughan always took the money and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080021"/>
               <p>shared it out. About two months ago, it was on the night of the police riot at Bow Street, me, Vaughan, and Reynolds went up the Strand, and seen a cigar shop. Vaughan put the door in, and a policeman, 35 CR, came up and asked Vaughan what he was doing; he (Vaughan) said, ‘I suppose I can stand at my own door.' I ran away. The next morning I saw Vaughan and Reynolds in a lodginghouse in Westminster Road; they were smoking cigars, and they both told me that they took fifty boxes of cigars, etc., and sold them to Mr. Bob Stone for 5s. a box. The reason I ran away was that it was the first time I have ever been engaged in a burst, and I felt frightened. Reynolds said to me when I said I was frightened that he would blow my brains out if I turned copper, and he showed me a revolver that he was carrying. About half-past four on the morning we were arrested, me, Vaughan, and Gabin went to Rider Street, St. James's. He forced the lock off (I mean Vaughan), and made such a noise that I went away. I met them again about an hour and a half after in Trafalgar Square; they were carrying the time-piece and boots between them. About the fourth or fifth of July last me, Gabin, Vaughan, Reynolds, and Scar-faced Charlie, and the boy Reynolds went to a jeweller's shop, corner of Hanway Street, Oxford Street. We lifted up the grating, and they all went in except me, and I remained at the opposite side of the street until a policeman ordered me away at half-past one in the morning. I did not see anything of them again for three days, when I met Vaughan at the lodging-house, and we laughed at the account that appeared in the papers. Vaughan said that they took the safe to Stacker's, who gave them £28 on account. I have since seen Stocker and asked him for my share. He told me that it was nothing to do with me, and he should give me nothing at all. I wrote to him yesterday, but he has not yet answered my letter. The woman, Jane Reynolds, has never had anything to do with these jobs; she only used to have a drink with us in the public-house. I only knew Reynolds about three weeks before I was arrested; I have known Vaughan as Percy for years. I only knew Gabin about two or three weeks before we were took. Tommy Crane and Charlie introduced me to Gabin, and said he was an expert burglar; but when he (Gabin) was inside a place he was all of a shake, and Vaughan told him in Dick's shop that he would brain him with the stick if he did not keep himself quiet, as he was making a noise with his mouth as though he was croaking. I don't know Kelly, but I have known Paddy Shea for years; we have only been about together since the 25th June last. I have made this statement of my own free will; I have been promised nothing, neither have I been threatened; but my mates have done nothing for me, and I am told that they are keeping people from coming to see me, so I am doing this for the truth to be known." <hi rend="italic">Gabin, in his defence, said he knew nothing of half the cases against him; that he never broke into a house; that Nicholls never saw him on</hi> 16th or 17th July; <hi rend="italic">and that when he took the others he said he did not want him.</hi>

This is a bad one"—he said, "Is it?"—I then walked outside, and he came out and joined Batt at the corner of Fleet Lane, about thirty yards from the house—we followed them—Brooks went into the George public-house at the corner of Fleet Lane—I went into the next compartment and saw him standing in the bar, but there were so many people that he came out—I went in and spoke to the barmaid, and then followed him—he joined Barnes; they stood talking a few minutes, and then walked to the Viaduct Tavern at the corner of Newgate Street—they both went in, and I went into the next compartment, and heard Batt ask for a half of ale; he tendered a penny—Brooks stood at the back of the bar—Batt came out and crossed the road towards St. Sepulchre's Church; he stood a few minutes, crossed to Brooks, when he came out and spoke to him; Brooks looked into the White Hart, and crossed the road again to Batt, and they both went into the Plough at one door and came out at another without having any drink—they stood talking, and we said, "We are police officers; we want that counterfeit shilling you have been trying to pass at public-houses"—they said, "We don't know what you mean"—Brooks said, "We will go to the station and be searched"—we took them to the station, and I found this shilling in Brooks' coattail pocket—I saw Underwood search Batt and find these four shillings</p>

I am the widow of James Hopkins; he was 40 years of age—the prisoner is his nephew, and lived with us at 29, John Street, Edgware Road; he had been a soldier—my husband was a lamplighter, in the employ of the Gas Light and Coke Company—the prisoner got into the same employ, and they worked together—on Sunday afternoon, 17th August, we all three went out together at half-past three, to the Welsh Harp, Hendon; we only stayed there a few minutes; we came home, had tea, and went out again, and went to Wormwood Scrubs, and came home about ten minutes past one—they had to go out between two and three to turn off the gas—I and my husband went to bed, and the prisoner went into the back room and changed his best clothes for his working ones, and came and laid outside our bed, as he had done for three months—I was awoke by my husband's abusive language to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "Lie down again, it ain't time for us to get up yet"—he went off to sleep again, and my husband used abusive language again to him—he said, "Don't do it again"—my husband went to make a blow at him, and, in self-defence, the prisoner struck him—my husband was sitting up in bed; the prisoner was out of bed, standing; he hit my husband at the side of the eye; I afterwards saw a small cut, it bled a good deal; he used to suffer a good deal from nose bleeding—I never saw him bleeding from the eye before, only when he had an accident from a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, that was two years ago—I sent my nephew, William Grover, for the doctor, and got water and bathed my</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Crooked Billet, at Stanwell—on 4th August, about a quarter to seven, a party of fifteen men and women drove up in a brake—I supplied them with refreshments—they left about twenty minutes to eight—they were perfectly sober; the prisoner was one of the party—shortly after I went outside on the doorstep and saw George Adams, and stood talking to him—there were two separate parties, men and women, having a regular skirmish—the prisoner came from the rear of the van, and deliberately struck the deceased on the rig lit chest—it knocked him over a pair of steps, and his head came in contact with the surface water pipe; he got up and placed his hands to his head, and said, "Oh my head!"—the prisoner struck him three deliberate blows on the back, and knocked him into the front door of my house—he did not attempt to retaliate at all; he walked about a little and then came and stood by my bar window—in the meantime the prisoner had driven off with his party—in consequence of what I was told, I afterwards went outside again and saw Adams lying on the ground; I got some water and bathed his temples and mouth, and felt his pulse, it was beating remarkably clear; I put my hand on his heart, and its action was gradually dying out—I sent for the police and Doctor Prince, who arrived about an hour afterwards; at that time Adams was dead—next morning I saw the prisoner at Battersea Police-station, and at once picked him out from about twelve people—I have not the least doubt that ho is the man that struck the blows; I conversed with him about ten minutes before he left my house—I know the deceased well; he was a quiet, inoffensive man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I understood that the prisoner was the driver of the van—at the time I was talking to Adams the people who were skirmishing were about fifteen paces from us, I should think the party did not exceed thirty—this all happened very quickly—the parties were skirmishing with each other and with the cocoa-nut man.</p>

I am the wife of James Wilson, a carman, and live in London Road, Staines—on 4th August, between seven and eight in the evening I was near the front door of the Crooked Billet—I saw two men come from the road, one hit the other and knocked him down, and his head came in contact with the brick wall; while he was down the other hit him again, and the poor man stumbled up and ran through into the bar, and I saw no more of him—I did not see what became of the other.</p>

I am a surgeon practising at Staines—on Monday evening, 4th August, about nine, I was called to the Crooked Billet, and saw the deceased; he was quite dead—on the 7th I made a post mortem examination—I found a bruise about half an inch in diameter in front of the right shoulder and another at the back of the head, a depressed mark about an inch and a half in circumference—those injuries were such as might have been caused by a fall or blows—there was internal injury corresponding with that on the head—the heart and liver were enlarged, the muscles slightly fatty, and the bowels incompetent—the lungs had slight adhesions on the right side—death arose from an excessive shock acting on a weak system.</p>

I live at 110, Farringdon Road Buildings—I work at a brewery—on the morning of 14th July, about twenty-five minutes past twelve, I was coming up Great Bath Street, Clerkenwell, going home—I saw two men standing in Farringdon Road, just above Vineyard Walk, as if talking together, about a yard apart—as I looked at them I saw the one who had his back to me, close with the other, and the other jumped away and said, "I am stabbed," and cried out, "Murder"—I was about seven or eight yards from them—the man who cried out ran across the road towards the Fire station, calling out "Murder" as he ran—the other man started after him, and stumbled; he had a stick in his hand, it was raised about level with his head or a trifle higher; he held the ferrule end, and the top was upwards—that man appeared to be the prisoner, when I saw him in charge of the Police—the other man ran down Mount Pleasant, round the corner in the direction of the New Road, and the other man after him; when he stumbled the other in front gained on him, he ran down Cold Bath Square; I lost sight of both of them there; I then turned and went back the way I had come; when I got a little way down Bath Street I saw the prisoner, a policeman, and another man (Till) standing together at the corner of Cold Bath Square; the other man was a long distance down Bath Street, on the ground on his back, bleeding—I waited there till I saw him put on a shutter and taken away.</p>

I am a hairdresser and live at 14, Eyre Street Hill—I knew Milandi; he was a hairdresser, and was a friend of mine—I do not know Valli—on Sunday, 13th July, a little after midnight, I was outside Milano's restaurant, on Eyre Street Hill, talking to three constables, when Milandi passed by; he was not going very quick, and was not in good temper—I said, "Good-night;" he did not answer me as he ought to have done—I went with him to the bottom of Eyre Street Hill; he turned round abruptly, and asked me if I knew Valli; that was just at the corner of Warner Street; I left him there—I had not seen Valli that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a looking-glass manufacturer—I have known the prisoner about five years; he has worked for me three separate times, first as a boy at ten shillings a week; latterly he has been working as a cabinet-maker—he lived directly opposite the end of Colebrook Row, within about fifty yards of the Angel—if he was going home from his club he should go behind Sadler's Wells Walk, Exmouth Street, by the Fire Station in Farringdon Road; or from Laystall Street, on Mount Pleasant, to the Fire Station, and then up Exmouth Street to the Angel—I think the nearest way would be by Mount Pleasant; I always walked that way myself—the prisoner was in my employment at the time this occurred—I have always found him very quiet and trustworthy and industrious.</p>

On 31st July, about 7.50 a.m., I was in plain clothes watching with Hicks in Lower Thames Street, and saw a South-Western van come to the market, loaded with hampers and packages of fish—I saw the prisoners Brown and Ward in conversation in Arthur Street—that was as near as they could get—Brown went to the Cock public-house with Thomas, a railway inspector, who checks all the goods which arrive—Ward then got on the van and took a crab out of a package and dropped it to the bottom of the van—he stopped on the tail-board some time, and said something to Vigar, who got on the van, and put two crabs in the bottom of the van into a mat basket, and then took them into a publichouse six or seven yards from the van—Ward was standing on the footway—after a few minutes, Brown came out with the mat basket which Vigar had taken in, and went into the Coopers' Arms public-house, Miles Lane—when he came out I told him I was a police officer, and asked what he had got in the basket—he said, "What has that to do with you?"—he then said, "They are crabs"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I bought them in Billingsgate Market"—I said, "How much did you give for them?"—he said, "Three shillings"—I said, "That is wrong; I saw a man steal those crabs; I shall take you in custody for receiving them"—going to the station he said, "Can't</p>

               <p>you square this matter without it going any further?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I have fifteen years' good character"—I said, "I can't help that"—I then went to Arthur Street East, and saw Ward and Vigar—I said I should take them in custody for being concerned with a man in custody in stealing two crabs—Ward said, "I know nothing about them"—I told Vigar that he took them into the Cock public-house—he said, "I have taken no crabs into the public-house this morning"—I afterwards took Thomas in custody, and they were all charged at the police-station-Brown said, "I gave the boy a shilling for them in the Cock public-house"—Vigar said, "You did not, you only gave me sixpence"—Brown said, "You did not"—sixpence was found on Vigar, and sixpence and two or three coppers on Ward—Thomas was discharged by the Alderman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser's manager at Mr. Shotter's, 145, Fenchurch Street—the prisoner was employed there under me—on 28th August I went up to the third floor to have dinner—the prisoner was there—I sat at a different table from the one he was at—he came over to me and said in German, which I understand, "What do you want to tell my friends if I had said another word to you you would have kicked me down the stairs"—I said, "I did not say so"—he said, "You</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080044"/>
               <p>are a liar"—I said, "You are a liar, I never said such a thing"—he then struck me a violent blow on my forehead with the broken leg of a chair which I had sent up from the saloon, and which was lying there—it knocked me nearly senseless—I put my hand to feel the injury, and he hit me across the hand with the same weapon and broke my hand, which I now wear in a sling in consequence—he got hold of me then and knocked me down, and dragged me about the room like a dog—then he got on top of me and hit me—I screamed, "Leave me alone"—he put his hand on my mouth—he has a mark where I bit his finger when he did that—he let me go—I was screaming "Murder;" he would not leave me alone—he was holding me down and hitting me, kneeling on me—some one came up and opened the door, and he got off me—I picked up the chair-leg—as I came downstairs I saw a policeman—I went to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was bleeding all over; my nose and my arms were bleeding—I have marks on my arm now—I had one cut on my head—I don't remember the doctor saying I had no cut there—I did not touch the prisoner—the policeman said he had a bad cut on the side of his head—I should think he came by that in the struggle; by falling against the fire-place or table very likely—I picked the chair-leg up when I got up; I never had a chance to strike the prisoner with it—he held me all the time he was striking me—I was very nearly senseless; I didn't know what I was about—when I was struck I started screaming—I did not strike the prisoner—I was senseless—I don't know who separated us—I picked myself up when I came to; I don't know if anybody was in the room then—I ran down to the policeman; I was glad to get out of the room—the prisoner was not in the room when I left it—I was afraid he was murdering me—I did not know what I was doing—I was almost crying when I ran downstairs; I was not lively; I was recovering my senses; I was excited—I told the policeman I almost fainted, that the prisoner was almost murdering me—I could not tell where the prisoner was at the time—I found him downstairs, and told the policeman; I gave him in charge—I brushed and washed myself before I went to the police-court—this was not a quarrel between us; I did not have the chair-leg first—I am not a quarrelsome man—the assistants in the place have given notice and left, because they are all Germans, and turned against me, and stuck together—the governor gave them notice—I do not know that they gave notice because they refused to serve under me—I said I had got them the sack; the governor told me he had given them notice—one assistant gave notice because the governor said he was going to send away two—I was discharged—the governor told me not to go into the dining-room while the other assistants were at dinner—I went on this occasion because I did not know they were going to murder me, and my dinner had been there a long time—I did not go there to quarrel, nor to speak sharply to the prisoner—the prisoner did not say when I went in, "Is it right that you have told the proprietor of the club that you sent us away?"—I said, "It is not true, I did not say a word"—the prisoner did not say, "I have witnesses to prove it"—I did not say, I will kill you," I did not strike him a blow in the face, I never struck him—I don't know where he fell—I cannot say if either of us fell against the washstand—he got hold of my throat and dragged me—I soon got away from him—I cannot remember where he caught</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080045"/>
               <p>hold of me—the whole thing lasted ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, another ten minutes would have killed me—no one came into the room; I was calling "Police" and "Murder" at the top of my voice; he had his hand on my mouth and was nearly stopping my breath; he let me go for a little while because I bit him, and then I called out "Murder" and "Police"—I don't know who opened the door—I don't know the prisoner's character—his attacking me was a strange thing; I don't know why he did it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The governor said to me, "Keep in the saloon as much as you can this week"—I thought he meant to look after the business—the prisoner began this struggle, and gave me the first blow, and kept going at me as hard as he could; I resisted, but always had the worst of it—there were two tables in the room—the prisoner got me into the middle of the room—I don't remember falling against a table—the first opportunity I had I got away from the room—I was very much excited by the struggle.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 867). About 12.30 on 28th August I went to 145, Fenchurch Street—when I got inside I heard men's voices shouting and screaming upstairs, and something being knocked about, and sounds as if a violent struggle was taking place—I went upstairs, and on arriving at the landing of the first floor the prosecutor came running down, followed almost immediately after by the prisoner, who was in a very excited state—they were both covered with blood—they ran into the haircutting saloon on the first floor—the prosecutor said nothing at the time, but subsequently he gave the prisoner in charge for assaulting him—afterwards other constables came, and then I went upstairs on to the third floor with the prosecutor—I found the room in great confusion—the prosecutor handed me this chair-leg—he was very excited—it was some time before he could give me any account of the matter—in one corner of the room was a pool of blood just beginning to thicken—he afterwards told me that the prosecutor was a liar, and that he struck him with the chair-leg, and he struck him in self-defence with his fist—I took him to the station—he made no answer to the charge—the prisoner did not appear to be suffering from any serious wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a wound such as might have been caused by this chair-leg on the prisoner's head, which had been bleeding I should say, but was not at the time—I examined it—he spoke French, which I understand—when I saw the prosecutor he was running downstairs; he did not look like a man who had just recovered consciousness—both he and the prisoner were very excited—the first words I understood him to say were on the way to the station—he said something at the shop to the proprietress, nothing to me I believe; I am not sure—I don't understand German—there was a delay of nearly ten minutes before the prosecutor charged the prisoner; they went and washed first—about ten minutes or so after I first saw them the chair-leg was picked up—the prosecutor said nothing about it or a stick till then—he did not run downstairs and say at once he had been assaulted with the chair-leg, but waited till he saw it in the room—I cannot say if it was picked up from the floor or the side table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went upstairs because I thought it might assist me in coming to some conclusion—I heard the prisoner say something to Mrs. Shotter, partly in French and partly in English—I took it to be that he wished me to take his name and address, and make it a matter for a sum-mons,</p>

I am surgeon at the London Hospital—on 28th August the prosecutor was strapped up by the receiving officer, and afterwards I saw him—he had a fracture of the metacarpal bone of his right thumb, and a contused wound and contusions on his forehead going back behind his ear—he was dressed and sent out—this chair-leg would break the thumb bone—he did not seem very much upset.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard of the cut which the prisoner had—the corner of this chair-leg would make a clean cut on the head—it would make a contused and incised wound, more like a lacerated wound; it would break the skin, I think—the skin of the man's thumb was not broken—I should think the wounds on Goldstein's forehead were caused by a fist.</p>

I live at 222, Barking Road, Canning Town, and am employed at this toilet club as hatter, in the same saloon as the other men—I have been there nine weeks—on this day some one told me something, and I went upstairs and opened the door, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutor struggling on the floor—I could not say who was underneath—I did not see the chair-leg there—I parted them, and they went downstairs—when I went into the room the prosecutor had not lost his senses, nor did he look in a fainting condition—I saw blood coming from a straight cut on the prisoner's forehead—blood was coming from his nose, and downstairs he showed me a bite on his finger—during the eight weeks I have known the prisoner he has been very peaceable and quiet with all of us, that is his character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter of 58, Portland Road, Tidal Basin—I do contract work—on Saturday, 9th August, I saw Raisbeck at Freemason's Road—he said he knew a party that had got some white lead and oil for sale cheap; I said I could do with it—I had known him previously—he said, "I don't know where he (meaning Davis) is, but if you come with me we will try to find him"—I</p>

               <p>knew Davis by sight—we found him at the Freemasons' Tavern—Raisbeck introduced me to Davis; he said, "This is Mr. Fisher, who is come about the stuff you have for sale"—Davis said, "I have sold what I had to Mr. Abrahams, but if you tell me what you want, I can get you anything you require," or something to that effect; I then gave him an order for some white lead, oil, and turps, and Oxford ochre—I ordered no varnish, boiled oil, or brushes—I asked Davis the price of white lead; he said he thought it would be about 16s. a cwt.—he promised to deliver it about two o'clock on the following Monday, the 11th—on the 11th I waited all day for him; he did not turn up till the evening—about eight o'clock Raisbeck came to the door with Davis, and said, "We have got your stuff"—he said it was waiting down at the Freemasons' Tavern in the van—ultimately, I, Raisbeck, Davis, and the carman went there, and the goods were unloaded at my works at Silvertown—Raisbeck said at the house, "Do you know what your things come to?"—I said, "No"—he took a book similar to this out of his pocket, and said, "It comes to about £10"—nothing was said about brushes, because going along Davis said, "I have brought more than what you ordered; I have brought ten gallons of varnish, some driers, and some boiled oil; will you take the lot?"—I said, "It must be at a low price then, because I have no immediate use for it"—Raisbeck said at the house, "You had better bring some cash with you"—I took £5 with me, which I paid to Davis—I was to meet him at the Prince of Wales public-house the following evening to have an account with him—they did not keep the appointment—next evening Raisbeck came to the house about nine o'clock, and said, "Here is Davis, he wants £2 tonight bad"—I declined to give him £2; I said, "He can have £1 if it is any use to him"—Raisbeck said, "Very well, you had better give it to him himself"—I went out and gave it to Davis—I took Bryant to my works, and he identified the goods as those supplied by Farmiloe—on the Monday night Raisbeck said he had some brushes that were of no use to him, and I could buy them if I liked—I said I would call round and see them—I called round on the Tuesday evening, I think it was, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am only a painter, and do not execute building contracts—I have known Raisbeck seven or eight years, he is a plumber and zinc-worker—the greater part of the time I have lived near Garberry Road, and before that he was living at Plumstead—during the time I have known him he has always borne the character of a respectable man—he was a member of Lady Ash-burton's mission—he said, "I don't know whether he has sold them yet, but if you will come with me I will try and find him"—he did not tell me first of all it was Davis who had the things to sell; he said a party—I formed the impression that perhaps Davis had sold them—the conversation with Davis and Raisbeck was in the Freemasons' Tavern—it lasted a few minutes, or perhaps a quarter of an hour—in the course of conversation it was suggested that some memorandum should be taken of what I would buy—Raisbeck said to Davis, "You had better take it down in writing properly, to make no mistake;" something like that—I then took out a piece of paper and wrote down the things I wanted—he did not say he had any goods, but that he could get me any I required, and I put down what I wanted, and then tore the leaf out of my book and handed</p>

               <p>it to Davis—Raisbeck did not then interfere with his book—I did not see this till the goods were delivered; I never saw it at the Freemasons' Tavern—the only price we went into was that of white lead—until Monday evening Raisbeck said nothing after introducing me to Davis; he left us to discuss it—the first time I saw this book was on Monday evening, when Raisbeck said, "Do you know how much it comes to?" outside my door—Davis was there, and the sum was mentioned—Raisbeck said, "You had better bring some cash with you, because Davis wants some," and I brought £5 and paid it to Davis—when the goods were unloaded zinc and metal were left in the van—the place where the goods were unloaded, and from which they took the zinc and metal away, was in Silvertown, which is about a mile from "Garberry Road—the unloading was completed I daresay at nearly 9 o'clock—when Raisbeck came to my house some nights after I saw Davis standing some distance off against the lamp post—I said I could not give him more than £1 till I had had a bill or a settlement.</p>

I shall take you into custody for being concerned with Davis, for obtaining a great quantity of oils, white lead, and other articles from Messrs. Farmiloe"—he said, "Yes, that is all right"—I conveyed him to Canning Town; he was searched, and this book was found on him.</p>

I am manager to Benjamin Hyams, of Hoxton Street, a licensed victualler; I live on the premises—on Sunday, 20th July, I was aroused about four a.m.—it seemed as if someone was breaking through and getting on the top of the railings that protect the lower part of the front window—I heard the noise twice—I went down, but found nothing—on going down the second time, I found some-one must have been in, because I missed three shillings or more in farthings, and the key of the back door, and a threepenny and sixpenny piece with holes in—I kept them on the top of the patent till behind the bar—the windows and shutters were in ordinary condition—a young person, by getting over the railings that protect the lower part of the front window could get through a space of about five inches, between the window and the post that holds up the revolving shutters—the younger prisoner could get through quite easily—then he would hare to go through a swing door, which he would push to get into the bar—he went out by the back door, breaking a skylight.</p>

I live at 201, Hoxton Street, on the opposite side to this public-house—at four o'clock a.m., on 20th July, I was looking out into the street and noticed the prisoners walking along—Ray got in at the side of the door, and Duke watched through the window while he was inside—I am quite sure of them.</p>

Posner, I suppose"—I said, "If J. Posner owes you an account, you have got the account in your day book or ledger," but he could not or would not show it to me, but shuffled out of it—I asked him to show me any memorandum that came with the cheque; he would not do it—he made an appointment to see me at my residence, 49, Taunton Street, Brixton, at eight o'clock—instead of keeping the appointment I found this letter in my letter box as I was going to bed—it is in the prisoner's writing.

I live at the International Club, Trafalgar Square—I am a journalist, and a member of the Institute of English Journalists—on 7th August I went to the Alhambra with my father and another friend—I left there and went for a smoke, and went to my friend's club, 172, Oxford Street—I was in Rupert Street about one or a little past; about the corner of Archer Street I was pounced on by three or four men from behind, and robbed of my gold watch and chain—I had on a morning coat—I struggled to the best of my ability, but was overpowered—I shouted "Help," but two or three people in the street ran away instead of assisting me—after I had got rid of those who</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at 50, Hertford Road,—on Wednesday afternoon, 30th July, about twenty-five minutes past four, I was at the Wagon and Horses, Kingsland, with Lambert and Wheeler, and a man named Gray—Lambert and Wheeler were singing and dancing—Mrs. Peck was serving in the bar; she asked them to go out; they did not go; they took no notice—Mrs. Peck turned round and said, "I have got somebody in the other bar to protect me"—she did not point to anybody—I saw the prisoner in the private bar aside of Mrs. Peck—we were in the middle bar—Mrs. Peck went to the further side, opened the flap and let the prisoner in behind the bar; he did not say anything, but he drew a pistol from his right-hand pocket and shook it at</p>

               <p>us three times—he put it back again, and Mrs. Peck pushed him out the backway into the yard—Lambert got up, and Mr. Peck came out of the same bar and hit me in the face and turned me out, and me and Lambert went out into the back yard—I did not go into the back yard at all; I went in the further side bar where the prisoner was at first, the private bar; Lambert went out through the door into the back—in about ten minutes he came back into the middle bar where Wheeler was—I called them out—I saw the prisoner in Hertford Road, coming from De Beauvoir Square way towards Downham Road, outside the house of Newman, the sweep; he was in the road—he passed me; I did not hear him say anything—I called the other two men out; I was alone when the prisoner passed me—when they came out we walked down towards Downham Road—Lambert and Wheeler went first; I was about eight yards behind them—the prisoner was then at the corner of Downham Road, outside the baker's shop; he turned round, took two or three steps in front, drew the, pistol from his pocket, and shot Lambert; I heard a second shot, and I fell down on my hands and knees and ran over to Mr. Wady's cabyard—I heard three shots altogether; I heard the third shot as I was running to the cabyard—I did not see what happened at the third shot—Lambert was about three or four yards from the prisoner when he was shot—Wheeler was opposite Lambert, about two yards from him—the second shot was pointed towards the Wagon and Horses; I can't say it was pointed at anybody; it was pointed at me; I was up against the brick wall—I don't say he fired at me; it was pointed to me—I saw the pistol in his hand—I saw Lambert fall—I did not see any sign of the bullet from the second shot—we had no intention of going after the prisoner—Lambert was going to St. Bartholomew's Hospital to see his little boy there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Peck, the landlord of the Wagon and Horses, in Hertford Road, Kingsland—on the afternoon of 30th July I was serving in the bar—there were five men there, Jones, Lambert, Wheeler, Gray, and another, I cannot tell his name—they came in after lunch, two o'clock—they were in and out for several hours, to my terror, until shortly before four, when my husband put them out—they were in the public bar, the middle bar—there are four bare—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080056"/>
               <p>I saw the prisoner come into the private bar about half-past three—the men in the public bar had been behaving terribly rude, using obscene language, and calling me terribly bad names—Gray, Lambert, and Wheeler tried to get over the counter; I begged of them to keep their places, if not I should send for the police, but no one dare go—the prisoner was there at the time—my husband had gone up to dress, but he felt tired and went to sleep—I screamed, and that brought him down—I screamed because Lambert struck me in the face, and called me a filthy name; I held him by the collar, and while struggling and screaming my husband came down—Lambert tried to get into the house; I prevented him, and said the dog was loose in the pot-house—he was underneath the flap—I raised the flap, and held him till my husband came—the prisoner was not in the house at that time; I did not see him go—I did not see him behind the counter before I took hold of Lambert—I did not open the flap for the prisoner to come through—I saw nothing of a revolver—I know of nothing that provoked him to come through the bar; he had no right to pass there, it is private—my husband put Lambert and Wheeler out, and Silly Charlie, Jones, or Vester, that was the name he was locked up in last, he was the one that rushed in on my husband; he struck at him twice, and said he would blow his brains out—after they were out I heard three shots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have had this house six months—during that time there have been frequent disturbances with these people, the two that were shot and several others—my life has been threatened I might say a hundred times by a number of men who I have seen with Lambert and Wheeler, and since this tragedy I have been assaulted several times—I have had brain fever—I think I have a clear recollection of what occurred on this occasion—the prisoner was there at first; I did not see him leave; he was not in the house when the row was going on between Lambert and me; he was there when Gray attempted to clamber over the bar—there was a three-branch chandelier in the middle bar, that was broken by Gray that day—we had a notice up in the bar that no trust was given—that was in consequence of these people trying to get drink for nothing; they were in the habit of coming there to victimise us—I can't say that I called out, "Merciful God! who will protect me?" very likely I did—I had sent for the police two or three times that day, but the people were frightened to go for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The police had called four or five times a day—I sent men and a child and a girl for them on this day, but they would not come—I had no servant only in the morning—Lambert, Wheeler, and Jones had drink in the house that afternoon; I served them; Gray called for it, and never paid for it; I trusted him 1s, 9d. to treat them, they were served two or three times; among five men that does not amount to much—I don't think they were the worse for drink, only Gray, the man that was the cause of it; he had left—I had seen the prisoner in the house before that day, twice I think; Saturday was the first time, and I think on Monday; but I would not say—he was in the private bar on the previous Saturday, when he was introduced to my husband as having just arrived from America—on the afternoon in question I spoke to the prisoner while the disturbance was going on—he could hear the disturbance—I cannot tell whether I spoke to him aboutit; it was merely general conversation—I did not to my knowledge ask him to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080057"/>
               <p>protect me, or to do anything for that purpose; I said I would send for the police, and I did—he could have come through the flap inside the bar while I was standing there, and could have produced a revolver without my seeing it—I could not say positively that I did not invite him inside the bar, or lift up the flap for him to come in—I have no recollection of doing so—I did lift up the flap, that was to get hold of Lambert, and prevent his getting into my place; but I have really been so very ill with brain fever, and have been twelve days in bed, that I cannot recollect that I lifted up the flap—I had brain fever the day after this, when they threw a sixteen-pound muller at my head, and I was laid up and could not go to the Police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Wagon and Horses—on the afternoon of 30th July I was upstairs in my room dozing—I heard my wife scream, which called me down—I saw Lambert at the door at the foot of the stairs, trying to get through to my private apartments—I said, "You can't go there, the dog is loose and will bite you"—I put him back and put him out—Wheeler and <hi rend="italic">Silly Charlie</hi>, as they call Jones, met me at the second compartment, and I succeeded in pushing them back towards the front—Jones made a strike at me, I warded it off and caught his hand and forced it back, and made him hit himself with his own fist—I succeeded in getting them all out at the front door; Lambert was the last that went out; as he was going out he apologised to me for what he had said to my wife—I fastened the door, and then went round the counter to the middle bar, to attend to my business—the next thing I saw was someone pass by the door towards Downham Road—I could not recognise who it was; he must have got thirty or forty yards past the door when I heard somebody, I believe it was Jones, say, "There he goes"; and I saw Jones, Lambert, and Wheeler run past the middle entrance towards Downham Road—they were about thirty or forty yards behind the man before they commenced running—I jumped over the counter to get to my sign-post at the corner, and I saw the prisoner at the corner, against the baker's shop; I could not hear what he said, but he put up his left hand so, and with his right hand he took a pistol and fired; that took no effect; the second time he killed Lambert, and the third time he killed Wheeler—I think all the three shots were fired within two or three seconds, as fast as they could be fired; but there was a long interval after holding up his hand before he fired—the three men were still running after him when he held up his hand; he did not move towards them—when the first shot was fired Jones was next the kerb; they ran breast by breast on the pavement—Lambert was in the centre, and then Wheeler—the prisoner was also on the pavement—after he had fired he went down Downham Road, and that was all I saw of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had only seen the prisoner twice before that day; he had come in as a casual customer; I believe he came in with Currie on the Saturday or Monday—I did not say to Currie, in the prisoner's presence, "This is a very rough neighbourhood, and I shall have to clear out soon"—I did not say so at the Police-court—I might have said it was a rough neighbourhood—I had seen Wheeler and Lambert outside in front of the bar the whole morning, kicking up a great disturbance on the pavement—when they were running after the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080058"/>
               <p>they continued to shout out—I could not hear what they said—I could not say in which way the prisoner pointed the pistol, whether towards the men or slightly over their heads—I believe the first shot was fired in the air, apparently to warn the men, and the other two in the direction of the men.</p>

I am a sweep, and live at 35, Hertford Road, next door but one to the Wagon and Horses—about four in the afternoon of 30th July the girl Chambers spoke to me, and I saw the prisoner pass my door towards Downham Road—after he had passed, I saw Silly Charlie, and the next thing I heard was "Hi!"—I saw Wheeler and Lambert on the path; the prisoner must have passed them—it was one of the three who said "Hi!" I don't know which—they were walking on towards the prisoner, behind him—at the corner I saw him turn round and face the men, and I heard a report and saw Lambert fall; 1 think he fell at the first shot, but I would not be sure, I was rather too far away—I heard a second shot, and a third, and I saw Wheeler fall; I could not say whether at the second or third shot—the prisoner then went round Downham Road; I followed him—he pointed the pistol fourteen or fifteen times at me—I could not hear what he said—Knifton went up beside him, and spoke to him, and seized him behind, and pinned his arms, and took the revolver from him and afterwards handed it to the police—I never saw the men run after the prisoner.</p>

I am an officer of the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals—I live at 61, Hertford Road—on 30th July I saw the prisoner in the Downham Road, running towards Islington—a crowd was running after him calling, "Stop thief!" and that he had shot somebody down the road—I followed, and got close to him—he pulled a revolver out from his inside breast pocket, and pointed it at me, and said, "I will"—the crowd began to throw stones at him—I walked with him about fifty yards, when we stopped running—I advised him to get into a cab with me or else they would kill him—he said, "All right, I will get one"—at the same time Newman sprang on to his arms—I then caught hold of Newman, and we all three fell to the ground—the three of us got hold of the revolver; Newman got it from him—the crowd began kicking him, and some jumped on him, put a rope round his neck, and all manner—we put him in a cart which was going towards the station, where we stopped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He pointed the revolver at me as he went along, not at anyone else—I first saw him about 350 yards from the corner of the Downham Road—I was going to No. 56—I saw the prisoner going towards the Southgate Road, 200 yards from where he was stopped—he turned to the right by the baker's—I was with him five minutes—I went with him to the corner of the Southgate Road, 285 yards further than No. 56, where he was stopped, and very nearly 600 yards from the Hertford Road—No. 56 is near the Culvert Road—he was coming the nearest way from the Wagon and Horses to the Southgate Road.</p>

I live at 3, Mary Terrace, Camden Town—I am a builder's labourer—on Tuesday night, 12th August, I heard a quarrel and came down to Mrs. Riddell's room—she is another lodger in the same house—I saw the prisoner striking his wife right and left with his open hands, boxing her in her face—I could not count the blows, they followed rather quick—I got him upstairs into his own room—his wife remained downstairs—the prisoner undressed himself and remained upstairs about twenty minutes—then he came down and commenced striking her again with his open hand on the head and face—she said, "Oh, don't, you will kill me," and she had her hands up to her head—he was calling her names; I did not listen much; I got him away again—when I got him on the landing he called her a b—cow and a b—w—, and afterwards that he would cut her throat that very night—he did not seem drunk; he sat up firm, and knew what he was doing—after a time I heard knocking on the floor—I went up to see what he wanted—he wanted his wife—I went downstairs and</p>

I am a pharmaceutical chemist, of 6, Park Street—about nine a.m. on 13th August Sarah Green walked into my shop with a cloth to her nose—she said she wanted it stopped from bleeding—when she took the cloth down I found the blood running from under the nostrils—I gave her some acid, and put some cotton wool with a few drops of tincture of iron up the nostrils; in five minutes or so the blood came through the wool; I gave her another similar draught, a syrup, and another drop of iron; in a few minutes the bleeding stopped; in about ten minutes she complained of fulness in the throat, and began to cough; she seemed all right after that; she dropped the coin in paying me, but she picked it up before I got round the counter, and gave it to me, and I drew it across; in another five minutes or less she said she felt faint; she fell on the floor; I helped her up, got some one to try her pulse; at first it was apparently stopped, then went on all right again; finding she looked so bad, I sent for a doctor, and got strong liquid ammonia and put it under the nose—she sat in the chair again—the pulse apparently stopped, and she fell again—then I sent for another doctor—the second time she fell she was dead before a doctor came.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 7, Stanhope Terrace, Regent's Park—about 9.30, on 13th August, I went to the chemist's shop, 6, Park Street—I found Sarah Green dead—she was blanched as if from loss of blood—death apparently had taken place from syncope and sinking from loss of blood from the nose—there was a lot of clotted blood on the right side of her nose, and a bruise on the nose, especially the right side—it might be caused by a blow or fall on a blunt surface some hours previous, it was not recent—on the Friday I made a further examination—I found two more bruises, one on the side of the right eye, and one over the right eye—they were very slight—one was almost over the right temple—I saw the bruise on the nose more clearly—a blow on the nose would cause the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The blows were indirectly the cause of death, in the way I have stated, because they caused the loss of blood, and the loss of blood caused death—nose bleeding is very common—once occurring it may occur again—clots of blood in the nose would be a sign of bleeding—her bag would not cause the wound on her nose, but quite a different injury; and it would have been recent—she suffered from a diseased heart and liver of old standing—I knew nothing of her—the liver would be affected by the heart and by alcohol—we find in such cases serosis; it is called ginger liver, or nutmeg liver—I should say the greater part of the diseased liver would be caused by a long-standing diseased heart—excitement and having no breakfast would be additional causes—her stomach was quite empty—a person suffering from heart disease would be likely to drop dead at any moment—probably earlier medical attention might have saved her—I have never lost a patient from bleeding of the nose, but there are</p>

Tell Lady Dunlo what I say, and ask her if I may pay the £50 in, then I will consider the other one"—he went away—he came back and said, "She is perfectly willing"—I said, "Write an authority then"—then he wrote this in my office: "On behalf of Lady Dunlo it is hereby agreed that the £50 cheque of Isadora Wertheimer is to be cashed immediately"—I saw him write it—I would not have it—he took it away—I paid into my bankers the £50 cheque on 16th—I have not had it returned—he brought the cheque for £300 again on 17th with the letter, written on the Pelican Club paper—I said I had not heard from my bankers, and was not prepared to go on—I said I did not care about it; my bankers had not had time to post the £50 cheque back if it had been dishonoured, and I did not care to go on—on 18th he came and said Lady Dunlo wanted some money—I gave him a cheque upon my bankers, crossed, and made payable to Lady Dunlo's order, for £25—I afterwards gave him this cheque of 22nd October for £53 5s.—the figures on the Pelican dub letter were on when I saw the letter, they are not mine—(<hi rend="italic">The letter from the Pelican Club asked Mr. Richardson to give Weston the money for the cheque, and was signed, "Isabel Dunlo</hi>")—I presented the £300 cheque on 15th November—it was returned as marked—I called on Mr. Wertheimer—I did not again see Weston till about last Easter or Whitsuntide—went to look for him at Eider Street, when Mr. Wertheimer called on me—I brought the action upon the cheque in November—it was tried before Mr. Justice Charles—the verdict was against me.</p>

I had known Weston since 1878—he introduced Lady Dunlo in my office in August, 1887—I had transactions with Weston jointly with Miss Belle Bilton, the result of which was, when Weston was convicted in March, 1888, a balance was left due to me on the joint transaction of about £115—my solicitors had instructions to press her as being jointly liable—I lend money otherwise than on pledge, upon bill or other security—the transactions between the prisoner and Miss Bilton were money lent—they signed my books in the usual way, jointly—payments have been made by her while Weston was in prison—when he came first to me I believe I knew Wertheimer by name—the prisoner asked me to keep the first cheque, and I suggested going to the Bank of England to make inquiries—he acquiesced—I had that cheque three days, and could have gone there any day—he gave me Mr. Werthoimer's address, 3, King Street, St. James's—I have ascertained</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080069"/>
               <p>that that is correct—during any of those three days I could have gone to Mr. Wertheimer and asked him if the cheque was genuine—I had no doubt that it was genuine—I gave the money for the £50 cheque the very day it was brought—I did not inquire whether it was genuine, but I knew it was signed by the person who signed the first cheque—I had it in my possession from October 5th to the 16th, and could have inquired at Mr. Wertheimer's place or at the Bank whether it was genuine—the prisoner called twice between those dates—he wanted to borrow £10, and brought a letter—I negotiated the £300 cheque on the 18th, the day I received it, and on the 28th a gentleman from the Bank of England asked me where I obtained it, because Mr. Wertheimer repudiated it—I told them whom I had it from—they told me they believed the £50 and £300 cheques to be genuine—I instructed my solicitor on 16th November, and heard from him soon afterwards that the defence would be that they were forged—after that my solicitor took down a proof from the prisoner as to what he would swear in my action—I did not discover any hesitation in asserting that they were genuine documents—I knew the prisoner's address before the civil action.</p>

I spell my name Isidor without the "e"—I live at 2, Ryder Street, St. James's—I did not give Lady Dunlo a cheque for £200 in September or October, nor did I give her one for £50—this is not my writing, or written by my authority—this cheque for £300 was not written by me or by my authority—I did not write this letter; the Friday letter to Lady Dunlo, nor the letter with the heading of the Pelican Club—there is no truth in the statement that I was waiting at the Cafe Royal, or sent her a cheque for £300, or that I had taken a box for the competition—I had an account at the Western branch of the Bank of England—it came to my knowledge in October that a cheque for £50 was debited to me—I made inquiries, and saw Mr. Richardson's manager—I had consulted Mr. George Lewis previously—I then gave instructions to my bank to pay no cheques, without instructions from me, at the request of the agent—I first saw this card of mine when the civil case was being tried—that is asking for a cheque on the 16th October, 1889—it was not written by me—I had a cheque-book in my possession at that time—I examined it, and found three cheques were missing; two were torn off, and one was torn out, counterfoil and all—the numbers correspond—after Thompson was out of employment I took him into my employment, and he continued there till October—in his capacity of valet he had my keys—he disappeared from my employment early in October—I caused inquiries to be made, but could not find his address, and the next I saw of him was driving with Weston in a cab—that was the first intimation I had that he was in communication with Weston—afterwards civil proceedings were taken with regard to the £300 cheque—I gave evidence—Lady Dunlo gave evidence, and the matter was tried by Mr. Justice Charles—I never gave Lady Dunlo a</p>

Lewis—I did not know that Weston was the person who had passed this cheque to Richardson—I did not know until the pleadings were put in that there was a cheque for £300 purporting to be signed by me, and endorsed by Lady Dunlo, in Richardson's hands—I did not about the first week in November know of this particular cheque—on October 20th I ascertained that the £50 cheque had been passed by Weston—I knew that it was forged, and that he had uttered it—I did not prosecute him, I left that to my solicitors—I knew they would do what was right and proper—the question was who should prosecute him, I or the Bank of England—I asked the Bank of England to prosecute—I do not know whether they refused—there was a good deal of correspondence between them and Messrs. Lewis—when I ascertained the forgery of the £50 cheque I did not know positively that I was a co-respondent in the divorce suit—I had a hint given me—I did not know it in November—I first learnt it by being served with a citation in March, 1889—at the time I placed this matter in Messrs. Lewis and Lewis' hands I knew that they had been in communication with Lord Clancarty, but I had no information that they were in communication with Lord Durlo—the two things were most intimately connected—Mr. George Lewis said, "Before you give me instructions, it is only right and fair that I should tell you I have received certain instructions from Lord and Lady Clancarty"—I knew that Lord and Lady Clancarty were anxious that Lord Dunlo should be divorced, but I did not know what was in their minds—I made up my mind to prosecute when the civil action was tried before Mr. Justice Charles, and before the verdict—after the trial, but before the verdict—an officer from Scotland Yard had been sent for—that was in July—I thought the Bank were the proper persons to prosecute, and I think so now—they were liable—I was once in partnership with my father in a way—at the time these cheques wore issued my income was very much diminished, and there was not a balance of £300 at the Bank, or anything like it, when the cheque was drawn—there was a very small amount there—they have a rule that you are obliged to keep a certain amount there, but they make exceptions, and mine was an exception—I had every confidence in Thompson up to the time he left—he frequently changed cheques for me—he was a confidential servant, and a man of some education—he sometimes paid my bills—I daresay he had disobeyed my orders about 27th September, 1889—he went out without waiting for me more than once—I wrote this letter to him, "As you have again disobeyed my orders, and gone out without waiting for me, I shall not require your services after this day week"; but he asked me next morning to forgive him, and I did—I thought better of it, he was a very good servant—I believe the Scotland Yard people have tried to find him, but unsuccess-fully</p>

I am a cashier at the Western branch of the Bank of England—Mr. Wertheimer had an account there in 1889, and I am well acquainted with his signature—looking at the signatures to these two cheques, I believe I should have cashed them if there had been funds to meet them—Mr. Wertheimer had given notice at the office that no cheques were to be cashed—there is nothing characteristic about Mr. Wertheimer's signature, it is a loose sort of signature, and it varies—the signature to this letter from the Pelican Club is not a signature at all, I cannot pronounce any opinion about it—the Bank had previously cashed the £50 cheque.</p>

About half-past ten on this night I was in uniform, going home off duty, through Birdcage Walk, in the direction of Buckingham Palace—when I got near the sentry-box, near the magazine, I met the prosecutor; as I met him I heard a sudden explosion of a rifle; just before that I heard a kind of rustling noise, as if some one had slipped—I saw the prosecutor reel, and cry out, "I am shot"—Dingley ran up and caught him, and said, "Look out, he is loading his rifle again," and we took the prosecutor as quickly as we could into the guard-room—by that time the soldiers in the guard-room ran out and apprehended the prisoner, and brought him into the guard-room—I examined the prosecutor's clothing and found the top button had been knocked off—I did not see the prisoner do anything—I saw this cartridge picked up—on further examination of the prosecutor's clothing we found this bullet—I saw a slight dent in the railing where the bullet had struck before reaching the prosecutor—next morning, when the prisoner was handed over to the police, he said he did not know what he had been confined for till he was told by the guard at five that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the Army Medical Staff—on the night of this occurrence I was at "Wellington Barracks—I was called to the guard-room, and there saw the prisoner—I spoke to him—I thought he was perfectly sane—in my opinion he was not under the influence of drink—I saw him again the next morning, and formed the same opinion—I don't think I had ever seen him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I thought him a little excited on the night; he was looking about him—I was a very short time in his company—next morning he presented the appearance of a perfectly sane man—I have heard the evidence here—I nave not had my attention specially directed to cases of epilepsy—I think it very likely that the circumstances deposed to favour the supposition that the prisoner was acting under a state of epileptic vertigo—that is a state that may occur at intervals, and may leave the patient in a state of perfect sanity—it is within my reading and knowledge that a person so afflicted will, when in that state, do acts which they have been accustomed to do—it is quite possible that a groom when in that condition may fancy he is grooming a horse—it is quite possible that the prisoner, if in that state, might automatically do what he is alleged to have done.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square—I am a B.A. of the University of London, a F.R.C.S., and Lecturer on Insanity at Westminster Hospital—I am the author of two books on the subject of epilepsy and mental disorders, and of numerous writings on the same subjects—my attention has been for many years past devoted specially to mental disorders connected with epilepsy—my attention was first directed to this case by seeing an account of it in the papers—I read the evidence carefully, and formed a distinct opinion about it, and in consequence of that I am now defending the prisoner—I have carefully looked at the evidence in this case, and in my opinion it indicates a particular form of epilepsy called epileptic vertigo, or <hi rend="italic">petite mal</hi>—in the course of my experience I have seen many seizures of that particular form—sudden unconsciousness is the characteristic feature of that malady, the duration of which is from a few seconds to a few minutes—the sinking down on the knees, the dazed appearance, the pallor, and the silence on being questioned, are symptoms of the malady—I can't say the man was unconscious; lean only say that the symptoms he exhibited were consistent with the hypothesis I have advanced; they are the symptoms usually associated with this particular form of epileptic vertigo—if a person in that condition finds in his hand an article which he has been accustomed to use, he will use it in the customary manner, and that without any relation to the surrounding circumstances—I have had frequent instances of that occurring in my own experience—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080080"/>
               <p>circumstances deposed to are such as I should expect to find in a case of the kind happening to a soldier, and usual in this form of seizure—if a patient is spoken to when in that state, as a rule he does not answer sometimes he does—shaky is a usual condition in such a case—it is sometimes followed by heavy sleep, and on awaking the patient is in his usual normal condition; but he retains no memory of what has happened during the attack—I should expect to find previous attacks of a similar nature, but they would vary in severity and duration; they seldom occur singly in a lifetime—if slight, they might not be noticed, and nothing would be done—I have seen the prisoner in Holloway, examined him, and spoken to him—I have formed the opinion that he has had similar attacks before—I have not seen him under the influence of one, but I have questioned his comrades and himself—under an attack of epileptic vertigo the patient occasionally falls to the ground; that is only in the major attack, and when it is severe—as a rule they do not fall to the ground—there is often a loss of power, as if in a dead sleep, similar to a case of somnambulism, during which time the mind is absolutely gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Seeing this case in the paper, I undertook the man's defence; I thought he should be defended—I have not been long in Henrietta Street, not six months; I have been in London a long time—I practice at South End, Catford; I have rooms in Henrietta Street—I am a specialist—I don't know that it is an exceptional thing for a medical man to undertake a defence—I prepared the proof myself; it was a matter that I thought would not probably occur to an ordinary medical man, and I communicated with the Colonel of his regiment—he said they were not going to undertake his defence, and I thought it was a view that should be placed before a jury—the view is, that the man having a rifle in his hand, automatically went through the movements customary to him, that is, loading and firing, and that he was oblivious of the fact that he was a sentry—such a thing might happen to him at any place and under any circumstances—I mean that he did not appreciate the act he was doing, not that he was insane, but unconscious, that he had no mind at all at the time—I saw him alone for about half an hour—I did not ascertain that during the whole time he had been in his regiment he had only been twice under the care of a doctor, once for diarrhoea, and once for a sprained ankle—I did not inquire, I wrote to the military surgeon, but had no answer from him—I obtained the prisoner's consent to this defence—I knew the serious consequences that follow a verdict of insanity; I explained that to him, and that he would go to Broadmoor as a practical lunatic—I did not hold out any promise to him that he might be got out of Broadmoor—I ascertained whether he was a man given to drink—I did not hear that he was punished at times for drunkenness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the umbrella department of Waterloo House and Swan and Edgar, Limited, Regent Street—on 29th July an assistant in another department brought the prisoners to me—the male prisoner said, "Show me some umbrellas"—laid so; he walked away, and Kate Watts remained and selected one at 18s. 6d., with a gold top, but said it was too much—I put it down, and showed her some more, and she chose one at 15s. 6d.—the man came back and asked her if she had made her selection—she said, "Yes, father," and asked if I would send the old one—I said, "Yes," and asked if he would pay—he said he had given a cheque in another department—I asked his address—he said, "153, King Street, Hammersmith"—I made out the bill and sent it down, and the change for the cheque, £4 15s. 9d., was sent up—I went to the cash desk for a minute or so, and when I came back the prisoners had gone without their change—I kept the £4 15s. 9d.—I then went to the pile of umbrellas and found this old one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying on the top, and the 18s. 6d. one gone—I should not like to give anything for this one—I sent it to 153, King Street. Hammersmith, with the invoice, and it came back—the gold-top umbrella has Swan and Edgar's name inside it—it has been used—we only had two in stock, and I have got the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and decorator, and did live at 40, Landry Road, Fulham—I was married on March 25th, 1882—on 17th May my wife was at work at the French Exhibition in the kitchen—previous to that we had got on very well on the whole—we sometimes had a word—her behaviour became very indifferent to me and the children—there were two children of her former husband, and two of mine—on 19th July I found a portrait of the prisoner, and my marriage certificate and some artificial teeth which the prisoner had bought for my wife, all in a silk handkerchief—I did not know him by sight at the time, but I made inquiries, and went to the French Exhibition; produced a card, and saw the prisoner there—he was employed in the kitchen—I asked him if he knew the portrait—he looked at it, and said, "How did you get it?"—I said, "Who did you give it to?"—he said, "Me don't understand"—I said, "I found this in my wife's pocket last night"—on July 28th I went to the Exhibition; saw the prisoner coming out, and followed him to his lodgings in Lawn Terrace, North End Road—I wag standing there, and he said, "What for are you watching me?"—I said, "Why did you decoy my wife away from four little children?"—he struck me with a knuckle-duster, and I struck him in the face—he said, "I have got something in my pocket which will do for you"—I said, "Use it; you are no man, taking my wife away"—he went away, and came back with a constable, and said he was frightened to go home—I told the constable he was living with my wife—that was in his hearing—the constable told him to go home, and he went into his lodgings—I remained on the opposite side of the way, and then went and leant on the railings—there was a light in the room, and I could see the shadows of my wife in her night-dress and the prisoner in his shirt sleeves on the blind, and I distinguished my wife's voice—I did not see anyone look out—I had not been there long when a shot was fired—the blind was still down—I felt my hand was shot, and the bullet passed through the rim of my hat—my wife called out, "Tom, is that you?"—my hand bled—I afterwards saw that the ball had struck the house over the way—I called out, "I am shot"—I sent for the police—No. 401 came up and knocked at the door more than once, but no one came—he then got in through the window, and called me in—I went in, and saw my wife and the prisoner inside, and a clock and several things in the room which I recognised as mine—I charged the prisoner.</p>

I was on duty in North End Road—Saunders spoke to me and complained that he had been shot—there was a slight graze on his hand and a little blood—I afterwards saw the hole in his hat at the station—I went to 11, Lawn Terrace, and knocked at the door—it was not answered—I waited two or three minutes, and finding the sash unfastened, I raised it and got in—two panes of glass were broken directly under the catch—one was a long smash and the other a bullet hole—the glass above the catch was not broken—the bullet hole was immediately under the catch—no one was in the room—I went up stairs to a back room, and found the prisoner and Mrs. Saunders—they were both dressed—the prisoner passed something to her—I asked him what it was—she said, "It is a revolver"—I said, "Have you a revolver?"—he said, "No"—I called Saunders upstairs—he identified the prisoner—T said, "I shall take you into custody"—he made no reply—I took him down to the front room, and found a brown leather revolver case—I picked it up, and asked him where the revolver was—he said, "Mrs. Saunders has it upstairs"—a six-chambered revolver was afterwards produced—five chambers were loaded—one had been discharged, and the empty cartridge case was in it—there was a hole through the blind corresponding with the bullet-hole in the glass, and a little smoke on it, and a similar hole through a pane of glass in a window on the opposite side of the road, on the same level, and a graze on the shutter inside—when the prisoner was charged, he said, "I fired the revolver to frighten him. I could have killed him if I had wished. I was only standing two yards away."</p>

I am not satisfied with what you tell me, and I shall take you to the police-station"—he said, "All right, they know me there"—we walked some distance towards the station without my putting my hand on him—at the corner of the Grange Road, without saying a word, he suddenly attacked me, and struck at me right and left with his fists—he had one of these graving tools, which he uses in his trade, in each hand—he struck me several blows about the chest and the body, and on the head and also on the mouth, and cut my lip—I tried to ward off the blows—I struggled with him, and blew my whistle—Turner came, and ultimately another constable, and the prisoner was taken to the station and charged—he said nothing in reply—I was taken home on the ambulance, and was not out of bed for six weeks; I am still under the doctor's hands, I am in a little pain now—I did not see these tools till I had got the prisoner down on the ground, and had him by the hands—I felt I was struck by something, and I thought it was a knife—I was wearing this cape; there are holes through it—I bled much, one wound in the chest penetrated to my ribs, the others were slight—there are eight holes through my tunic, and four through my trousers.</p>

I live at 36, Edge Street, Notting Hill—I am beadle of St. George's Church, Notting Hill—when I left the church about nine o'clock on August 6th the doors and windows were fastened—I returned next morning at eight, and found a window at the back had been forced open, and the doors of the vestry had been forced open—ten collecting boxes had been opened; no money had been left in them, but drawers in the vestry had been forced open, and between £9 and £10 had been taken out—I missed this timepiece, which cost about £4—I found someone had got in by a window—there was a mark on the stone where something had been put under it to force the window open—nothing but the string held the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as Williams and Co., isinglass merchants, at 50, Commercial Street—I have known Copping for about nine or twelve months—my first transaction with him was about December, 1889—I had another in February, 1890—about July I communicated with Mr. Chamberlain, also an isinglass merchant, trading as Henry Giles and Co.—I had lost isinglass at that time and am now—on Tuesday, 29th July, Copping came to me; he brought with him a sample of isinglass, and asked me if I would buy it, naming the price, 3s. 6d. a lb.—I told him to come next day and bring the bulk—in the meantime I gave a message about the police—Copping came on the Wed<lb/>nesday</p>

Isinglass is principally used by brewers to fine the beer; it is used by many persons who deal in hops—it is a limited trade, and there are comparatively few in the trade—I never heard of a small lot being bought or sold—I call this a most irregular proceeding; any person buying or selling a small lot would arouse suspicion; under a hundredweight is rather a small lot—I did not make any inquiry as to who or what Copping was; on the first occasion I bought of him 33 lb., and on the second a hundredweight—on both occasions I gave the market price—I did not communicate with the police—I suggested to Copping that the proceeding was most irregular, that he should be quite sure where he got it from, and that he should ask the man where he got it—that was not at the first transaction; I have had three or four transactions with him—I could not have said that I only had two transactions with him; I had two previous to those mentioned, on 17th November 77 1/2 lb. at 2s. 9., and December 13th 33 lb., and then came the two lots we are speaking of—I happen to have paid the market price for all of them—it was when he came first that I asked him to speak to the man he bought it of—He sold to me three times" after that—he said the first time that he was quite satisfied it was got perfectly honestly—I don't think I asked him for any reference; Mr. Chamberlain happened to mention to me in conversation that he was being robbed—if I have said that I did not communicate with anyone outside my office until Mr. Chamberlain called upon me that would be correct—he did not come to my office; I met him out—I understood that Copping was in the seed and corn line—I thought I was buying my own isinglass—I did not send for the police; I took steps in my own factory to try and find the thief; I thought it was one of my own people who was robbing me—when Copping left the sample he called by appointment at my office—he was there to explain his possession when the police and Mr. Chamberlain were there—I presume he was asked who he bought it from, but I can't remember much of the conversation.</p>

Dear says he has been stealing it, and dividing the money with you"—he made no reply—when the charge was read to them at the station neither made any reply—they all gave their right addresses—Copping's is 18, Wellington Road, St. John's Wood.</p>

               <p>after a week or two he said he knew where to dispose of some isinglass, and I said very well, and we did it then—after that, isinglass was taken by Harris—I was always outside when it was taken, but I know how it was done—there was a padlock on the trapdoor, and he had to open both doors to get the stuff—Harris picked the lock of the store-room door with a piece of iron; then he took the key out of the store-room, and opened the padlock, and went down—I first knew Copping about three years ago—Charlie Harley introduced him to me—in December, 1889, I met Copping on Tower Hill, and he asked me if I had any stuff to sell him—I said I did not know till I had asked Harris—I asked Harris, and make an arrangement with Copping to meet him again—he said he would tell me where to send the stuff in, and two or three days after I sent the stuff, about 30 lb., which Harris got out of the stock-room, to the place Copping told me, 17, Water Lane, I think the number was—the next I took was about February or March—I saw Copping before that, in February, he told me he had some money, and could buy some more if I had it, and he showed me some bank notes—I spoke to Harris, and a man carried about a hundredweight up to Rood Lane—I saw no one there, Copping had gone away then—about a fortnight before I was arrested, on 24th or 25th July, I saw Copping by Hart Street, Mark Lane—he had not paid me for the lot he had in February—he told me he had lost a lot of money, and could not afford to pay me—I said 1 should have nothing to do with it, I should set Harris on him, and let Harris speak to him about it—he said it was no good, but after a while we went into a public-house and had a drink, and he made an arrangement with me there to write to me in a week and let me know; he was to write to a friend to send me some money, and he should give me that money for another lot of stuff—he wrote to me the following week to meet him on Tower Hill—I met him—he told me he had not the money, but he would write me again, as he had not heard from his friend—he wrote to me again—I met him in Wormwood Street—he said I was to fetch Harris with me the next time I met him—I took Harris, and he and I met Copping about six o'clock a week after that—the same day that I met him at Wormwood Street I met him with Harris at six o'clock at the Monument public-house, and while we were there he went out and brought in Arthur Cooper, who was to hand Copping some money, but he would not do so, to pay for this lot that he had had in February—then Copping arranged to meet me two days after on Tower Hill—he then met me and gave me £5—next day I met him, and he gave me £6—I went down on to the Custom House Quay and gave Harris half, and we went back to our work—that afternoon that he gave me the £6 Cooper came to my place, and when he had given me the £6 I gave him a note, which was supposed to be a ticket for goods at the railway station, but it was not really, as there were no goods there—the next day Cooper came to the cellar at our place with this note, and whistled down and said, "I want you here"—I went up, and he arranged with me to meet Copping at a public-house—I met Copping at the City Arms, a public-house close to my master's place in Tower Street—Copping said, "Good God, what have you done?" and I told him that I did not know what it was, because I pretended to know nothing about it, and after a good while he</p>

               <p>said he should give us in charge—ho said, "I shall lag the whole affair," meaning he should tell of the whole affair—I said, "The best thing we can do is to go into Seething Lane and give ourselves up"—Copping refused—we went round to Water Lane, and he said if he did not get the stuff he should give Harris and mo a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>, and then ho should clear out of the country—I said, "I shall do nothing about it myself; you must see Harris about it; I am nothing to do with it"—I made an arrangement for him and Harris to meet, and Harris arranged with Copping that they should have £60 worth of stuff—I did not see it come out of the warehouse, but I knew it was going—on the Friday previous to his arrest Copping arranged with Harris to send him that lot of stuff—I met him by the Monument, and he told me the arrangement he had made with Harris, and on the Monday I met him and gave him a note for that lot—it had gone to the Great Eastern booking-office at Fenchurch Street Station—Harris packed it and gave it to a man—I did not see him do it; I was always outside—I saw it the day before—I saw the man carrying it out of the warehouse—I followed the man to the booking-office, and paid twopence for the booking—a ticket was given, and I ran round Tower Hill and gave the ticket to Copping—the next day I was arrested.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. A. GILL</hi>. It was Harris who always stole the isinglass; I was an accomplice, I suppose—I was always the person who took it anywhere, and was found taking it about—I have been doing it five years—he did it before I assisted him; he was accused of it once—I told Mr. Chamberlain he had been doing it—I did not say for many years—he asked me to do it as others had done—I know he did it before, though I cannot prove it, because he and other foremen were accused by the old governor, Mr. Giles—Harris was suspended—I cannot give the name of any person who ever saw Harris dealing in isinglass, or in possession of isinglass, either before or since I have been mixed up in this matter—what first started me was my owing Harris ten shillings and two shillings interest, and my owing money all round, and he asked me to do it—I swear no claim has been made on me for the maintenance of a child—I have not had a child by a woman who is not my wife; a woman had said it is so, but it is not true; she has not applied for nor got an order against me, and I have not paid anything to her or to anyone on her account—this particular isinglass was stolen at from one to half-past one on about Monday, 28th July—I did not stay in the warehouse during the dinner hour—I know Reeves—I might stay for one or three minutes; I am generally out first and away—I was on the stairs on this day—Harris was inside the warehouse—there were two meetings at the Monument Tavern when Harris was present—about 14th July Cooper was there—Harris took the leading part in the conversation on that day—Cooper was at the bar, and back and outside the house—he was talking about lending money—he could hear to a certain extent—Harris talked to Copping and Cooper.</p>

When I first began to steal, fire years ago, Harris did the selling—the first person I sold to was Copping's partner, Charley Harley—that was when they had an office close to one of the yards in the Borough, the Queers Head, I believe—Harley introduced me to Copping—I know Harley's father; Harris has sold to him, I did not—since then I have sold to Harley's father—I first sold isinglass</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080099"/>
               <p>about eighteen months ago—Harley's father was bankrupt, he had no business—I met him in the Borough, and he spoke about what he had done, and said could we do anything for him—I heard he was a distant relation of the firm—he knew I was a thief, robbing my employers; I did not put it in such plain words—he knew it was stolen property, and he must have known I was a thief—I had two or three transactions with him, I suppose—I made no false statement to him, because I knew he knew all about it—young Harley knew I was a thief, too—I sold to Copping and Coventry—Coventry did not know I was a thief, because I sold to him through Harley—I did not sell to Coventry myself at all—if Coventry said he bought from me, and that I told him I had collected it as dock samples, it would not be true—Harley told him about the dock samples, and told me to say that too if I was asked how I came by it—he never asked me—I might have told Coventry that, but I never sold to him directly—I sold Harley two lots—it did not occur to me I might get a better price for it if I said I picked it up as dock samples—Harley told me to say it was dock samples, because he thought Coventry would not take it on if he knew it was stolen—Harley did not say it was stolen; Coventry thought it was got honestly, because Harley told him it was dock samples—he said to me, "Are you going to send some isinglass into my place?"—he did not ask how I got it—I don't remember if I told him—I did not tell him I had collected it from different lots, and was entitled to it—I have not represented myself as a man with money, having shares in companies, or as a speculator, buying barrels and casks—I have made excuses to get out to buy casks and kegs for the firm—I did not tell him I attended sales at the docks—I have never done so—I went to the London Docks in the course of my work—the last conversation I had with either of the Harleys was about four or five months ago—I did not know Harley sold to Mr. Chamberlain, because he has told me they never dealt or did anything with our firm since they failed two years ago—I did not say that the reason I stole was because I was pressed for money by a woman, nor that she came and made a disturbance at our place of business—they have come there, but not for money—I made a statement in this case to clear myself, because I have been wanting to stop this for a good while, and I have been threatened so often that I said I would tell the truth of the whole lot, so that it could all be cleared up—the first statement I made was to Mr. Chamberlain—I did not mention any name then—Leman came to me when I wrote for him, when I was under remand—my father came and said to me, "Why don't you plead guilty?"—I said, "I am going to make a statement"—I had heard that if the prisoners pleaded guilty the case might be dealt with before the Magistrate, and I thought it would be better than lying about so long with it on my mind—I wanted to plead guilty for the benefit of all of us—both of the other prisoners said they would plead guilty at the start—I made the statement in the interest of all of us; I did not think I should be let off lighter; I don't suppose now that I shall—I certainly did not think that if they were convicted it might benefit me—I didn't suppose it would affect me either way—the detective asked me no questions—he asked if I wished to make a statement, and I made it—he did not tell me what he knew; when I mentioned one time, he said, "That was when I missed you"—I asked Harris and Copping if they were going 'o plead guilty—I did not say in the cells that if they did not plead guilty I</p>

I am a builder, of 12, Maiden Lane, Strand—I was the owner of 11, Woodfield Crescent, Harrow Road, which was to let in February, 1888, and Mr. Carter wrote, and the prisoner afterwards called with him—Mr. Carter said that he had brought a tenant, lie brought an agreement with him—I had received this letter from Mr. Carter, in which he names the references—the prisoner represented himself as of Lancaster Street, Hyde Park, and gave as references, Mr. Hall, 216, Belsize Park, Kilburn, and Mr. Darling, 11, Glengall Road, Kilburn—I do not think anyone wrote to them—the prisoner said that he had held the Edinburgh Castle in the Strand, and his aunt was there, who was going to live in our house—he went into possession at the end of January, but the rent did not commence till March 25—this is the agreement he sighed, it is dated February 22—he paid no rent, I distrained in October—I got a letter on 11th July, saying he was sorry he could not pay the rent that day, but would send" it on the 23rd—I received a visit from Scorey and Richards or Gurling, who I saw before the Magistrates at Marylebone in February this year—they asked me if 1 knew what sort of a tenant I had got at No. 11—I said I thought I had not got a very good one, for I could not get any rent—Richards, I think, said, "He is a scoundrel"—they urged me to place the matter in their hands to get possession, and could do so in three weeks if I would pay £2 or £3—I said I would not—he then suggested another person to collect the rents from the lodgers for me, which I agreed to—the prisoner never lived in the house, it was let out to lodgers—the time ran out nearly three weeks, and I then received this document by post. (<hi rend="italic">An agreement between Wells, Scorey, and. Richards</hi>)—I believe the signature W. Wells to be the prisoner's—I received several letters from him, also from</p>

In February, 1888, the prisoner came to me and asked the particulars of 11, Woodville Crescent—he gave me the names of two references; Darling was one—I afterwards went with him to Mr. Walden, the landlord, and he signed an agreement which I witnessed—before he signed it he showed me the Edinburgh Castle public-house in the Strand, and said he had sold it, and expected to have £3,000 or £4,000 shortly—in the following April I went to 11, Woodville Crescent on behalf of a lodger named Burridge, and saw Richards, Scorey, and Wells—I said to the brokers, "Will you kindly show me your warrant, as you are going to distrain on Mr. Burridge?"—they refused, and used most disgraceful language, and a mob of two hundred people assembled out<lb/>side the door—the first quarter's rent was due in June, and shortly after that I met the prisoner in Chippenham Road—he said he meant to make Mr. Alder give him £10 to go out, and give him a receipt in full for the rent; and after he was out Richards and Scorey would still be in possession, and he would have to give them something to go out, and after they had got the money they would still stay on—on 2nd August Richards and Scorey came to my office about Hatton's matter—Hatton was outside—they brought a sewing machine and other things to be sold, having lent ten shillings on them—I afterwards paid the proceeds to Richards and Scorey—I saw Wells, Richards, and Scorey together several times after that, up to their conviction—it is not true that they ceased to have any connection after the quarrel at Mr. Walden's.</p>

I am a stonemason, of 1, Kennington Oval—I am entrusted with the letting of 12, Cedars Road, Fulham; the landlord is Mr. Hitch—about the middle of February the prisoner came to me about the house; he said he was a decorator, in business with his brother, and lived at 29, Princes Road, Shepherds Bush, that his father had died and left them a lot of property which had to be divided, but he could not agree with his brother and sisters, and they were going to sell the property and divide it—he referred me to John Carter, 8, Carleton Road, Hammersmith, and Mr. Freeman, 38, Alexander Road, South Kensington—I wrote to them, and received this reply</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher of Angel Lane, Stratford—on Easter Monday I gave the prisoner £3 to put on Hex, a horse running in the Grand National—Hex won, and I saw the prisoner from time to time, but could get no money out of him, though I asked him several times—the Derby Day was June 4th, and several days before that he said, "I have got forty to two on Sainfoin, you can go halves with me if you like," and showed me a paper; I said, "Yes"—I had a form, and he gave it to Mr. Ponsford, who kept it; he is my friend, and is a wheelwright at Leytonstone—I afterwards asked for the voucher—I saw it before the Magistrate—I went to the Derby and saw Sainfoin win—I saw the prisoner next day at Mr. Penbury's; he said he was very glad the horse had won—I said, "Where is the proper voucher?"—he said, "At home"—I said, "This is no good, you must fetch it"; that was the one Ponsford held—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "I do not want it if it is like what it was at Easter," but he went home and fetched it—he said, "Oh no, I won't do you," and gave me another paper, and said, "Don't show it to anybody"—I put it in my</p>

               <p>pocket, and went to Epsom to fetch my horse and cart—I gave him 4 half-sovereign—he wanted the voucher from me at the railway station, and said he would send it from there to Boulogne—I said, "I have left it at home"—I let him have £1, because he said he had no money, and then I let him have 10s. to get a coat out of pawn—on 6th of June, he sent for me to Ponsford's, and said, "I want to send the voucher away to get the money"—I went in and took the voucher, and he wrote on it and said, "Now you may see me send it off," and he wrote in a book; he said, "I have made it payable to you, and I saw him put the same piece of paper into the envelope, which I saw him write, and I walked across to the poet office with him, Harrow Green, Leytonstone—he handed it in there—I paid the fee, and got the receipt and kept it, and I believed it was the same letter into which I had seen him put something—I then gave him £2, in the belief that £42 was coming to me from J. Wallace, the commission agent at Boulogne—I saw the prisoner again on Saturday, June 7th, he could not pay Mr. Akinson the solicitor, and I let him have £2 more; he said, "I won't do you, you will have the cheque on Monday morning"—I believed that, and on Tuesday morning I got a telegram about 9.30.—the prisoner was there when it arrived and read it; this is it, "Mills, care of Dowle, butcher, Leytonstone; letter and cheque follow, Wallace, Anderton's Hotel"—he then said would I let him have £3, as he had got the brokers in—I did not let him have any more money—on the Wednesday morning, about 10 o'clock, I received this letter—I then consulted my solicitor, Mr. Sharman, and afterwards saw Detective Forth—I appeared at the Police-court, and gave evidence there.</p>

I am a solicitor, of West Ham—I appeared before on both occasions, and saw the prisoner using notes—one was made on a portion of this engraving—I was sitting near him, in front—the dock is behind the solicitors' table—the paper on which he wrote fell in front of me, face downwards, revealing a portion of the engraving—it was a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> of April 12th, and a portion of the same engraving is in the Dead Letter office envelope—during the hearing of the case I compared this portion with the portion which fell from Mills' hand, and found they corresponded, and the other piece of paper in the Dead Letter office envelope corresponds with another agreement in the <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> of the same date—I saw him writing on another portion of that engraving—he said time after time that he acknowledged sending the envelope containing the piece of paper, but he had no intention to defraud, and Mr. Dowle's proper action was to go to the County-court for the money—he called for a notice to produce, which he had written and served on, I think Mrs. Dowle, and commented on the writing of the notice to produce, which he said was in his own writing, and the letter in the name of Wallace, from Anderton's Hotel.</p>

I shan't be no more than an hour"—I said, "Yes, go and get it"—he came back with the horse and cart, and said, "I shan't be no more than an hour if I sell the horse"—I did not see him again till Friday, 29th, when I met him by chance in St. Mary's Road—I said, "You have been a long hour with my cart"—he said, "Yes, George, I am ashamed to come and see you; I got with a company of a lot of them, and they got me drunk; I sold the cart for 22s., and I spent the money partly in drink"—he said he had sold the horse for 10s.—I told him I wanted the cart; he said I could get nothing out of nothing—I asked him to come round in the afternoon; he did not come—I asked him whether he had the cart; he had not, and I gave him into custody—I gave him no directions to sell the cart for me—I valued it at £2 5s., but it was worth more.</p>

I would charge you with stealing it—you said, "I walked thirty miles yesterday; I cannot find it"—I said I wanted it or the value of it—you said you could not help it; it was drunk in fourpenny ale—you did not drink it all—you only sold one pony for me, and I paid you for it—the man gave £3 10s. for the cart before I had it, and paid 9s. for a wheel.</p>

I live at 60, Malta Road, Leyton, and am a draper—Mr. Hughes lives next door at No. 62—on 4th August, at twenty minutes to eleven, I heard a noise; I went outside and saw a light upstairs at No. 62, at Hughes's, and went to get assistance—when I came back, I saw the prisoner and another man come out of the front door—Mrs. Bolton was with me—I asked what they had been going in there for—they both said, "All right, old man, we are friends of the family," and walked briskly away—a neighbour blew a whistle; I followed them; as they turned the corner, I met Mr. Martin, and said something to him, and we both ran after them, Mr. Martin in front—we followed them into Water Road—we did not lose sight of them from the time they left Mr. Hughes's house—the prisoner ran into an empty garden in Park Place—a constable came up; we went into the garden and found the prisoner there; he is the man whom I saw come out of the house—I returned to Mr. Hughes's and found the house had been broken into—I knew Mr. Hughes was out of town; he asked me to keep an eye on the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Daisy Villas, Manor Road, Leyton, and am a bamboo-worker—on Bank Holiday, about a quarter to eleven, I was in Manor Road; I heard a whistle within perhaps one hundred yards of Hughes's house—Malta Road runs out of Manor Road—I had just turned the corner when I heard some one saying they could not keep their shoes on—I turned round and saw Sayer, who made a communication to me, and pointed to two men in front of me—I ran after them—directly they heard my footsteps they ran also—I lost sight of the short one in Park Place, but I saw the prisoner enter a gateway, and I stood outside till a constable came up—then we went into the garden, and secured the prisoner behind a bush—he was taken back to 62, Malta Road, where Mr. Sayer and Mrs. Bolton identified him—he seemed rather surprised at being taken into custody—the constable went behind and pinned his arms, and he asked what it was for, and I said, "You know as well as we do"—he was taken to the police-station and charged.</p>

I am thirteen years old—the prisoner is my mother—we lived in Valentine Street, Wandsworth—the deceased, Frank Ernest Higgs, was my brother; he was about five months old—I have one sister older than myself, the baby came after me—on 7th July I went to school, leaving mother and the baby alone in the house—we had a zinc bath, which I think was outside the house when I went out—there was also a small zinc bath kept in the scullery—I came home about a quarter to one—I knocked at the door, but got no answer—I went through the next door, Mrs. Harlow's, got over the fence, and went up to the back parlour window, and looked in—I saw the small zinc bath with</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 23, North Street, Wandsworth—I have known the prisoner about seven years—I attended her in her last confinement; she had not had a child for about 13 years—her husband is a builder or carpenter—she got through her confinement very well; there was no puerperal disturbance—the child was a very fine baby—before its birth the prisoner was in very good health, except that she had a skin disease, about which she consulted me two or three times—some weeks after the birth of the child I noticed that she was very depressed, and anxious about her child—she suckled it—I thought it best that she should wean it, considering her depression and weakness—she did so—but she seemed to think the effect would be to cause it to waste away—I saw her at the surgery several times afterwards concerning herself—she always appeared depressed and anxious about the child when there was no necessity for it—the child was born on 17th January—I saw the child up to the Monday before this happened, and spoke to the father about it—I thought it was suffering from the commencement of tubercular meningitis, that is practically consumption, only it affects the brain; it ultimately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189009080123"/>
               <p>causes wasting—I saw the mother and child on the Sunday—she was then very depressed and anxious about the child—on the Monday, about a quarter to one, I was called to the house—I saw the child on Mrs. Berryman's knee; it had been dead some time—I afterwards saw the prisoner in bed partly dressed—her expression was vacant; she did not appear to understand any question I put to her—this was two or three weeks after she had weaned the child—after a time I asked her what she had done with the child—she said, "I have killed it, because I could not bear to see it waste away"—it was a little wasted, but it really was a very fine child at the time of its death; rather abnormally large, very well developed, and very well nourished—I made a post-mortem examination—there was no mark of violence upon it of any kind; it had undoubtedly died of drowning, although there were signs of tubercular meningitis, but not sufficient at that period to have caused death—it was certainly alive when it got into the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner always appeared very anxious about the child, even before I advised the weaning, she suffered in health from nourishing it—she was very reluctant to wean it—she afterwards said she thought its state was due to her weaning it, she called herself unnatural—she was depressed to an extraordinary degree—I saw her nearly every day during the last eight days—during the whole of that time her manner was very strange—I formed the conclusion when I saw her on the day of the child's death, that she was suffering from melancholia, and that she was not responsible for her actions on that day—she was a very affectionate mother; a woman of a very affectionate disposition.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Arthur Firmin, and have resided at 3, Honeywell Road, Wandsworth Common, for nine years—on 16th January this year Mrs. Conway came to reside at No. 1, next door—I had been on terms of intimacy with the previous occupier of that house for seven years—Mrs. Conway first wrote to me about erecting a wall—the gardens were separated by a wooden fence, and she wrote asking if I had any objection to a wall being erected; at the same time she complained that a little pet monkey of mine had picked off some leaves—I gave permission, and the wall was erected, and some trellis—we were on friendly terms with her up to the first week in June—my husband then wished me not to be so—after that Mrs. Conway's conduct and language was most abusive over the wall, and she accused me of behaving indecently to the tiny monkey—that occurred continually; I could never go into the garden without being annoyed in some way—she never called me anything else but a dirty, filthy bitch—numbers of men used to frequent her place—I was ill for four weeks before this occurrence; I had a nervous shock principally owing to this system; I was attended all that time; I do not know anything about the conviction at the Police-court; I was in bed at the time; it was for abusing my son in the street—my monkey died on 9th August from strychnine on Sunday, 17th August, I came down from my room, and rested in the garden for an hour, and on Monday I came down about half-past four and went into the garden—I had seen the two prisoners in the garden before I left my room—between half-past four and five I was in the garden, leaning forward to pull over some of my beans into the arbour; I had my hands up above my head when I suddenly felt something come on my forehead, first of all two drops; I dropped the piece of string that I was using, and I was in the act of catching hold of the girl's shoulder, and I distinctly heard a slight noise, and felt something coming on my forehead—I made an exclamation to myself, and 1 heard them both laughing loudly—I knew their laugh perfectly well—I immediately went into the scullery; there was a large pan of water there, and I washed it off; it was burning intensely—previous to that I called the attention of my servant and Mrs. Kersley, a laundress, to see what it was; I said, "Oh, it has burnt me!"—they both came forward and looked, and said it was a whitish fluid—the burning did not subside; I called Margaret to fetch my hat, and I went straight down to Mr. James, the chemist, leaning on one of my little boys, for I was very weak—he looked at it, but did nothing; he advised me to go and see my doctor at once—I did not go to my own doctor, because he had visited me in the morning, and told me he should not be in—Dr. Hefferman came in the evening, after my husband arrived—I have still the marks on my forehead (<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>); the doctor has been attending me for it; it has affected me very much; I was in bed</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. The application about building the wall was made to my husband; we paid nothing towards it—this letter of 7th June was written by my husband. (<hi rend="italic">Giving his consent to the wall being built</hi>)—I don't know the height of the wall—on 14th July my husband received this letter from Mrs. Conway (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>); that was answered on July 15th by my husband, and on the 18th this letter came. (<hi rend="italic">These letters were read</hi>)—after that my husband communicated with Mr. Johnson—I did not see him; I know his wife better than him—he is no connection of mine—I had not spoken to Mrs. Conway about him that I know of; I never spoke to her about my husband getting his discharge from bankruptcy—I know he has got his discharge—after I came downstairs I heard of an action for libel and slander against Mrs. Conway—she said I had followed her trustee about; I never had; I certainly met him several times—I swore an information before a Magistrate about this occurrence; I complained of the abuse—I went into the garden between half-past four and five; I was inside the arbour; my servant was close beside me—I was pulling my beans from the wall; they had not grown so high as the trellis-work; a Virginia creeper was on the top of the trellis-work. (<hi rend="italic">A number of photographs were produced, and the witness pointed out upon them the position in which she stood</hi>)—I had nothing in my hands that I know of; I had been using a towel, which I had thrown over my shoulder—I gave a description before the Magistrate of tins—I don't know that I have ever stated before to-day about the sound I heard—I did not wipe the stuff off with the towel—I called the witnesses to see what had happened; I said, "What is that?"—I felt a burning pain, and said, "Will you come and see what she has thrown at me?"—I wanted witnesses at once; I did not leave it there in order that they might see it; Margaret was on the spot, and Mrs. Kersley was at the scullery door; of course I wished them to see it—I don't know that that was the reason why I did not wipe it off; the whole thing did not take a minute—I wished them to be convinced that there was something on my forehead, because she had been very rude before—I had not seen Mrs. Conway, but I knew she was there—I said, "See what this horrid woman has done; she has either burnt or poisoned me"—I can't say that I walked to the scullery without touching my forehead; I believe I did put up a handkerchief in the first place, and then went in and washed it on—I can't tell you where the handkerchief or cloth is; it was left in the water, I suppose—I never thought about it; I was only too anxious to get to the chemist's—I believe I put one or other to my face, because I thought it might be my eyes; I thought it was intended for that—I did not wipe it off—I put it up to my face till I got to the water—I have not looked for it; it never occurred to me that it might have a mark on it; it was never suggested to me—I believe I left it in the water—I did not go or send for the police; it was as much as I could do to get to the chemist's—there was no blister on my forehead at that time; afterwards in the evening it came out in little tiny pin's heads all over; it was very much inflamed when the chemist saw it; very red—I went to ask him what it was, and what I should do to it—I told him I had washed it off, and I told the doctor so—I did not tell him I had used a handkerchief or</p>

               <p>towel—he asked to see my dress; not the towel—the dress was examined to see if there was any mark on it—I did not touch my forehead with my hands, only with the towel—some of the burning stuff would have gone on the towel—it was some time after nine when the doctor came—I felt one drop first of all, and the others followed almost immediately after; I can't tell how many, three or four—I found no mark on my dress, or on my hair—I did not look about in the arbour for any marks then or afterwards—I believe I was in bed the whole of Tuesday—my husband communicated with Mr. Johnson on Tuesday—I never com<lb/>plained to the police at all, my husband did; I don't know when—I saw Mr. Johnson on Wednesday—he took down what I said, and on Thursday I went to the Police-court with my servant and a friend in a cab—I heard both the prisoners laughing—I spoke so that I could be heard—I did not hear anything said—I believe I went into the garden afterwards, when I came back from the chemist's; I simply went to see where I had been standing, to see how she could push it through—I could not say what time that was; it was not six, because when I came down from the window, where I saw Sadler wiping the wall, it was not six—I don't think I went into the garden after that; my servant was with me then and my little boy; I did not hear anything said—I believe in the first account I gave I did say that Conway said to Sadler, "If she chooses to throw burning stuff on her own face, and then say we did it, that is her look out; I know the law as well as she does"—I had quite forgotten that—those are the words she used—I have not been on the stage only as an amateur—I have been paid for it; the principals are always paid—in the first account I gave I did not say that Mrs. Kersley and Margaret saw the fluid on my face <hi rend="italic">and</hi> wiped it off, that is a mistake; it ought to be, "and I wiped it off"—Conway said, "If you do this to your face you must take the consequences"—she said that directly afterwards—I did not say that I saw Sadler wiping the trelliswork; I said, "Wiping the wall"—I don't know what she was wiping—I know that a piece of the trellis was cut out after this.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been servant to Mr. and Mrs. Firmin three years—I remember Mrs. Conway coming to live at No. 1—they were friendly at first, afterwards they became unfriendly—I heard Mrs. Conway say many dreadful things, have I got to repeat them?—two or three times she called Mrs. Firmin a filthy bitch—I remember the monkey dying—my mistress had been ill for nearly five weeks previous to the 18th August; she came down for a little while on the Sunday—on the Monday she came down in the morning and stayed a little while; after dinner she went to lie down, and about four she came down again; she came in the kitchen to me between half-past four and five, she went into the arbour to tie up her beans—she had tied one bean, and had just got the string to tie another, she dropped it, and I was in the act of stooping to pick it up, when she caught hold of me and said, "Oh, Margaret, that horrid woman has either burnt or poisoned me!"—I looked up, and saw something white, like a milky fluid, just one drop over her eyes, and as I looked up at her I saw two or three more drops come through the trellis-work—I saw the fluid—I did not hear it just then—it all went on</p>

               <p>her forehead—that was all I saw—some might have gone on the ground—I did not hear the prisoners laugh then, but when my mistress called Mrs. Kersley to witness it on her face I heard both the prisoners laugh—shortly after, when mistress went down to the chemist's, I went up to the bath-room window looking into the Conway's garden, and I then heard Mrs. Conway say to her servant, "Oh, I can't help it; if she throws stuff on her own face I can't be blamed for it"—my mistress had not mentioned her face, when she said, "That horrid woman has burnt me"—I had not noticed them in the garden before this.</p>

Nitric acid would leave a yellow stain; sulphuric acid is supposed to leave a brown stain—I have seen sulphuric acid applied to the hands—I cannot say that it produces an unmistakable brown mark; on the hard cuticle it would not; it would not produce a dark brown colour on the forehead—a strong corrosive fluid, if left on, would entirely destroy the skin, and then you could not tell the nature of the fluid—I am not going so far as to say this was an acid; it was a corrosive fluid, but I do not think it was an acid; it was a violent irritant—I looked at the dress, but saw nothing; I did not look at the trellis or the leaves; it was dark; I had no opportunity—caustic, although a very powerful alkali, will have the same effect on the skin as a powerful acid—it must undoubtedly have been a powerful irritant—an acid rapidly applied and quickly removed would produce a blister like that she had—there need not be a continued application of a corrosive fluid to raise a blister; any powerful irritant or alkali would do it—I have never tried American potash; I have seen the effects of it on the eye, not on the skin.</p>

Conway came to live next door my wife had been friendly with her—from what I afterwards told my wife they ceased to be friendly—in consequence of her insulting one of my children on 6th August, I got a summons against her—on the 8th our monkey died, the same night that she accepted service of a writ for libel; on Friday night it was poisoned—the libel was in respect of the letter accusing my wife of lying and stealing—the monkey was poisoned on the night of the 8th; we found it dying when we came from the Police-court, on the hearing of the summons, and it lingered till Sunday morning at six—I was present at the Police-Court when the summons was heard; but I was not in the Court, I was ordered out—she was fined twenty shillings or fourteen days, and costs; that was on the</p>

I am lecturer on forensic medicine—I have been in practice since 1865 in Savile Row—I have been in court, and heard Mr. Hefferman's evidence—a blister may be raised in a few seconds, minutes, or hours, it depends entirely upon the agent, a very strong escoretic will do it in a few seconds, in a few minutes if weaker, and in a few hours if quite weak; but the agent must be applied continuously before the blister rises, and if removed at any distance of time the effect ceases—if the solution is very strong it destroys the skin, then a blister will not rise, because the cuticle is destroyed—as far as the evidence here goes it was removed in a very few seconds, and as there was only redness there was no possibility of a blister forming; it could not form from that cause—the blister was there, but not from the action of any solution; it must have come from some other cause—a strong acid thrown on the forehead and wiped off would cause discolouration of the skin, and there would be an end of it, no blister would follow—carbolic acid to cause a blister must be kept on continuously; if you put it on your hands and wash it off, nothing follows—vitriol destroys the skin; the colour of vitriol is very marked—nitric and all those acids are very marked—hot water would do it, if kept on long enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A very strong acid will not destroy the skin immediately—carbolic-acid left on for fifteen seconds or half a minute, and wiped off, will leave redness, but no blister; you would have to leave it on a minute, a minute and a half, or two minutes—if you wash away the agent you have done with it—vitriol would not do it, if washed off soon; it would leave a discolouration, which would produce a sore, that is not a blister.</p>
