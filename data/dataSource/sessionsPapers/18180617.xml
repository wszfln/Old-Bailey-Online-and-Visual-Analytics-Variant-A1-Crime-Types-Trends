            , ESQ. I live on my private property. On Sunday the 24th of May, I was on a visit at Mr. Young's, 28, Parliament-street, who is my brother-in-law; in the evening him and I were walking together in the Park, from nine until ten o'clock, he left me about a quarter after ten near Buckingham House - I was then making the best of my way home; knowing the Horse Guards gates would be shut, I thought I would go out at Queen-square gate-my nearest way to that gate would be across the Pagoda-bridge. When I arrived at the foot of the bridge a man caught hold of me by the breast of my coat and waistcoat, and tore the corner of my cravat off-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170004"/>I believe he made an attempt at my brooch. He was dressed in dark clothes, not in military uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now - A. Yes, it was the prisoner. When he seized me I put my hand up to defend myself. He turned round and struck my face against the sentry-box, which was two or three steps up the bridge, on the left side-there was no sentry in the box. I immediately called to the sentry, and in the scuffle dragged the prisoner to the top of the bridge, not finding the sentry below. The prisoner said, "give me whatever you have got." When I got to the top of the bridge I called the sentry again, he came, and I insisted on his taking the prisoner in charge; he said, "It is no business of mine." The prisoner asked me again, in the presence of the sentry, to give him whatever I had got; he also said he was the sentry's comrade, and he would not take him in charge; this was in the presence of the sentry. A scuffle ensued. The prisoner told the sentry I had offered him two guineas to ****** him. Upon which I called him a d-d rascal, and requested the sentry to take him in charge while I went for a police-officer. He said he would not. I then requested him to detain us both until the Relief came round; he said he would not do it, and walked away. I then tried to drag the prisoner down to the more public part of the path, upon which he made a snatch at my watch, tore it from my fob, and then ran off. I immediately called Stop thief! he ran over the bridge towards Queen-square gate; just at that instant a gentleman and some ladies appeared. I called out Stop thief! again; the gentleman called to the sentry, who was just by, to stop him; he said he should not. I did not pursue him beyond the bridge, not knowing what accomplices he might have in the dreary part of the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the gentleman - A. Mr. Smith, who lives in Westminster, he was then a stranger to me. As the prisoner passed the sentry I saw him go close to him, and it struck me that he put something into his hand; this was at the top of the bridge. I found the corner of my cravat in the sentry's hand, and took it from him. I then went up the steps again, intending to go to the guard-room. I went towards St. James's Palace, and met some gentleman, I told them I had been robbed - They advised me to go to Bow-street. On Monday morning I went to my watchmaker's, and got the particulars of my watch, as I did not know the number myself. I took the particulars to Bow-street. I had two Napoleons in my pocket at the time, but did not then know it; I knew I was possessed of them, but did not know they were in my pocket - I had put two in my waistcoat-pocket on the Saturday night. I have since discovered that I have lost two Napoleons, but do not know how I lost them. On the Monday after, between five and six o'clock, I was called from dinner to Mr. Jarman's shop, found the prisoner there, and instantly recognized him - He said the watch had been given to him. He was asked if the person was present who gave it to him? he said, No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I did not give him the watch. My grandmother died when I was twelve years of age, and left me independent. I never followed any business. Mr. Young is now in Ireland. My brother asked me to go to Soho-square; as we returned we walked into the Park through the gate opposite to Mr. Coutts's, down by the houses in the Green Park into St. James's Park. My brother told me he was going to call at Pimlico. I declined going with him, as I wanted to go home to my wife, who was not very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the only gates open at that time were the Green Park and Buckingham gates - A. I did not know it. I had lived in Parliament-street five or six weeks, and had lived in London above ten years. I did not know the Queen-square gate was shut - A gentleman told me I could get out. I knew I could get out at Buckingham-gate, but that would be out of my way. I did not know it was ten o'clock until after I had left my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not meet the prisoner before you got to the bridge - A. I swear I never saw him until he laid hold of me by the bridge. I spoke to no person but the gentleman whom I asked if I could get out at the gate. I said nothing to any body about it being a fine night. I took no man by the arm. On my coming to the foot of the bridge the prisoner rushed upon me without saying any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are stronger than him - A. I possibly may be; but I was very ill at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not give him two Napoleons, or two guineas - A. I swear I had not a farthing in my hand from the time I left him until I returned. The prisoner told the sentry I offered him two guineas - He did not say I gave them to him. I did not stop until the Relief came round, as I did not know when it would come. I did not go to the guard-room; a gentleman advised me to go to Bow-street, as I could find the sentry at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Gillham - A. No; I know a Mr. Gill. I have dealt with Mr. Hall, the silversmith. I never took indecent liberties with any man. I have been married two years.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in York-street, Westminster. On the night of the 24th of May I was crossing the Park, with four ladies - I came out at my own back gate, which leads into the Park, and went towards the Pagoda-bridge; when I got on the bridge I saw two men running, the one behind was the prosecutor; he was calling stop thief, and said the person who was before him had stolen his watch, which was worth eighty guineas. I attempted to extricate myself from the ladies, to secure the prisoner, but they screamed out, and I continued with them-the man went on towards the sentry on the bridge - He was about thirty yards from the sentry. I turned round and called to the sentry to stop him, as he was a thief. The sentry said it was not his duty, and he should not stop him. He passed so near the sentry that, if he had put his gun out he must have fallen over it. I never saw the prosecutor or the prisoner before. I mentioned the circumstance to a person belonging to Queen-square office, and they found me out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was on the top of the bridge at the time. I was coming from Queen-square. The people were coming up the steps on the opposite side-we had just got on the level. I could have stopped the man if it had not been for the ladies, he passed me.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in the Strand. On Monday the 25th of May, a watch was brought to my shop, about a quarter after four o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170005"/>the afternoon, for a glass, by a boy, who said he was a potboy at the Jolly Butchers, public-house-it was a very valuable watch, which excited my suspicion. I asked the boy who it belonged to? he said to a soldier, who was at their house, drinking. I told him I had not a glass that would fit, and he must call again for it. I went to the maker of the watch, he said it was stolen. I told him to send for the proprietor. I took an officer to the Jolly Butchers, which is in Hungerford-market, behind my house, I told him to wait outside; I went in but could find no person who claimed it. I left word for the man who owned the watch to be sent to me when he came in. I do not think the boy was there. I returned, and desired the officer to wait opposite my house. In a few minutes the prisoner entered my shop-he was very drunk. The officer came in, I sent him into the back-parlour, and asked the prisoner how he came possessed of the watch? he said he wanted a glass for it, and it was no business of mine, as a gentleman gave it to him; and began relating the manner of its being given to him. Mr. Hooker and Mr. Young, who lives at No. 28, Parliament-street, came into the shop; Mr. Hooker immediately said, "that is the man who took my watch."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I shewed Mr. Hooker the watch, he said it was his. The prisoner immediately said, "I don't think the gentleman is here who gave it to me, for he gave me this chain also;" putting the chain out of his pocket at the time. He then said, "the gentleman who gave me the watch will never come forward I am sure." I said, "Why not?" He said, "the man that gave it to me took unnatural liberties with me." Mr. Hooker and Mr. Young were present. Mr. Hooker said, "Yes, that is the charge I expected; soldiers always make these charges." I said, "Mr. Hooker, under these circumstances, you had better take your watch, chain, and seals." He appeared willing to do so, but Mr. Edmunds, the maker of the watch, who had come in, said, "Mr. Hooker you cannot do so, you must clear your character." I then called the officer from the back-room, and gave the prisoner in charge. The prosecutor requested me to get the examination put off until the next day, that he might advise with his friends whether he should prosecute. I saw Mr. Hooker in the evening, after he had been to Bow-street, and asked him if he had lost any thing besides his watch, chain and seals? Mr. Young was with him. He said he had not. I said I had heard a whisper about some Napoleons. I at first asked him if he had any money in his pocket at the time of the robbery? he said he had not. When I mentioned the Napoleons, he put his hand in his pocket, and said, "Dear me, he must have taken two Napoleons - I had two, and a sixpence."</p>

            . I am a private in the 3d regiment of Foot Guards. I was on duty at the bridge at the time of this transaction, between half-past and three-quarters past ten o'clock at night; the prosecutor and prisoner came up to me-at that time of night. only Buckingham-gate, the passage leading into Pall Mall, and the stable-gate, are open-the other gates are closed at ten o'clock. I was at the top of the bridge, nearest to Birdcage-walk, and heard the cry of sentinel! I do not know who it proceeded from; I went towards the top of the steps (where the cry came from), and saw two men, each had hold of the other - They gave charge of each other-both their mouths opened at the same time. I asked what was the matter? the prosecutor said the prisoner had attempted to rob him of his watch; the prisoner said he had offered him two guineas to ****** him. The prosecutor said he had no such things as guineas, but he had two Napoleons. The prisoner said, "you young b-r, I'll throw you over the bridge." Each persisted in giving charge of the other. I told them it was quite contrary to my orders to take people into custody, and did not do it. They went from the top of the bridge, waited there, and conversed two or three minutes together. I advised each of them to go for a constable, and they both left me with that intention. When they got to the top of the bridge they stood there - I stood in the middle of the bridge watching them; I could not know what passed, but it turned into quite a mild conversation, and I thought they were making it up. Shortly after that one parted from the other-the prisoner walked by me. I cannot say he is the man, nor do I know that he was one of them. As he passed me he said the other was a b-y s-d. After he had passed me three or four yards I heard the prosecutor call Stop thief! he came up and asked me to pursue him; I told him it was contrary to the Articles of War for a man to leave his post, and he had better pursue after him himself. He then asked me if I would stop him if he came that way back? I said I would, and he pursued after him, calling stop thief. I saw nothing more. The prosecutor returned in about twenty minutes. That is all I saw that night. When the man passed me he went towards Queen-square-gate. I went before the magistrate the next day, and afterwards before the grand jury-the prosecutor ordered me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. At your examination before the magistrate, did the prosecutor make any charge against you - A. No, nor any complaint, except that I refused to take either in charge, which I could not do. The prosecutor told me to come here to-day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The prisoner was never a companion of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been in the same regiment with you - A. He was never in the company that I belong to; I only knew him when he was in the Tower. I never kept company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he on the bridge before the prosecutor called out that he was robbed - A. The scuffle and every thing else lasted about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner had been talking together - A. No, I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing - A. I did not know that he was a soldier, he had plain clothes on. I was six months in the Tower with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not frequently meet him on duty - A. I had seen his face before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170006"/>Q. Is it not your duty to order people away who are loitering about the bridge - A. I ordered them away - I never saw the prisoner alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it your duty to stop him - A. If he had been given into my charge alone I should have taken him; but both giving charge of each other, I did not take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that the prosecutor did not desire you to take the prisoner before the prisoner told you to take him - A. I cannot say I know Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not call out to you to stop the prisoner, who was running away - A. I never heard him. The prosecutor walked by me - He never called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Smith tell you a robbery had been committed, and desire you to stop the prisoner - A. No; the prisoner said the prosecutor had offered him two guineas; the prosecutor said he could not offer him guineas, for he had only two Napoleons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention Napoleons at Bow-street, or any where else, until after you heard them mentioned at Bow-street - A. I meant to have said it, but I left it out. I said guineas were spoken of but mentioned nothing else. I did not mention that the prosecutor said he would throw the b-dy rascal over the bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor charge you with receiving part of the property - A. He asked me if the prisoner had not given me anything? I said, No; but I had picked up the remnant of a frill upon the bridge - I had it in my hand at the time. I only saw the prisoner once in the Tower. I only met him occasionally. Nothing was said before the magistrate about Napoleons.</p>

I returned to the chariot, and called for a light at the wine vaults, but could not find the ridicule. I took the number of the chariot, and said I would go to my friend at the Chapter Coffee-house, thinking it might have clung to her dress. I could not find it. We then went back with the waiter to the chariot, and gave the prisoner in charge. The bag was found by the chariot.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Chapter Coffee-house. Mrs. Ramsden came and enquired for Miss Court, and said she had lost her bag. I got a candle, searched the chariot, but found nothing; I returned, got my hat, went back, and told the prisoner if he knew nothing of it he could not object to be searched, and to turn his horses round and drive to the watch-house. He was taken to the watch-house-nothing was found on him. I went out to the chariot, and got there as soon as the prisoner. I saw him go to the boot, and take out a handful of hay, as if to feed his horses; he went round to them, staid a little time, and came round again; I went round to where he stood, and found the ridicule at the horses' feet. The chariot then stood by the passage which leads to Dolly's chop-house.</p>

The prisoner was introduced to me as a man shortly coming into great property, in order to be bail for another man - I agreed to accept the bail. Two or three days after he called and asked me to go with him to his new agent to receive 60l. of him. He said he intended to take up my bill if I would go with him. He said he was very dirty, and asked me to lend him a pair of pantaloons, which I did. When the appointed day came it was put off. He called on me again, desiring to know my terms for teaching, and asked me to teach a young lady, whom he intended to marry - I said I would. I took my musical stick with me, and played on it; he asked me to lend it to him, which I refused. He said he thought he would take a lesson in dancing himself, but he should he very poor until he got his money. I went home for a pair of pumps-when I returned I missed my violin and the musical stick, which I had left in his apartments, and the prisoner. I made frequent applications to him for them. He often promised to return them - He admitted that he had got them.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN CRUMP. I live in Castle-lane, York-street, Westminster. On the 11th of May I <rs id="t18180617-18-viclabel100" type="occupation">kept a booth in <placeName id="t18180617-18-crimeloc101">Tothil-fields Fair</placeName>

I laid down to sleep about eleven o'clock at night-there was no door or fastening to the booth; there were five or six candles burning. About three o'clock I was called up by a woman, and found about thirty men breaking the benches, tables, and stools. I went to them, and asked what they were doing? they made no reply, but threw the broken pieces of benches and stools at me, and put out the lights. They struck me, and knocked me down several times-the prisoner, Kelly, was there. I fetched out a sword, and told them if they broke any more I would make use of it. I immediately went into the bar-Kelly and six others rushed in. Kelly caught hold of the sword, and told the others to come on, as he had got it - He only held one end of it, I did not let it go. I turned them all out of the bar again. They went out into the street, and began throwing stones and bricks at me. Four or five of them fell on my wife and beat her sadly. I sent for a watchman. I had to get through the top of the booth to get away-when I got to the top they knocked me down again with stones; I got up again, and jumped into the middle among them, and tried to make the best of my way to the watch-house; they all followed, and Kelly knocked me down with a stick several times. The last time he knocked me down they took all my money out of my right-hand breeches pocket, which was upwards of 2l. in silver. While they were taking it from me, the cry was "Kill him!" or "Murder him! cut his throat!" I got up, and the first that I noticed was Hare; he was close to me, and took half a crown out of my left-hand breeches pocket - They took my handkerchief off my neck. Kelly held me while they searched me. I had the sword in my hand, he took it from me. I lost a bunch of three keys. They unbuttoned my clothes - I do not know who took the money out of my right-hand breeches pocket. They were all apprehended about an hour after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. This was the second morning of the fair - I was quite sober. My wife took care of the booth while I laid down-there were seven or eight people in it; some of them were dancing-there was neither dancing nor music while the prisoners were there. They made holes in the tarpauling to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the men rush in at first to take the sword out of your hand - A. They had destroyed the booth - I reasoned with them to quiet them. Kelly came into the watch-house with the sword of his own accord - I charged him with being one of them; he had before that made his escape from the watchman. I never said I had no knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner UNDERWOOD. Q. Will you swear that you saw me there - A. Yes; he stood by my side while I was being robbed.</p>

My master was called up by my mother; he drew his sword, and said he would stand in his own defence - They had broken the tables and stools before this. He drove them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170010"/>out-they came in again, rushed into the bar, and tried to take the sword from him; he kept it, and made his escape out of the booth; he sent me for the watchman-they knocked him down.

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Totbil-fields-Kimberley fetched me. When I got there I saw the prosecutor getting off the ground, covered with dirt - He was sober; there was a great mob round him. I asked what was the matter? he gave Kelly in charge for robbing him-Kelly heard him, and ran away; I could not overtake him. The prosecutor had no hat on, nor any handkerchief round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There might be fifty persons on the spot. I took one of them-he was tried at the Westminster Sessions. The mob fell upon me, and tried to rescue him. Edwards was there, and threw stones at me in order to release him. Kelly afterwards met me with a mob, who tried to rescue the prisoner - he followed me to the watchhouse.</p>

The whole of the prisoners, with several others, threw stones at me to release him - I said I would fire at them. While we were at the watch-house, Kelly came, and said he wanted to come in to say something in behalf of the prisoner - I saw the sword concealed under his coat, behind his back; I pulled it out and detained him-the prosecutor immediately gave him in charge, and said he was one of them. I went to see the prosecutor safe home, and took Edwards and Underwood in a booth. I took Hare at a gambling-house about five o'clock.</p>

            . I am a gardener. On the morning of the robbery I heard a noise, got up, looked out of window, and saw a mob beating the prosecutor in a terrible manner. I thought they would have killed him - He ran off about twenty yards; Kelly followed, stopped him, and got him against the wall-he cried out Murder! I am sure Kelly was one of those that were upon him. Hare got the prosecutor against the wall, and beat him in a most shocking manner-there were two of them; they got him when he was on the ground.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite the prosecutrix. On the 10th of May I saw her go out and lock her door; about half an hour after I saw the prisoner go to the door and knock-no answer was given. He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket, held it in his hand, and put his hand towards the door - I am sure he was turning the lock round. He went away, returned in about five minutes, and made another attempt. He repeated this four or five times, going away and returning. About twelve o'clock he went in and shut the door.

I stood in a part of the shop which is not in sight of the door. I heard a noise in the shop, turned round, and saw the prisoner going down stairs with a piece of kerseymere under his arm.

On the 2d of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some seals; he took up several, asked the price, and I put them down one by one as he looked at them - He asked the price of one, which I told him was 15s. When he put it down again there was a vacant place. I told him he had one in his hand, he said he had not; I said I was sure he had - He shook his handkerchief over the tray, and the seal fell out. I told him to go about his business, as I was sure he only came to thieve. My husband came out of the parlour, and told the prisoner he should be satisfied if he shewed him the money he had to buy the seal with. We sent for an officer, who searched him, and found only 3d. in his pocket.</p>

He ran up Chancery-lane - I called Stop thief! he turned down Carey-street; he was some distance before me, several people pursued him, and he turned up Star-Yard. A gentleman said, "Let us go through the archway into Lincoln's Inn-he must come out on that side," which I did. Before he could get out of the inn I saw him stopped. He said he had no pocket-book of mine. I heard the mob say my pocket-book was found. I asked him for a letter which I missed, he denied having it.

            . I am porter to the Society of Lincoln's Inn. I saw the mob running by the side of Star-yard, and heard the cry of Stop thief! by this time the mob had got by the fountain; I pursued-several gentlemen were there. The prisoner was stopped by Mr. Hawkins, at the end of the passage leading to Searle-street - he would let nobody pass. I followed, and laid hold of him; he turned round and said, "What do you want of me?" I told him there was a cry of Stop thief, and I thought proper to stop him. I brought him part of the way back into the inn. Mr. Barton came up and asked for his pocket-book - A man said he had got it. I took the prisoner to Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were more than twenty persons ran from Star-yard - They were above half way across the inn before I knew what was the matter. Nothing was found on the prisoner.</p>

            . I was coming up Star-yard, heard the cry of Stop thief, and ran with the others. In going through the little inn to Lincoln's Inn I saw the pocketbook lying - I passed it, but returned and picked it up, Mr. Barton claimed it. I saw the prisoner being brought back.</p>

Next morning I missed three sheets from two different rooms. I went to the room in which she had slept that night, and found her in another bedroom. She saw me in the passage, returned to her own room, and got into her own bed. I sent for an officer, and sent one of the maid servants up, who told her she must get up-the servant found the sheets; I waited outside the room.</p>

I went to the prisoner's room, and asked her to get up - She said she could not, because my master and the officer were there - They left.

On the 21st of May, a little before six o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving my wife in bed; I double-locked the door, and threw the key through the window on the ground floor, where the glass was broken-no person could reach it-the broken glass was not large enough to admit any person through. I went across the road to work in my garden. A little before seven o'clock I was called away, and returned home.

I found a bill-book on the floor of the room; there was a little blood on it, and a great deal on the floor by it. The bill-book was not mine, nor was it in the house when I left. I took my wife to the hospital on a bed, in a cart. As I was putting her into the cart I saw Wells with a razor, which had blood on it. My wife died in the hospital on the 6th of June.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was at Westbourn-green on the 21st of May, about seven o'clock in the morning. I have known the prisoner some years. I was about twenty yards from Roger's house, and saw the prisoner enter the premises. He stood opposite the door for about a minute before he went in - I do not know whether anybody let him in. I was digging in the road - I went on with my work. Two or three minutes after, I heard, as I thought, a woman scream-it seemed at first to be a long distance off; I took no particular notice of it. The second time that I heard it, it appeared to be nearer, and to come from Rogers's house. I heard it again, and ran to the house. Before I got to the door I saw the deceased fall out of the door, all in a gore of blood. She fell forward on the ground, rose herself up, and made for the place very quick - She staggered, and immediately seized the pales with her right hand. I immediately called out to Reeves that there was a woman murdered-he came, and ran for her husband. I did not see the prisoner come out. I saw the razor in the possession of Wells.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known the prisoner some years, and was always very good friends with him. I always thought him a very good kind of a man.</p>

            . I was at work nearly opposite Rogers's house. On the 21st of May I had been to fetch some tools: as I returned about seven o'clock a man came running on horseback, and said a woman's throat had been cut. I saw the deceased sitting on a pile of bricks, in a very bloody condition-there was blood in the house. I went for an officer-when I returned I looked about, and found a razor near the path, and took it up-it was bloody.</p>

            . On the 21st of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I and Court were at the Coach and Horses, public-house, at Paddington, about a mile from the prosecutor's house; the prisoner came in to us, called for a quartern of gin, and asked us to drink a glass, which we did; I have known him some years. After we had drank he called us into the back yard, and said he had been and murdered a woman that morning; that he had knocked her down with a bill-book, and cut her throat with a razor. He spoke in that easy way, that we did not believe him. I asked him who he had murdered? he said "

It was agreed that Court should go up to the prisoner's house, and ask his daughter for two little pill-boxes that he wanted, and he would hear if there was any alarm - I was to remain with the prisoner. Court went, when he returned he said it was true. We immediately took the prisoner into custody, and delivered him up before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am receiving house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital. On the 21st of May, in the morning, the deceased was brought there in a cart - I saw her taken out of the cart. After removing some handkerchiefs from her neck, I found a large wound in front, to the extent of about five inches, across the windpipe-this was the principal wound; but there were several others, as if several attempts had been made to cut her throat. There were ten principal wounds in her head-such an instrument as the bill-hook would make them exactly. She lived sixteen days; I attended her every day.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment, what was the cause of her death - A. The wound in her throat, combined with others, was the cause. Her scull was fractured, which would have caused her death in a short time. She frequently expressed her apprehension that she should die.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have attended the hospital five years. I could form no idea of her health before the injury. The form of the fracture of the scull was such that it could not be caused by a fall. The windpipe was completely severed. My opinion is, that this wound alone must have proved fatal.</p>

            . I live at No. 43, Old Bond-street - I know the prisoner, Evison. On Monday evening, the 4th of May, he called on me, said he had a commission to purchase a carriage for Mr. Smith, of Southampton, and was ordered to go as high as 150l. I shewed him one at 120 guineas - He said he would call in the morning to see some others. Next day he called, and agreed for the carriage at 120l., and said he would give me a bill on Francis and White, who he believed were very respectable people. He said he did not know who was the drawer-he wrote the particulars down on a piece of paper in the counting-house. I saw him write it-(looking at it) this is it (reads) "Smith, Esq., Southampton. Bill accepted by Francis and White, Merchants, &amp;c. Nine Elms, Vauxhall. P. Evison." He said he did not know the amount, for Mr. Smith was to remit him the bill, and he had no doubt but it was a very good one, as Mr. Smith was very particular in money affairs. I said I would give it to my brother, and we would let him know next morning, at No. 14, Grosvenor-place.</p>

I said I had made inquiry, and found Francis and White were the

             people, and I was perfectly satisfied with the names of the parties, as I understood they were very respectable people, and that a bill on them was as good as a bank note - He said he understood so. I said I would take their acceptance in payment for the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said with respect to the persons who were to be the acceptors of the bill - A. I told him my brother knew Francis, and often met him at Lloyd's coffee-house. I asked him the amount of the bill? he said he did not know the amount; that he expected Mr. Smith in town, and he would bring the bill with him. I asked him who was the drawer of it? he said he did not know. He said he would let me know when he should want the carriage. I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again - A. On Thursday, about three o'clock, the prisoner, Dickinson, brought me a note, he gave it to me-this is it (producing it) - I read it, and told Dickinson the carriage should be got ready for him, and that I would either go with it, or send somebody. I accompanied the carriage on horseback to No. 14, Lower Grosvenor-place, on Friday, the 8th of May, at two o'clock. As I went I saw the prisoner, Dickinson, in the turning which leads to Pimlico, and inquired of him where No. 14, Lower Grosvenor-place, was? he directed me there-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170017"/>I met him about six yards from the place; he was walking towards Buckingham-gate, in a contrary direction, from Lower Grosvenor-place. I found the house according to his direction. When I got there I found Evison in the parlour, and was introduced to him.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed - A. He asked if the carriage was all right? I said it was. He then produced the bill-this is it-(looking at it) - He said Mrs. Smith was taken ill at Guildford, and Mr. Smith was detained there on that account, and that he was going there with the carriage to meet him. I remarked that the bill was for 139l., and the carriage only came to 120l. He said Mr. Smith would draw on me for 19l. at his leisure. He then rang the bell for a pen and ink, and took down the particulars of the bill, that Mr. Smith might draw on me, to come due about the same time as this bill. I then looked at it - He said they were very respectable people. I told him I had made inquiry, and understood that Francis and White were very respectable people, and I considered it as good as a bank note. He said he understood they were very respectable people, but he did not know anything of them. He wished me to sit down; I told him I was busy, and left him. I immediately rode over to Nine Elms, Vauxhall, with the bill; it was about a mile and a half, I gallopped all the way. I went into the counting-house, presented the bill to one of the clerks, and found the acceptance was forged. I rode back as quick as possible to Lower Grosvenor-place, and found the carriage was gone. I inquired at the toll-bar, went to the Post-master, and learnt which way it had gone, went to Esher, and sent for a constable. I saw the carriage at the first inn that I passed at Esher. The constable came. I went to the inn, into the parlour, and found the prisoners, Evison and Dickinson, sitting at the table, just going to dinner. I recognized Evison, and told him he had given me a bill which was forged. I told Dickinson he had brought me a letter, and that I had supposed him to be Evison's servant-Evison replied, that he had a friend with him, who would soon settle the business-that he was gone out, and would return and satisfy me that every thing was right. I told him if he could do that I should be satisfied, but if he was a rogue I should take him to town. A person of the name of Bennet came into the room, and offered his assistance. I left Evison and Dickinson in the charge of the landlord. I then saw Entwistle in the room - He went into the room of his own accord - I followed him in, and asked him if he came in the carriage with those gentlemen? he said he did. I then gave the constable charge of all three; they were secured in the house. Tilley put Evison and Entwistle into the carriage, and drove with them to Kingston-the constable took the other in a post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you in the carriage - A. Yes; I held them out neither promises nor threats. Entwistle said, if I would stop at Kingston he would settle every thing. Evison said he had given Entwistle instructions to settle every thing. I said if they would convince me that they were honest men I should be satisfied. When we got to Kingston I went into the parlour with Entwistle; he then proposed that if I would let them go, he would pay me for the carriage and all my expences. He said that it was a fraud committed by Evison, but that he knew nothing of it-that it would very much hurt his character, for he was going into business with a Mr. Needharn, and if this was exposed it would hurt his family, his father being a methodist preacher and a man of great respectability. I told him it was a public affair-that I should call Mr. Bennet in to hear what was said, for I should not compound felony. Mr. Bennet came in; I told him of this conversation. Entwistle said it was not right to call Bennet in - I said I considered it was. I went to Bow-street, they were examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. When he brought you the bill he did not profess to know who the acceptors were - A. He did not - He left me a paper that I might inquire about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Knowing there were Francis and White, of Vauxhall, you supposed it to be them - A. I knew no other. I made inquiry, and was told there were no other. I made inquiry before I saw him a second time and could find no other. At the second conversation I told him I had made inquiry, and was satisfied with the bill, as they were respectable people - He then told me he was going to Guildford.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. You told Evison that they were the

            . I am an inn-keeper. I was present when the prisoners were secured at Esher, and assisted in securing them. Entwistle at first refused to be searched, but afterwards consented. They handed the things out of their own pockets - They were sealed up in paper. I made the prisoners put their names on the papers. There were several letters and bills found on Entwistle. I went in the chaise with Dickinson and the constable to Kingston. When I got there, Evison put his head out of the carriage to me, as I stood by the side, and said, "Are they coming? I have empowered Entwistle to settle it with Mr. Powell." - I went into the parlour. Before we got to Bow-street, Evison said he was sorry Entwistle was not permitted to settle it, as they would not be able to prove a forgery, and he knew it to be a fraud. He afterwards said if it was a forgery he knew the person that committed it, but it was not him. We took them to the Brown Bear, in Bow-street. Entwistle said it was a pity it was not settled, as they would not be able to prove the forgery, and it would hurt their characters, and do no good. When Evison was questioned about drawing the bill, he said he was brought up a gentleman. He said he drew the body of the bill, and Dickinson wrote the bottom part, "Dickinson and Co." He was sent out, and Dickinson was called in. Mr. Birnie asked him if he knew anything of the bill? he pretended to know nothing about it at first, but afterwards said, in the presence of Evison, that he and Evison were in partnership together. Mr. Birnie made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170018"/>some remark upon the spelling of the name. He said the plate on their door had not been altered. Entwistle was asked what he knew of it? he said all he knew of it was that he had received a letter from Evison to come and ride with him into the country to buy the carriage of them. He said he knew nothing of the bill. Evison then said he had given the bill to Entwistle to get accepted, and he brought it back.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Grey-street, Blackfriars-road. I know Mr. White, of Nine Elms, Vauxhall, a coal and timber-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time draw an agreement of partnership between him and a Mr. Francis - A. Yes, I produce a copy of it. White informed me he was going into partnership with

                  Peter

            ; on the 20th of April I copied the agreement, and saw White and Francis execute it. White was in possession of a wharf at Nine Elms before this. I knew Francis before, but never saw White before. It was signed at the ship, in Wormwood-street, London-wall-(looks at the bill). - I believe it to be the hand-writing of Francis, who executed this agreement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. I have lived four months in Grey-street. I lived with Messrs. Rundle and Bridge two years ago - I was fourteen years with them. I first saw White on the 20th of April. I have seen cards calling him a coal-merchant - I have known Francis two or three years. When I knew him he lived at Camberwell. I think I could tell his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I never saw Evison or Dickinson till I saw them at Bow-street. I have known Entwistle a short time. I believe he has given Francis credit to some amount - They are acquainted. I do not know whether he is in the habit of accepting bills for him, or not.</p>

On the 6th of March the prisoner called on me and bought a tea-caddy, which came to 9l., and asked the price of some card-tables. He asked me if I objected to take a bill? I told him I did not, if the parties were respectable. He ordered the tea-caddy to be finished by Wednesday the 11th of March - He went away, and returned on Wednesday, it was ready for him; he said it suited him. He said he had brought the bill, and produced it. He said he should like some card-tables very well, but he thought them too dear. He paid me the bill, and gave me an order for a loo-table. The card-tables were delivered to him with the loo-table-(looks at the bill)-this is it. I never received the money for it-it is noted. It was due on Saturday, the 25th of April. On that day I met him at the corner of Lower Northampton-street, and told him the bill was due that day; he said it was, but he had got a letter from the party in the country, and they were not exactly prepared to take it up, and he wished to have it renewed. I told him it would certainly be presented that day.</p>

I paid one shilling for liquor, and lent a person a shilling-the prisoner was at the house, and a person of the name of Day - They saw me change my note. I was not quite sober, but knew what I was about - They pulled me about in the house. I told them not to rob me, but to keep their hands out of my pocket, and if they wanted a shilling or two I would give it them; they made no reply but tore my coat, and almost stripped me in the house-others assisted them. I knew them before, and had seen them there before. When I left the house the prisoner and Davis both followed me for about a hundred yards, they came up and hustled me-Davis took my silver from my pocket while the prisoner held me behind; Davis got about fourteen shillings, and a two-foot rule, out of breeches-pocket - They knocked me against the railing and stunned me, I was senseless for sometime.

I did not think the prosecutor was very drunk. I suspected the prisoner, having heard the prosecutor had been receiving money. I advised the prosecutor to give his money to the landlord until the morning. The prisoner called me a b-dy Jacob, and asked if I thought he was going to be taken-in by a flat of my kind-that he had been too long in town. On my asking him to give the money to the landlord, he snapped his fingers, and said he would see me d-d first. I did not know he had got the prosecutor's money - I only took the sailor's word for it. I told the prisoner if he did not give up the money I would send for an officer, which I did; as soon as the officer came I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170020"/>told him the prisoner had got the prosecutor's money - He denied having more than 1l. about him, and said he had none of the prosecutor's money.

I followed him out of the cellar across Turnagain-lane, into the stable; I then told him I thought his bag contained more than belonged to him; he said it did not-he objected to my examining it, but I insisted upon it. He then said he would tell the truth, he had got a little drop of wine; he gave it to me, it was two bottles of shrub. He begged hard for mercy, and I let him go. At eight o'clock, when I took the key up, I told Mr. Abbotts of it; he was angry with me for letting him go.</p>

On Friday, the 29th of May, between one and two o'clock, I lost my watch out of my parlour - I had seen it hanging over the mantle-shelf half an hour before; I was not at home at the time. A person must go through the shop to get at the parlour. I had left my wife in the shop; when I returned she said it was gone. The lodgers have no communication with the parlour. On Monday the officer brought it to me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday, the 1st of June, I apprehended the prisoner in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and found the watch in his fob. I asked him where he got it? he said his mother left it him about three years ago. I found the prosecutor's name on it, and told him it was dated 1818, and that he could not have had it so long. He said he had had the cap made to it since his mother gave it to him.</p>

I do not know what he asked for her. He said he had rode her a great many miles the day before, when he brought her up; he did not say from where - He said he brought her seventy miles. I put the mare in my cart, and recommended Langley to buy her - He swapped another for it, and some money to boot-(looks at the receipt)-this is the receipt, I witnessed it; it is dated the 3d of April, the prisoner wrote it.</p>

I left the shop, and went down to the kitchen underneath - I had left the shop-door shut, and took the key with me; I thought I had locked it-there were watches in the window. In a few minutes I heard a noise in the shop, ran up, and found the prisoner coming out of the shop into the passage, with a silver watch in his hand. I stopped him, and asked him how he came by it? The street-door was always open. I asked him what business he had in the shop? he said he was coming in, and found it on the floor - I had seen it hanging on a hook in the window half an hour before; no person but myself had been in the shop. I held the prisoner; the neighbours came to my assistance. I took the watch from him, and gave him into the charge of Bennett. It is a silver watch, which came to be repaired-my husband made it about two years ago, and received 6l. for it. Bennett is not here. I saw the watch at Worship-street the same evening in his possession.</p>

While I was talking to her I took my watch out to see the time-she had a candle. I returned my watch to my pocket and left her. Soon after, she ran after me, took me by the coat, and said I should have the lot. She kept moving her other hand by my body. I did not feel my watch go, but missed it as soon as I left her. I returned to where she had stood, and found her gone. I got the watchman, overtook her in Stewart's-rents, going into her house, and asked her for my watch. She said "I have not go it-search me." The watchman said, "It is unless searching, you have dinged it." I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not fall down in Blackmore-street - A. Yes, but got up without help. She was out of my sight five minutes.</p>

I asked him if Mr. Paget had any fresh goods come in? he said he had none but what I had seen. I said they would not suit me, as I could buy them cheaper. He then said there was a person in the country of the name of Howe, who owed him money; that he had sent him several lawyer's letters, and that Howe had promised to send him canvas for the debt, and asked me if I would be a purchaser? I said I could say nothing to it. He asked for my card. He knew my shop very well before - I gave him one. On Saturday, the 6th of June, he called again, and said the goods were arrived, and they would not hurt me at 8d. a yard - He said he should send them down on Monday. On Monday, the 8th of June, about seven o'clock in the morning, a man brought five bolts of canvas, and said the person who sent him would be there in the course of the day. In about ten minutes the prisoner came, and asked me how I liked the canvas? I said it was much the same quality as what I had seen at Mr. Paget's, and had been asked 9d. for. He said he thought it was as good a quality, and asked me if I would buy it at 8d.? I told him I did not particularly want them, as I had bought eleven bolts shortly before of Mr. Stephenson, of Philpot-lane. I then offered him 7 1/2d. a yard; he said if he did he should lose 16s. on them. He then said, rather than put himself to the expence of porterage again, he would let me have them. I told him I hoped he would excuse me, and asked him why he did not offer these goods to his master? He said he did not wish his master to know it. I told him his master could give as good a price for them as I could, and I could afterwards buy it of his master. He said he did not wish his master to know that he had any dealings with Howe. He then took a paper out of his pocket-book, with the lengths, and what they would come to at 8d. a yard. He scratched that out, and calculated it at 7 1/2d. - he made it 6l. 17s. 4d. He pressed me to pay him immediately, and said he would give me a receipt, and that would satisfy me. I said it did not suit me to pay him that morning. He said, "I suppose you do not want the goods?" I said I certainly did want them, and if he would call in the course of the day I would pay him - He went away. I afterwards told Morris what had passed. We went to Mr. Paget's - I remained outside. Mr. Paget afterwards came to my shop and claimed the goods. The prisoner never gave me any bill of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. The canvas was as good as that at 9d. I have often seen him at the warehouse, and have paid him money on account of his master. I told him to call for the money, because I wanted to inquire if the goods were his own.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer of Shadwell. Nathan gave me information. I went to Mr. Paget; he went with me to Nathan's, and claimed the canvas. We returned to the prosecutor's, and questioned the prisoner about the goods. He said he had sent some goods to Nathan, and that he meant to receive 9d. a yard for them, and produced a bill of parcels, which amounted to 9l. 4s. 7d. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170025"/>searched his pockets, and found a paper in his pocketbook, with a calculation at 8d. and 7 1/2d. a yard.</p>

            . I live in Mark-lane. On the 8th of June I received information from Nathan, went to his house, and found five bolts of canvas there, which were mine-the prisoner was my foreman. When goods are sold out of my house, it was his duty to enter them in a book, and send a bill of parcels with them-there was no entry made of the goods. There were two entries of good transactions of the same day, which must have been bought after ten o'clock in the morning; they were made by the prisoner about eleven o'clock. I asked him why he did not enter these goods? he said he had not had time. The lowest price he might have sold the goods at was 83/4d. a yard. - the usual price was 9d.; he knew that. It is usual to enter goods before they are sent out. He should have entered the number of the piece and the yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is quite unusual to enter goods after they are sent out. We always have cash from Jews.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Nathan ordered five pieces of me - He said he must have them to cut, and would call at seven o'clock in the morning, which he did, and said he must have them immediately - I sent them. He offered me 71/2d. for them; I told him I could not take it. I forgot to enter them. I never intended to defraud my master.</p>

I waited there sometime, the prisoner did not come in while I was there. I was informed that he was in Hart-street; I followed, took him in Monkwell-street, and brought him into the back parlour. I told him I took him for robbing his master-he was agitated, but said nothing. I found five cravats in his coat-pocket, two yards and a half of jaconet muslin, and five duplicates. I returned to the public-house, and found the key of the cupboard where the goods were, in his possession. Mrs. Perch gave me six yards of black and white gingham, sixteen yards of calico, 15-16ths of jaconet, and one handkerchief. Sarah Gable gave me two dresses, six yards of gingham, and a handkerchief.</p>

When he left us I asked for his address; he gave me, "No. 6, Whitecross-alley, Finsbury-square." While he lived with us we did not miss any goods; we are not likely to miss them. I have examined the goods. I went to the prisoner, and asked him how long he had been in the habit of robbing us? he said, "not quite two months." He said he had stolen two pieces of gingham, two pieces of cambric muslin, and eighteen cravats. He begged of me not to prosecute him. The property is worth about 20l.</p>

On the 26th of May, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going through George-street, St. Giles's-some people were collected together, and two women were quarrelling - I stood there to hear what passed. Three men were standing round them-the prisoner was one, and Fitzgerald was another. In about two minutes I went on my way home. Fitzgerald followed me very close, hustled me off the stones, and knocked my hat off. I caught my hat in my hand. The prisoner and the other man came to my right-hand side, and took my watch from my pocket-it was gone in an instant; I felt it going-it was a silver jewelled watch. They ran away as fast as possible. I called the watchman, who took Fitzgerald to the watch-house. Next day, the prisoner was taken at the Black Horse, public-house, in George-street - I am positive he is the man. I had seen him and the other close to Fitzgerald. I understood by their conversation that Fitzgerald had been fighting the day before; the prisoner was sparring with Fitzgerald.</p>

            . My sister keeps the Black Horse, in George-street - the prisoner was in her employ. My sister sent him out for some pump-water - He returned in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. My sister asked him where he had been so long? he said he had been looking at a fight, and had picked up the case of a watch, which he produced. I asked him if he knew who had lost it? he said he did not. He had lived a fortnight with my sister. It was a silver case.</p>

             re-examined. I am not quite certain which of them took my watch. It was a new one-the case was not loose. I only had it made about two years ago, and paid seven guineas for it-there were three gold seals and a ring to it. I never got them again. The prisoner said he sold the case the next day to a man in the street.</p>

On Wednesday, the 20th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, the silver coffee-pot was standing on a tray on the kitchen dresser, about a yard from the window - A person in the street could see it; the window was open. I went into the back kitchen - I left nobody in the front kitchen. In about five minutes I heard a noise, I immediately went into the kitchen, and saw a person in the area with the coffee-pot - I believe the prisoner is the person. I said there was a thief, ran to the street - door, and called out Stop thief! I saw the man running along the square, and the coffee-pot in the area. I did not see him drop it. In about five minutes the prisoner was brought back to the house by Hardy - I believe he is the man who was in the area - I thought so at that time. I went to the window, and picked up the coffee-pot. There is no railing round the area-there is a railing in front round the fore-court, and a gate. When the prisoner was brought back there was red lead on his knees-the area had been cleaned with red lead. He must have knelt in the area to reach the coffee-pot. The dresser is nearly on a level with the bottom of the area.</p>

I was near my own house, and saw Puttock drive his cart of hay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170027"/>nearly opposite the prisoner's door; it could not get quite to it. The prisoner is a married woman, her husband's name is James. Puttock got on the load of hay, took one truss, and threw it down. I followed him into the prisoner's apartment-(she keeps night-carts.) I saw her give 1s. 9d. into his hands. I took it out immediately, and asked him how he came by that truss of hay? he said he had brought it from the barracks, as it was a returned truss - He said he sold it by his master's orders. I told him I thought it strange he should bring one truss for sale. I took him into custody, took the team to market, and returned for the prisoner, she was absent. I did not take her until last Friday week. I went back to Puttock. He said he found the hay by Edgeware Barn. It appeared to me to be part of the load.</p>

I had been there half an hour before, the window was then shut and the plate safe-it is on the ground-floor; Mrs. Kent had been in the room after I left-the windows were not fast. I heard Mrs. Kent in the parlour, she might have opened the window without my knowing it. There is another house joins ours. I saw some dirt on the carpet, and in the room. I looked out of the window, and saw the gate open, and dirt on the window ledge, as if some person had got in at the window-it is not quite to the ground; there is a fore court to the house, I did not observe any footsteps there. I cannot say whether more than one person had been in. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; there were six table-spoons and a teapot left. I alarmed Mrs. Kent and the servants, and they gave the alarm-Blyth and Lambe went in pursuit. The prisoners were brought to the house about six o'clock. Cook brought the things back.</p>

I saw Lord Holland's groom stop Jackson as they ran - He was one of them-the other three ran off. Lord Holland's servants went in pursuit.

            . I went in pursuit with Blyth, and saw the prisoners together in the lane, looking into the hat - I followed them. Lord Holland's servant took Jackson, the others were stopped and brought back. I am sure they are the boys that I saw in the lane-the property was not found on them; I said they must have dropped it. I went to look in the direction they had ran, and found a large silk shawl in a ditch, which had a silver wine strainer in it, broken in two, I gave it to the constable. I found nothing else. I had seen the prisoners run by the side of that ditch.</p>

            . I was driving a dray, and stopped opposite Mr. Kent's gate. I saw a boy come out of the gate with his hat in his hand-one stood in the road opposite the gate, I believe it was Bailey, and another was sitting under the wall, about fifty yards further on-it was one of the prisoners, I do not know which; I believe Bailey came out with the hat. Jackson was in the road, and went up to the one that came out, and said, "give me a bit." I heard no answer made. After they passed me, the one under the wall got up, they all walked off together. About five or ten minutes after Mrs. Kent gave the alarm that some person had robbed the house. The people went in pursuit.</p>

We came out of the gates, and went into Aldersgate-street, up a coach-yard, and slept in a coach until half-past four o'clock, then went to Smithfield, and from thence to Field-lane; Gurney made us take off the coats, and he went and sold them; he told us to wait, when he returned he said he had got twelve shillings for them, and gave us four shillings each.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish. On the 9th of June I apprehended Gurney at the Little King of Prussia, Hoxton. I found nothing on him. I took Lowe on the Wednesday following, at his master's, who is a watch-pendant maker, in Brick-lane; his master asked him if he had anything to do with the robbery? he said, Yes; he was neither threatened or promised; he said he was with them, and Whitley was concerned in the robbery; that all three went to the gates, Gurney got over and opened them, and let the rest in, they then got into the wash-house, and each took a coat, that Gurney sold them for twelve shillings, and they had four shillings each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never had Whitley in custody.</p>
               <p>GURNEY'S Defence. I was out of work. Whitley said he could get three coats if we would go with him; we went about twelve o'clock, Whitley got over the gate, went to the wash-house, cut the string, and brought the coats out.</p>
               <p>LOWE'S Defence. Whitley brought them out to us.</p>

On Monday the 18th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, looked at some things at the door, he then came in and asked the price of velveteen breeches; I took down a pile of breeches from the shelf, and shewed them to him - He asked if he could try them on - He took two pair into the passage, by the side of the parlour, to try on. A young man came to the door and asked about some clothes. When the prisoner came out of the passage, he said one pair were too large, and the other too small; I said I had more, and went round the counter to look for them, I then missed one pair which I knew I had left on the counter. I told him I did not know what had become of them; he asked me if I thought he had them? I said I did not know what to think. I went round the counter, saw his coat-pockets stick out, and felt them. He said I was coming very close; I said Yes; because I had lost a pair of breeches. He said I might strip him if I liked. While I was looking for them he went out, I sent my daughter after him, he said he would not come back; I then sent my man for him. The constable brought him back, and found the breeches upon him. I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WATTS. I am fourteen years of age, and have known the prisoner about four years. On Sunday, the 24th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, he wanted me to play with him, I would not, and he threw a stone at me; I left him, and in about half an hour I saw him again, ran after him, and was going to give him a pat on the head for throwing the stone; he took out his knife, pointed it at me, and swore he would stick me if I came near him. About eight o'clock I met him again, opposite my grandfather's door, at Hackney, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "Don't you say you will stab me any more;" he said he would stab me - I ran from him, there were several boys there, he pursued, and ran the knife into the side of my thigh once. It was a pointed knife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not strike me first - A. No; I meant to pat him on the head, but did not.</p>

Watts ran away, and pushed against me to get out of his way. The prisoner ran after him, and put his hand to his side. Watts said, "O L-d! he has stabbed me." The prisoner immediately ran away, and Watts ran to me. I had seen them together before, they were apparently scuffling together, and turning each other round.</p>

            . I am a constable of Islington. On the 27th of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners in company together, in Middle-row, Holborn. I watched them down Holborn, and saw them look at several gentlemens' pockets - They went down Field-lane, and I lost them. I then met Thompson; he and I went together, and met all four in <placeName id="t18180617-77-crimeloc420">Fleet-street</placeName>

I saw Glover follow a gentleman in black, and take a yellow handkerchief out of his right-hand coat pocket-the other three were close to him, covering him, to prevent anybody from seeing what he was doing - I do not know the gentleman. They all four turned round, and went up Johnson's-court together. I immediately went over to Thompson, and found he had seized all four of them. I lost the gentleman, and do not know his name. Thompson found the handkerchief on Holland. I am positive it is the same I saw taken from the gentleman. Holland said he would give him the fogle (meaning the handkerchief) to let him go. I had been watching them for an hour.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. I met Owen, and we went to look for the prisoners. I went on one side of Fleet-street, and he on the other, and saw all the four prisoners coming together towards Fleet-market. After following them a little way, I saw them all four dart into Johnson's-court together-Holland was a little behind the others. I ran up the court, and saw one of them push a handkerchief into Holland's hand - I took it out of his hand. Owen came over - I desired them all to stop, which they did for about a minute, and then Feathers made his escape, but was brought back by a man who stopped him. Owen then came up, and told me what he had seen. I searched and found another silk handkerchief in Holland's pocket. I said to Holland, "I thought you told me you would leave this off." He said, "Thompson, take the fogle, and let us go."</p>

They followed a gentleman; I suspected them, and followed them through Temple-bar - They then left that gentleman and followed another, crossed over, and came up the street again on the right-hand side. When they got to the Bolt in Tun they met the prosecutor, who appeared to be in liquor - They immediately turned round and followed him. I saw Bruce go up and try his pockets - He put his hand in, and pulled the handkerchief out about four or five inches: Rothburn immediately closed up to conceal him. Bruce then took the handkerchief out, and both darted into a court together. I followed, and caught them both. Bruce threw the handkerchief down; I pulled them towards it, and picked it up. Owen came and took charge of them while I went after the prosecutor - I found him in five minutes; he missed his handkerchief, and claimed it when I shewed it to him at the Compter.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners in company, and watched them. I saw the handkerchief in Bruce's hand - I did not see him take it. Thompson went and secured them. Bruce said, "Why do you collar me? I am a tradesman's son, and have done nothing." We took them to the Compter. The prosecutor was brought there and claimed it.</p>

            . I am a butcher. About half-past eleven o'clock in the morning I was going to Mr. Belford's - I turned my cart by the side of Mr. Belford's cart, which was at his door. I went to the tail-board, and saw the prisoner come out of <placeName id="t18180617-87-crimeloc478">Seymour-place</placeName>

While he was talking to me the other man walked by the area, and kept looking down. The gardener came up the area, and went down again. The prisoner immediately left me, and went to see if the area-gate was fast, or not - He said all was right. He asked the other man to take the things out of the cart, which he refused. He said, "D-n you, you must not leave every thing." He asked him, if he took it out, whether he would run away with it? he said, Yes. The prisoner immediately reached over the head of the cart, took the basket out, and gave it to the other man, who ran up South Audley-street with it. I immediately ran down and told the butler. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

I saw him again at three o'clock; he dodged me round the hay. He attempted to get out of the yard, but saw me, and would not come out. I concealed myself, and saw him come out - I ran up to him, and found the rabbits tied up in his apron, which was in his hand - He dropped it and ran off. I pursued, and told him he might as well stop, as I knew him. I gave the alarm, and he was stopped by Grace. The prosecutor claimed the rabbits. He had killed four of them.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 1st of June, about three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner coming down the New Road towards Battle-bridge, with a bundle under his arm. I told him to stop - He used very bad language, and knocked me down. I got up - He ran off as fast as he could. I sprung my rattle, the watchman took him. I asked him to pull his hat off, which he refused-the watchman took it off; I found the strings in it. He dropped the bundle as he ran-it contained the leathers.</p>

On the 3d of June the prisoner came to my shop and looked at several parcels of stockings, none of which suited her; I missed two pair. After some time she attempted to go out, I called her back, and told her I must speak to her. She tried to get out again, said she must go and ask her mistress for some money. I told her I missed two pair of stockings, and perhaps she had put them into her pocket by mistake - She denied it. I said perhaps she would like to be searched; she said, Yes. My servant took her into the parlour, searched her, and said she had nothing about her. I missed a pair of shoes, and said I was sure she must have them; she then pulled them out and gave them to me. I said I would have the stockings also. She then pulled them out. My servant searched her again, and found the crape.</p>

When we left Newgate-street, we left property there to a considerable amount; Clayton lived there to take care of it. I know the prisoner; he never dealt with us to my knowledge; he lived in Wood-street, Cheapside, and, I believe, calls himself a straw-hat maker. I detected Clayton in robbing me; and on the 27th of May, in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's house, to see if any of my goods were there. I saw his wife; I waited, and in about half an hour I saw him, and asked him if he had not been in the habit of dealing with Clayton, who was present. He said he knew Clayton. I charged him with having dealt extensively with him. He hesitated, and said, "No, not extensively; he did not know that he had." I asked who he sold the goods to that he received from Clayton? He said he did not think it necessary to tell me. I said, if he was an honest tradesman, he would make no objection; but that he was afraid of saying too much. Ellis, an officer, who was present, said he would not suffer me to leave without giving the prisoner in charge. I had charged him with having in his possession a book belonging to Clayton. He hesitated; but at last acknowledged having it, but refused to give it up. I said I must have it, or I would give him in charge. He said he had not got it with him, but would procure it for me in the morning. I said that would not do; I must have it that night; and I threatened to send for the watchman. He consented to go and fetch it; he went out, returned in an hour and a half, and gave it to me. Clayton remained with me. Our house is very well known in the trade.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I did not tell the prisoner he owed Clayton 10l.; I said he owed him 2l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not deny it - A. Clayton said he owed him 12l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then say to Clayton, "You fool, did I not tell you, if you would mind what you was about, I would save your neck" - A. No, never; nothing of the kind passed. I do not believe he said the book was only given to him that morning. I believe he was taken into custody next morning.</p>

            . I lived nearly two years with the prosecutor. I first lived with him in Newgate-street; I was left in care of the premises in Newgate-street. The prisoner came to see me there several times. He came to see if I had any goods for him, either black chips or Leghorn hats. He knew very well who I lived servant with. He told me he had bought goods three times at Gatfield's.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of May, before you left there, did he apply to you to sell him any goods - A. He came to my lodgings, on the 23d of May, at night, to pay me a former account, and asked if I had any goods. I said, No; but I was going to my master's house next morning, which was Sunday, and would get him some more. He urged me to get a great quantity of Leghorn hats in particular, and chips. He was to buy them; he knew that I was to steal them from my master. He said he would take any quantity that I could get. I went and got six Leghorn crowns, and three flats for fronts, and four dozen chip flats. They were worth 5l. each bonnet; the chip flats were worth 4l. a dozen; he gave me 22s. a dozen for them. I took them to Bull and Mouth-street, about a quarter before eleven on Sunday morning. I got them about ten o'clock. He came to me, and asked what luck? The goods were then on the table in my room on the third floor. He looked at the Leghorns; I told him he should have five of them; he was to give 12s. 6d. each; he was to make up the other for a person that I knew. He liked the chips. I asked him 2l. a dozen; he refused to give more than 22s., and said he would pay ready money. I took it. He paid me in all 7l. 10s. 6d., and took them away. I was taken into custody on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening before that, did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner about the robbery - A. Yes, on the evening of the 26th of May, he called upon me, and asked me if I had got any thing more? I told, him my fellow-servant had detected me putting chip-flats into my bosom. He asked if I was sure of it? I said, Yes. He asked if my fellow-servant took them on my person? I said, No. He said, as he did not take them upon my person, he could not prove it against me. I asked if I should deny it? He said deny it to the last, as there is no proof against you; but, above all things, do not mention my name; and said he would call the next morning, to know how I got on. He came at nine o'clock on Wednesday morning, and asked how I got on? I told him my fellow-servant had asked me if I saw him down below? that I denied; and that he said he had seen me put the chips into my bosom, which I denied; but he should make the warehouseman acquainted with it, and he might do as he thought proper. I told the prisoner this, when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170037"/>called on me to breakfast; the prisoner then told me to deny it to the last, and if I was committed, he would call and do what he could to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any accounts in writing between you and the prisoner - A. Yes; he took them away with him that morning. When I told him of my detection, he said, the first thing I must do, was to collect all my memorandums together, and destroy them. I had no fire; I told him he had better take them away, which he did. He often called on me in Bull and Mouth-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. I kept a memorandum of the date of the proceedings. I have only dealt with two more persons beside the prisoner; they thought I got the goods in a proper way, and did not know that I lived with Mr. Gatfield.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first begin trading with the prisoner - A. On the 13th of November; he asked where I was, and who I dealt with? I told him I dealt with Mr. Moon, of Greek-street, Soho, which was false. I said I got the things from Mr. Moon; he asked who I sold things to? I told him to Miss Jones, of Grub-street, Mrs. Rogers, and Mr. Redcroft. The chips were very good. There might be a rotten one in one parcel. I believe I have received 40l. of him in two months. When I was detected, he owed me 1l. 11s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Gatfield that he owed you 10l. - A. I did; but it was a story. Before my master went to the prisoner, I told him it was only 1l. 11s.; I told him the whole proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the prisoner you was servant to the prosecutor - A. On Sunday, the 20th of January; I then was at Newgate-street. I came to live at Bull and Mouth-street on the 17th of March. My cousins, as I called them, came to see me there; I told the prisoner they were my cousins, but they were not. I never told the prisoner that my aunt left me 400l. I sold him Leghorns worth 10l. for 25s. He made an agreement with me to take one with the other at 12s. 6d. a bonnet. I never quarrelled with him about the balance. I often asked him to settle; but his reply was, get more goods, and I will pay you for them altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner find out you was servant to Mr. Gatfield - A. He saw me there, and asked if I was not in his employ? I said I was. He then said, "give me your hand." He shook hands with me heartily, and said, "depend on me, keep your own counsel, continue to do as you have done, and I will stand by you." I told my master this.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have done every thing to restore your master's property - A. I have; and have a book containing an account of 50l. of money which I have in the Savings Bank; most of it is the money I have received from the prisoner, for goods stolen; and he knew that; the book was given to him with my papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the amount of goods you have sold him - A. 120l.; the value of the property was about 500l.</p>

I told him I had worked for him; I had put bonnets together for him. I do not remember his inquiring about his being a respectable character. I had forgot his address, and referred him to Miss Rogers.</p>

            . I live in Charterhouse-street. I have known Clayton about fifteen months, and have bought things of him. I believe the prisoner called on me once, to inquire where a person named Clayton, whom I had bought chips of, lived. I directed him to Craven-street, City-road; he made no further inquiry. It was before Christmas.</p>

He lodged in another room, and was ill a-bed at the time. I had seen the chest locked three hours before; the staple was drawn; the articles stated in the indictment were taken out of the box, and laid under the bed. Leonard died about five or six days after. I know the property was his. I found the prisoner under the sofa; when he saw us, he ran down into the yard. I followed; he said he would be my butcher, if I touched him. I secured him, and charged him with the robbery. He said nothing. He had no business in that room. He was rather drunk.</p>

He said it was Jack, and that he was going to bed. He slept up stairs. He went out; I told him to shut the door, which he did. In about a quarter of an hour, I heard my door open again, and somebody bustling about the floor at the foot of my bed. I got up, and called for a light; the prisoner jumped up, and told me to say nothing. He got under the sofa; but afterwards ran down stairs. Cox followed him.

            . I am a pig-butcher, and live in Devonshire-street, Mile End. I have known the prisoner two or three months. On the 7th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another man brought seven pigs to me, to kill by next morning. I was not to kill them till I saw him again. The constable came to my house, and I shewed them to him. I told him I knew who brought them to me; but I could not remember his name. He drove the pigs to the watch-house; and kept me in custody about ten days. I then gave the prisoner up, as having received them of him. He had called about four days before, and said most likely he should have a job for me.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th of April, I was informed that some pigs had been driven into Thompson's house, I went there, and asked him if he had any pigs in his house? He said he had. I asked him who brought them? He said he did not know. I said that was strange. He said he believed he should know one of the party, if he saw him again; but they were going to be fetched away, and driven to Romford market next morning. I took him and the pigs to the watch-house. He was admitted to bail, to bring the man forward. I mentioned several names to him at his second examination. He said he believed Lunnun was one of them. I had mentioned Lunnun to him at the watchhouse; he did not then fix on him.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I was with Mr. Michod, and marked the copper on Saturday night, and watched the premises. On Monday night, about twelve o'clock, I heard a great noise on the roof - They were tearing the copper up; we waited at the end of the house, the three prisoners came down, I secured Rew first, the patrol and I followed the other two-Harwood jumped into a cellar, Cremer was secured, and then we went down and took Harwood in the cellar. When we first rushed upon them they each had a bundle of copper. When we brought them out there was an attempt to rescue them.</p>

Between nine and ten o'clock on the night in question, I found the prosecutor's premises in Jenny's hole broken open; I went and informed him, he came down, and missed the things.

I immediately crossed the Strand, went down Norfolk-street, overtook them about a hundred yards down, and made a catch at one of them; he got out of my hand, and all three ran away. I pursued through different courts, at last the prisoner fell down, and as he fell he threw the pocket-book from him, to the left; I secured him with my right hand, and with my left picked the pocket-book up, which contained the property stated in the indictment.</p>

I saw something red under Cood's arm, he was foremost. I knew there were six shawls on the counter five minutes before. I ran into the shop, and missed four crimson shawls. I pursued across the road into Mount-street, and saw the prisoner, Allen, walking on the pavement, which is not within view of the shop. I asked him to pursue those boys, as they had robbed me of four shawls - He immediately pursued after Cood. He and the boy made a stop at the end of the street, as if they were stopped by the posts - I lost sight of both. When I got to the end of the street, I saw Allen running with the shawls under his arm, and Cood running in a different direction. I saw Mr. Goldie, begged of him to pursue after Allen, and pointed him out to him. I saw Allen make off to an obscure court. He was taken with the shawls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Allen pursued willingly. I have since learned that he is a constable. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170042"/>afterwards saw them running in different directions-Allen was running before Cood, and had the bundle under his arm. He could have conecaled it under his coat if he had liked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How were they going in contrary directions - A. Both were running the same way. The boy was before Allen. I think he might have stopped him if he had liked.</p>

            . I live in Mount-street. I was crossing Whitechapel-road, heard the cry of Stop thief! turned round, and saw Cood running; Allen was a few yards behind him; another boy was a little way behind him-the prosecutrix was pursuing all three. Allen had something red under his left arm. I ran up, and asked the prosecutrix whom I should stop? she said the man with the shawls. They were all running towards Mile End turnpike. Allen was more to the left than any of the others. They were then at a greater distance from each other than when I first saw them. My attention was entirely fixed on Allen. I saw him enter Wood's-buildings - I cannot say whether the boys went up there. When I got to the entrance of the court, which is very narrow, there was a great crowd collected, which prevented my pursuing so fast. I called out Stop thief! When I got into the court Allen was beyond Cood four or five doors. Some persons had stopped Allen, and were bringing him back. I took him; he endeavoured to get away from me. As I was taking him out of the court, he said "This is the boy who stole the shawls." In my judgement, if he had been attempting to stop the boy, he could not have helped seeing him when he 
passed. I secured Cood also. When we got into the road Allen again endeavoured to get away; Cood also endeavoured to get away. Allen never intimated that he 
was a constable, or that he was pursuing the boy.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. I only lost sight of him while I turned round to speak to the prosecutrix. I thought Allen was the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Allen say "Let me alone; this is the boy, and I will have him " - A. No; I do not think he did.</p>

               <p>COOD'S Defence. I live in Whitechapel. A boy accosted me, and said he was going to buy a pair of stockings. He brought the things out of the shop, and told me to take them to a man with a white coat.</p>

When I was about the middle I found the crowd so great that I was obliged to turn, and go with it. I felt somebody press very hard upon me; at the same moment my coat was lifted up. I looked round cautiously, and observed the prisoner take his hand from my pocket. I tried to catch hold of him - He shrunk back as far as he could, and nearly fell to the ground. At that instant I heard something fall on the pavement, which sounded like metal. I immediately seized him, suspecting he had taken my box - I missed it out of my coat pocket. It was given to me by a person near me. I am certain the prisoner's hand came from my pocket.</p>

On the 15th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me to take some stays with her, to shew some servants in Finsbury-square - She said she was cook there. I took ten pair with me. She went down Mr. Montague's area, and told me to walk about. She came up and said if I would leave them the servants would try them on while the dinner was up stairs - I gave them all to her. She told me to call again in half an hour, and bring two dresses with me. She came up again, and walked as far as Featherstone-street with me, and then went into a bird-shop. In half an hour I returned to the house, and could not find her. She was taken about a fortnight after. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

I saw a person go up the steps of the house, and I found the prisoner concealed behind the bottle-rack. I took him. On lifting him up I found he had no shoes on. I asked him what he did there? he said he had just dropped down there to go to sleep. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170044"/>asked him where his shoes were? he said he had been ill used by several people, and they had thrown his shoes away. I gave him in charge of Cox, went to the roof of the building, found the gutters cut all to pieces, and the lead lying near them. I found a chisel at the back of the building, and part of a pair of sheep shears, with which he might have cut the lead. It weighed 157 lbs.; some of which was ready to be thrown down.</p>

They got off the roof on to a bow-window, and from there on the ground, ran through the yard; before I could get up to them one got over the wall; I went back for the other, he could not get out at front, and ran towards the back again. I found him behind the bottle-rack. He said he had been in liquor, and did not know how he got there-he had no marks of violence on him.

            . I live in Long-alley, Moorfields; my husband is a shoe-maker. I was at Highbury; I never saw the prisoner before that, nor the prosecutor. I was trying to get into the gardens. The prosecutor turned round, put his hand to his fob, and said, "I have lost my watch." He took hold of the prisoner, and said, "You have got my watch. He put his hand to his fob. The prosecutor appeared to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Very much so, did he - A. Yes, he smelt so, walked so, and could hardly stand. He called for an officer, who took the prisoner into custody. He said,"You have got my watch;" the prisoner denied it. He(the prisoner) never moved or struggled at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Not struggle at all - A. No; nor even attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you think the man was so drunk that he did not know what he was about - A. I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know where the prisoner lived - A. No, he was a perfect stranger to me; I did not know where he lived, nor do I know now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner where you lived - A. Yes, I told him at Islington where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at the time - A. At home-at Highbury Barn; I left him there, while I went up with the prisoner. My husband was in the gardens; he had been there about half an hour; I did not see him in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk home with him - A. No, I missed him, and went home; but I did not go home with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the spot where you left your husband from where the man was robbed - A. About four or five yards; I left him to go with the prisoner. I left my husband in the gardens half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the spot where the robbery was committed - A. Within one hundred yards. He got home before me, because I went before the magistrate at Islington; the magistrate was not at home. I saw nothing of my husband till I got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officer who first came up - A. Yes, he delivered him to another officer. The first officer did not go before the magistrate. I do not know his name.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I am not at all concerned in this case. I was at Highbury, on that day, with the Jewish free-school children. This accusation occurred about five o'clock in the afternoon. When I came out of the garden, I saw a mob on the outside of the house, and saw the prisoner; the prosecutor had hold of him. I knew neither of them. I asked what was the matter? He said a man had been robbed of his watch. I said is that man robbed? He said, No. The prosecutor put his hand down to the prisoner's trowsers.</p>

My watch hung at the bed-side. I shut the bed-room door, and left the key in it. The prisoner, and three others, slept at my house that night. They came down together, at about five o'clock, called for a pot of beer, and then went out. I went up stairs, and found the bed-room door wide open; my wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170047"/>and child were asleep. I awoke them, and missed the watch.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and found four men in the house. They denied the charge. I took them to the watch-house. I began to search them, and found a chain and key on the prisoner, which the prosecutor claimed. The prisoner said it was not the prosecutor's, for he bought it in Scotland. The prosecutor still insisted that it was his; he knew it by a knot in it. The prisoner appeared confused. I put him in a separate place from the others. He then said, "Let me out, and I will tell you all about it; but don't tell the others what I have told you." He went to a cupboard in the watch-house, and brought me out the watch, seal, and two keys, and gave them to me. The prosecutor claimed them. He offered me money, to go to the prosecutor, and beg for him.</p>

            . I happened accidentally to be in the watch-house when the prisoner and his companions were brought in. I know nothing of them. All four were put into the same room with me; the prisoner was afterwards taken out, and put into a separate room. After he was taken out, I happened to look through a hole in the door, and saw him take the watch out of the coal-hole, and give it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put it there - A. I saw the Mulatto man take something from him, and put it in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between the prisoner and the Mulatto - A. I heard the Mulatto say, "I have got 40l. coming to me; and if you will take the charge upon yourself, I will take care to collect the money, and settle it with the landlord and officer, so that you shall not be hurt."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since you were discharged from Newgate - A. I came out the day before yesterday, by proclamation. The prisoner's brother was present when the Mulatto asked him to take it upon himself. I really do not know what I was charged with.</p>

He would not look at them, but turned from the counter, to go away. I saw a shawl hanging from under his coat. I ran round the counter, and seized him at the door. Before he got out, a lady and gentleman who were in the shop immediately absconded. They had paid me a forged note, and given a false address. A man, dressed like a sailor, was near the door; I called to him to assist me, but he went away. The prisoner made considerable resistance, during which time the shawl dropped from under his coat.

On the 16th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, Reading, in my shop, a person came in and asked me if I had sold anything, as a girl had gone out with a blue bundle under her arm. Reading then said there was a girl gone out, but she did not think she had taken anything. I ran round the corner, and found the prisoner, Pack, in a court close by, and asked her for the things she had taken? she said she had not got anything. I found the cotton on the other side a wall near where she stood; she was brought back to the house; Reading was still there. They denied any knowledge of each other.</p>

On the 12th of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came to the shop with nine band-boxes, which they offered for sale; I said I did not want them-they left the shop. I immediately missed the shawl off the counter. I went after them, they said they had not got it; I stopped them, and found the shawl behind a hedge in a garden close to where they stood; they saw me coming after them-nobody but them could have taken it; I saw it safe two minutes before. I did not search their boxes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners, in company with two women, in Islington-road, at the corner of a field - I suspected them. When I got near them, the prisoners withdrew towards the field where the sand is kept for making bricks. The women were eating veal; they escaped with some plates and spoons. I watched the prisoners, and saw Jones with something in a basket. I went towards them, and asked them what business they had there? they said they wanted chalk. A man on the premises gave them in charge for trespassing. I found the cask and cock in the basket.</p>

            . I am beadle of Bloomsbury parish. I apprehended the prisoner, Pound, on the 8th of June, in Dyot-street, and found a gown and shawl on her back. She said she stole them from St. Pancras workhouse, with another girl, whom, she said, might be found at No. 2, Charles-street, Drury-lane. I went and found Russ there. She said she stole a gown, which another girl in the room had on. She gave it to me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wadmore, and live next door to Mr. Hinxman's slaughter-house, in Clare-market. On the 4th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of the slaughter-house gate with a bag on his back. Before I saw him come out, he was standing at the door, and wanted me to go up stairs, and put my master's children to bed; he had no business with them. I remained at the door, and then I saw him come out of the slaughter-house with a sack on his back, which appeared very full; but I could not see what was in it. He was in his butcher's dress, with his jacket and apron on. He went towards Lincoln's-inn-fields. I followed him there, and then told Mr.Poole, who was in sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I have known the prisoner some time; I never had any dispute with him, nor resentment towards him.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 4th of June, in the evening, Eliza Hall pointed the prisoner out to me at the begining of Lincoln's-inn-fields; he had a sack, which was quite full. I and Thomas Chettle followed him to Crown-street, St. Giles's, without losing sight of him. I lost sight of him there, it being dark; some people crossed over the way, which hindered our seeing him for a moment. We remained there, and in a few minutes we saw him come out of a chandler's shop kept by

            . I am a butcher. I went with Poole after the prisoner; he has spoken correctly. I parted from him, and went to Mr. Hinxman, told him what had occurred, and then got Furzeman. When the prisoner went into the house, he had an apron on; but when he came out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170053"/>he had none. When I got Furzeman, we found the prisoner in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane. He was taken into custody. After that, I returned to Poole, in Crown-street. I had seen Woodford's son come out with the prisoner; before that I saw him come out and go into the chandler's shop once or twice, and then go into the boiling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You came to the house again, and Woodford, sen. was there - A. Yes-Poole, Wadman, Hinxman, Furzeman, and Roberts were there, with Woodford, sen. his wife, and daughter. We went into old Woodford's boiling-house, and searched all over the premises, except one large box, which he would not open, but found nothing there. My attention was called to the next door, which was the chandler's shop, out of which the prisoner and Woodford's son came. As we smelt and heard something, we went immediately to the privy, and found a great deal of fat. We drew up a large quantity of it; it was bullock's fat, pieces of caul, and gut fat. It was not in a fit state for sale, for it had not been cleaned. It was not in such a state as it is when sent out for sale; it must have been further cleaned, before it could be in a state for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding it in the state you did, could you tell whether it was fresh off the bullock - A. It was just off the animal, and was quite warm; if it had been warm with the weather, it would have been putrified. As soon as we went in and had pulled the first piece of fat out, Woodford,sen. made his escape; and I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I followed the prisoner with Poole to the corner of Lincoln's-inn-fields. I was before Mr. Poole all the way. I lost sight of the prisoner, in Crown-street, for a moment. I followed him, because I wished to see where he was going to take it. I do not know what was in the sack.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you tell by appearances what was in the sack - A. Yes, I could tell it had hot fat in it; because, when a bag has hot fat in it,it slides off the back. The sack did so. We found the sack and apron in the wash-house belonging to the chandler's shop. I turned the sack inside out, and it was all greasy; there were lumps of fat as large as an egg remaining in it. It was the same kind of fat as I found in the privy; it was quite fresh and sweet, and evidently from a beast but newly killed. We only found one sack and one apron there, and the sack looked like the one I saw on the prisoner's back.</p>

            . I am a constable. I assisted in taking the prisoner. We then went to Crown-street. Mr. Chettel has spoken correctly. The fat was found in the privy. I produce the sack and apron, which were found by the weights and scales in the wash-house,next to the privy.</p>
               <p>ELIZA SCOTT. I keep the chandler's shop in Crown-street. Woodford,sen. hired the wash-house of me on the 30th of May. He kept a tripe-house next door. He must go through my passage, to get to the wash-house. I did not see the prisoner there. Some scales were in the wash-house. Robert Woodford, jun. borrowed a four pound and a two pound weight of me, at about a quarter or half past nine o'clock that evening. He returned them to me with a lamp, which he had taken out of the shop without my leave, within two or three minutes after he had borrowed them. After he had borrowed the weights, he went out of the door, and a man went out with him whom I did not know. I saw the fat after it was taken from the privy.</p>

            . On the 4th of June, I delivered seven beasts to be slaughtered at Mr. Hinxman's. I saw the gut fat; there were about 16lbs. short. There were other fats also deficient in some of the beasts. Part of that found in the privy would have made them complete; it corresponded with the weight that was deficient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We can sometimes tell the fat of one beast from another by the colour; this corresponded also in colour.</p>
               <p>JOHN HINXMAN. I do not know the sack nor apron; all butchers wear them. The prisoner had no authority to take anything from my slaughter-house that day, nor had he any business on the premises at that time of night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Nobody but my servants have access to the place. The fat corresponded with Mr. Hick's beast; and was worth above 2l.</p>
               <p>MR. CHETTEL. It is the same sort of sack the prisoner was carrying. <rs id="t18180617-170-verdict951" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am servant to Mr.Robson, of Brompton. I saw the prisoner jump up behind the carriage-he stopped two or three minutes. I saw Mrs. Bates was alarmed - I was close by the carriage. While she turned her head to speak to her servant, the prisoner put his hand in the carriage, and took out a black ridicule. I ran after him-Howe stopped him. I never lost sight of him. He dropped the ridicule before Howe got up to him. A boy picked it up and gave it Howe. Several boys came round. He threatened me very much.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HOWE. I was driving my mistress out - She was speaking to me; I turned round, and saw the prisoner jump off the step - He ran with his arms folded. I kept looking at him for five minutes. My mistress missed her ridicule. I pursued him, but lost sight him - He laid down by another boy. I went back to the place, but could not find him. I at length caught sight of him with another boy - They both ran very fast-one of them dropped the ridicule; I took the prisoner. The last witness charged him with being the boy. He swore, and made use of very bad language, and attempted to get away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in the shop-the prisoner was looking at some lace in a basket. She stood with her apron against the counter-the piece of lace was between her and the basket. I saw her look both ways, then put her hand to it, and drew it under her apron; after which she rolled it up in her apron, and went as far as the door. I told her she had something which did not belong to her; she said she believed not. I found the lace in her apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember being before the magistrate yourself - A. No; I was sent for, and said I would go on Monday, but could not. It was about a charge that was taken last Easter. A man had been gambling - I searched him, put the money on the table, and the other officer took it up; I did not keep the money. I have paid it out of my own pocket, but I never had it.</p>

I found the three prisoners in the two-pair back room. I sent for an officer, and gave them in charge. I found about 25lbs. of lead cut from the gutters; the sink had been cut away, and put up ready to be taken off - They said they came there for a night's lodging.</p>
