                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live at 88, Stevens Road," West Ham—on March 1st I purchased this postal order for £1 at Stevens Road Post Office—I took the counterfoil off it, and put the order into a letter which I was going to post—this is the envelope, addressed to Mrs. Palmer, Reading Room, Necton, Swaffham, Norfolk—while I was in the office the prisoner came in—I had the order in my hand, and I asked him if he had collected the letters outside—he said, "Yes"—had not put the order into the envelope before the prisoner came in—I had it in my hand when I spoke to him—he could have seen me put it in—he stood by my side—I do not know if he saw me put it in—I sealed up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250004"/>
               <p>the envelope and dropped it in the prisoner's bag—I afterwards heard something from Mrs. Palmer, to whom it was addressed—the prisoner could have seen to whom the letter was addressed if he had liked—I did not write anything on the order before I put it into the envelope—the writing now on it is not mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I fastened the envelope securely—I gave it a bang with my fist on the counter—a piece of blotting paper was in front of me there—I should have missed the post if the prisoner had not come in—I was not particularly anxious to catch the post—I think I have mentioned before to-day that I asked the prisoner if he had collected outside—I have been sending postal orders for some time to this address—they were for the support of my father—Mrs. Palmer is my father's sister in law—she looks after him—he is eighty-one years old—I believe I paid 4 1/2 d. for a packet of twenty-five sheets of paper and twenty-five envelopes—, I do not know if the gum on thin envelopes fastens more quickly than that on thick ones—I do not use many—I swear that I put the order in<lb/>side the envelope; I am positive on that point—I do not remember ever having made a mistake when enclosing anything in a letter for the post—I did not fill in the name of the payee on the order; I never do so—I did not know I ought to do so; I know it now—I very likely made two mistakes in the spelling of the address on the envelope—I never went to the School Board.</p>

Dear Sir,—Will you kindly forward to the above these two pledges, and oblige, yours respectfully, G. Ash"—I put the memoranda on it, "Postage 6d., 18s., 2s. change sent"—the pledges were for 18s., and the postal order being for £1, I returned 2s.—I filled the 20s. order in—it was received blank—we cashed it—there were two pawn tickets in the letter to us—they referred to a signet ring, 10s., and a lady's keeper ring, 7s.—the other 1s. was for postage and interest—they were pledged in the name of Ash—we obtained the postal order for 2s. on the same day from the Leytonstone Road Post Office—I sent it in a registered letter to G. Ash. 194, Gloucester Road, Stratford—I did not fill it up, it was sent blank—I do not know how the name "G. Ash" got there—I gave the letter to James Hare to post—I think</p>

I am an overseer at the Stratford Post Office—the prisoner has been employed there for about ten years—he was on duty there on March 1st—it was his duty to make a collection from Stevens Road Post Office at 4 p.m.—he should bring the letters he collected there to the Stratford Sorting Office and turn them out on the table—he was also on duty on March 5th—he performed the 10 a.m. delivery of letters in the Plaistow Road—this paper bears the prisoner's signature as receiving a registered letter for delivery; it also bears the number of his uniform in his own writing—this other paper bears the addressees' receipt for that letter, signed "G. Ash"—the prisoner returned it to the office on his return—that is his voucher for the fact that it has been delivered—he has been under my supervision for about two years—I have seen him write daily—to the best of my belief, the signature "G. Ash "is in his writing; it is written in the same coloured pencil as supplied to postmen, as the prisoner's signature—I say the letter to the pawnbroker is also in the prisoner's natural writing—to the best of my belief, the signature "G.

                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk in the secretary's office at the General Post Office—I have been making inquiries lately into the loss of letters in the Stratford Post Office—I had this matter under my observation in May—on May 18th I saw the prisoner at the Stratford Post Office—I told him my name was Murray, that I had been instructed to make inquiries in connection with the loss of certain stolen letters which had passed through his hands—I cautioned him, and said I should take down anything he said and it might be used against him—I showed him the 20s. order, and said it had been purchased by Mr. Knight and had been dropped into his bag on March 1st—I pointed out that the letter reached its destination, but the order was missing, that it had been traced to the possession of Mr. Greaves, and that the letter to the pawnbroker appeared to be in his writing—he said, "It is not my handwriting"—I said, "The pawnbroker purchased a 2s. order and enclosed it. in a registered letter with two rings, addressed to Ash, 194, Plaistow Road. You signed for the registered letter, but you never delivered it at 194, Plaistow Road"—I showed him the tab which he received from the post office—he said that was his signature—I said the signature "G. Ash" was in his writing—ho said, "No; it was signed by the young woman in the shop"—he said he had delivered it—I took him round to the shop and confronted him with Mr. and Mrs. Hawkes—they said they had no young woman in the shop—I asked the prisoner what ago the woman was—he said about twenty-five or thirty years, and that she was doing something in the shop; he did not say what—I suspended him on that day—he was given into custody nearly a month afterwards—I have made a study of handwriting—I have had a good deal of experience in considering handwriting—I asked the prisoner if the list of roads was in his writing, and he said "Yes"—it contains some of the words which appeal in the letter to the pawnbroker—the word "road" is abbreviated with two dashes under the "d" in the list and in the letter—I see "Plaistow" in both documents—I see a resemblance in both words, and in particular in the "P"—it is a somewhat curiously formed "P"—also the capital "W" in West Ham—there are other resemblances which I have noticed—I put the red marks on the delivery sheet for my own guidance in examining the writing and comparing it with the other documents—I have no reason to doubt that the latter is in the prisoner's undisguised</p>

               <p>writing—at my suggestion the prisoner wrote a copy of the letter to the pawnbroker from my dictation—I noticed certain similarities between them—I see a dot between the "Dear" and the "Sir" in "Dear Sir," and in the words "Will you kindly forward" there is a very strikingly formed small "f"—the letter which he wrote from dictation is much larger than the other letter or the list—I have compared the signature "G. Ash "which I saw him write with the one on the receipt—I say they are in the same writing, and, in my opinion, in the prisoner's writing—I should say the signature to the receipt is disguised—I say the signa-ture on the 2s. orders are in the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of 2, Kingsland Road, Hoxton—I made an examination of the body of the deceased on June 25th with Dr. Lowsely—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a small scar behind the right ear, not recent, and a few old scratches; there was a recent blood tumour as large as a walnut on the outer side of the right leg, two small recent grazes on the outer side of the right knee, "a little black material was deposited on the right side of the nose; I think it was lampblack—on opening the skull I found congestion of the brain and an effusion of blood—in my opinion death was due to compression of the brain from the effused blood, which was the result of concussion or severe shock—a direct blow would not have been sufficient to account for the effusion of blood—if it had been a direct blow I should have expected to find some external mark of violence—a fall on the ground would account for the symptoms of effusion of blood if it were a pro-counter stroke, that is to say, you get a blow at one part of the body, which is directed</p>

               <p>along some other organ and eventually shakes up the brain—there were no external marks on the head—cases do occur where death is due to effusion of blood caused by violence, although there is no external sign—in my opinion, a fall on the ground would be sufficient to account for this effusion of blood, and cause the concussion of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The small scar behind the right ear was several days old—I think the tumour was received about Saturday night—it had nothing to do with the cause of death—I do not know what caused it—he may have struck his leg against the kerb as he fell—it was an un-important injury—if there had been a violent blow in the face I should have expected to find bruising—it is not always necessary to receive a violent blow to cause a fall—in the ordinary sense it takes a pretty good blow to knock a man down—I should expect to find a mark at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> if he had received a blow sufficient to knock him down on Saturday night.</p>

"If I cannot get them out one way I will get them another; I will set fire to the place but what I will have them out; I will burn them out"—I said to him, "Mind what you are saying; there are people in this place here; you do not know who is here; mind what you are saying"</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted.</hi>) I am a mining engineer residing at Douai. Nord, France, and have had over twenty years' experience of mines-in 1901. I met Pappa in Paris—both prisoners speak and write French—Pappa proposed to me that I should become a technical director of the Clifton Consolidated Copper Mines of Arizona—I had to purchase 600 shares, and I paid £600 to the Anglo-Continental Agency—having become a Director. I went to America in October or November. 1901. with Heckscher for the purpose of examining and reporting upon the property—I saw the whole of the company's claims—I met Mr. Dunham on the property he was then the resident manager of the mine—at that time the four claims in question in this prosecution were not part of the company's property—I did not attend a board meeting on September 23rd. 1902: I think I received notice of it—I attended a meeting on September 30th—I first went into the Anglo-Continental Agency's office at 47, Old Broad Street, and there saw the two prisoners—the room was next to the office of the Clifton Company in the same building—Pappa said that he and Heckscher had bought four claims in Arizona for 9500 dols., and were disposed to sell them to the company at the same price, but that if the company did not want them he was not anxious to sell them—Pappa pointed out on a plan the four claims—they were practi-cally in the middle of the company's property—the average price that the company paid for the other claims which they had acquired when the company was formed was.37,000 francs, while the new purchase worked out at 11.000 francs, each—I then attended the Clifton Company meeting—there were present Mr. Mace, the chairman; Mr. Pappa, and Mr. Larchin. the secretarv—Heckscher came in, although he was not a. director—when the directors wanted information they sent for him—he held a power of attorney to represent the company in the United States—at that meeting the minutes of September 23rd were read and con-firmed—they were translated into French for my benefit—I heard this read from the minute book: "The acquisition of some further claims which has been recommended by Mr. Dunham, was confirmed, and the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250041"/>
               <p>secretary was instructed to call a meeting for Tuesday, 30th met., at two o'clock, at which Mr. Fontaine was to be asked specially to attend to advise the Board in the matter of the acquisition of these claims"—at the meeting on the 30th. a plan was produced indicating the position of the four claims, I was asked for my opinion, and I supported the resolution for the purchase—this is the plan—the claims are coloured dark blue on it—this resolution was then carried: "The acquisition of four claims called 'Raven,"Eagle." Mount Vernon No. 3.' and 'Sparrow' was discussed, and it was resolved that the same should be purchased; it the price of 9,500 dols in cash, and cheque for the equivalent was parsed for payment as soon as funds in hand of the company will permit"—at that meeting Pappa said, Heckscher being present, that they had purchased these four claims for 9,500 dols., and that they were prepared to sell them to the company at the same price, but that if the company were not desirous of having them they were not anxious to sell them—I believed the statements made by the prisoners—I had had no notice or information that those claims had been located by Mr. Dunham on behalf of the company before the meeting of September 30th, nor had I seen any accounts showing work done on these claims—I received technical reports every month, but nothing to show that Mr. Dunham had located these claims—I first heard that these four claims had in fact been located by Mr. Dunham on behalf of the company in April this year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Heckscher had no salary from the company—he gave advice to the company when the directors asked for it—he came in and out at every meeting—before the meeting of September 30th I knew from Pappa that there was a question of acquiring fresh claims, but I knew nothing else—when I first gave evidence I had forgotten this—about that time I saw Pappa in Paris, but he did not tell me about the four claims—I am quite sure I did not refer him to Mr. Fribourg—if I had approved of the purchase when in Paris, Pappa would have said, "Mr. Fontaine has approved of the purchase"—Pappa's statement is false if he says so—I voted at the meeting for the purchase of the four claims because I thought they would be advantageous to the company, and because they were recommended by Mr. Dunham—it was stated at the meeting that there was not enough money in the bank to pay for the claims—it was not stated then that the prisoners, owed £2.000 upon certain deben-ture—I do not recollect that Pappa explained to me prior to or at the meeting of September 30th that the £1,958 which they were to obtain. for these claims, was only to be used in paying up calls on debentures that were due—the prisoners told me they had bought the claims, and I had confidence in them—I did not know their financial position—I afterwards knew they were pressed for money when they did not fulfill their engagements—during October, 1902, they asked whether they could obtain at Douai, where I resided, money on debentures—there was some correspondence about it—I was not surprised that the prisoners should offer to sell the claims at the same price as they bought them at, as they were interested as shareholders in the company, and had an interest in the concern going well—I thought the claims were worth a good deal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250042"/>
               <p>more than 9,000 dols., considering the previous claims had been obtained on an average price of 37,000 francs and this was only 11,000—Pappa did not in Paris before the meeting tell me exactly the whole history of these claims, and that they had been located for Heckscher by Mr. Dunham—it was not clearly stated at the meeting on the 30th that these claims had been located by Mr. Dunham for Messrs. Dunham and Heckscher—when the resolution for the purchase was moved, I asked Pappa that the title to the property should be verified, Pappa spoke to the others in English, and the matter was at an end—I did not insist because I thought it was the same as in France, where a deed of sale has to be executed before a notary, and the notary investigates the title—Pappa explained to me the objects of the meeting and the questions which were discussed—he translated the sense to me after every sentence—I am a director of the Omnium Company, which was formed about July. 1903—it is an English company registered in Guernsey—in 1903 Heckscher was in America endeavouring to amalgamate the Clifton Company and the New England Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the English Bar, and also a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States—I have had seventeen years' experience of the practice of the law in America, and have had occasions to consider the mining laws of the United States and the State of Arizona—the source of title to mining lands in America is acquired by the discovery of minerals upon a certain area of land, and the taking possession of it—the Federal law of the United States and the law of Arizona both require that when a person has discovered mineral in land which is subject to location or acquisition by the discoverer, he shall mark it out upon his boundary by muniments, and shall fix somewhere on the land a notice signifying that he has located it as his own property, and he has then 90 days in which to perfect his claim, if he desires to do so; at the expiration of that time, if he is so desirous, he must record in the office of the County Recorder a transcript of the notice which he has posted upon the land; after that he must do certain assessment work to the amount of 100 dols. in each year he holds the claim, which is a question of evidence—from the time he takes possession publicly he has a good title against all the world to that property except against the United States, which has a title over him. but holds its claim in abeyance so long as he continues to do the necessary work required by the Statutes in connection with the location, and ultimately the location may be carried out to the extent of obtaining a patent, and then ho has a title even against the United States itself; his title becomes absolute—this document now handed to me is a certified copy of the records in the County Office—an abstract of the records of a county, if they are under the seal of the County Recorder, certified by him to be a faithful and accurate transcript, is accepted as evidence in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250043"/>
               <p>Arizona—it certifies that there have been recorded in the office of the County Recorder the location of the four claims, "Raven," "Eagle," Sparrow," and "Mount Vernon No. 3"—it complies with the statutory requirements of the Act of 1895 of Arizona—this further certifies that there has also been recorded on the records of the county, proof of labour upon those four claims, so that it is a perfect title—this certificate further sets forth that the money expended in the assessment work has been provided by certain specific parties, the work on the "Raven" mining claim by the New England and Clifton Copper Company, Arizona, owners the "Eagle," by the Clifton Consolidated Copper Company of Arizona owners; and "Mount Vernon No. 3" by the New England and Clifton Copper Company, owners.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had a great many years' experi-ence in practical mining—in November, 1900, I met Heckscher in New York, and brought to his notice certain mining properties in Arizona, which were subsequently purchased by a syndicate—I was acting as agent for the vendors of the property, which afterwards was sold to the Clifton Consolidated Company—I have been practically manager of the company since it started—I took up my duties, and remained at the mines till October, 1903—for the purpose of registering the title to the property, a local company was formed called the Mexican Arizona Copper Company, because the local laws do not allow an English company to be registered as owner—these claims were registered and held by Heckscher and myself as trustees, he and I being directors of the local company—the claims which were then acquired by the company in 1901 are all set out in the schedule to the agreement under which the property was sold—this plan shows in light green the properties which were acquired by the., company on its formation—in the early part of 1902 my attention was directed to certain vacant ground in the midst of our property which I located for the benefit of the company—you first <hi rend="italic">peg</hi> it out, and then in ninety days you have <hi rend="italic">to do</hi> 100 dols. worth of work on each claim—I put up a notice to comply with the law, and reported it at the time—I gave the names to the four claims—before the ninety days expired all the necessary notices were filed by me at the office of the County Recorder of Graham County—in doing the location work we expended the com-pany's money which I was supplied with from time to time—I as manager kept under my supervision books of account there showing the affairs of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250044"/>
               <p>the company and the money expended—I examined the accounts before they were sent over here on the 10th of each month we sent copies with voucher: in fact, a balance sheet and bank statement of what was wanted beyond money spent on the work location. Which I entered in the books, I spent nothing at all for the four clams on May 11th, 1902 I sent letter. enclosing monthly account (or April, 1902. with a copy of my journal in that journal there are entries relating to three of the claims, the "Raven" "Eagle." and "Mount Vernon No.3" it says: "Location on following claims.

I shall be glad to receive a copy of these locations, so that we can, add them upon our own map"—I later sent to Heckscher a tracing of the four new locations. I never made any recommendation to the company to acquire them. because they already belonged to them through my location—it is nor true that they were ever sold at any time to the prisoners for 9500 dols. they never at any time belonged to them—they had never paid a farthing for them—all the money for assessment and location work was spent by the company—I never heard that the company was proposing to buy these claims, which were already their own property. for 9500 dols.—I never hoard till March tin's year that the company had agreed to buy these claims—there was not the slightest reason' why the Clifton Company should in September. 1902, have paid a farthing to the prisoners, for these claims—nobody ever offered me any portion of the money I did from time to time while out there, acquire or negotiate for options on certain other property which was contiguous to the company's property, and informed Heckscher of it—that has nothing whatever to do with these four claims.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made arrangements with Heckscher that we should take up some options for our joint account—I think I located some claim besides the four in question on behalf of the company—I located none lor the joint account on the prisoners and myself. but!

But he never did I had a general talk with him about getting options on claim I am prepared to swear that I did not discuss the location of these particular claims with him on his and my account—I had interviews with him. and later on I located these claims for the company—I had a conversion with him in the spring of 1903 at the Sheldon House Hotel. Elpaso, Texas, but it is absolutely false to say that I asked him in the presence to Mrs. Heckscher what he had done with the claims, and that he told me then that he had sold them to the company—nothing was ever mentioned about selling these claims to the company—there was no</p>

               <p>the Board in London on matters connected with the mines—the prisoners looked after the financial concerns of the company in London—Dunham sent monthly accounts from the mines, which were generally handed to Heckscher to examine—I did not examine them; I should not have understood them—they were afterwards handed to the accountants to put in the books, being first brought before the Board—I received the letter of May 11th, enclosing copy of the journal and monthly account for April—I put the enclosures with the accounts before Heckscher—practically all the letters to Mr. Dunham were dictated by Heckscher—I first heard of the four new claims from Pappa in the early part of September, 1902—he asked me to call a meeting to purchase four claims—the company's maps that we had in the office showed those four claims uncoloured, and therefore not belonging to the company—he suggested the company was to buy them from himself and Heckscher, as I under-stood—I called the meeting of September 23rd, and gave notice of it to the company's solicitor—he was present at the chairman's request—the directors present were Mr. Mace and Pappa—Pappa said at it that the acquisition of these four claims had been recommended by Mr. Dunham—I do not recollect any discussion at that meeting—the claims were shown on the map practically surrounded by the company's claims—Pappa explained that he and Heckscher were going to sell the four claims to the company for 9,500 dols., out of which they would be making no money—the meeting was adjourned to the 30th for the attendance of Mr. Fontaine to advise and strengthen the Board on the matter—I did not give notice to any other French director—I did not know that Pappa had written to Mr. Fribourg, another French director—the meeting was held, and I was present—it began by reading the minutes—Pappa acted as interpreter to Mr. Fontaine—Mr. Mace asked Pappa to explain to Mr. Fontaine the nature of the business—Pappa said, "I have already done so, and he approves of the purchase"—he then had a conversation with Fontaine in French—the chairman stated that it was not possible to carry out the transaction in the present position of the company's funds—Pappa said that the company would be placed in possession of funds very shortly—this minute was afterwards drawn up by me showing the resolution which was passed—a cheque was passed for payment, and approved, but payment was held over till the company was in funds—at that time I did not know that those four claims had been located by Dunham at the expense of the company—Heckscher did not show me Mr. Dunham's letters that he received from time to time—he might have read sometimes an extract which referred to the working of the mines—this letter of July 30th enclosed the plan of the four new claims, and says, "Please hand maps to Mr. Larchin"—that was not done; I never had such a map—the letter did not come under my notice till these proceedings—it was no part of my business to make myself acquainted with all the details of these transactions—this document of October 28th, 1002, is a kind of sale note showing the sale by the Anglo-Continental of the four claims—on October 29th the cheque for £1,958 was drawn, payable to the Anglo-Continental Agency, signed by Mace and Pappa, and counter-signed</p>

               <p>by myself—I knew at that date that the Agency was liable for about £2,000 to the Clifton Company on debentures—I knew at that date that the balance of the Agency at the bank was about £75, and that this cheque was paid in to the account, and provided the money to pay for those debentures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite sure I did not know that the four claims in question had been located by Dunham at the expense of the company—I did not see when the accounts were sent in that certain money had been expended upon them—I never looked at the accounts—I was asked, before I was summoned, to give a statement to Mr. Blair, the solicitor for the prisoners—I did not give it; I refused to sign it—a statement was drawn up, and I submitted it to my solicitor; acting under his advice, I did not sign it—I say Mr. Blair dictated the following state<lb/>ment, and it was not from myself: "I remember the accounts sent over by Mr. Dunham, and noticed that they included payments made in connection with the new claims—I did not regard this as showing that the claims belonged to the Clifton Company, and I did not think it was strange the payments should have been made by the Clifton Company on their account, if it was intended by the company that they should at some subsequent time secure them for themselves. These payments were very small, only a few pounds altogether. The whole of the other properties held by the Clifton Company had been obtained through Dunham"—it was possibly dictated in my presence without my disput<lb/>ing the accuracy of it—I say it is untrue—at Heckscher's request, I was plaintiff in proceedings brought against the Omnium Company, and obtained an injunction restraining the directors, among others, from dealing with certain shares—after these criminal proceedings were insti-tuted against me, I gave notice to Mr. Blair that I was not going on with the action—Pappa never stated in my presence that he had acquired the claims by purchase, or that he had paid 9,500 dols. for them, but he did say in my presence that they were making no money out of it—I cannot say whether I told Mr. Blair so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My solicitors, on June 15th, 1904, returned the state<lb/>ment to Messrs. Blair and Girling, saying that the statement was not accurate in several details, and that I was quite prepared to give my evidence if my proof was taken properly beforehand—when Pappa said they were making nothing out of the property, he said the price was 0,500 dols.—I was guaranteed my costs in the Chancery action by Mr. Blair—it was really Heckscher's action.</p>

Texas, in February—we met Mr. Dunham there—he asked my husband about money matters, saying he was dread-fully hard up. that he had personally paid out 2,500 dols. for the Balbeck claims which he had "jumped" on January 1st, and asked my husband if he had any money for him; my husband said he had not—he said. "What have you done about the four claims 1"—I do not remember the names exactly; I remember they were names of birds—my husband said that no money had passed but that he had paid for some debentures, and when they were fully paid he would settle with Mr. Dunham and give him his share—Mr. Dunham seemed satisfied and the conversation drifted.</p>

I watched this house with Hillier on the four nights from May 31st to June 3rd—I saw twenty-seven couples enter—by a couple I mean a man and a prostitute—on May 31st I saw one woman enter twice—the women were known to me—I saw about eight couples admitted by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector D.</hi>) I have known the premises 46, Tottenham Street, for about two months as a disorderly house—on June 13th I went there with a warrant against the prisoner and his wife</p>

               <p>—he walked in with the last witness about 10.45 p.m.—I read the warrant to him—he said, "Is that all? I thought it was something worse"—I went over the premises—on the ground floor was what the prisoner said he used as a workshop and a separate room; there was very little stock there—there were a few old chairs and an old mattress—on the first floor were three rooms—one the prisoner said he occupied as a bed room—one was locked—one was apparently occupied by a respectable woman—I did not go into that—the prisoner said it was not his—it is not usual to force a door in these cases—on the second floor were three rooms, one was locked—one was a bedroom occupied by a prostitute who I know and a man—one was empty—the prisoner was with me all the time—he said those rooms were not his—on the third floor were three bed rooms—two were locked—the prisoner told me they were bed rooms—in the one that was open I found a man and a prostitute—the prostitute was standing completely naked—the man was undressing—the prisoner said those were his rooms—that was while we were in the room—the prostitute said "I pay 12s. 6d. a week for the room to occupy, and I bring gentlemen here"—the prisoner shrugged his shoulders as much as to say, "lam caught"—I took him to the station—in reply to the charge he said, "Yes, that is right"—he said he had been there eight months—the following day, June 14th, I went again about 9.30 p.m. and found his wife, and in the room the prisoner said was not his on the second floor, a woman I know as a prostitute and who had been charged at Tottenham Court Road Police Station with soliciting, when the prisoner stood bail for her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and house surgeon to the Hartlepool Union Hospital—I saw Alfre. Garrard Falshire on July 23rd at the hospital—he was suffering from aute rheu<lb/>matism—he was in bed—I made a careful examination of him—his temperature was 1015, which would indicate fever—I saw him again on Sunday morning, when I made a further examination—his condition was practically the same, the fever still continued—I saw him again on the 25th—he was then improving slightly—it is absolutely out of the question that he could be here to-day to give evidence—his liability to be here arises from his illness—I examined his wounds—there vas a scar on the left side of his neck, almost immediately behind his ollar bone, just over 2 in. long, crescentic in shape, and about in. wide—here were marks showing that it had been stitched—there were marks of free stitches—I think it was fairly clear that it had been a punctured would, and not an incised wound—it could have been inflicted with a knie—he had two wounds on the outer aspect of his left upper arm—they were rather smaller in size, and had also been stitched—they could have been caused by a knife—I examined his hands—he had two very small scaron his left hand—his present illness, in my opinion, is in no way due to the wounds.</p>

               <p>Police Court when Falshire gave his evidence—the prisoner was charged with wounding with intent to murder—Falshire's evidence was taken down in the presence of the prisoner, who cross-examined the witness—the deposition purports to be signed by the learned Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">Falshire's deposition read</hi>): "On May 25th last, about noon, we were at Carupano when the prisoner came to me and said, 'What kind of a dinner are you giving me to-day?. I have no jam and milk with my pudding. 'I said, 'I will go and see the cook about it.' I said, 'The pudding is made with milk, and I gave you a pound of jam yesterday.' Prisoner said, 'I will fight you to-day.' I came out of the pantry and went towards the galley. I met prisoner in a rage with his fists clenched. He said, 'I will fight you or any man in the ship.' He struck me on the head with his fist, and was about to repeat it when I knocked him down. He got hold of my legs and pulled me on top of him. He seized me by my collar and I struck him in the face. He was then pulled off me. I spoke to the cook about the pudding. Prisoner was feeling in his pockets and saying, 'Where is my gun? I will shoot the b——.' I went back to the cabin and laid the dinner, and then again met the prisoner on the deck. He said, 'I will kill you to-day or you will kill me.' He raised his right hand with the open knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) which I know to be his, in it. He struck at my head, but I dodged and received "it on the left side of my neck, causing a large wound, which bled. He struck again at me, and cut my hand between my thumb and finger, and struck again at me. I slung a dish I was carrying at him, striking his head. I tried to get away aft, but he caught me by the braces and gave me a severe wound on my felt arm with the knife. It bled profusely. I then ran into the cabin and got my wounds seen to. I was very weak from loss of blood. Prisoner came to the top of the stairs and said, 'Where is the mate and the steward? I will kill one of then.' A doctor stitched up my wounds. I suffered some time, but they are now healed. Prisoner and I had been four voyages together and had no quarrel.</p>

Where is the steward?" I said, "The steward is aft"—he went aft—about twenty minutes afterwards I heard a running on deck—I came out of the galley and went on deck—I saw the steward was down and the prisoner on top—me and the chief officer Norman separated them—the prisoner was feeling in his pocket and asking for his gun—he did not find his gun, but found the key of the store room—the boatswain of a ship always carries it—he opened the store room and took an iron bar or bolt out—the mate and I took it from him, and I went back to the galley—the prisoner went forward—I saw him after about fifteen minutes dressed up, and he had this open knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)</p>

In consequence of instructions received from Inspector Martin, I kept observation on 214, Lower Clapton Road, beginning on June 2nd, when I saw Shillum go to the pawnbroker's there with a parcel about 8 a.m.—he came out without the parcel—on the 3rd the same thing happened at 8.3 a.m., and on the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, all about 8.a.m.—he left the shop without a parcel on those days—on the 10th I stopped him in the Clapton Road, about 300 yards from 214, when he was going in that direction, and carrying a parcel which contained some sheets and a piece of silk—the silk was under the sheets—they have been separated—these are the separated parcels—I spoke to him—he gave an explanation which was not satisfactory, in consequence of which I took him to the police station, where that morning he made a statement to Detective-Sergeant New—I have examined the tickets, and find different addresses upon them, but in the name of Shillum—I have been to those addresses, and find that no such person has been known there during the past eighteen months—he has lived at 14, Inver Road, Clapton, about 300 yards from the pawnbroker's.</p>

I am manager to Mr. George Simon, trading as Simon &amp; Co., blouse manufacturers, 27, Monkwell Street, E.C.—Shillum lias been employed there twelve years as a cutter of blouses—he gets the material from the stock room and takes it to the cutting room, cuts what he requires, and returns the remainder—the quantity required for a certain number of blouses varies according to the kind of blouse—all this silk produced I identified at the police station—it belongs to Mr. Simon—this piece is about 12 yards—the value of the silk taken is £20 to £25—the qualities of these remnants' vary—the price varies from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 8d. a yard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The books record every pawning—I have heard Shillum say the silk cost him more than what was offered him—that was when Perry would not lend all he asked—I have also heard Shillum speak of purchasing pieces of silk after having cut blouses—he said he had bought the silk—I heard he was a silk cutter—after twelve months, unredeemed parcels are put into stock—some are sold—some were paid for by instalment—Shillum seldom gave an address, and I put any address—it had not done quickly—there were many pledges in a day—I should think 4,000 to 5,000 a month—I was there when Perry first came.</p>

I should think—I can-not say that I remember the first transaction—I have always seen Perrv—when I pledged anything, I used to leave the ticket behind me, pretty nearly from the first—as far as my memory serves me, I have seen other people leave tickets to be put on the file, and I believe I asked him to do the same with mine, I am not quite sure—I mostly handed the silk pledges to Perry, who fixed the lending value when he. took them in—no question was asked me with regard to the silk—I have known Perry since we were boys—I do not think he knew I was Mr. Simon's cutter—he knew I was a cutter, but not where I was employed—no question was put to me with regard to that—I always accepted what he offered—I usually knew the value of the stuff. I cannot say did in every case—the value he offered was not anything like the real value—I redeemed some of the silk, but not very often—that would be on Saturday afternoons—I also pledged wearing apparel of my wife and children—that was through illness—I did not tell Perry that, but he knew I had illness—the quantities of silk varied—I cannot say that it was 16 yards, but I have offered some about 9 yards, probably—1s. 3d. per yard would be about the value, I think—there was no set price—I cannot say whether Perry knew my address—he was never at my house—he knew the name—I never gave an address—I usually took the silk when I had something to pledge of my own—when I first went into the shop we passed the time of day, then the parcel was undone—then I used to say what I wanted. I did not always get it, then he would say what he would give—when 1 took any of my own clothes they were put on seperate tickets, and the wearing apparel and the silk were put in separate parcels—I took them</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no other knowledge of Perry than as a pawn-broker—we knew each other as children—I never visited his house, nor he mine—members of my family used to pawn at the shop in the coastland Road when he was living there—that shop was kept by his uncle—it was another branch of the pawnbroking business—we were children living in the same neighbourhood—Perry and his family had no reason to suppose my relations were not respectable people—I knew Wheatley when he looked after the Cassland Road business—when Wheat leys went away Perry succeeded him—I was entitled to buy silk just a shade above the cost—besides that there were some cuttings over—I kept the remnant—I had no right to do so—we were allowed so many yards, say 5 1/2 yards a blouse, if we got it say, out of 4, and we had a dozen to cut that would leave 4 1/2 yards over, we may have to cut eight or ten dozen at once, that would run into 70 or 80 yards, it all depends on the width of the silk—that I pawned as much as 10 yards in a piece is a mistake, it must have been more than one piece—what was left I took to Perry's, it is what is termed in the trade "cabbago"—it was rolled flat, and not crumpled as this is—the pieces were folded properly so that they would not crease—if very wide it was folded in half, perhaps—I began to steal about the middle of last year—I took pretty well all of it to Perry's—I think on only two occasions have I kept it—I would redeem it and repledge it—I only sold a piece to one person—I might probably have said to Perry, "It has cost more."</p>

Smith, Fawdon &amp; Low, asking for a certificate of naturalization—it was made by Henry Goldschlug, and stated that he was a subject of Roumania; that he was a married man without children; that his settled place of business was 219, Brunswick Buildings; that he had for over five years and within eight years past resided within the United King<lb/>dom; that is to say, from November, 1898, to September, 1902, at 3, Rupert Street, and from September, 1902, to the present date at 219. Brunswick Buildings, making a period of five years six months altogether; that he intended to reside permanently within the United Kingdom that he sought to obtain the rights and capacities of a natural British born subject in order that he might remain and carry on his business as a tailor, and have the other rights of a British born subject—this was supported by a statutory declaration made before a Mr. Prichard, a solicitor, and was further supported by declarations signed by Aloysius Richard Fennel, Charles Graystone, John Graystone, and George Cousins. made before the same solicitor on the same day—there was also a further declaration by John Moyse—this memorial and these declarations were sent in a letter which also enclosed £3 for the fees that had to be paid—the matter was put into the hands of Sergeant Stephens to make in-quiries in the ordinary course, and on his report being found satisfactory a certificate was about to be issued when an anonymous letter came which caused us to make further inquiries, and this prosecution is the result of those inquiries.</p>

I am a solicitor and member of the firm of Smith, Fawdon &amp; Low, of 12, Bread Street, and have been in practice a great number of years—I have known Page a number of years as a surveyor—on April 26th, Goldschmidt and Page came to my office—Page said that he had a friend, Goldschlug, who wanted letters of naturalisation, and asked me for particulars—I told them I did not recollect what fees were payable, but informed them that the declarations of four householders would be required that the applicant had resided here five years, and that also inquiries would be made into his standing, and I made an appointment for the next day—Page, Goldschmidt, and Goldschlug, and I think Fennell, came next day—in the meanwhile I had made inquiries into the fees, which I ascertained were £5, and had obtained printed forms, which information and forms I gave them—I took down from Goldschlug on a printed memorial form his nationality and his position and so on, and I asked him what object he had in taking out letters of naturalisation, whereupon he informed me that he wanted it for the purposes of acquiring premises and going into business here—I filled up the memorial and the declaration, verified from the particulars he gave me, and I gave them four printed forms for householders—I also informed them that the fees would be £11—Page, Goldschmdt, and Goldschlug came the next day with four householders—the declarations of the householders were filled in by my clerk, and they independently went to Mr. Prichard, who was sitting at another table, and took the oath, after having had the declara<lb/>tion read over to them and saying they understood it—Goldschmidt made no declaration—they paid me £11, the fees, and afterwards I sent the declarations and memorial to the Home Office, together with £5, for which I received a receipt.</p>

He has lived with me ever since he has been in this country here," meaning Brunswick Buildings, "and also at 3, Rupert Street"—he stated that when Goldschlug's wife was in London, they had lived together at Brunswick Buildings, and he further said that when Goldschlug had found a good place of business as a tailor, he was going to fetch back his wife from the Continent to live with him—I made other inquiries, and in consequence, I made a favour<lb/>able report to the Home Office.</p>

               <p>and find out, and fix up an appointment—I said that I was too busy to wait and must see him that day, whereupon he said he would try and find his address—we went out—at the top of Coulston Street he pressed five sovereigns into my hand, saying, "Now, Mr. McCarthy, you must make this thing all right for us," and I took the five sovereigns—he then said, "If you like to go and wait at the Three Nuns I will bring the address to you"—I noticed when we came out from Coulston Street a foreign Jew appeared to be following us, and I went off at once, so as not to raise suspicion—I waited for about half an hour at the Three Nuns, when Goldschmidt came back and gave me a piece of paper on which was written," 94 Imperial Avenue, Stoke Newington," and we went to the end of Commercial Street to take a tram there—I hung back a bit, and saw him put something into Hester's hand—as we got out of the tram I noticed this foreign Jew turn round the corner rather quickly—we went into 94, Imperial Avenue, which is a small flat in Rothschild's Buildings, and found Goldschlug was not in, but after a few minutes he came in—he seemed very pleased, and said, "It is all right now; I will get my naturalisation certificate"—I said, "Yes, everything will be all right presently"—he then proposed to have a drink, and we all went out but instead of taking them to a public house we went to a police station—I read the warrant to Goldschlug, and he said, "I do not understand"—Hester read the warrant to him in Yiddish, but as far as I know he did not make any reply—on the warrant being read to Goldschmidt he said he did understand, but made no other reply—Page came voluntarily to Scotland Yard on May 30th and made a detailed statement in writing, which was produced at the police court—he was only summoned, and appeared on the summons—Goldschlug was allowed out on a bail of £50, but he absconded, and is "now, I believe out of the country—Goldschmidt could not find a bail.</p>

I want to tell the truth"—after cautioning him, he said, "All right; I want to tell the truth. I came here from China about two months ago. I had a little business at Port Arthur, and when the war broke out I came away. I wanted to get naturalised, as I wanted to start a public house business.

She has done this because I left her. She sent her daughter here on Sunday, and I gave her 2s. (6d. I saw Mrs. Pearcey at the gate, and she swore at me for not giving her." 3s. I admit I have married her, but it was for the sake of her child"—I took him to the Gray's Inn Road Police Station, where he subsequently made this statement: "Having heard the charge against me, I wish to make a statement giving a full history of my legal marriage with Alice Agnes Jones, and the second ceremony which I went through with Julia Pearcey at the Holborn District Registry Office on May 3rd, I married my wife at St. Thomas' Church, Hackney Road, on June 10th, about twenty-four years ago. The witnesses were my wife's mother, Louisa Jones, and a man named Rider. Both are now dead. I lived with my wife, with the exception of one or two occasions, up to about six or seven years ago. The last occasion I saw her was about two years ago. That was when my father was buried. I stopped making my wife an allowance about four years ago, as I heard she was likely to become a mother, but not by me. I first knew Julia Pearcey about twenty years ago, she was living in Northampton Row; I was living with my wife in the same street. Julia Pearcey was married at that time, and was living with her husband. I was friendly with her then, and was introduced to her by a man named Brock. The friendship continued up to the death of Mr. Pearcey, about seven years ago. After his death I used to go and see her of a Sunday evening; she was living in Baker's Row. From there she took a room in St. Alban's Buildings, Portpool Lane, which I furnished. I visited her there, and one night when it was raining she asked me to stay with her, which I did. At that time I was living away from my wife. I have told Julia Pearcey scores of times I was a married man and that my wife was living. In fact, my own children visited us whilst I was living with her at Edmonton, and they used to speak of their mother in front of us. The witnesses to my second marriage were Ellen Baxter, who is Julia Pearcey's sister, and she was fully aware I was a married man, as I had told her on several occasions. Before my marriage with Julia Pearcey, Ellen Baxter saw me privately, and said to me, 'Jim, I want you to come into the front room, as I have some very important business to speak to you about.' I said, 'What is it?' She said, 'Julia will be a better woman if you only do what I want you to do.' She said, 'Julia wants you to marry her.' I said, 'You know I can't do that, both you and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> know I am a married man.' She said, 'Never mind, nobody <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> know, only us. If you do this only</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250081"/>
               <p>for her, to get her daughter home from school, she will go on all right.' I agreed to marry her on condition that she kept the matter a secret. The other witness to my second marriage was a young man who was employed at the registry office. After the conversation with Ellen Baxter, I spoke to Mrs. Pearcey about what her sister had asked me, and she asked me to marry her. I told her what a risk I was running. She said,' Never mind, nobody won't know, I cannot get my child unless I produce my marriage certificate.' I lived with Julia. Pearcey up to about five weeks ago. I went away from her then because of her drunken habits. I left her on one or two occasions before for the same reason. This statement is true."</p>

I am the assistant medical superinten<lb/>dent at the Greenwich Union Infirmary—I saw James Henry Sexton on April 27th after he had been admitted—he had then been bathed—his body was covered with vermin bites—he was thin, but did not appear to be suffering from any organic disease—I think his condition was chiefly due to want of food—I did not see his clothes then—he was brought to the infirmary again on May 22nd—he was unconscious and exceedingly dirty—I do not think I have seen a more filthy child—his clothes were filthy rags—he died on May 30th, partly from consumption—he was suffering from tubercular meningitis—during his illness his parents came to see him every day—they were usually under the influence of drink and in the quarrelsome stage.</p>

               <p>marks upon them—I was at Grove Park station when the prisoner was Identified on June 29th—Bishop was some distance away, and could not hear anything that was said at the time—Corney identified the prisoner—I took him in charge, and his reply to the charge was, "I admit being there. I came that way home after doing some shopping, and spoke to the watchman. If I have done anything wrong, I am very sorry"—I find if a fish plate is put on the rail there is a little more than an inch between it and the point of the guard—a fish plate is a piece of iron for pinning the rails together, and some were lying about very close by—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a hook from one of the trucks belonging to Messrs.

I am the managing director of the prosecuting company and live at (69, Oakhurst Road, East Dulwich—this is the certificate of incorporation of the company (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—these are three bundles of solder which the police showed me as having been found on Sadler's premises, and which I identified as ours (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they are exactly similar to the sticks we always use, and which we buy from Messrs. Farwig <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co., of Thames Street, in quantities of about two tons per week—this is a smaller bundle of solder that was shown to me—it is not ours—we employ about 700 hands in making tin boxes—in June, in consequence of our missing solder, I directed a watch to be kept in the store room.</p>

I should feel justified in swearing that we have not sold any solder during this year to anyone; we supply very little in the course of business—I have not examined our books to see if we have; I have very little to do with the books—I am almost positive that we did not sell any last year—I identified the metal found at Sadler's at a police station in Wapping, about July 14th, after the prisoners were locked up; the police asked me to come down and see if the solder was ours—the bundles were tied in half hundredweights as usual—on the night of the prisoner's arrest I identified another half hundredweight bundle of solder as ours, which was found elsewhere—these solder sticks are not made to a special design; we have similar sticks, but not the same shape, made for us—Farwig's is a very old firm.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been the timekeeper and storekeeper for eleven years, and live at 15, Hanlon Street, Deptford—it is the duty of the watchmen to see that the store room where the solder was kept was locked—after all the hands are gone there is no reason for going in there—the partition that divides the store room from the passage is about 7 ft. high; anyone would have to get over that if they did not go through the door—I keep the key from 8 a.m. till 7 p.m.—I had been missing solder for some time, and I reported it to the manager, and a box to hold it was made about twelve months ago—it was a box with a lock and held about 30 cwt., but sometimes, there being too much, we had to put some of the solder on the top—we were very busy at the time the robberies were taking place, and we were using from 30 cwt. to 2 tons weekly—on April 12th there was about 15 cwt. in the box, which would do ordinarily until the 18th—on April 15th I found that the lock of the box had been broken, and that we had almost run out of solder, and we had to melt down all the scraps to keep the business going—the value per cwt. Of solder is about 67s. or 68s.—I informed the firm of what had happened—on June 3rd, as instructed by Mr. Clark, I hid myself at 8 p.m., which was closing time, in the store room—Goshawk was out on his rounds, and Thundow was in his van in the yard close by—after about an hour and a half Goshawk came in at the door, which I had received instructions to leave unlocked, looked round, and took a bundle of solder from the box, which was unlocked—I informed Mr. Clark of it—Smith was in hospital at the time, and it was Hayward's night off; there was an odd man</p>

According to what Sadler says, he has been a marine store dealer for forty years—I have known him for five years—he is not a registered metal dealer, who is compelled to keep books, and must not buy metal except in certain weights—if they are convicted they are registered—he has been twice charged for receiving. but was acquitted—he told me he was the only person responsible for the business; up to Christmas he was in partnership with his three brothers—he has a son in the business—he has workmen there—he did not prevent us going in, nor did he <hi rend="italic">bar</hi> us looking at anything—the bundles of solder were in view on the floor—we found that the price that Austin had supplied 2 1/2 cwt. to him, on April 28th, was 64s. a cwt.—this bundle (<hi rend="italic">Small bundle produced</hi>) looks as if it had been cast by an amateur—it is very rough—I cannot say whether it would be possible to cast it in this mould (<hi rend="italic">An iron angle produced</hi>)—I examined Messrs. Austin's books, and found an entry in pencil in one of them of having supplied him with 2 cwt. 3 lb. of tinman's solder two days before the date I went there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He did not show me this iron angle at the time—it would be quite possible to melt down Messrs. Scott's sticks into this shape (<hi rend="italic">Small bundle produced</hi>)—on July 4th. 1000 he was charged with stealing and receiving a cash register, valued at £40, for which he paid £4, from the Royal Albert Docks; the prosecutors failed to appear, and he was discharged—I was not there when he was charged the second time—on May 19th he appeared on four summonses for not keeping proper books—this is the only book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) I found on the premises, and that contains no entry of the purchase from Austin's.</p>

Farwig &amp; Co., of 106, Fenchurch Street with about a ton of solder every ten or fourteen days—I have compared these three bundles of solder found at Sadler's (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) with the mould (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in which I cast my solder, and I can swear they are mine—there is one groove in this mould that has two pin holes in it, and several sticks in these bundles have got the same flaws in them, and these sticks are exactly the same length and shape that I make—this shaped mould is the only one from which I cast solder for Messrs. Farwig.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant R.</hi>) About 12.30 a.m., on June 11th, I went to 187, Southward Park Road and saw Goshawk—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with a number of others in stealing a quantity of solder from his employers, and he said, "Yes, I Lave had some of it; I had a half hundredweight on Friday night. I took it out of the store room and hid it round the other yard behind some crates. I went in next morning at 6.15 a.m., a quarter of an hour earlier than usual. I put the solder on my trolley. I was to have gone to Swan Lane, Upper Thames Street, but instead of going there I went to Red-cross Street, and sold the solder to a dealer at a rag shop, I do not know his name. I got 14s. for it. I said to the receiver (Ray-bould), 'I have got a little bit of stuff.' He said, 'What is it?' I said, 'Solder.' He said, 'Fetch in a sample.' I took him in a bundle. He said,' It is very poor stuff, but I will give you 3d. a lb. for it.' He asked me whether the firm missed it. I said, 'No, it has been going on for about two years.' The cause of this is brought on by one man, Mr. Thundow, a carman. He told Tarrant, another carman, where the stuff was, and Tarrant came and told me, otherwise no one would have known where the stuff was. We have been selling it to Sadler, a marine store dealer in Canning Town. He has been receiving the solder for the last two years from Thundow, Tarrant and myself. I sold him a half hundred-weight of solder about a week after Christmas for 14s. I have not sold him any more since. I gave the carman Trost 2s. out of the money I received for the stuff on Saturday morning. I gave it to him because he saw me get it. The door was open, and I went inside and took the bundle out. He was standing outside at the time. I will show you the man who I sold the solder to"—on arresting Hayward and telling him the charge, he said "I did not steal it. I know some of the carmen had some. I suppose they want to put it all on my back"—I then went to Thundow's house and charged him, and he said, "All right. I know nothing about it"—he was in bed at the time, and while he was dressing he said, "I will tell you the truth. I have only had a share of two lots, 2 1/2 cwt. on one occasion, and 1 cwt. on another, which me and the carman Tarrant sold to Sadler, a marine store dealer in Canning Town"—I was with Inspector Hailstone when Sadler was arrested—on June 11th all the prisoners were taken before the magistrate at Greenwich, and they were remanded for a week.</p>

Goshawk made this voluntary statement to me. which I took down as well as I could in writing: "At Whitsun I received 1 cwt. of solder from Hayward at Scott's promises. He was in his office, and he told mo he had put it on my van. When I got on the van I saw it in a crate on the van. I went to Dunk's, curry people, at Lea, and delivered a load of tins, and from there I wont to Raybould's shop in Redross Street. E.C., and sold the solder for 28s. Raybould paid me in the shop. I had been to the shop before with two half hundredweights of solder all stolen from Scott's, Limited my masters. It was arranged between me and Hayward that he was to have half of what I made on the solder. The 28s. I spent and got drunk. I gave Hayward 5s. on Thursday. I took a half hundredweight from the store room on Friday night. I found the store room door open. I sold it next day to Raybould for 14s. Hayward always took the solder out of the store room and put it on the van."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the licensee of the Sawyer Arms, Bromley Common—I bought the pony in question last December from the prisoner—he asked £14 for it—I said I did not particularly want to buy it—he later on said he would take £7 and two pigs for it—I gave him £6 and two pigs—the latter were worth about £5—he asked me to keep the pigs a day or two, and said, "Perhaps you will buy them back, as I have no place to put them"—he wanted £4 10s. for them—I gave him £3 10s.; so that I paid him altogether £9 10s.—he told me he got the horse from a bookmaker—I sold it the latter end of February to a man named Ayres. of the Rose and Crown, Green Street Green, for £8—I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years—t have had ponies from him before.</p>

Owing to information, I went to the prisoner's place at High Road, Beckenham, in company with another officer—I told him we were police officers, and that we were making inquiries respecting a pony, cart, and harness, which he had sold to Mr. Reeves, of the Sawyers' Arms, Bromley Common—I cautioned him—he said, "Which one do you mean, the roan one?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "Have you seen Reeves?"—I said, "Yes, and have taken a statement from him"—he said, "I bought the pony from two men who I do not know, on a very foggy Saturday, and have not seen them since"—I said, "How much did you give for it?"—he replied, "£4 10s."—I said, "Did you ask them for their names and addresses?"—he replied, "No"—I said, "Did you get a receipt for it?"—he said, "No, the pony was my receipt; I often buy a pony for a hobby; I never ask any questions. I deal in and buy anything, and that pony I sold the following day to George Reeves, the landlord of the Sawyers' Arms, in a 'chop' for two pigs and money—I did not want the pigs, so I resold them to Reeves for £4 15s., as I wanted to get rid of the pony"—I asked him if he could refer me to anyone who knew the men—he said, "No; but I believe they came from Sydenham"—the prisoner made a statement which was written down and signed in my presence—I then told him I should arrest him—when charged, he replied, "I did not steal it, I only bought the pony and cart."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector L.</hi>) I have had both the prisoners under observation for some time—I have seen them together in the street, and at 32, Evelina Mansions, Church Street, Camberwell New Road, as well as at Crampton Street, Newington Butts—on June 22nd, about 6 p.m., I saw the woman leave Evelina Mansions—with Beard and Woollard I followed her to London Bridge—I saw her go into a Brighton Railway refreshment buffet and pay a coin, which I afterwards received, and found to be counterfeit—I then followed her to another refreshment buffet on the South Eastern side—I saw her pay another coin, which I afterwards received, and found to be counterfeit—I produce both florins—I marked one, Sergeant Beard marked the other—on June 24th I was keeping observation at Evelina Mansions—I saw the man enter about 10 a.m. carrying a parcel—about 1 p.m. I saw the woman leave the house with two jugs—directly she had left I opened the door of the house with a key I had—I found an inner door locked—I and other officers forced it open—it led into the middle room of a flat—the man was standing up with a sheet and blanket in front of him opposite the door—the officers seized and handcuffed him—he had an apron on and some slippers, but was dressed—in a few minutes the woman came in, followed by Sergeant Woollard—I said to both prisoners, "We are police officers, and shall arrest you both for making counterfeit coin," and I said to the woman, "And you will be charged with uttering at London Bridge on Wednesday last"—she Paid, "I was not at London Bridge"—I said, "You were, and so were we"—she said, "Did you follow me home?"—I said, "No, we followed you away from home"—the man said. "Was I with her? "—I said. "No, you were not"—he said, "No, you have never followed, me"—I said, "Oh, yes, on several occasions.; last night I rode with you on a tram, and sat next to you, and felt in your jacket pocket to see if you had any coin"—he said, "I remember you now"—the woman said, "Well, you have been very smart on us; who was your informant?"—searching the house in the scullery we found a marble top table, six moulds, four containing two, and one, containing one counterfeit florins—the coins were hot—there were two double and two single moulds—there was also a <hi rend="italic">gas stove</hi> burning, and on the stove a saucepan full of boiling metal and a ladle and spoon—on the table were twenty-five counterfeit florins—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190407250110"/>
               <p>this is the saucepan with the metal still in it—there was also some plaster of Paris, and a thermometer was hanging on the wall—there was another saucepan, also with metal in it—in the middle room I found 150 counterfeit florins, several pieces of zinc, four files, two small bottles, one of silver chloride, and one containing some ammonia powder—the files had been recently used—in the back room, on the ground floor, I found 960 counterfeit florins in one drawer, done up in parcels of twenty-four each—in a bag in that room I found 200 counterfeit florins, and in another bag, sixty—there were also some cyanide of potassium, some milling tools, and three books, one is on electro metallurgy, one is a silversmith's hand book, and one is on electro depositions—the articles are produced—we took the prisoners to the Camberwell Police Station—they were charged later on—I then went to the house in Crampton Street with the other officers—in the first floor front room I found twenty counterfeit florins, finished, and wrapped up in separate paper, each paper being stuck down, also twenty more loose in a bag in this glove—I found this depositor's book of the National Penny Bank, 56, Walworth Road, with no name upon it, it is identified by a number, and begins in 1902—it showed a credit of £265 5s. 4d. at that time, but since then £45 has been drawn out—I also found a paying in book and a cheque book of the London and County Bank, Shoreditch branch—it is simply a slip book with counterfoils—some of the slips remain in it—I also found a quantity of cyanide of potassium, but no moulds at that house—the coins weigh 36 lbs., and there was about 3 lbs. of metal, including what was in the saucepan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had the woman under observation about three months—the first time I saw the man with her was on June 18th, after I had been watching her—I saw him with her on three occasions—I never saw him pass any bad money—on one occasion I saw him carry a bag to Evelina Mansions—it appeared to contain plaster of Paris—the last payment into the bank was in August, 1903—I believe money has been drawn out of the London and County Bank, and paid into the National Deposit account for the purpose of saving it—he carried on business as a hair dresser at 3, Crampton Street, but it is a bogus shop—he has carried on the business by managers—when I broke into his room I had seen him go into the premises carrying a small paper parcel—I found a hammer in the room—I do not remember any nails—he did not appear to have got out of bed, he had his sleeves turned up, and his apron and some slippers on—I assume two objects in holding up the blanket and sheet, one was to cover up the moulds, the other was to throw it over our heads so that he might escape.</p>

               <p>the man came out, followed by her—I followed them through various streets to the New Kent Road—when near 188, the man left her, went to the opposite side and walked on about sixty yards—the woman in about three minutes came out of 188, with a brown handbag, which appeared very heavy—she walked some distance up the New Kent Road, when the man ran up and joined her—they walked to the Walworth Road, when the woman entered an omnibus—I followed her—the man came behind the 'bus and said, "I shall be down after tea"—I afterwards followed her back to Evelina Mansions, and at 7 p.m., whilst keeping observation on 32, I saw the man enter—he left at 8.30 p.m.—I followed him back to 3, Crampton Street—on the 20th, about 12.30 p.m., I saw the woman leave 32, carrying a small market bag—I followed her to Clerkenwell—she entered the warehouse of Messrs. Feil &amp; Co., 147 and 149, St. John Street, tool merchants—about ten minutes afterwards she left with a bag on her arm, which appeared very heavy—I followed her back to 32, Evelina Mansions, which she entered, and remained a long time—that was about 2 p.m.—late in the afternoon the man entered 32, probably about 5.30 p.m.—I kept observation on the house—I saw the woman go in with two little girls—they left about 8.30 with the prisoners—I followed them to the Enterprise Bazaar, in Walworth Road, where the prisoners made several purchases—the following afternoon I saw the man enter and leave 32 alone—the woman left at 7.30 p.m.—I followed her to Vauxhall Station, where I lost sight of her—on the 23rd I saw the woman at 11.45 p.m. leave 32 with two jugs and return—about 7.45 p.m. I saw the man leave 32, followed by the inspector—at 8.15 the woman came out of 32—I followed her to Camberwell Green, she sat on a seat, I got close behind her—I saw her take from beneath her dress a bag answering this description, and shake about twelve florins out of it into her lap—on Friday the 24th, after the arrest, I found this bag at 32, in the middle room, where I had found the man—I also found this receipt of Feil &amp; Co. in the back room, for 16 lb of grained tin, for £1 3s. 4d., dated June 20th, 1904.</p>
