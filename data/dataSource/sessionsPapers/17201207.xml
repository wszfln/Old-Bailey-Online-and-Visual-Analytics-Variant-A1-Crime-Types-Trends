That he (this Evidence) went after wards to the Deceased to endeavour to mitigate the Matter, advising him to sign the Paper, telling him that he believed that the Prisoner was in Drink, or else he would not have used him so. To which the Deceased reply'd Drink is no Excuse for Rudeness; he shan't lye in my Cabbin any longer nor will I forgive him; for he has as good as challenged me; nor will I sign the Paper; for I am not to be huss'd into Compliance. That the next Morning about 10 or 11 a Clock he found the Deceased walking on one side of the Quarter Deck, and the Prisoner on the other side; that he asked the Prisoner where he had lain the last Night, who answered, that he had lain with Mr Weston (the Second Lieutenant) in his Bed, who gave him a Can of Elip before they went to Bed; and then told him that the Deceased had ordered him off the Quarter Deck, but Capt.Boyle had ordered him on again; and told him, that if he had a mind to do himself Justice, he should do it; thereby making an Uriah of him. That presently after the Deceased came to him and told him that the Prisoner had Challenged him before the whole Quarter Deck, and had told him that if he did not do him Justice he would post him for a Coward; that he (this Evidence) told the Deceased he was sorry for it, and again begg'd of him to sign the Paper to put an end to the Difference. That about 2 or 3 a Clock the Prisoner came to him on the Quarter Deck and made a Protection that he would do himself Justice let the Consequence be what it would. That he told him to Morrow was Sunday, and he hoped he would not do it then; upon which the Prisoner asked him if he thought he was Child? and said, to morrow is my Birth-Day, on which I am 30 years of Age; and perhaps it may be the Day of my Death; I have but one Life so left. Upon which he told him, that if he could prevail with the Deceased to sign the Paper he hoped that would put an end to the matter; to which the Prisoners reply'd perhaps it may, and perhaps it may not; as he will. That afterwards, he (this Evidence) went into the Master's Cabbin to consult with him how to prevent the Mischief that might arise from the aforementioned Dispute, and then went again to the Deceased to persuade him to sign the Paper and prevent the mischief which might otherwise ensue; but the Deceased told him that he spent his Breach in vain, for it was not consistent with his Honour to sign it, because it would be to sign himself a Coward; and he was not to be huss'd and bully'd into a Compliance; that the Deceased said his Principles were as honest as any man's, and that he did not intend to Wrong the Prisoner nor any Man; but to pay him as soon as he was able; and that he meant to have sign'd the Paper if the Prisoner had not used him in such a manner; but now he would never forgive him nor Drink with him, nor sit where he was. That the next Morning he was call'd up about 6 o, Clock and found the Deceased dead on the Quarter Deck. That he had 8 Wounds, one whereof was over the Left Pap, through the Left Lobe of the Lungs, coming out under the Armpit, which he judged to be the Cause of his Death. And that about Half an Hour after the Prisoner was brought aboard, and he drest a Wound he had received. That on Saturday the 10th of October following, when Mr. Ely was a Prisoner aboard the said Ship, he told him, that the Captain might have prevented it. This Evidence being ask'd by the Prisoner, further deposed, that the Deceased and the Prisoner were intimate Friends, and the Prisoner very serviceable to him; that the Deceased used to jangle with the Officers, and had once threatened to Cane him (this Evidence) when he should meet him on Shore, to which he (this Evidence) reply'd to the Deceased, that he would not be served by him as he had served Capt. Clarke. And that the Prisoner was Well-behaved, and never given to Quarrel.</p>

It appeared that the Prisoner and the Deceased were intimate Friends, and had been a Fowling together that Day; that when the Prisoner came home he Shot at a Bird in a Tree, the Deceased not being then in Sight, and that another Gun went off at the same time; that when he understood the Deceased was shot, and thinking that it might be done by his shooting at the Bird, he said he was very sorry for it, and had rather it had been himself. That it was 25 Foot distance between the Place where the Prisoner stood when he Shot off his Gun and that where the Deceased fell, and that the Deceased had no scattering Shot at all about him, and his Clothes were burnt with the Flash, and another Gun being heard to go off at the same time, the Prisoner observed that it was most likely to be the Deceased's own Gun which shot him.
