               <p>Was the inside glass, or the outside glass broke? - The outside window; when I ran out, the people said he ran that way, and I saw the prisoner laying down; I crawled to pick him up; his hands and feet were on the ground.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he did not know any thing of it, and that somebody had knocked him down; I did not find any thing upon him; I did not miss any shoes immediately, but the shoes were produced when he came into the shop by one Webster, he is not here; they are my property; they were made for sale; the initials of my name are in my own hand-writing; they have been in my possession ever since; I have kept them separate ever since; there were two pair of shoes taken; Webster produced only one pair; I took a candle, and went and searched, and in the place where he lay, I found this pair among the mud; this pair is also mine, I know it by the work; I have had them frequently in my hand, and put them into the window again; I am induced to believe they are mine, because they were brought in at that time; I would not make oath of them at another time, as I would at this; I believe them to be my property; when I searched for what shoes were missing, I found one pair wanting; I missed three pair in all; when the prisoner was brought into my shop, he had white nankeen breeches on, but they were all over mud; it was dirty weather, and the road had been new made; the shoes are both dirty; they are in the same situation they were when they were returned to me; this pane of glass was three parts broke at the window of my house; it is twenty inches by fourteen; there were shoes against the pane.</p>

               <p>Was you on the same side of the way? - The same side.</p>
               <p>Were there any lights near? - Yes, it was a moon-light night, and there was a lamp, besides candles burning; he snatched the shoes with one hand, I cannot say which; I am sure I saw him take the shoes; there was no soul night.</p>
               <p>Is not it possible these shoes might have fell down when he broke the window? - No, no, I am sure he put his hand in, and took them out of the shop; he immediately ran off with them, and I ran after him; when he came about twenty yards from the prosecutor's door; he slipped down, and as he slipped, I collared him immediately; as he was getting on his knees, this Mr. Westber came by, and assisted in taking him; the shoes lay close by him, one pair, and this stick I took out of his hand immediately; I then took him into the prosecutor's house, the prosecutor looked in at his window, and said he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210004"/>missed more; he did not mention how many pair; the prisoner was present at the time; the prosecutor said the shoes that were brought in were his; the prosecutor went out immediately, and I saw him bring the other pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Johnson. Was any stick produced to you that day by any body? - The same evening, I really do not know who produced it; the shop was full; it has been in my custody ever since, till yesterday; this is the stick.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness: the prisoner at the bar came into the shop to cheapen some bird-eyed handkerchiefs; I never saw the prisoner before then, but I am sure he is the same; nobody was in the shop but myself when he came in; I had a dog in the shop that barked at the boy, and I imagine while I turned the dog out of the shop, he stole the piece of handkerchiefs; I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>How far did you go to turn this dog out of the shop? - Only just to a little door that opens into the entry.</p>
               <p>Was your back towards him at that time? - Yes, it was turned upon him; he was in the the shop but a very little while cheapening the handkerchiefs; I cannot say to the time; it was in the day; when I turned round, I saw some handkerchiefs bulge out of his coat; he asked me if the dog would bite, and I told him yes; as soon as he came into the shop, he wanted to look at some bird eyed handkerchiefs; I took some handkerchiefs down to shew him, and the dog barked, and he said the dog would bite him; and I turned back to put the dog out; then I saw his coat bulge out; then I missed my property; the handkerchiefs I shewed him, were not those that he took.</p>
               <p>Did you shew him the handkerchiefs before you turned to the door or after? - After I turned from the door, upon seeing something bulge in his pocket, I looked and missed the property directly, which was nine silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Where had you last seen them? - I saw them hang in the window when he came into the shop; there is a beam on purpose to hang them on.</p>
               <p>Was he near it? - Yes; he walked to the door as soon as he saw I perceived him; our maid, whose name is

               <p>Did you see the prisoner stopped? - No, he was brought back by the gardner, who took him a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>The property that you saw upon him, in the way that he had it, could you distinguish whose property it was? - I missed my handkerchiefs directly, and there was nobody but him and me in the shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210005"/>Could you see enough of them to know them? - I saw him button his coat, and I saw the ravelins hang out.</p>

               <p>Supposing you had not missed any handkerchiefs at all, could you from what you saw under the boy's coat, have judged that to be your property? - To be sure not, but when I missed my handkerchiefs, I knew nobody but him and me were in the shop.</p>
               <p>When the boy was brought in, were the handkerchiefs brought in at the same time? - Yes, the man that took him, had the handkerchiefs in his hand; his name is Cross; the handkerchiefs I saw, and examined; they are my husband's property; they were Barcelona handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>How many were there in this piece? - There were nine, I counted them over myself; they were new.</p>

               <p>I heard the cry of stop thief, and I stopped the prisoner the corner of Long-lane, in Aldersgate-street, that may be a quarter of a mile from Mr. Davis's house; this young woman was in pursuit of the prisoner; I took these handkerchiefs from under his right arm under his coat; I brought them in my mouth to the door, and the maid took them and gave them to her mistress; the prisoner was very troublesome; I was obliged to have assistance to bring him along; the prisoner attempted to make his escape, and offered me a guinea to let him go.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did he shew you the guinea? - I had it in my hand in the house; we searched him to see if he had any thing else; I shewed the guinea to the constable, and we gave it him again.</p>
               <p>Couchman. The prisoner offered a guinea to the last witness, and he offered me a guinea to let him go when I was going to Wood-street compter with him; I saw the guinea in the hand of the other witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked for sixpence, and that guinea was clapped into my hand.</p>
               <p>Do you wish to say any thing about the handkerchiefs? - I have people to my character.</p>

               <p>Did you see them join? - After what passed, I looked just to, and I saw the three men together near Mr. Brown's the cabinet maker's; they walked a little below Mr. Holland's the oil shop; they then got before me, and the three men passed me, and went and jostled against Mr. Hughes, and tripped up his heels.</p>
               <p>You were not walking arm in arm then? - No, my Lord; I had my little child in my arms; Mr. Hughes was tripped up; he fell against the bars of a cellar window; then I saw the prisoner on Mr. Hughes; Mr. Hughes cried out he had lost his watch; and laid hold of the prisoner; Mr. Hughes had his cane in his hand; the prisoner had one end of the cane, and Mr. Hughes had it also, so that I cannot say Mr. Hughes had the cane totally in his hand; he attempted to take the cane from Mr. Hughes, when he collared him, he carried him into the house of Mr. Holland.</p>

               <p>Was he sober enough to know what he was about? - He certainly was, my Lord; he immediately cried out he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Was the boy searched that night? - Yes, nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the shop where the prisoner was carried into? - Mr. Holland was there, and two more gentlemen came in; but none of the people from the street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long do you say this person had been in your service? - About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>There were a great number of articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose you could not have a recollection whether they were all in the house that day? - Yes, I am positive they were.</p>
               <p>Had you looked at them all that very day? - Yes, I had occsiaon to look for something that day; I do not think I had lost some of these things before.</p>

               <p>On Thursday evening, between six and seven, I went out with Miss Plomer, from her house in Howland-street; she was kind enough to say she would set me down at Covent Garden theatre, as she was going to spend her evening in the city; the maid lighted us to the door, held the door in her hand, and shut the door with a candle in her hand; that was a little before seven; I parted with Miss Plomer at Covent Garden, and I returned to her house again just as the watchman had gone his round for ten o'clock; I knocked at the door and nobody answered; I then pushed at the door, and found that the bolt was just hung on the thing that receives it; just pressed upon it; I pushed the door from me, and it opened; I then walked into the parlour, and found a part of a mould candle laying on the table, lighted, burning in its own grease on the table; I was so very much confused that I did not immediately extinguish the light, but looked round the room, and on the side board in the recess, I found this article. (A sort of chissel or crow.) I also found they had been attempting to break open the door of the cupboard, but had not been able to force it open; I then went out and called the watchman; I found nobody in the house; the watchman went into the kitchen; and I looked for this silver tea pot and stand, and the milk pail, which we had just used at tea, and found they were gone, and two of the drawers in the dresser open, and this metal watch was gone, which used to stand on the chimney; I then went up stairs, and found in the first bed room, that they had stripped off the chintz curtains from the rods, and had taken the coverlid off; I then went up stairs to the room adjoining to the room where Miss Plomer sleeps, and I found it stripped of every thing; the wearing apparel almost entirely gone; after searching the house entirely round, and being convinced there was nobody in the house, I told the watchman to go out and watch if anybody came to the door, and leave me in the house till Miss Plomer returned; she came back about twelve; I went to the door on hearing a coach stop, and apprized her of her loss; she was very much confused, I endeavoured to appease her with all the arguments I could; at last, when she was sufficiently so, I took an account of all the things that were missing, all that she could recollect that evening; in the morning early, I accompanied her to Sir Sampson Wright's office, who advised us to make enquiry at the place where she last lived, which was Mrs. Vincent's, in Hanover-street, Hanover-square; I went there, and in consequence of the information I received, we went to Mrs. Hicks, in David-street, Berkley-square.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Had you her character from Mrs. Vincent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowden. Mrs. Hicks gave us a direction to the prisoner at the bar's sister; a Mrs. Boss, in Joys-court, Oxford-street; we went there, and I took the coachman with me into the court, and I found the aunt of the prisoner, whose name was Connolly, and she went with me to Mrs. Boss's lodging in New James-street; she was not at home, but I saw her daughter; we interrogated them, both the old woman, and Mrs. Boss's daughter, and took both to Sir Sampson's; the girl was examined, and by what appeared on her examination, we were directed to

            , who is the man prisoner; in consequence of that, Jealous and Carpmeal went from Sir Sampson's, I did not go with them; the result of that was, that they took them, and brought them to the office; I suppose they might be gone two hours, or two hours and a half; they took them and brought them to the office; they brought a great deal of property back with them; I was present when the prisoners were examined; they appeared very sulky and churlish, and would not speak at all; as for the man, he was drunk. Last Monday evening was a week, to the best of my knowledge, I returned with Miss Plomer, who had been out, and she went down into the kitchen, and came up very much confused, and said there was a blackguard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210011"/>looking man in the kitchen, and desired me to go down to see him, which I did, and it was the prisoner Daley.</p>
               <p>Was there any other servant but Connolly? - No other servant regularly kept, but a woman occasionally to assist her; this hammer was found the next day in the back kitchen, which was not the property of Miss Plomer, nor the iron crow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man in the kitchen you had never seen before? - No, never to my knowledge; I went to the cistern, and washed my hands, and when I returned, I looked at him again; I am sure of his person.</p>

               <p>What did you find? - I found a quantity of plate, these watches, and almost all the articles in the indictment; Carpmeal went to a door just by, and apprehended the prisoner in another house, that was in about ten minutes after I found the things; I desired Mr. Carpmeal to bring the prisoner up stairs, and I asked him if the clothes that were laying about the room were his property; he said, yes, and it was his own room; and in the same room I found a check apron, with a cloak, which the woman prisoner acknowledged afterwards to be her property; there was one gown, which she said belonged to her; and in the same bundle, a gown, which that lady has positively sworn to be her property; that bundle was between the sacking of the bed, and the feather bed; it contained most part of the things, which were the plate, the watches, and the candlesticks, and the lady's gown; and most part of the bed furniture, were in the lady's gown wrapped up in the bottom of the box; I found these gold watches lay along with this plate, and the jewels; there were a quantity of wet things; I found between the sacking and the bed, which I gave to Mrs. Plomer, thinking there was property enough here without them; they were some aprons and ruffles, and a toilet, and a piece of broad cloth lay between the bed and sacking, which is here; Carpmeal took up the prisoner Connolly; I heard her acknowledge before the Justice, that that bundle was her's, and she begged to have the gown and the cloak back; that was on Friday, the 6th of February, the same day she was apprehended; Sir Sampson would not give it her back, as the lady's gown was found with her's.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner Daley about three or four doors from the house; it was in a kind of gallery down the stable yard; I traced him from a public house, to the washer-women's, with a pot of beer; when I was making enquiry, he tried to make his escape; I took him into the cook's-shop where he lodged; I did not tell him what he was wanted for, I told him when I took him down what it was for; and I tied his hands and searched him; he endeavoured to put his hand to his pocket, and in his coat pocket I found a clean handkerchief folded up; in his breeches pocket I found a pair of gold wires for the ears; round his neck, a muslin handkerchief; in his pocket, two keys, the key of a door, and the key of a box; the key of the door opened his room door; the key of the box opened the box that contained the plate; I then took him up stairs, into the room where the things were; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210012"/>was asked then, whether the things that were found there belonged to him, particularly this coat, which is a sort of working jacket; he said they were his; I then found two keys in the pocket, one is the of the prosecutrix's house, the other the key of the house where he lodges; I tried the key to Mrs. Plomer's door, in the presence of Mr. Bowden; then I left him, and returned to this place where I found him, and there I found the woman, and I took her in the same place I took him; I searched her, and in her pocket I found this cloak; I asked her whose cloak it was, and she said it was her own, and wanted to put it on; seeing it all over powder, I thought it was not her's, and I kept it; in her pocket also was this stomacher; when I brought her down to the office, I took her backwards to search her more; on her back I found this shift, which the lady says is her's.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the prosecutrix the handkerchief found in the coat pocket of the of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is mine, I hemmed it myself; there is no mark on it, nor a letter; there were five more; they are my property.</p>
               <p>(The gold ear wires that were found in his fob shewn to the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>They are very like a pair that I had in a toilet drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Those are a very common sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the prosecutrix the muslin handkerchief that was found on the prisoner's neck, and the stomacher, which was found in Connolly's pocket? - This is mine, it is a stomacher belonging to a dress; I know this handkerchief particularly, by a corner being torn out, and darned the first time I had it on.</p>

               <p>Court. Shew Miss Plomer the key that opened her house? - I believe this to be the key of my door, but there is no particular mark to it; I have lost the key of my door.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloak that you found in Connolly's pocket shew to Miss Plomer - This is mine, I know it particularly, I made it myself, and the lace was torn in a particular part; I have no doubt of its being mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the shift that was found on the prisoner Connolly to Miss Plomer? - This is mine, but the P is taken out, here is C No. 10.</p>
               <p>Where was that plate found? - In a box that was nailed up.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. I tried the key found in his pocket, and it opened the box where the plate was found.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at two or three of the most material articles that were found in the box.</p>
               <p>Miss Plomer. I am positive this is my watch, for I wore it some time without the outside case, and thereby damaged the enamel; it was in one of my drawers; I know this tea-pot and stand; I am sure they are mine.</p>

               <p>I live in the same house with the prisoner Daley; about half past ten, on Thursday night, he came in with a large bundle; nobody was with him; I thought it was my husband at the door; I went to the door to open it, and it was the prisoner with the bundle; he carried it up stairs, and when he came down again, I asked him if he was going to be married, and if it was his household furniture that he brought in, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. You saw the maid shut the door, after you when you went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210013"/>Are there any more doors than one? - Only one street door; I cannot say I had been down within an hour or two of the time I went out; I am sure none of the doors or windows were open when I sat in the coach; I saw all the front windows were shut.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bowden. When you went down stairs, did you observe whether the back doors were open or shut? - I cannot exactly say, I was most exceedingly confused; there is a very small yard behind the house, with a tolerable high wall, and no door out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Miss Plomer. I did not observe the back door, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Was any door of the house broke open? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You take all the receipts in your own name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the house originally let to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who pays the land-tax? - Myself.</p>
               <p>Has no gentleman paid it for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Has there been no agreement, that in case you do not pay them, another person should? - Never.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been married? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Daley. I knows nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is an indictment for burglary; it is clear that no force had been made use of on the door of the house; the door is in that state in which it might be left by neglect of a servant.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no proof of any forcible breaking certainly; but I am of opinion, that if the Jury should believe this theft to have been committed by both the prisoners, the servant and Daley, that the servant's opening the door to that man to let him in, for the purpose of robbing the house, is burglary in them both: the fact I shall leave to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It depends on the idea that this man was not in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. It does so.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. About what value were the things lost? - About fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Connolly called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Daley. She gave the things to me, and said they were some things of consequence, and I took the bundle to my room, and I locked the door, which had not been locked for three months before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Daley called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Connolly. My Lord, my mistress desired me to move those things, as she was going to leave her lodgings, and I have a witness of that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. You might as well suppose I was going to set the house on fire.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know whether all was fast that night? - Yes, it was fast; in the morning only one shutter was wrenched away from the other; all was safe the night before; I know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>When were you first alarmed in the morning? - Between four and five in the morning I heard a noise; I got up; and I saw the shutter half way down, and the glass broke, and the wire that the watches hung on broke also, and a brass wire upon which watches hung was broke off.</p>
               <p>Was any watches or trinkets gone? - I could not tell then, for before I came down, they got the prisoner to the watch-house; I did not look then; the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things found? - Yes, a watch.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>How long has he lived with you? - Upwards of two years.</p>
               <p>What part of your house did he sleep in? - In the back parlour; exactly joining to the shop.</p>
               <p>At what distance from the front windows? - At about the distance between me and my Lord.</p>
               <p>In what manner were your shutters fastened? - There is only one iron bar with a pin, and key'd on the inside.</p>
               <p>When you got up, did you observe the manner in which the shutters had been opened? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe from the inside in what manner your shutters had been opened? - The one had been shoved past the other; the iron bar, the pin, and the key were in their usual state.</p>
               <p>Had it occurred to you ever to observe your shutters before that, that one could be shoved past the other? - I never did observe that.</p>
               <p>How was the glass disposed of? - It was broke inwards, and the wire was broke that the watches were on.</p>
               <p>Did you inspect it so accurately as to know whether the wire was bent inwards or not? - I cannot say that I did; I had no other idea but it was broke from without.</p>
               <p>But you are not able to state to my Lord and the Jury whether the wire was bent inwards, or whether it had received it's bruises from outwards? - It might snap from force internal or external.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find your outer door? - The outer door had been opened; the door was then shut.</p>
               <p>Was Lucas dressed at that time? - No; he was so anxious that he had not dressed himself.</p>
               <p>Had he gone out without any clothes on him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Without shoes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In short without any thing but his shirt? - Not even his shirt, as I am told; I was not there.</p>
               <p>How far did Lucas go without any thing upon him? - He went a good way up Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>Into Hedge-lane? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>In what manner were your shutters fastened, was there a hook at one end of the bar and a pin at the other, or was every particular shutter pinned? - No, Sir, there are no screws to the shutters, and no pin except one at the end to fasten the bar.</p>
               <p>Have you got the iron here that was found on the outside? - My man has.</p>
               <p>Were the things that you lost left in the window the preceding night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they usually left? - They had been for some time; we very often neglect them and sometimes take them in; the best course is to take them in, and put them in a place of safety; I was at home that evening myself; I believe Lucas was at home that whole evening.</p>
               <p>Had any thing remarkable happened that evening? - Nothing that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it a part of Lucas's business to remove these things? - No, it was not; I always removed them myself; I have not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210016"/>discovered any thing but the things mentioned in the indictment; I do not know what I have lost; there might be some trifling things that have not been discovered, but they must be trifling things; as for the things mentioned in the indictment, them I am sure I lost, and lost them in the course of that day; I cannot say to the evening.</p>
               <p>What sort of articles may you have lost at the same time? - I suppose some tle trinket or the other.</p>
               <p>Will you enumerate the several articles that are in the indictment? - The principal thing is the toothpick case.</p>
               <p>I do not like that answer, the principal thing; what things did you lose? - Two toothpick cases; there are watches which are forth coming; two metal watches, one French gold one, and a silver one, which are all mine.</p>
               <p>Of these articles which of them have you seen since? - All of them.</p>
               <p>Did you lose no other articles that you knew of, except these that are mentioned in the indictment? - I told you before that I did not know of any, except some trifles, there was a gold patent watch hook, it was found at that time, but we took no notice of it at that time.</p>
               <p>How near to the door was the pane of glass that was broke? - It was the second to the door.</p>
               <p>Were there articles hung up at every pane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not equally valuable? - No.</p>
               <p>This was a pretty good pane? - It was.</p>
               <p>I will venture to ask you, before you saw the prisoner at the watch-house had you ever seen him in your life? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had he, as far as you know, any communication with your family? - None in the world; the maid had a light, and stood at the door while Lucas was gone.</p>
               <p>Had the maid been called before he went away? - She got up naked.</p>
               <p>So the naked maid stood at the door with a candle, while the naked man was gone after the thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she as compleatly in puris naturalibus as the man was? - Not quite.</p>
               <p>Where did she sleep? - Near the shop; not directly under the man's room; there was no candle that I knew of burnt either by the man or the maid; I came in consequence of an alarm from the maid.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the candle that the maid had? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it a candle stuck into a tinder box or in one of your family candlesticks? - I cannot say I took notice of that.</p>
               <p>Recollect now - I cannot; but I know that in the parlour we had a candle in a brass candlestick.</p>
               <p>Are you correct in the day on which this happened, you have stated it was on the 7th between four and five in the morning? - Yes, I am pretty sure of that, it was on Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the watch-house immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things produced to you immediately when you first went? - Yes, the two toothpick cases.</p>
               <p>I believe the watches were brought afterwards to your house however, and the watchman left them? - I cannot recollect them; I did not see him searched; the two toothpick cases were shewn to me; one of the metal watches was found in the area of Mr. Thompson's house, in Cockspur-street; my man brought the silver one in.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the examining whether there was any blood about your shop window? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner's hands examined? - Yes, there was a little blood and a scratch, but nothing material; he appeared to have cleaned that with a handkerchief; there was a handkerchief produced that was bloody.</p>
               <p>You understood that the man had been knocked down and beat about a good deal? - No, I did not; I understood that he had made a blow at my man, and that they both fell down together.</p>

               <p>Had you any alarm that night at all? - Yes, between four and five I was alarmed by the shop window being broke.</p>
               <p>Did you get up immediately? - I saw the man's head against the shop window.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - He was in the street; I saw him taking the things out of the window; he was standing opposite the second pane of glass on the right hand side going out.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In brown coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity to observe him? - Not at that period of time to take particular notice of his person.</p>
               <p>You was then at the glass door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What light did you see him by? - I do not know whether there was the moon, or whether it was the lightness of the morning or the lamps.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you any lamp on the spot? - There is a lamp at the street door, not exactly at the spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any light in the inside of the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the door or the window of the shop open? - One of the shop shutters was slided down; shifted off the hinge where it twists.</p>
               <p>How far was it moved? - About half the width of it over the other shutter that was up.</p>
               <p>How high is the shop window from the ground? - It might be about two feet or two feet and a half from the ground.</p>
               <p>What may be the heighth of the window? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>As near as you can judge? - I cannot pretend to say; there were only three large panes in the heighth of the shop window.</p>
               <p>What the whole from top to bottom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - Going on three years.</p>
               <p>Is not the shutters higher than you are? - Yes, the shutter was the end to the ground, and shoved a little over the other.</p>
               <p>How much of the window was open by that means? - I suppose about three parts of the pane of glass, or a little more.</p>
               <p>How wide was the pane of glass? - It might be twelve or fourteen inches wide.</p>
               <p>When you looked at it was the glass door between the parlour and the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you see through that, a man standing in the street, so as to discern how he was dressed? - Yes, so as to discern the colour of his clothes, but not his person; as soon as I saw the man I went to the parlour door that leads to the passage, and then to the house door; I unlocked the house door and took down the chain that goes across it; then I went out and I saw the prisoner taking this metal watch out of the window; I opened the door as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>How is the street door fastened? - With a lock and chain; there is a bolt to it; but I do not think it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Was it double or single locked? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was the chain up or down? - It was up; I unlocked the door, and took the chain down as fast as I could.</p>

               <p>How far is the door from the shop window? - I suppose four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Then this man was not alarmed with the noise of your opening the door at all? - No; I suppose he could not hear me unlock the door, or take the chain off, because the dog was in the shop at the same time barking at him, which I suppose turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210018"/>the noise; he let the watch fall directly, and ran off.</p>
               <p>How came he to let it fall directly? - Upon my word I do not know; it was as soon as he saw me; I immediately pursued him; he ran up Suffolk-street; I laid hold of him, and turned him three or four times backwards and forwards; what I mean by turning him, is, he ran backwards and forwards, up and down the street; he was down there in Suffolk-street; whether I struck or pushed him down I am not sure; and in the scuffle we were both down together; I found he got the advantage of me; he got up again; I immediately pursued him again; he ran down the street, and crossed Cockspur-street opposite Jefferies and Jones's; I saw him in Suffolk-street, while I was running after him, throw away these articles, an ivory toothpick case, a silver watch, and a red Morrocco bracelet, as he was crossing over; I ran after him, and by Thompson's the haberdasher's I caught him again; he struck at me; I saw a blow coming, and I put my head on one side, and prevented him striking me; then I struck him down and collared him, and kept him till the watchman came up to me; I gave charge of him to the watchman; so I went home to put on some of my clothes; I had no clothes on at this time not of any kind; the watchman that was at the corner of Jefferies and Jones's brought him, and searched his breeches pocket, and found this gold patent hook in his pocket; I saw it found.</p>
               <p>When did your master come down? - He was not down stairs till he was gone to the watch-house; the articles that are here, the ivory toothpick case, the silver watch, I picked up; I know them to be my master's property; and when I got my clothes on, I picked up some bracelets and some small trinkets that were thrown opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You slept in the back parlour if I understand you right? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is close adjoining to the shop? - Yes, there is a glass door and a glass partition.</p>
               <p>Was the door open when you went to bed, or did you shut it? - It was fast.</p>
               <p>You did not burn a light? - No.</p>
               <p>You went to bed about eleven? - Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Was you the last person up in the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any maid servant in the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does she sleep usually? - In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How long might it be from the first alarm that you had of the shutter, to the time you got compleatly out of the house? - It might be two or three minutes; I never heard the dog bark till the pane of glass was breaking, that was before I got out of bed; he continued barking till I went out.</p>
               <p>Did he go out with you? - No.</p>
               <p>You stood looking on at the man taking the articles out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could distinctly observe that his clothes were brown? - Yes, Sir, I could distinctly.</p>
               <p>Could you observe what colour his waistcoat was? - No, as well as I recollect his close bodied coat was buttoned, and his great coat was the same colour.</p>
               <p>Was the great coat buttoned? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether he had a glove on when he was pulling out the articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What coloured glove? - White leather.</p>
               <p>What they call Woodstock? - I fancy it is what you call wash-leather.</p>
               <p>Had you any fire arms? - No.</p>
               <p>Any watchman's rattle? - No.</p>
               <p>Any bell in the shop? - No, there is a bell in the shop, but I did not go into the shop; there is a bell that goes out of the shop into the kitchen, and another that goes out of the parlour into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>So you observed the man through the glass partition; then through the glass inside of the shop, and so then through the window, and so then you saw his brown great coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ring either of the bells? - No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210019"/>the stairs of the kitchen go out of the passage; there is no door at the head of the kitchen stairs.</p>
               <p>Is it a large chain that goes all across the street door? - It goes only half-way.</p>
               <p>Is it a large rattling noisey chain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The noise of that, the man could not hear, by the dog's barking? - No; he slipped down the shutter, and then sideways one over the other.</p>
               <p>How long might you be gone from the shop before you came back again? - It might be five minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Did you pull the street door after you? - No, I did not, I found it open when I came back; the maid was at the street door, she had got on some of her things, but not dressed herself; her petticoat and cloak, or some such matter.</p>
               <p>I dare say if she had been without as much covering as that, it would have struck you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was standing with a candle? - I do not believe she had any light at all.</p>
               <p>Then when you came home, she asked you if it was an alarm of fire, and where the fire was? - No, she asked me what was the matter, and I told her there was a rascal had broke into the house.</p>
               <p>Do you ever throw your clothes on your bed of a night? - Sometimes I do.</p>
               <p>You put nothing on that night? - No.</p>
               <p>If I understand you, you went out as naked as the nurse first received you from your mother? - I was naked.</p>
               <p>Had not you a shirt on? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How happened you to be without a shirt? - Sometimes I lay without a shirt, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Had you your hat on? - No.</p>
               <p>No night cap? - No, nothing at all on.</p>
               <p>How far did you pursue this man? - Up Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>On which side of the pane of glass was it that your street door is? is it further from Charing-cross, or nearer to it? - It is from Charing-cross; I live in Cockspur-street.</p>
               <p>Did the man run past your street door from the pane of glass, or from it? - He ran from it.</p>
               <p>When you came out, you saw him drop the metal watch? - Yes, I was about a couple of yards from him; I pursued him; I past by no watchman; I ran the first time about fifty yards; I called out for assistance, and nobody came.</p>
               <p>How near is the watchman's stand from your house? - The corner of Jefferys and Jones's; I found this silver watch in its present state, in an area in Suffolk-street; and this box was found with the glass broke, which was found when it was taken, it was found in the area, and a red morocco bracelet with it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an extraordinary watchman; yesterday morning, about half past four o'clock, was a fortnight, I saw the prisoner running away from the prosecutor's shop window.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I was about thirty yards from the shop, and I saw Mr. Lucas naked, pursuing him, crying stop thief, and I went to his assistance immediately; the prisoner fell down, and Mr. Lucas fell upon him; he could not stop himself all in a hurry; we picked him up, and I held him while my comrade watchman searched him; he was stopped in Cockspur-street; he ran up Suffolk-street; he fell and we picked him up, and he run back again down Suffolk-street, and across Cockspur-street.</p>
               <p>How came you not to give your assistance at first? - I gave immediate assistance as soon as ever I heard stop thief, I run after him with Mr. Lucas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas has swore that he pursued him up Suffolk-street, and he turned him two or three times, and had a struggle on the ground, and all that time nobody came to his assistance? - Mr. Lucas cannot say so to me; the very moment I heard the cry of stop thief, I went to his assistance, and he cannot say to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210020"/>Did you search this man? - Yes, there was an ivory box, mounted with gold I believe, and a silver pick-case I think it is; my comrade watchman has got it; I held him while he searched his pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. extraordinary Short, how near was you to Mr. Grant's window at the time it was broke? - I dare say I was thirty or forty yards, and I heard the glass fall, and I saw the gentleman crying stop thief on the instant.</p>
               <p>How long before you heard the glass fall, was it that you had passed Mr. Grant's window? - It was not in my beat to pass the window.</p>
               <p>Had you a rattle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you spring it? - I had no rattle about me, but my comrade watchman had.</p>
               <p>Do you ever go out without one? - Seldom, but that night I did, I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Do you swear it? what upon your oath, was you that night without a rattle? - I was.</p>
               <p>Who is your superintendant now? - The gentlemen subscribers belonging to Cockspur-street; I will swear I was without my rattle that night.</p>
               <p>You say you had some difficulty to stand and keep yourself up? was you so sober as you are now? - I was neither more nor less, and I am sure I am not drunk now; I am as sober now as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>This was good fun for you to stand by and see all this? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Had you any stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make outcry, or knock at any doors, or ring any bell? - What occasion was there?</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; my stand is at Jefferies and Jones's, goldsmith and jewellers to his majesty; at half past four I called the hour; I came back to Mr. Jefferies and Jones's front door of the shop, in Cockspur-street: I heard some glasses fall, I did not know whereabouts it was, but I saw a naked man run after another man; I ran to his assistance; he ran up Suffolk-street, as near as I can guess about fifty yards; he slipped down there; he got up, and ran down Suffolk-street again, and at Mr. Thompson's, he slipped down, or was down by some means; the man that was naked laid hold of him, and delivered him to my charge; I immediately searched his pockets, and will produce what I found; there are the two articles I found in his pockets; I met the other watchman, and said there is some glass fell somewhere; then we went together to this naked man's assistance up into Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>You considered a good while about it, I find, both of you? - We went immediately as soon as ever we heard the word cried stop-thief.</p>
               <p>How came it neither of you were up with him? - The naked man could run faster than I could with my clothes, and my staff, and my rattle, and my great coat on; I found both these in the prisoner's right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In his great coat pocket? - He had no great coat on.</p>
               <p>What coloured bodied coat had he on? - He had a kind of an ash coloured coat, a little darker than such a dirty one as this of mine.</p>
               <p>Was it like this gentleman's? (N. B. That was a lightish brown.) - Not quite so dark.</p>
               <p>Was his coat buttoned? - Not buttoned at all.</p>
               <p>A light coloured waistcoat? - His waistcoat was the same as the coat.</p>
               <p>When you searched his coat pocket, that was after he and the naked man had been down together? - Yes.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>You ran as hard as you could? - I had no opportunity for running; I was more anxious after the business.</p>
               <p>Did your partner spring his rattle? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not? - I cannot tell why.</p>
               <p>Did he lend his rattle that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you each of you had your rattles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you spring them? - We were more anxious after running; he had his rattle, but he does not not make use of a rattle; I am sure he had his rattle; I imagine it was in a sling by his left side, I believe it is in general; his lanthorn he does not carry, but I am sure of his rattle.</p>
               <p>Do you remember who he gave his rattle to when he came to the watch-house? - He does not belong to the watch-house, he did not go there; he always takes his rattle with him.</p>

               <p>Had you told him to bring the purse? - No, I do not think I did; I do not remember I did; but it was very usual whenever he saw my purse laying any where to bring it to me; I desired him to turn the money out of the purse on the table, and count the money; Captain

               <p>Now, it will be necessary for you to say what money this purse contained when you left it upon the table? - Yes, my Lord, there were ten guineas, two half guineas, six shillings, and half a crown; I made a memorandum of the money turned out of the purse; I desired the Captain to take notice of the same; I wished not to have an officer in the house; I thought it was very probable the man would struggle; I thought the best way was to take him to the Magistrate's; the carriage was at the door; it was his turn to go behind it; and we went to Covent Garden piazza; and I got out opposite the Bedford Head coffee-house, and I desired the servants to wait there, and I went with Captain

             to Bow-street; I told Sir Sampson what I have now been relating to the Court, and Sir Sampson sent one of his men for the prisoner, who was waiting with the carriage; the prisoner came to Sir Sampson's, and my information was read to him: Sir Sampson desired him to empty his pockets before him; he emptied the pocket on his left side, and there was I think half a guinea,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210025"/>and a small piece of silver in that pocket; Sir Sampson Wright then asked him where the guinea was that he had taken from me; the prisoner then put his hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, and he took out a guinea which he put on the table before Sir Sampson Wright; Sir Sampson asked him if that was the guinea he had taken from me.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, I ought to ask you, Sir, whether any thing that the prisoner said was reduced into writing by the Magistrate? - The Magistrate reduced what I had said into writing.</p>
               <p>But was what the prisoner said reduced into writing before the Magistrate? - There was a clerk employed writing, and I should imagine it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The examination is here.</p>
               <p>Court. Then we must not receive parol evidence of it; were there any promises made to the prisoner of favour in case he would confess? - I have not the least recollection of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Or were there any threats made use of? - No, I am sure there were not.</p>
               <p>You are positive as to the number of guineas that were in the purse? - I wrote down their number; I am sure of the number; I presume the paper I wrote it on, is not necessary to produce.</p>
               <p>Alderman Watson. Did you entrust this man with your purse, Sir? - Yes, frequently; I had an entire confidence in him; perhaps I am saying more than is necessary; and I wish in that case to be directed; I purchased him in America, and made him a confidential servant; and I cannot say till lately I ever suspected him.</p>

               <p>I was applied to by the last witness to come to his house and count some money.</p>
               <p>Did you see him produce his purse? - The purse was laying on the desk in the study; I opened it myself and counted the money, and found it contained ten guineas two half guineas, six shillings, and two half crowns; I then replaced the money in the purse and shut it; the Colonel and I went out of the room, and he shut the door, and left the purse on the desk.</p>
               <p>Was the door locked afterwards? - Yes, the Colonel locked it; we went into the drawing room, and the Colonel rung for his servant, that is, for the prisoner; the prisoner came, and he desired him to go up into his study, and bring a letter, but I do not believe he mentioned his purse, but he desired him to bring a letter, and some visiting cards; the Colonel gave him the keys of the room, he brought down the letter, and the Colonel's purse; the Colonel told him to empty the money out of the purse which he did, and the prisoner counted nine guineas, two half guineas, six shillings, and half a crown; there was one guinea deficient.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about that deficiency at the time? - No, there was sufficient proof at that time that he had taken the money; I went with the Colonel to Bow-street, where he gave evidence, and the man was apprehended; I then related before Sir Sampson what I have told you, and the prisoner was taken into custody; he produced half a guinea and a sixpence; an examination took place, which was reduced into writing.</p>
               <p>How was this purse secured, with strings? - It is a purse that slides; I think a kind of rings; I think it is a green purse. (The purse produced.) That is the purse.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness; the first time I ever saw the prisoner was the 5th of November; it was near candle light; my husband and me were sitting by the fire side; it was a Sunday evening; there was another man came with him whom I do not know; he knocked at the door and came in, and said, is your name Moore; my husband said, yes, and they went out together; he came several times, and on the 9th of December, at night, I think I went to bed about nine; the prisoner came into the room and struck me with his hand; I was in bed; my daughter was in the room, and he hit her, and knocked her down; I sat up in bed, and he asked me for the keys of the drawers, and said, if I offered to make a noise, he would knock my brains out; and I laid in my bed, having nobody in the house but children; he directly went to the drawers, and there stood this tea chest, and some other articles; the drawers stood facing the bed, and he opened the tea chest, and there lay the spoons and tongs in the place; he took half a dozen tea spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs, marked W E M; there was a great noise of dogs; he blew the candle out and went down; I fainted several times with the fright, and knocking me down together.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you faint? - I cannot tell, I kept fainting several times; I never saw the spoons since; I knew the prisoner before by seeing him come to and fro after the 5th of November; I asked my husband who the prisoner was, and he told me he was his attorney; I remember my husband's coming in, and I told him here has been this Jordan, and used me in this manner, and has taken my things.</p>
               <p>How were you when he came home? - In a very poor situation.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - About one I think.</p>
               <p>Your daughter was up, was not she? - She was up, but we have no clock or watch in the house, but I cannot say what time of night it was; my daughter set up for my husband.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me whether there ever had been any quarrel between the prisoner and your husband? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is not possible for me to ask her any questions, because every word that she has told you, is as false as God is in heaven.</p>
               <p>ELIZ. MOORE, junior, sworn.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Turned of sixteen.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect having seen the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I have seen him at different times at my father's house.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at any time in December? - I cannot particularly tell what time it was that I saw him, for I had been to service; I am not always at home with my father.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at any time in December last? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing happening? - The 9th of December it was I saw him; my father was gone out, and my mother was gone to bed with the young child, and I sat up mending some stockings, waiting for my father's coming home; I had been to sleep, and there were two bolts against the yard door, and I had unbolted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210028"/>the door, and set a large heavy chair against the door for my father to come in at when he came home; I had been to sleep up stairs; I heard a noise in the room, and I looked up and saw the prisoner in the room; then I asked him what he wanted, and he gave me a knock on my side like, and knocked me right under the post of the bed; then my mother jumped up in the bed; he had a large hammer in his hand, and she asked him what he wanted, and he said he wanted the keys of the drawers; my mother said she had not the keys, my father had them, and he hit my mother with his hand as I believe, and knocked her right down in the bed; then he went to the drawers, and opened the tea-chest; and he said if she made a noise, he would knock her down with that hammer, if either a one of us spoke, or made any noise; then he went to the drawers, and took out six silver tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs.</p>
               <p>Where did they stand? - They were in a tea-chest, and the tea-chest stood upon the drawers; the tea-chest was not locked.</p>
               <p>Did your mother see this? - No, my mother did not see him take them, but I saw them; I cannot say that she did not see him take them, she might, she was in the room.</p>
               <p>Had the blow that he struck your mother any effect upon her? - Yes, it made her very ill some time afterwards, and she was very much frightened then; she could not get up, she fainted away; I cannot possibly tell the time that she fainted, it seemed very long to me; she might faint for five minutes or more; when he took the spoons, he blew the candle out, and went away immediately.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the room? - I cannot tell you how long, it seemed very long to me.</p>
               <p>Did your mother continue fainting after he went away? - Yes, she did faint after he went away.</p>
               <p>How long? - Not very long.</p>
               <p>Did she faint at different times during an hour? - I cannot say for an hour, I do not think she was a fainting when my father came home, but we were all so frightened.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this man before? - I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>What is this man? - I cannot tell you what he is.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear of any quarrel that your father and the prisoner had had? - I cannot say I know any thing about it, I happened then to be up stairs when my father came home; he looked about to see if there were any body in the house; there was a fire, not a very good fire, when my father came home; he might come home an hour after this happened.</p>
               <p>When your father came home, did he eat any supper? - He might, I did not lay the cloth.</p>
               <p>What had you for supper? - There was some cold meat, and some potatoes and greens.</p>
               <p>Now you have told me a strange story, and I desire you to explain it a little? - I was to have broiled it or fryed it, as he chose it; there were some beef and mutton in the house; I was to have done any thing he liked to have done.</p>
               <p>How many beds were there in this house? - Five.</p>
               <p>You have never seen the prisoner? - Never till now; I never saw any of the things since; I have been to service since; I have nothing else to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no questions to ask her.</p>

               <p>My Lord, my first acquaintance with the prosecutor was, I was introduced to do some jobs in the carpentering line; I am a carpenter by trade; he is a plaisterer, and he had spoke to me, and told me there were several people that owed him money, and that he would do some repairs if he could get the money, and that one Mr. Harrison, a grocer, in High-street, owed him fifty pounds; I asked him what was the reason he could not get his money in? he told me it was lent to this Harrison, the grocer, in ready cash; I asked him if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210029"/>he had any note for it, or bond; he said no; I said it was not a common thing for people to lend money without security in writing; then he said he had two witnesses, one was by when he lent the money, and the other when Harrison acknowledged the debt; then I told him to arrest the man; he did so; in a few days afterwards, one of these witnesses, whose name was Broom, that he had to the affair, happened to meet me, and told me that it was no such thing, that Harrison owed him nothing; with this the prosecutor said, he once bought half a dozen ducks of him, and paid him seven shillings; a few days afterwards I met the prosecutor, and he asked me to drink part of a pot of beer; I told the prosecutor what Broom had said, and he fell into a rage, and said the bloody rogue could he say any such thing; I told him he had told me so; after a little conversation with the prosecutor, he told me, says he, if you will row in one boat with me, and become an accomplice of mine, I will put some hundreds in your way; I asked him in what manner; he told me he meant to touch Harrison for fifty pounds; and if I would become a witness against Harrison, and say that I was by at the lending the money, or at the acknowledgement of the debt, I should have ten pounds if he could obtain it; moreover he said, there were plenty of people that he was acquainted with, and that he would touch them up in the same manner; I told him I would have no concerns with any thing of the kind; in a few days after I went, and acquainted

             the grocer of every thing the prosecutor had offered me; when the prosecutor found this, he went and swore a robbery against me of robbing him of a pocket hook containing a guinea and six shillings; that was some little time before this; the pocket-book was found by three honest men in the neighbourhood, and they produced the pocket-book without any money in it, and I was discharged; he said he had a witness to say that he saw me pick his pocket, and would bring him the next day; the justice took my own word, and bid me come the next day; I came of my accord the next day; I staid from eleven till one, and the prosecutor never appeared against me then; and he has laid his plan, which he bragged of to other people, to put me aside, that I should not be an evidence against him at Westminster-hall.</p>
               <p>Who did he bragg of it to? - To one Fownes, and he was upon the trial at Westminster-hall, when he was cast last Saturday week; I told you this morning that my friends were not come; accordingly the prosecutor took out this indictment against me; I was under no apprehension, I knew myself innocent; when I went to Westminster-hall, I was subpoened by this Harrison, where that gentleman in green clothes (the constable) was ready to take me.</p>

Did you give evidence? - No, I did not, he took me before the trial came on, and if Mr. Harrison was here, he would declare the same; my witnesses were not in town, and I sent for them last night; I have witnesses to my character; I worked at the Duke of Newcastle's for nine years, where I was entrusted with thousands.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife to the last witness; I have known the prisoner these last seven years; he bore a very good character for any thing I ever heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Have you known him lately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately have you known him? - I have known him all along since I first knew him; I have known him the last two or three years, so far as knowing his sister and brother, and hearing of him frequently; I cannot tell where he lived these last two or three years; they live in Queen-street, Tower-hill; the prisoner has no family, and there I saw him; I saw them yesterday; I lodge in the old Bailey, and as soon as I saw it, I sent my little boy to let them know; I have known him to work, and have seen him at work within the last two or three years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. You and your husband live together? - Yes; I have seen him within these two or three months; my husband had not an opportunity of seeing him, being confined for debt.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long have you known the prisoner? - The first time I ever saw him, was the 5th of November; he told me that he wanted to speak to me; he took me to Sir William Warren's square, but the house was uninhabited; he told me it was his own property, and that he was an attorney, and had formerly been another business.</p>
               <p>Did you know where he lived afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you take him up? - I never could hear of him after the 9th of December; I saw him at the sheep and shears, which I believe was about eleven the night of the robbery; I got home I think between eleven and one, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you supped before you went home? - I had no supper, but I commonly carried a bit in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you sup at home? - No, I had supper enough to see my place robbed.</p>
               <p>Did you expect any supper at home? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any quarrel with the prisoner? - No, but that night, or the next morning past, he came in very rigid and drunk, to the sheep and shears.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Harrison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have your ever had any law-suit with him? - Yes, that is the very man that gave orders for the writ, and said he had orders for the attorney; this man came to me, and extorted money from me at different times, twelve guineas, under the title of attorney.</p>
               <p>Was he, or was he not subpoened? - How should I know?</p>
               <p>Was you at the trial at Westminster? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he there? - He was taken there.</p>
               <p>How did that law-suit end? - End, I sat down with my own loss; I did not recover against Harrison, but I shall renew it; this man has been the biggest enemy that ever was known in this world.</p>
               <p>When was the trial at Westminster? - I think it was last Saturday was se'night I believe, or Saturday was fortnight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, it is an unlikely story.</p>
               <p>Constable. It was the very day the cause was tried that they took the prisoner at the Ship in Old Palace-yard; that was the 3d of February.</p>

In one part of the barn a was hen roost: we got out as fast as we could, and ran to a neighbour's, Captain Webb's, the next door; as soon as we were a little settled, we returned to get as much of our property out as we could, expecting the dwelling house every moment to be burnt down, the whole of the barn, together with a hen roost, and a room adjoining, was destroyed that night; this was on the 10th; the next Sunday, which was the 17th, after having foddered our cattle as before, and fastened the hogstye door myself, we went into the house; I believe the prisoner went in before us; every thing was safe at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was this? - Between four and five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any body about your house at that time? - There was nobody but one Cromwell who was employed by me; I took the milk at the kitchen door for Admiral

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you any light at the time? - Yes, I believe we had a bit of candle; the prisoner was absent about ten minutes; when she returned, Mrs. Taylor desired her to do some trifling thing; she sat down, and had her own tea, and Mrs. Taylor sitting with her face towards the window, and I with my back to it; she cried out, Lord, what a light there is on the green platt; I turned round and said, Lord have mercy upon us, we are all in flames; I saw flashes of light, and the sparks from the thatch of the barn coming towards the house; we got out as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210032"/>we could; I was so much alarmed myself, I could hardly find my way out; I turned my eyes around, and saw my barley barn on fire; it had caught the wheat barn, and the stable, and they were all on fire. It burnt down my wheat barn, my barley barn, all my ricks of hay, my stable, six horses, my harnesses, and all my implements of husbandry; we then went to Captain Webb's with great difficulty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was in the pigstye when you went in to fasten it? - There was a fat hog which I fastened in before the fire, and that had got out into the yard during the time of the fire; the prisoner several times that day said to several of the family, she hoped we should not meet with any accident again that day; she hoped it would not happen again as it had the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure she made use of that expression that day? - She said I hope it will not be to day as it was last Sunday with us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. After this I believe you advertised a reward of twenty pounds? - My friends did; there was a person of the name of Hanking taken up in consequence of some expression; he was discharged. On the 12th of January, soon after the second fire, we found a handkerchief, which the prisoner had declared was taken from her by force by two men at the bottom of the stairs as she was moving some of my things; on its being found, she was carried before

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before she made a confession on the second examination, were any promises made to induce her to confess? - None of any sort by me, or any other person in my presence.</p>
               <p>Was she threatened? - No, all that was desired was, that she would speak the truth; it was made voluntarily; she was cautioned by the Justice not to say any thing that was false, and to be particular; her confession was read to her before she put her mark; Justice Bond said to her, now, if there is any thing here that is not strictly true, let me know, and it shall be altered; or if there is any mistake, check me as I read it; he then read it over to her, and made a stop; - Is this true, said he? she said, it is; he then proceeded with several pauses, always asking her if it was true, to which she replied, yes: when he had compleated it, he said, now, my girl, is this all true? - She said, yes, it is indeed.</p>

               <p>"purpose of setting fire to the straw, and</p>
               <p>"firing said barn; that when she left the</p>
               <p>"said barn, which was immediately, a part</p>
               <p>"of said straw was hanging over the flame</p>
               <p>"of said candle, but had not caught fire</p>
               <p>"when she left the barn; that as she was</p>
               <p>"coming away from said barn, she pulled</p>
               <p>"out the peg of the door of the hogsty</p>
               <p>"in which was a fat hog, and threw</p>

               <p>"motive for so doing; that she</p>
               <p>"then went into her master's dwelling-house</p>
               <p>"at the back door, which she bolted</p>
               <p>"and shut after her; that she then went</p>
               <p>"to the candle-box, took out a piece of</p>
               <p>"a candle, which she lighted by the</p>
               <p>"kitchen fire, and put it into the iron</p>
               <p>"candlestick which she had before placed</p>
               <p>"on the brown table; then went up into</p>
               <p>"her mistress's room where she drank tea,</p>
               <p>"after which her mistress desired her to</p>
               <p>"light Mrs. Edwards, whilst she put the</p>
               <p>"child to bed, which she did; that whilst</p>
               <p>"said child was putting to bed, her mistress</p>
               <p>"made the alarm of fire; when this examinant</p>
               <p>"discovered that the barn was</p>
               <p>"on fire. That this examinant was not</p>
               <p>"induced to set fire to said barn, from any</p>
               <p>"resentment, malice, or ill will, towards</p>
               <p>"her master or his family, or any other</p>
               <p>"person whatever, but that it arose from</p>
               <p>"a sudden thought, which she conceived</p>
               <p>"when she was making the toast as</p>
               <p>"as aforesaid; and further this examinant</p>
               <p>"says, that she was not induced to set</p>

               <p>"or solicitation of any person whatever,</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was any thing said to her to induce her to confess? - Nothing, I desired her to say nothing but what was true.</p>
               <p>(The Confession produced to Mr. Taylor, who acknowledged the signing to be his.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did she appear to be in her senses at that time? - She said she did it to ease her own mind, and to acquit innocent people.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Taylor the prosecutor; the prisoner had been our servant about three months; on Sunday the 10th, after her return from the Admiral's, she sat down behind her master; at half after four she suddenly started up and said, if I did not want her she would go up stairs and change her petticoat; she went up stairs and staid about ten minutes, and on her return, she said she saw a man with a candle and lanthorn; she and her master went to the window to see what it was; they immediately ran down stairs; my husband cried fire; I ran down and found the place was on fire and burnt down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe at that time whether she was in liquor? - She was perfectly composed; we went to Captain Webb's; the prisoner after assisting at the fire, came to Captain Webb's to us; I desired her to go out no more; she appeared to be much confused and in liquor then; that was about one or two in the morning; I heard after that she had been drinking; I desired her to go and lay down; on the Sunday following after foddering we went up stairs as usual, somewhat after four, I desired her to make a toast and get the tea ready; I desired her to light a candle; it was too dark to drink tea without; she lighted the candle, and after putting water in the pot, she went out of the room; where she went I know not; she was gone ten minutes or better; she came back again into the room; I desired her to go with Mrs. Edwards to lay the child down; when she came back I saw a great light on the green platt, in the front of the house; my husband immediately got up and said, we are all in flames again; he saw the flames coming round and we all ran out.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the hog there? - Yes, I saw it loose in the yard; we always made it a rule to fasten him in at tea time; after the fire I missed an old japan candlestick, with a handle; I have two of them, one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210035"/>with a handle and the other without; the one I missed had a handle; the prisoner used a large iron one in general. (The candlestick produced.) The one found in the fire had a handle; it is a fellow to the one without a handle; on the evening of the second fire, the prisoner told me that coming down stairs with a basket of clothes, a man met her at the bottom of the stairs and took a handkerchief off her neck; she said it was a striped handkerchief, and that she had borrowed one of the cook at Captain Webb's instead of it; she said she had lost a black cloak; it was on the Monday week after the fire that she told me so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ever see that cloak afterwards? - Yes, about a week after when she came to town with me to go before the Grand Jury, with respect to Hanking; when I heard the handkerchief was found, I asked her for the fellow to that she had lost; she gave me this handkerchief; she asked me what I wanted with it; I told her it was no matter;

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you suppose she meant by that? - At the time of the first fire, the people took the meat, pudding, and bread, and every thing of provision in the house; she several times in the day said she hoped it would not be as it was the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you ever seen any symptoms of insanity about her? - No, I never saw any thing like it; she always appeared very well satisfied, and laid with my children; if she had been any way disordered in her mind, I never should have suffered her to have slept with my children; I had no reason to suppose she had any ill will.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there liquor given at the time of the fire? - There was to the people.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; the prisoner was committed the 14th of January, in the evening, by Mr. Taylor the Magistrate; I was particularly desired not to let any body speak to her, except her father and mother; and I was to keep her in a close room confined, without fire or candle; she was taken before Mr. Taylor, on the Monday at 11 o'clock; she declared all to be false that she had said on Sunday, about Winden and Goring; she said the same on Tuesday; she was committed till Thursday; on Wednesday afternoon she wished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210036"/>to speak to her mistress, I said, I could not grant it; I was ordered not to let any body speak to her except her father and mother; she said, she wished to go earlier on the Thursday morning than she had gone on the former mornings, for she was very uneasy and would discover the whole truth; accordingly on the Thursday morning before I went out with her, she said, she should have acquainted Mr. Taylor on the Tuesday with the whole matter, provided there had not been so many people in the room; I wrote a note to Mr. Taylor acquainting him of this; and the room was kept clear; and there she made the confession as voluntary as could be; there was only Mr. Bond and Mr. Taylor in the room when she made that confession.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was her general behaviour? - She did not seem much concerned, but rather less than I expected both before and after opening her mind.</p>
               <p>Court. During her confinement did she see her father and mother? - Yes, her mother frequently, every morning; her father only once.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe how she appeared in her presence? - Her mother fretted very much; she desired her not to fret, for she did not mind it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no motive assigned in your house for her behaviour? - No, she always spoke in the most respectful terms of her master and mistress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know of any dispute of any sort between the prisoner and Goring and Winden? - I do not.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Taylor. Do you? - I do not.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Taylor. Do you? - I do not particularly know.</p>
               <p>You say you do not particularly know, be so good, Madam, as to explain how far you know it? - All that I know is, that the prisoner said, there had been some words between Winden and his wife and her, and that she had Winden's wife before 'squire Taylor two or three times for slapping her.</p>
               <p>Was there thing any said respecting malt? - That was before either of the fires, it was not long before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it that she had bad words with Winden and his wife, or with Winden's wife? - With Winden's wife on account of some slaps; she said, Winden has been my ruin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did she explain in what way? - No.</p>
               <p>You said this conversation was before the fires? - I believe she said she had been ten times before 'squire Taylor.</p>
               <p>How many days was this before the first fire? - I do not know; I believe it might be about a week.</p>
               <p>Was there any intercourse between Winden and his wife and the prisoner to your knowledge? - I do not know what intercourse there was between Winden and his wife and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner was speaking of Winden being her ruin, did you understand it to be the wife or the husband? - I understood it to be the husband; the name Winden only was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Justice Taylor. Had this girl ever been before you on any charge against Winden and his wife? - I have not a recollection of it; it does not come to my memory that she was; she might have been; but from the multiplicity of people that come to me upon business it is hardly possible that I should recollect it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I suppose if she had been before you several times it would hardly have escaped your memory? - It certainly would not.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Messrs. Blundell and Stafford; I only know that one of the witnesses came into the shop, and informed Mr. Towseland a man had robbed his cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He offered me money.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Towseland. Did you offer the prisoner any money? - I never did, upon my oath, I never made him any promise whatever; I gave him sixpence when the constable was taking him to prison; after the alderman committed him fully; he said he should be stripped of his things for garnish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He offered to let me go if I would give him the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is not true.</p>

               <p>Court. Then you watched them? - Yes, I went over the way to Half-moon-alley, and I left my things at the oil shop, and told them what I left them for, and I saw Akers with the ham on his head, and I think Farmer was at the lottery-office window; I went and gave the alarm at the shop, and the man came from the back part of the shop, and asked which way they went; I told him they ran down Artillery-lane; we pursued them, and the patrol took Farmer the corner of Union-street, the new opening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Akers. Ask the boy if I was the person that was standing at the lottery-office window? - I am positive he was the person that was at the lottery-office window, which was very well illuminated, and there were lights in the other shops.</p>

               <p>Did you at the time believe it was him? - No, my brother told me of this man when he saw him go through the taproom.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know him, only from what your brother said? - Yes, Sir, I had an idea of him, but not so much as he had; Ellt called all the company together, and separated them into four different rooms, and we went into these rooms, before we went into the room where the man was; and when we went into the room where the man was; we picked him out.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the rooms? - I cannot say; there were three or four in each; I knew him again then; I went before the Justice, and the Justice asked me if I would swear to the man, and I told him I believed he was the man; my brother was with me; the other prisoner was with him at the time when he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you remember him when you saw him at the Justice's? - Yes, this long man's name is Evans.</p>

               <p>Did you see him on the Saturday night? - No, I did not see him till the Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - At the Rotation office, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of day or night was it you was robbed? - At six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was you near any lamps? - There was snow on the ground.</p>
               <p>Was it so light that you could clearly distinguish the countenance of these two people so as to know them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. How near was the light of the lamp to you? - It may be twenty yards; the shop windows were lighted; it was on a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Court. In short, by the shop windows, or the lamps, or the snow, or whatever it was, was it so light that you could distinguish him? - Yes, Sir, it was not dark, the snow was on the ground, a little snow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Counsel for the Prisoner Walker. I think you say you live in King-street, Golden-square? - Yes, I am a journeyman bricklayer.</p>
               <p>You was going to see for work, you was pretty rich, had not you been drinking pretty freely with your companion? - I had been drinking, it cost me about eight-pence; I was at the public house about two, and set out between five and six.</p>
               <p>You had been pretty jovial, had not you? - No, Sir, I cannot say I was.</p>
               <p>How many were in company? - There were twenty in the tap-room, all the brick-layers that were working at the buildings; there were thirteen houses; I was drinking with them; they were no acquaintances of mine; I am sure I was robbed this night.</p>

               <p>Had this man had any conversation with you before this took place? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you undertake, a fortnight afterwards, to swear to the persons of men whom you never saw before? - Yes, Sir, I think I can.</p>

               <p>Was not you stunned? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you never said that you was so drunk at the time, that you did not know whether you lost your watch, or was robbed of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk at the time? - No, Sir, I cannot say I was drunk, I had been drinking; I cannot say I was clear of liquor.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - Porter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then your share of the porter came to eight-pence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much porter will eight-pence buy? - Two pots and a penny over.</p>

               <p>Had they any arms? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>This was done by force, and without any arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see these men afterwards? - I saw Walker on a Friday, almost three weeks after.</p>

               <p>Who shewed him to you? - Nobody.</p>

               <p>You know Walker immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - On the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him then? - At Mr. Staples's office, that was John Walker, I saw him at the Rotation-office; I knew him again then.</p>
               <p>You went through two or three rooms? - Yes, me and my brother; my brother picked him out; I told him to pick out that man.</p>
               <p>Who did he pick out? - Walker was the first man he picked out that day.</p>
               <p>Did your brother know him again as well as you? - Not so well, but he had some knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure from what you was capable of seeing that night, that these two men are the men that robbed your brother? - I am very sure that Walker is the man that got his watch, and I am pretty sure that Evans is the man that struck me first.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was there when your brother was robbed? - There were the lamps and shops lighted, just opposite where he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Were these lights near enough to see distinctly? - Yes, Sir, so far as to know them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had you been with your brother spending the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Walking out in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards went into a public house to refresh yourselves? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long were you in the public house? - I cannot say how long, we had but two pots of beer between us.</p>
               <p>Was you half an hour there? - Yes, that if not more, not an hour, I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour, or three quarters of an hour? - May be it might be half an hour, or may be three quarters of an hour, not to exceed an hour.</p>
               <p>However, you was with your brother all the time? - Yes, but we were at two public houses; I suppose we might be there three hours.</p>
               <p>Which did you come away from last? - That close by the buildings in the City-road.</p>
               <p>How much might you drink at the last place? - I cannot say how much we drank, because the master he was seeking the job of work was there, and he drank along with us; it came to each a pot of beer, or four-pence, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210046"/>Then you had not been drinking there largely at all; they would not charge you eight-pence for a pot of beer? - No, some paid four-pence, some a pot of beer, and some more; my share was either four-pence, or a pot of beer; my brother's was seven-pence or eight-pence; I do not suppose them that drank most paid most; we got there about two, and I suppose it might be a little after five when we came away.</p>
               <p>Who was with you besides your brother? - I do not know the people; there was one that I knew, but there was no more; and there was another that my brother knew, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Who was with you when these two men men came up? - Nobody but our two selves; I was twenty yards before my brother; there were a deal of people going about, but not at that spot where we were, not that we saw, but there might be.</p>
               <p>Were the shops open near that place where your brother was knocked down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any application for assistance? - No; there was one man particularly that I remember said, we had better go home, and think ourselves very well off we got off so; I made no application.</p>
               <p>Did your brother? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>But at the time you was struggling with these men, did not you think it necessary to call for assistance, as the shop was so near? - It might have been necessary; we did not know what to do for the best; if we had thought of that certainly we would not have spared ourselves to have called out.</p>
               <p>In fact you did not call out or give any alarm at this time, how long might your brother be engaged in the scuffle? - He got up with my assistance; I do not suppose the scuffle lasted a minute, because one of them struck me as soon as I came up, and another gave me a blow; they walked to Old-street turnpike-gate, and we came up the other way.</p>
               <p>How long might they be in your sight after they quitted your brother? - Not a minute.</p>
               <p>You desired your brother to pick Walker out at the Justice's? - Yes, I had told my brother before, that I could know him; I said so at the Blue Anchor; there was a man there threatened my life if ever I said a word; that was the reason I would not pick him out; my brother said, he supposed that was the man; and I told him I was sure that was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your brother pointed him out as the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near were Nash and the other person to you? - Pretty near.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How much will your brother and you get if these two men are convicted? - Upon my oath, Sir, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard if these two men were convicted there would be eighty pounds reward? - No, Sir, nobody told us so.</p>
               <p>Did not you know it? - I never did hear that there was a halfpenny for taking a man up.</p>
               <p>Do you know it now? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes, I can, and I will if you please.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you expect any thing at all by the prisoners being convicted? - No, Sir, I do not; I do not want any thing; I had not seen them between the robbery and the time; here is the watch which

               <p>Do you know him by sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him at your house? - It is possible I may; if not in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him with the other prisoner? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him on this occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing at all of him concerning the watch? - No; the prosecutor offered to make it up; the prosecutor offered to swear to my own brother; that is the gentleman, I do not know his name. (Pointing to Matthew Stephenson.) We were disputing about this matter of the watch, five or six; and some proposals were made by the prosecutor to settle something of this matter about the watch, which I refused; if I would have made their loss good, the prisoners would not have been here; accordingly I asked him if he should know the person that took the watch from him if he saw him; he said, he should; accordingly one said, he should, and the other said, he should not; and that other said, he was so much in liquor, he could not know any man, nor know how he lost it; accordingly I says to Matthew, you have lately seen the person that found the watch; if he was the thief why did not you take him; he said, if he saw him, he was doubtful of laying hold of him, least he should have ill treatment; I immediately engaged myself that my life should be at stake, that no man should ill treat him, in the matter, on the premises, or where I was; I desired him to look about; he looked about and saw my brother Thomas Ellt, and he said, you I know well, he said, this coat I remember well, though in the dark; this wig I remember very well, though it was dark; I put my hand on your shoulder in Old-street-road, such an hour, such a night; I sent for an officer to secure my brother till they decided the matter; but the officer did not come; and he bugged my brother's pardon, and treated him with something; accordingly that passed on for sometime; he acknowledged himself that he had aggrieved my brother, and wrongfully accused him, when he found my brother had sufficient proof where he was that night at that time; after that I was subpoened before Justice Staples on account of the watch; Mr. Staples sent for me, and I went up; he did not send a warrant, nor a summons; he asked me, if I knew the man that took the watch out of pawn; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210048"/>told him, I believed him to be an honest, industrious, young man; and I believed he would not be absent when he was wanted; that went on for I suppose three weeks and better; the prosecutor applied to me, two or three different times; I had seen the person who is now prisoner, two or three different times; about the latter end of the session, I received a fresh order to come up to Mr. Staples's, and the prisoner

             said, how can you accuse this man, who has lived so many years in the neighbourhood, and never had a blemish in his character in his life, when I can prove where he was that evening till ten at night; I was in the Fleet-prison upon business, from three till ten that night; I was doing some business with a prisoner that was there; with that, he rather then began to draw his words in, and he said he was sorry, he believed he was under a mistake, he was sorry he had charged me with it, and if I would forgive him, he would treat me with any thing I would drink, and he would make up every matter, and give me a guinea and a half out of the reward that was offered for the watch, and he would have the watch, and make it all up; with that, I told him it was a very hard case to have my character, which had never been blemished, where I lived twenty-five years on the spot, taken away; but if he would ask my pardon, and confess before the company I was not the person, I would make it up.</p>
               <p>Did he do it? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>He confessed before the company that you was not the person, though he had charged you before? - Yes, and he was going out of the door, and we had shook hands, and he said, says he, I cannot help thinking still but you are the man; I saw no more; my brother and he, and another man went together, I believe to get the watch from the pawnbroker's, and I saw no more of him till we went up before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the prisoner Walker? - I have seen him several times; I believe eight or ten times, but I have no acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Where does he lives? - I cannot say, I have seen him at my brother's; when I came before the Justice, I told him how I had been used, and I asked the prosecutor to give me his name, and place of abode, and he refused it; I applied to Mr. Staples; he said it was proper that he should, and he asked him for it, and he wrote it down on a piece of paper; I live at the Gentleman and Porter, in Bell-lane, Spitalfields; I have only lived there about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before? - In Petticoat lane, next door to the Coach and Horses; I have lived there much about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Was Nash at Staples's at the same time? - I believe not.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it in the dark? - It was quite dark; there was a window, but we shut the window to, that they might not see; the prisoner Barker says to Mash, Jack, are you there, is it you; I hope you have not been a saying nothing? no, says Mash, I am not such a fool as that, they will get nothing out of me; they told me, they had got you, but I would not believe them; he said, that we had told him that somebody had seen them on the spot that night; this prisoner Barker said, sure that person could not watch us; Mash told him, mind, when you go before the Magistrate, we must deny knowing each other; and says he, do not own to nothing, for there is nothing to affect us, for you must not mind what they say; there was a great deal more discourse that I cannot recollect; then Harper came and opened the watch-house, then Armstrong and me came out, and spoke to Harper, for we had heard every thing but where the liquor was sold; and we were locked in again; then Mash says to the prisoner, d - n you, what do you think of it now? he said, I hope they have got the weeds out of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. What did they mean by weeds? - That is the goods that were stolen; Mash said, they had had time enough to get it out of the way; you have no occasion to fear nothing now.</p>
               <p>What was there between the place in which you were and the place in which the prisoners were? - A door, and there was likewise bars that looked into the place where we were; we were set down in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Could you hear distinctly what passed in the rooms where the prisoner and Mash were? - I could hear distinctly every word they said; we went and searched the house of Mr. Levy, in Frying-pan-alley, Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>How came you to search that house? - By what we told Harper when he locked us in again; he spoke to the prisoner, and said, Harper and Armstrong are gone to search such a house after the liquor; we suspected it was there; I searched the house, seeing a stone bottle, I took it up, and smelt it, and says I, here is some raspberry; there was very little liquor there; we found nothing else; then Levy was sent for; we told him, we had two such people in custody, and had heard such discourse from them that we were sure he had bought the liquor; he said, he could say nothing to it that night, he would come up to the Magistrate in the morning; this was about eight at night; accordingly on the Monday, he came up to the Magistrate; he produced one cask on the Monday morning, and I think the next he produced was on the Wednesday morning; then he brought another.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any more? - No, only the two.</p>
               <p>Did you search to know what had been in these casks? - There is one that we smelt that had bitters in it; the other had peppermint; there are the marks on the casks; the prisoners were under two or three examinations; they were locked up; the prisoner Barker wanted to come out, and said, he wanted to be admitted an evidence; we told him, we could say nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210057"/>to it; there was a Magistrate there, and he must go and speak to him; accordingly we took him before the Magistrate, and he told the Magistrate he wanted to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Did the Magistrate consent to have him as an evidence? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell him he would not? - He told him he would not; he made him no promises; he said, he and Mash were drinking at the King's head, in Spital-fields, on the Saturday night, and Mash and the other asked him to go and do a little job with them; he asked them what? and they told him, to get into a house where they could get some liquors; he says, they all three went, and Mash and the other broke open the house, which he said was the Eagle and Child; he said, he and Mash and the other broke open the house, by breaking open the window shutter, and they got in at the window; he said, that he stood a little distance from the house, and they put out the casks at the window; he said, then each of them took their part and took them away; I think he said, there were eight casks; I cannot recollect whether he said, where he carried them; then he said, they went and drank at a public house in Shoreditch; I think it is the Star and Garter, facing Shoreditch church, till about six, and then they took the casks to Mr. Levy, and sold the liquor.</p>

               <p>Are you a pretty vigilant officer? - I try to execute every information that comes; it was out of our power to bring Levy, because he entered into recognizance before the Magistrate to surrender; we never knew that we had any power to bring him as he was out upon bail; I know his house of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210058"/>abode; I saw him on Monday; he gave the prosecutor notice of the trial.</p>

               <p>All I know is, that Mr. Scudmore was tricked out of four notes, for two hundred and fifty pounds each, to the amount of one thousand pounds; an action was brought against Mr. Scudmore for one of the bills; Mr. Garforth defended the action for Mr. Scudmore; and pending the suit, two of the parties became bankrupts: a bill was filed in the court of Exchequer, for an injunction to stop the proceedings; Aikles was subpoened while in Newgate, when he said he could make a discovery of the whole fraud; he then wanted his time to be enlarged; application was made, and I believe his time was enlarged; Mr. Garforth understood his time was enlarged.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this, you do not mention any time? - I do not recollect the time, it was the last time he was discharged out of Newgate. My Lord, I have one thing more to say the prisoner applied several times to Mr. Garforth to have a hearing, and to know whether his time was enlarged, but Mr. Garforth was very busy at the House of Common upon a petition.</p>

               <p>I am a brick-maker; I was at work; and two young men came through the brickfield, one had a bundle under his arm; seeing something white under his arm, I thought it was an apron; it was between two and three o'clock on Wednesday 7th of February; they were going towards Haggerston; we thought if we run after them they would run away, but we did run after them; and I took one of them by the collar; the other got the bundle; the prisoner came up the same lane to their assistance; he came up the same lane, and I ran past him; while I was disputing with the man I had hold of, the prisoner said, Jack, what is the matter? come across the road and give me the bundle, I will not be stopped, nor go back for any one; the prisoner said, Jack, go and fetch your mother, for these things are for her to wash; then we detained the prisoner at the officer's house at the Black Bull, at Haggerston, and the bundle; and in the evening we went to the Justice's.</p>

            ; on Wednesday the 7th of February, between two and three, I saw two men coming across the field; and up the lane I saw something white like an apron, which was a large bundle under the arm of one of them; and we pursued them up the lane with the bundle; the last witness took the man that had the bundle, and the others ran away; then the prisoner came up the same lane, to assist in the lane where the other was stopped; the prisoner says, Jack, what is the matter? come over the road, and give me the bundle, I will not be stopped by any body; the things are your mother's, and are going to be washed; he went to fetch his mother, but he never returned again; we took the prisoner and the bundle to Mr. Davis, at the Bull, at Haggerston, and then to the Justice's with the bundle.</p>

               <p>How did you see that? - Because I rushed in directly, and she was behind the door; I ran in directly and the man was sitting on the side of the bed; I threw him backwards on the bed; he attempted to run something into his pockets, or into his breeches; I cannot tell which; Treadway ran up to my assistance, and held his right arm, and Freeman came and took something out of his right hand; in the struggle there was a small cup, or a small gallipot, with some stuff in it, which stood in the chimney corner, next his left hand, which the prisoner knocked down; I then tied him, and took him away from the bedstead; there were three beds in the room, and I sat him down on one, which he said was his own, and the others, that is Freeman, Meecham, and Treadway, searched the room.</p>

               <p>I went in company with Beamish, Treadway, and Meecham, to the house in Hampshire-hog-yard, St. Giles's; between the hours of three and four, to the house of Mr. Wrinkle, upon information; I went to the room door of the two prisoners; Beamish got upon the second flight of stairs, observing the crevice where the light came through on the top of the door; I observed him rather short, and pulled him by the coat, and got up myself; I looked over the door, and I observed the prisoner William; I could see with my eye at the top of the door; but I forced it a little, and had a better view; I saw him sitting on the side of a bed on the right side of the fire place; he was on my left side; I observed just one half of him, for I could not see his left hand; I saw his right hand move, as if he was at work with something in his hand; at that time Beamish was looking through a hole in the door on one knee; I made a motion to Beamish to assist me in forcing the door a little more open at the top, and with his assistance, I had a further view; I then observed the woman sitting on the other side facing the man, in a chair; I observed a basket by her side; in that interim one of the officers let his stick fall; I then made a motion to have the door bursted open, and just as we were going to burst the door, the door was opened withinside; then Beamish, myself, and Treadway another of the officers, rushed in; Beamish seized the man and threw him across the bed; I observed the man too strong for Beamish, and while I was stooping to pick up some of these articles, I am now going to shew you; I let go the things and seized the prisoner by his right hand, and took out of his right hand this bad sixpence; between his legs was a pitcher of water, which in the struggle he threw down; at that instant, my Lord, the woman was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210070"/>making her escape; she had got out of the room, and was on the second stair going down stairs; I left the man and pursued her, and brought her back into the room; I observed her rubbing her hands within her apron, and in her apron, I found that. (Another bad sixpence.) Observing the man obstreperous -</p>

               <p>Court. I suppose you mean violent? - Yes; I left the woman, and seized hold of him again, and in the struggle he knocked down that cup; that stood withinside the fire place, within about six inches of his knee; it stood atop of the hearth: seeing the cup broke I gathered it up together; there is a composition in it; when the water was thrown down that was in the pitcher, there was a quantity of salt in this paper, and the water fell on the salt, so that I could not gather up the salt; here is the paper; I could not pick it up; I tasted it; on the side of his left foot was this sand; it appears to be common sand, and this stone, and a cork; it is a whetstone, and a common bit of cork, and this sixpence not coloured, and this pair of pliers by his left side, and a file, and this strap, a piece of leather by his feet; we secured the man and tied his hands; and when he got up, I found this small piece of brass which are cuttings; by the side of the woman there was a basket; I asked her if that was her basket; she said, yes, it was her's, there was nothing there but a few pins and a few ballads; I searched it, and found these four sixpences, this bad sixpence, and this brimstone; then I secured her; and Beamish and me took them to the round-house; she desired I would take great care of the things in the basket, for that every thing in the basket was hers, and so I did.</p>
               <p>Did she say this after she had seen you take out the things? - Yes; and the man likewise desired I would take care of them, for they were all his; I took him before the Magistrate, and he told the Magistrate the things were all his, before Mr. Clarke.</p>

               <p>I went with Freeman, Beamish and Treadway, to this house in Hampshire-hog-yard; in searching between the bed and sacking, which the prisoner owned be his, I found this piece of brass.</p>
               <p>There were three beds in the room, were not there? - Yes, he owned this to be his before he went to the watch-house in my hearing; I found a pair of scissars, a file, which appears to be brassy, a rubber very brassy indeed, and in a bag four square bits of brass cut out; there were five, but I believe one was left at the Justice's; they were not coloured, and some sand in a paper, and a hammer; there were pieces of leather, and things laid up together in a corner, and a piece of rag wet with some stuff upon it; I do not know what it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a room in which other people lodge.</p>

               <p>I have been employed for these fourteen or fifteen years in his Majesty's mint, for these prosecutions; I have attended this Court near upon twenty years.</p>
               <p>Look at all these things, and explain to the Court and Jury the process that has been carried on by people having these things in their custody? - If this composition is discovered in Court, every man will be his own coiner for sixpence; this is a sheet of brass, from which apparently such blanks as these have been cut.</p>
               <p>Is that a piece of brass of a size fit to cut blanks to resemble a sixpence? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>These square pieces are cut from that larger one? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Having made them square, what do they do next? - Cut them round with a pair of scissars, and after having cut them round, they generally use a file in order to take the roughness of the scissars from it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210071"/>the file which is produced, had been made use of apparently from the brass upon it; these are squares they afterwards cut round; these round ones have been so cut; then they are filed round the edge; after this, to take off the grease, they rub them either with scowering paper, or with such a rubber as this, which is a piece of leather nailed on wood; this rubber has been used by somebody; the next thing is the colouring, there is one there which has been coloured, but has not been finished; this was the one that was found in the man's hand.</p>
               <p>How does that appear, has it been kept separate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at these four? - These four have been finished.</p>
               <p>When they are in that state is it compleat? - It is compleat for putting off; they were a great deal better when I saw them before, but they lose their whiteness by keeping, and the reason why they lose their whiteness, is on account of the want of silver being mixed with the brass.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing produced to you now which will produce the colour of silver upon brass? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is every thing there that has been produced to you, sufficient to transact such business, sufficient to colour blanks to resemble sixpences, or shillings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say then, that among these things found in the prisoner's lodgings, there all were materials, and tools necessary for making counterfeit sixpences and shillings, so as to give it a probable chance of passing for true money? - Not a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Have you any witnesses? - That woman, I asked her before the Justice if ever she knew that I made any such in my life; God knows who left them there, I know nothing of them; as for the woman's moving the basket when that drunken woman's bed was down, there was only a passage to the fire place.</p>

               <p>Did you take these handkerchiefs from her? - Yes, then we brought her back to the shop; I told my master who was in the back shop, he came, and as she came in, she took another parcel from under her cloak, and put it on the counter; then my master took her into the back shop, and I went to look for a constable; and she was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Are the handkerchiefs here? - I left them with a woman that keeps that door yesterday; and about ten o'clock last night two men came in my name, and she gave them to them.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave the handkerchiefs with any body? - I was just come out of the gallery, and I left them with her till I came back.</p>
               <p>What is the woman's name? - Mrs. Storey.</p>
               <p>Court. Before this woman comes, were this parcel of handkerchiefs which you took from under her cloak, any of those that were produced to the prisoner in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the other parcel which the prisoner laid down on the compter, a part of the handkerchiefs which had been produced to her in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many handkerchiefs did each parcel contain? - One contained twelve, and the other eight.</p>
               <p>You took care of these handkerchiefs I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And had them in your possession till what time? - Till last Saturday.</p>
               <p>What became of them then? - I left them at the Pitt's-head over the way.</p>
               <p>With whom? - With Mrs. Goldspring.</p>
               <p>Who is she? - The mistress of the house, till yesterday morning; yesterday I saw them again, that is, I brought them up in the gallery; I went but there in the afternoon about two, and I gave them to the door-keeper to keep till I came back.</p>
               <p>You have not got them again? - No.</p>
               <p>It is necessary to ask you whether you perceived the prisoner in the shop attempting to secret these handkerchiefs? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>How many shopmen may they keep? - They keep another now, they only kept me then.</p>
               <p>Then I take it they frequently attend in the shop themselves? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very industrious men in that respect? Yes.</p>
               <p>You have two shops, a back and front shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They communicate by glass doors? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many of these gentlemen are there in the business? - Him and his brother; they are not partners, but they are constantly serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>This was the time of high business? - No, we had no customers in the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Then I take it as you had no other customer in the shop, your attention must be a good deal directed to this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw all she did, I take it? - I did not see her take them, nor offer to take them.</p>
               <p>What Magistrate did you attend before? - Justice Walker, in Hyde-street.</p>
               <p>Were you the only evidence before the Magistrate? - Nobody but me and my master, who came to swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Are you quite confident that you did not declare before the Magistrate that you saw the woman take these things? - Yes, I am quite confident I did not say so; I did not see her take them.</p>
               <p>You gave immediate information to Mr. Richard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you call out your master from the back shop at the same time? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is there any body here beside you and the constable? - My young master is.</p>
               <p>Your other master is taking care of the business at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with your master to see this poor woman before the Justice, or in prison? - Yes, I went before Mr. Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>Your master felt a great deal of pity for her and her two children, one of four years of age, and the other at the breast? - My young master was very sorry for her.</p>
               <p>He did not wife to indict her capitally, I believe, if he could have helped it? - No.</p>

               <p>Twydale.

            , Esq; of Harley-street, No. 9; I have lived with him above these two years; on Friday was a week, the 16th of February, the prisoner came to my master's stables.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before this time? - Yes, I had seen him in company with Newman when he bought the mare, about a week or ten days before that; he came to <placeName id="t17870221-33-crimeloc176">Charlotte-mews, West</placeName>

               <p>Whereabouts? - It was just going into the gateway, not quite in, but just going in; he said, come in young man, and I will pay you.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the horse? - I do not know, he took hold of the bridle, and gave it to the boy; he said come in, and I will pay you, and I followed him into a back room, and he called for sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and said, sit down my man, I will pay you directly; he asked me if I was hungry, if I would have a bit of bread and butter; I said no, I was not hungry; he said he was very hungry, he had been walking about all day, he would go out and get a plate of bread and butter; he went out for that purpose, but never returned.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any money to you in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>He talked of paying you? - Yes, he said several times over he would pay me, and desired I would sit down; I never saw him afterwards till we took him.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait for him in the room? - Four or five minutes as nigh as I can guess; I then asked in the house if he was there, and they said no; I then went into the yard; I did not find him, nor the horse there; I went into almost all the stables, and there was no such horse there; then I went to Newman's house to enquire for this man; I found the horse the next morning; I saw him coming out of Mr. Newman's stable, between six and seven.</p>
               <p>How far is Newman's from the Golden-horse? - It is within a mile.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210076"/>Jury. It is rather better than a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Foulger. Newman was upon the horse; I went to Newman, and took hold of the bridle, and said the horse must not go till he was paid for, for that I had sold him over night to a man, and he had not paid me; he asked me what I meant, and I told him the whole story; Newman refused to let me have him; he rode off with him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that horse you saw with Newman upon it, was your master's horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a bay gelding? - Yes, it was cropped; my master has had him about a year and a half in my care; I knew him by having him so long under my care.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing else by which you can distinguish him? - No, there is no particular marks that I remember, only his colour, and being cropped, and having known him so long; I went to Newman's to enquire for the prisoner, because I had seen him with Newman before.</p>
               <p>How long before had you seen him with the prisoner? - About a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Was the horse brought out to you, or did you see him by chance; - I saw Newman come out upon him; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the prisoner afterwards? - Yes, we took him the Sunday following; I was present when he was taken; he was taken at a public house, near Shepherd's-market.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I do not recollect saying any thing to him particular; I told the constable that was the man; I did not mention the horse to him.</p>
               <p>Was he given into custody without any conversation about the horse at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with the prisoner about it? - No, he said when he got to the watch-house, that he should not have deceived me, if the other had not deceived him.</p>
               <p>Tell me the whole conversation? - He said he should not have deceived me, if he had not been deceived by George; by that I understood Newman, I knew his name to be George; the prisoner told me not to be frightened, for he knew how to do business.</p>
               <p>What did he mean by that; I do not know; that was what passed, I recollect them words.</p>
               <p>Was that the expression, that he knew how to do business? - Yes; I said to him at the public house, I suppose you know me; I unbuttoned my coat to shew him my livery, that I was the same person; he said nothing to that; when I first went in, I did not exactly know him.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the room? - Yes, there were several people in the room.</p>
               <p>How came you to know him afterwards? - He came into the room where I was with the constable.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the first room? - Yes, I saw him, and I said I thought it was he; I was not positive of him when I first saw him, but I thought it was him.</p>
               <p>Do you think the prisoner saw you in the first room? - Yes, I am sure he saw me, but whether he knew me or not, I do not know; when he came into the second room, I knew him directly; he did not attempt to go away at all.</p>
               <p>What may the value of this bay gelding be? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe to be the value of it? - I cannot exactly tell, I am no great judge of horses.</p>
               <p>What would you give for him? - We gave ten pounds, or ten guineas, I cannot say; my master said ten guineas, but I think it was only ten pounds; I know he gave ten pounds; I am sure he gave ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not you the money tendered down to you? - No, I never received a a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he shew you any money? - No, I never saw any money.</p>

               <p>Not by any body? - No; Newman put ten guineas down to go out with the constable and me to find Robinson; he left it in the keeper's hands; this was before the prisoner was brought in; the prisoner was not present in the watch-house then.</p>
               <p>Did the keeper take that security? - Yes, he took it for a few minutes, and returned it again, as Newman did not go to look for Robinson, but gave us directions where to go for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He put it down to pay for the horse, and they wanted a guinea a piece, did not you ask us for a guinea piece that we might both be at liberty? - No, I am sure it was not so.</p>

               <p>I am an officer in Mary-le-bone; the last witness came to me on Sunday morning to serve a warrant on Newman; I went with him to Newman's house, where he lives, and found him in his own apartments, with his wife; Foulger went in first, I followed him close; the prisoner was not there; I took Newman into custody, and saw no horse; on Sunday night I took the prisoner at the Griffin, in Half-moon-street, near Shepherd's-market; the coachman was with me when we went into the house; there was a lamp, or a light that hung up high, and there were several gentlemen sitting in the box: and the coachman hits me on the elbow, says he, I think that is the man that stands there, so, and so; I believe the prisoner saw the coachman, for reasons that I have; we were going into the other room; the coachman went in; I looked round and saw them moving; I stepped forwards to the door, as they were just going; the prisoner came into the second room where the coachman was; I asked him to step into that room with me; I told him, if you will step into this room with me, I will tell you my business; he said, yes, with all his heart, or something to that meaning; and he came into the room with me; talking a little while before the coachman; at last he says, that is the man, that is your prisoner; says I, my friend, you must go along with me, I have got a warrant for you, and he begged me not to say any thing about it, but put up my staff, and he would go with me very peaceable and quiet; I took him in a coach to Mary-le-bone watch-house; Newman I took in the morning first, about twelve; this prisoner I took in the evening between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did not take Mr. Newman out in the back place of the watch-house, and ask him for a guinea a-piece? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go out with Newman at all? - I do not know whether I took him out at all; he put down ten guineas in the watch-house keeper's hands, for security for his return, to go with the coachman and me to find the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Were there many people in the room at this time? - Only Robinson, me, and Newman, and the people of the house frequently backwards and forwards in the same room; it was a public kitchen; I have at different times advanced a little money for Robinson, and always found him honest; I know nothing more.</p>

               <p>What do you know of these scales? - The prisoner Halsey, and Coleman, came and offered these scales to me for sale on the 28th of February; I bought them for a shilling.</p>
               <p>What were they worth? - I looked upon them to have cost about six pence or eight-pence in labour, and then they would fetch about two shillings; I took them out of the prisoner's hands.</p>

I was sitting at the corner of the place; I did not know where they brought the things from; they came and gave me a blanket and a pair of scales; and I did not know where they got them from no more than the dead; I did not; and I was so foolish to take them from him; I have not a friend in the world; I was only brought in this morning.</p>

On Tuesday the 9th of January last, Mr. Byron called at Mr. Gedge's shop; I did not know him before; he had the appearance of a gentleman; he was very genteely dressed; he called to look at some Irish linens; and ordered some to be left at his lodgings in Poland-street the next morning; I went the next morning and took several pieces of linens, and some handkerchiefs; he Bought four pieces of Irish and twelve pocket handkerchiefs; the whole amounted to about twenty-one pounds; this Mr. Byron presented this bill for payment for the goods; I told him, I could not possibly take it, as I knew neither of the parties, without making enquiries about it; I then asked him who this

This is the bill I presented to him; I asked him if that bill was drawn by him; he took the bill into his hand, and looked at it, and he told me it was drawn by him, and it should be paid as soon as it became due; I then left the house, and made some enquiries in the neighbourhood about it; I found he was not known by any person in the neighbourhood; I then immediately went home, and told Mr. Gedge; he said, he would not take the note by any means; we kept the note in our hands three days; the third day Mr. Byron called at Mr. Gedge's shop, to know if we approved of the bill, Mr. Gedge told him, he did not, and could not possibly think of taking it, as he knew nothing of either of the parties; just as he was going out of our shop, a man came in and took him by the arm, and desired him to go with him; he was taken into custody immediately; it was Mr. Lee's man of Charing-cross, a hosier; and he was taken immediately to Justice Hyde's; I know nothing further of the prisoner; this note was presented by Byron.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-maker; I live in Poland-street; on the 8th of January, a young gentleman, with the appearance of a gentleman, came to take an apartment in my house; he answered to the name of Byron; I enquired where I could be referred, for his character; he referred me to Mr. Mason, No. 4, Argyle street, for his character.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It was Monday the 8th of January; in the afternoon I went to No. 4, Argyle-street, and knocked at the door; the prisoner opened the door, and I asked for Mr. Mason; he appeared as the person; I told him I was referred to him, by a Mr. Byron for his character: he asked me if it was H. Byron of Case Haughton; I told him yes; he told me he was a gentleman, and a man of fortune, and that I was very safe; I was then satisfied with the character he gave; I never saw Mr. Mason before.</p>
               <p>But he was the person answering to the name of Mason at this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever know me by any other name than Mason? - No.</p>

               <p>How long afterwards was it that he was at your house, that he ordered you to call on him by the name of Mason? - A great while after; I conceived that to be his name; he lived at the British coffee-house two years ago; I called for him by the name of Mason, but he was not at home, but they answered to the name, and said he was not at home; in consequence of that, he called upon me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any body call him Mason? - Not in my house.</p>
               <p>Any where else? - Only at the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Why you never saw him at the coffee-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any body address him by the name of Mason? - No, I conceive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210087"/>Mason to be his right name, because he told me so, when he told me to call on him by the name of Mason; it is more than two years ago; I cannot positively say to the time; I was called upon to prove his hand-writing by the Grand Jury, at Guildhall, but as I had never seen him write, I could say nothing on the business.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been a witness in this Court before? - I never was in this Court before this trial came on.</p>
               <p>At any time? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear this man call himself Mason, except in the conversation to you that you have talked of? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any letter from him? Never.</p>
               <p>People enquired for him at your house? - Yes, in the name of Aikles.</p>
               <p>Never in the name of Mason? - No, Sir; he at that time kept a house in Bateman's-buildings, Soho-square, No. 6; his wife used to come to him at my house.</p>
               <p>What name did he keep it in there? - By the name of Aikles.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned, finding a special verdict, and said they had not the least doubt, but the name of Mason was assumed for the purpose at that time; because, they said, they disbelieved the evidence of the woman; and that it was the sense of the whole Jury, that his name was Aikles, and that the name of Mason was first assumed for this purpose. The Court asked the Jury, if they found that he never went by that name before; to which they replied, never my Lord, we cannot suppose he ever did; Upon which, Mr. Knowlys, counsel for the prisoner, informed the Court, he wished the Jury, having this opinion, would find a general verdict of guilty, subject to the opinion of the Judges.</p>

            ; on Wednesday, the 1st of February, about the noon of the day, between eleven and twelve, I lost six pair of stockings; the prisoner Wood and another boy with him, which I believe to be Riley, came to my shop for a ball of worsted; the prisoner Molloy did not come in with them at that time; they paid for the ball of worsted, and went their way; about ten minutes after, the boy Wood was brought back to me, with six pair of thread stockings, by Mr. Higinbottom.</p>
               <p>Had these two boys any conversation together? - They came in together, they spoke together, and they were both concerned together in buying the worsted; I am clear the stockings are my own property; they are marked with an eyelet-hole just under the welt; there are four eyelet-holes in each heel.</p>
               <p>Is that the case of all of them? - No, it is only to distinguish the different qualities of them; these eyelet holes are made by the manufacturer; this is a very particular article; I bought them the day before, and I had them in my hand, examining them, not five minutes before the prisoners came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Unless you gave express orders for these stockings yourself, other stockings are made the same way for other people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing else besides these eylet holes? - No.</p>
               <p>What quantity had you bought before? - Six pair, they were tied up in a sheet of blue paper when I lost them; I bought them in brown paper; when they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210088"/>brought back, they were in paper; I have not got the paper; I know nothing of Molloy.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these stockings? - Fourteen shillings I gave for them.</p>
               <p>When did you first miss your stockings? - Not till they were brought back by Mr. Higinbottom.</p>

               <p>What time might it be when the boys got to the shop? - I suppose it might be near twelve; I did not take notice of the time; I observed to a Mr. Dunn, that these were pickpockets, or shop-lifters; I observed Riley, and from my own suspicions, I followed him and Molloy up Bond-street; they crossed Oxford-street, and went into Bear-street; they went up several streets, and went to Mr. Hartshorn's window; Wood and Riley went into a shop, and Molloy stood at the door; I followed the boys to Portland-street, there I lost sight of Wood and Riley; I saw Molloy stand or sit, on the opposite side, a few doors above Mr. Wigley's shop; I saw Wood and Riley go into the prosecutor's shop, and I went into the opposite corner shop, Mr. Wallis's the butcher's, in order to remain there till Riley and Wood joined again to Molloy; I had hardly been there the space of five minutes, before I saw Wood come out with something under his coat; I pursued him up Mary-bone-street, I took him immediately; I did not see the other boy then come out with him; I am sure it was Wood; I do not know what became of the other boy; there was a coal cart obstructed me; I seized him opposite Queen Ann-street; there he had quitted himself of the goods; I did not see him throw down any goods; he had nothing upon him; I brought the prisoner back into George-street, and the goods were given me by a man out of Mr. Phelp's shop; I took Wood and the goods back to Mr. Wigley's shop; Mr. Wigley said, they were goods he had had much trouble in getting the day before, for Mr. Yorke, of Portland-place; and had tied them up that morning that the prisoners came in for a ball of worsted, that he bid them match it, and left them, and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>What became of Riley? - I do not know, I saw Molloy lurking on the opposite side, when I came back; he was not in the shop; I observed he was one of the gang; I sent over, and had him taken.</p>

               <p>I am a muffin baker, in George-street, Portland chapel; I was standing in my shop, on the 21st of February, and I saw a lad run, to the best of my knowledge it was Wood; I knew him; I saw him stoop down with a bundle in blue, like blue paper.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Riley at that time? - No, I have not a doubt but it is Wood, because when he stooped to drop the bundle, I perceived he had very short hair; I saw him throw the bundle under a stair-case, which goes over some stabling; I saw a gentleman take it up; he brought it into my shop; the blue paper looked very fresh then, but I could not say any further as to the bundle.</p>
               <p>Did the gentleman pick up the same bundle that the boy put down? - Yes, we kept the bundle; the gentleman said, I will take it home, and if they should ask for it, you will tell them where it is; I immediately saw him bringing the boy back again; and he gave the bundle to Mr. Higinbottom I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you see him give the bundle to Wigley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy taken? - No, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210089"/>was brought back in five minutes, it was not three minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>Is that the boy which was brought back? - It was Wood; I am positive Wood was the lad that was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. Pray Sir, did you see me take a bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see me throw it down? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say that it was a light colour blue paper? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not it a very short gentleman, in a blue coat, and that gentleman had a white coat at the same time, and a pig-tail? - To the best of my knowledge, it was Mr. Higinbottom.</p>
               <p>Higinbottom. I received the parcel, but I cannot say from whom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Phelps. Did you follow me to the shop where I was taken to? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you gave the stockings to that gentleman? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. This is not the boy that was with me, it is a boy bigger than him; I know nothing of these two lads; I never saw them before I came into the prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Riley. I never saw this boy before.</p>

               <p>Was the crowd still about the Opera door at that late hour? - It was an early hour; it was the night of the masquerade; one person I felt take hold of one pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210090"/>and one person of the other; and one laid hold of my hat, another pulled my watch out of my pocket; I caught hold of the seals; I retained the seals; the watch was taken and the chain; I had hold of the chain; I felt the chain as I walked with my hand on my pocket which I endeavoured to secure; after they got the watch, the chain remained in my hand; I saw three or four men picking up some guineas which had fallen from my breeches pocket; which they had turned out; the next day I advertised my watch as having been lost at that place; I was fearfull of taking any of the men surrounded as I was.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the persons by sight? - No, there was no lamps at the door.</p>
               <p>Did any of them shove you or strike you before the watch was taken? - No, nothing more than the pressure of the crowd; I had hold of the chain all the time.</p>
               <p>Did it require any considerable degree of violence to break the chain? - I defended it as hard as I could; and the man pulled as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Was there any struggle? - Only pulling at the chain; I perceived him take it, and I endeavoured to retain it, and he pulled it from me.</p>
               <p>It was then by the force of his pulling that it was taken from you? - It was.</p>
               <p>You endeavoured to retreat? - I did; I found it was too late for that; when they closed in upon me there was a hustleing as much as might be expected upon such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Was the pressure of the crowd occasioned by the concourse of people, or was it occasioned by these people? - I felt no crowd till these people came up.</p>
               <p>It was then apparently a crowd of their own making? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you by advertiseing ever find the watch again? - On Wednesday morning after a constable came and informed me that a person had been stopped with a watch upon him, which answered my description; in consequence of that, I went to the office in Litchfield-street; a person was brought to the bar on whom the watch had been found; that was the prisoner; a watch was produced, which from the maker's name I believe to be mine; the case was out, and the glass was broke; it was in a mutilated state; when I lost it, it had a glass upon it, and a green fish skin, or a shagreen case; as the outside case.</p>
               <p>Did you before you lost the watch know the maker's name and number? - Number there was none; the maker's name I knew; I believe it to be mine, but I cannot positively swear to it; if the maker's name had been out, I think I should not have known it; the prisoner said, he found the watch in the street, at the Justice's; the maker's name is

               <p>From the view of this watch what remains of it have you any doubt whether it is, or is not your watch? - (Looks at it.) - I think it to be my watch.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection from the general appearance of the watch, or the dial plate or any thing; have you any recollection but from the maker's name: suppose before the watch had been produced to you the maker's name had been rubbed out and defaced, is there any thing that would have enabled you to say it was your watch? No, certainly.</p>
               <p>- DALTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the prisoner at the bar in company with several others, and I heard he was wanted for several other matters; I went to Young to get his assistance; Young came to me, and we took the prisoner; he was in the room where I saw him before; in searching him, I found that watch; it was in the same condition it is now, without a case; we asked him how he came by it; he said, it was his mother's; he was committed; when he was examined, he said, he found the watch in the kennel opposite the Opera house at twelve o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, Prisoner's Counsel. What<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210091"/>distance of time were you absent? - Not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>In that two minutes the prisoner might have got out and you not have seen him? - Yes.</p>

I said, you are welcome to see, and I gave him a light; I went with him, and as I went into the house, the first thing I saw was them two boys with their hands tied together in the passage, so I said, Lord, bless me, what is the matter here! they took the light and seemed quite busy looking about the place; I took no notice; I came back again with a light: I saw nothing more of these two children; they took them away afterwards on an information of a little girl; I took a light and went into my yard, and sought and found nobody: I went up to a room, and looked out at a window, a back window, and in the next yard, I saw a bundle laying in the yard; it was the 18th of January, to the best of my knowledge; I suppose it was about five or six minutes, to the best of my knowledge; the girl fetched it up; I took the bundle, and there were two shirts, a waistcoat, and a handkerchief; I asked what office them officers came from; I went to Justice Walker's, and took the things there; I know nothing of the prisoners; I have seen the two children before; I never saw them but twice; I saw them the night before; I let that room to two girls that sold matches and hat pins about the streets; I do not know who they were; they lodged about a week.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court. There has been laid before the Court such a scene of wickedness and profligacy of the worst kind, going on the heart of this town, that cannot but fill every body with horror; it is not to be wondered at the number that parish at the gallows, harboured by such wretches as Mrs. Hickey; children trained up to the commission of every kind of profligacy and wickedness; all that is in our power is to take care that the guilty person shall be punished; with respect to the older boy, I am entirely satisfied with both parts of your verdict, that enables me to do what I have not the least doubt is an act of mercy to this boy, I mean that of sending him out of this country, and thereby save him from being hanged; let him be transported for seven years; with respect to the other boy, let him be detained, and carried before a Magistrate of the city of London, to be passed to the parish in which his mother has sworn he was born, in the county of Stafford.</p>
               <p>Court to Conway's mother. You, madam, have probably been reduced by misfortunes, which may have led you to expose that boy to the melancholly situation in which he stands; I shall therefore not reproach you any more on that subject; it is your duty to make all the reparation to God and your country; it is your duty to attend before the Magistrate, to make oath of the place of this child's birth; and it would be the most wise conduct if you was to attend him thither; have you gained any settlement since? - Yes, I kept a house nine years in the Borough; and I kept one since in Westminster; his parish is Westminster.</p>
               <p>Court. As this boy is past nine years old, he may be sent to the place of his birth in the country.</p>

            ; last Friday was a week, I lost my things; I went out about a little business, between two and three in the afternoon; and I left nobody in my apartment; I locked the door of my apartment; there were other lodgers in the house; I came home between eight and nine; I went round to the back door of my room, which is in a back yard, and I found a pane of glass picked out; my apartment is on the ground floor; the door goes into the entry, and there is a staircase; my door is at the foot of the staircase; it is part of Mrs. Evans's house; the door was shut as I left it; the casement window was open.</p>
               <p>Was the pane that was picked out near the handle which opens the casement? - Close by it, any body might put in their hand and open the casement; that casement was shut when I went out; I am sure of that; when I went in I searched my drawers and places, and all about, and missed nothing then; in the morning I missed my things, and some of my wife's; they had been hanging behind the door; my drawers were not locked; nothing was taken out of the drawers; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they were all in one place; my wife came home with me, and the next day I found the things at the office, and the prisoner in custody; I first saw him in the lock-up room and the things on the tap room table; it was at the King's Arms, East Smithfield.</p>

               <p>On the evening of the robbery, on the Friday week last, a few minutes before eight, I was coming along; I saw the prisoner, with these things under his arm rolled up pretty tight; I went close by his side; he was going towards Rosemary-lane, from the prosecutor's house; I followed him to the top of the street; he went over the way to a clothes-shop, and some few words past between him and a man; I came up and asked him what he had there, and took him to the King's Arms; he told me they were some things of his mother's, that she had sent him to sell; I asked him, where his mother lived; he said, in Petticoat-lane; I advised him, as the Magistrates were then sitting, to send for his mother; and I believe had the mother come that evening and claimed the things he might have been discharged; the prosecutor was a painter, and the landlord of this house knew the jacket; and there is the initials of the prosecutor's name on each of the buttons; then the next morning he said he bought them for three shillings, and was going to sell them again; there was the mark of a shoe on the top of the drawers, which corresponded exactly with the shoe of the prisoner; the shoe had been soled, and not soled home; that corresponded with the mark where the seam was.</p>

               <p>I am a collar and harness maker; on Tuesday the 6th of February, about twelve, these two women came to my house and offered some things for sale; there were four bridles, a bradoon, a pair of strap irons and leather; one of the women had some of the bridles in her apron; I looked at them, and asked her what she asked for them; she said, she had some more in her pocket; she pulled them out of her pocket, and asked seven shillings and sixpence; I would not buy them; I thought they were not honestly come by.</p>
               <p>Are these two the same women? - Yes, I took such notice of the women by looking at them, that I am quite sure they are the same.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt, Counsel for the Prisoner Doyle. What is that J. A. the mark of the person that made the boat? - The man's name to whom she belonged to before.</p>
               <p>You say she was moored below the causeway? - Yes, it is what we call low water.</p>
               <p>It is common I believe for boats to go adrift of themselves? - When they come to what we call shoal water, there they will ride; they will never go against the tide; the tide was at ebb when she was moored; it is impossible for them to drift by themselves without being turned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When a boat drifts that is at anchor, does not she carry her anchor with her? - She certainly does.</p>
               <p>Had your boat her anchor with her? - No, the anchor was cast aside.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see a boat drift with five or six men in her? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. If she had drifted, people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210103"/>might have taken her up ten miles off, or at any distance? - No, they could not without another boat.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a tide surveyor of excise; about twelve in the evening of the 21st of January, near the Half-way-house, near Halfway-reach, between London and Gravesend, laying on the shore with my boat, and another tied to it; we heard a boat rowing against the tide, towards us; we were then on shore; my people pushed off the boat; I was in from the shore; we lay drifting up with the tide till the prisoners in their boat came up to us; there were five persons in their boat; these four and Watts; we boarded them; I asked them where they were going; they said, on a party of pleasure to Erith; I cannot say which of them that said it, I believe all; they seemed to agree to that; I said, they looked like pretty gentlemen for pleasure; and I desired one of the people to rummage the boat, and I found a pistol under the seat where Warner sat; he was the person that sat and did nothing; the other four were rowers; this is the pistol; it was loaded; I have the charge in my pocket; there was a slug, small shot and powder. (Shewn to the Jury.) I saw a gun under the same seat.</p>
               <p>What became of that? - Immediately on my mentioning there was a gun, Watts, who is not here, sat at the bow of the boat, he took it up and threw it overboard.</p>
               <p>Did the other prisoners hear you ask these questions? - Yes, I asked Watts, what he did that for; and I told him it convinced me that they were such persons as I took them to be, fresh water pirates; the other seemed to be angry with him for doing it; while I was talking to him, I asked Warner where he was going, and he then pretended not to be concerned with them; he said, that they took him in; he was a passenger; they all concurred at first that they were going on a party of pleasure; after talking some time together, I asked Warner, where he lived; he said, at London; I asked him where he was going; he said, to Gravesend; I asked him, on board what ship; he said, an East Indiaman; I asked him the name; he paused and said, he could not recollect her name; I asked him the Captain's name; he did not recollect that, but he said, he was going to see a person who was mate of the ship, and he knew where to find him; I asked Bateman where he was going; and he said, he was going on board the Apollo, West Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Was there such a ship? - Yes; I consulted my fellow officers, and we took them into custody; I towed them up to the stern of my boat; taking out their skulls; they had two pair of skulls; nothing more passed, only they cursed and swore in a most reprobate way; I delivered them to the watchman to put them into the cage, and the next morning they all of them changed their dress; they put on fresh clothes, so that they appeared different persons, but I knew them again; I am confident the prisoners are four of the persons; I had the boat locked to one of the King's boats, at St. Catherine's stairs, till the proprietor came to own her; I went down the same day and saw the prosecutor sitting in her; the boat that I saw Williams sitting in, was the same boat we took from the prisoners; the prisoners threatened me at the Justice's, the prisoner Doyle in particular behaved very bad, he declared if he was nigh me four minutes he would have my bloody head off; I did not take notice of the marks of the boat.</p>
               <p>To Williams. Was that boat you was in at St. Catherine's-stairs chained to the King's boat? - It was, it is my boat; Bateman appeared to be worse than all; but he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did you ever see Doyle before the 21st in the evening? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>They were in the habits of seamen, were they not? - They were in long coats.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210104"/>You say you saw the gun in the stern of the boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is usual for people to carry fire arms with them when they go a shooting? - Certainly when they go a shooting, or else they cannot shoot.</p>
               <p>Is it a common thing to carry fire arms in a boat? - Not that I know of, except when they are shooting.</p>
               <p>The pistol you say was underneath the seat where one of the other prisoners sat? - Yes, and the gun likewise; but I forgot to observe that Bateman came and stepped to the after part of the boat and threw something overboard; he said, it was a piece of rope.</p>
               <p>Did Doyle make any resistance? - No, it would have been folly in them to have resisted, for we were well armed.</p>

               <p>Did you see any fire arms in the boat? - I took a lanthorn with a light in it, and searched the stern of the boat, and saw the pistol that Mr. Clarke took out; which is produced here to day.</p>
               <p>Who was sitting in that part of the boat? - I cannot say, one of the prisoners; I saw a gun; as soon as Clarke took the pistol out of the boat's stern, Watts came from forward to the aft, and took up a gun and threw it overboard; I am sure the prisoners are four of the men; we locked the boat to the King's boat at St. Catherines.</p>

               <p>The old man Mash said nothing at all to you about the sheep? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Gifford, I take it for granted, that you kill a good many sheep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not kill any of these? - No.</p>
               <p>You sent them publickly to be sold at Smithfield? - I did, I did not suspect them to be stolen; I have known Kimpton about four months; he keeps a public house, and besides that, collects skins about the country.</p>
               <p>As I understand you, he felt the skins to see what they were worth if he bought them, and then emptied his pockets of two pounds worth of halfpence? - Yes; when he was doing all that, he said do it quickly; it was about four, and he was to return home; he then gave a considerable quantity of halfpence to Mash.</p>
               <p>When the sheep came down, this man Kimpton had a lien upon them for some time for the two pounds? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>During the whole conversation were they not treated as the property of young Mash? - I understood it so.</p>
               <p>So that during the whole transaction they were treated as his sheep? - Certainly, I took Rushin to be the brother of Mash.</p>
               <p>Did not Rushin only appear to be assisting Mash in disposing of his property? - No, Mr. Kimpton said they were two brothers, and I concluded Rushin to be the brother, by his giving me the price of the sheep.</p>
               <p>At what time was it that you met at Muswell-hill? - At half after one.</p>
               <p>During the whole business, did Kimpton act as if they were his sheep? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Kimpton lives directly opposite the work-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there a court yard before his house? - There is; I did not see these sheep there.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not say they were his sheep? - No, I understood by him they were two brothers.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This skettle ground is an open place opposite the house, opposite the work-house? - I believe it is; I did not deliver the sheep to Cook.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher; I live in St. George's market, Oxford-road; I purchased some sheep on Monday was week.</p>
               <p>How many? - Thirteen.</p>
               <p>What kind of sheep? - Little Welch weathers; they were sent home to my house; I killed one, and on Wednesday I sent them home to my Lord's; I delivered them to the drover to take them where they came from; my Lord's steward came to my house, and told me to send them home.</p>
               <p>Strut. I know this witness, I went to his house on Monday, the 13th, at half past ten at night; I found twelve sheep, and one was killed; I went down, and there was a candle, and this little cropt sheep; I saw it, and said that is my Lord's property; I cannot say to the one that is dead; I felt him in the ear without the candle, and I said I am sure it was his sheep; then they brought the candle again, and I looked them over, and I am very positive they are my Lord's property, all of them; they were sent home to my Lord's on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Gifford. You went to my Lord's farm I understand? - I did; I saw the same sheep at my Lord's which I had bought of the man; I had put a mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much did you receive for these sheep? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How much did Carr agree to give for them? - Fifteen shillings a-piece; that is nine pounds fifteen shillings; I kept them from Friday to Sunday in my open yard along with the rest of my sheep.</p>
               <p>Were they bought within ten miles of London? - I do not know how far it is; I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you not know it is not more than five? - I never measured; I do not know; I went on horseback; I do not count the mile stones as I ride.</p>
               <p>I ask you, now, upon your oath, do you believe that it exceeds five miles; do not you know that it is but four miles and a very little bit? - Upon my oath, I do not know how many miles it is; I cannot tell how long I was riding there and coming back.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it is more than four miles and a quarter? - I cannot tell; I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it is ten miles? - I do not imagine it can be ten miles.</p>
               <p>Come, Mr. Gifford, was not you taken up for this yourself? - No, I was not, upon my oath; I was not committed for further examination, I was never in custody of an officer about it.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the prisoner Mash, I shall not call upon him to make any defence, there is no evidence at all to affect him.</p>

               <p>On Monday we proposed to meet at Muswell-hill, between one and two; I could not get my business done, I met Mr. Gifford at three, after that I had a mouthfull, of victualls, then we went down to look at these sheep; when we came to the sheep, they were in a lamb house; Gifford went in, and he said to the prisoner Rushin, what do you ask for ten of them? he said, fifteen shillings, or sixteen shillings; Gifford said, here are ten nice half guineas, I will give you for ten of them; he said, you shall not have them; Gifford came out to me, and said, what do you think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210112"/>these skins are worth? I said, not above eighteen pence a-piece; Rushin took them into the field; he came after us, and asked us to have them; there was no answer made for some considerable time; it was near five before they had done; I was talking to the landlord about this house; I told him I should be very glad to embrace the opportunity to have the house; he put down my name; he said, he should be at the brewhouse on the Monday or Tuesday; I went to my father-in-law to enquire about it, as another person had engaged it, and I was taken on Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Can you tell what day of the week it was? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How long ago was it? - I cannot remember, I saw a man by the fire place in Mr. Johnson's house.</p>
               <p>How came you to see him, where were you? - I was peeping in at the window as I generally do; I live in Church-lane, Whitechapel, with my father; about two in the afternoon, I was going to school, I saw a man putting something in his lap, I could not see what it was.</p>
               <p>What did you see more? - I saw him go on tip-toe to the door, and go into the little back room; then Sir I pulled off my pattens, and went up two pair of stairs to Mrs. Johnson, and asked her whether she had the key of the door; I did not stay a minute with Mrs. Johnson; she run down stairs, and I run after her; I told her there was a man in her room packing up her things; then I went away, I did not see the things so as to be able to know what they were.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the man before? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him since? - I saw him at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that you saw him at the Rotation-office? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when you saw him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you know him if you was to see him now? - Yes.</p>

             was at home, and she asked me to drink some spirits, and handed me a glass; then Cooper came up, and asked me how I did, and said, he had not seen me this month; then he asked the woman how Johnson did, though Johnson was the room door at the same time; I saw him at the door; Cooper asked me again who these things belonged to; I said, to a man at the other end of the town; I took the waistcoat out of the bundle, and threw it on a chan, I took the other things under my arm, and Johnson came in, and pretended to be very drunk, and he looked, d - n you, says he, this is my waistcoat, and he put it on; I thought to go out of the house, and Cooper came before me, and said, d - n it, Johnson, you must try these things on; and they forced these things from under my arm; Cooper laid hold of it first; then they gave me a shove, and forced it from me; Johnson put the waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Did the woman do any thing at this time? - No, she said, they must be mad, or very drunk; that is all she said: then Johnson put on the clothes, and insisted on having his watch, and a looking glass; says he, I am a fine gentleman: and he put his watch in his pocket, and never staid to button his breeches knees, but set off and never returned.</p>
               <p>Who was it that put on this waistcoat? - Johnson.</p>
               <p>Had he put it on before he shoved you or afterwards? - Before.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - When he put on the clothes he made off.</p>
               <p>What did Johnson put on the coat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210126"/>breeches in the presence of Mrs. York? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the other man do? - They both went off.</p>
               <p>Did they go together? - No, Johnson was the first man that went down.</p>
               <p>Did they go off in company? - Cooper went after him; I said, I did not understand being robbed, and I would go for an officer; Mrs. York said, she believed she could find him at Mr. Welch's, at the bottom of Holborn-bars; and Mr. Cooper, at Saffron-hill, Chick-lane. where he lived; she came came out, and I ran after her; she walked out pretty sharp, and she said, she was very sorry that such a thing happened; she came to Mr. Welch's, and I stopped at the door; she went in; Welch said, they had not been there since eleven o'clock; then she went to Chick-lane, and she went up stairs; I did not go in at all; then I went home, and said, I was robbed, and got two men, and went in; I pursued them till eleven at night, and could get no account of them; in the morning I went and took a man with me to the place where I saw the woman; and there was Johnson, and the woman, and a little boy.</p>
               <p>Was Cooper there? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon was this after you lost your things? - It was early the next morning, Sunday; then I took an officer, and went again; it was a long time before we could get in, and Johnson was taken in my presence with the coat and breeches, and the waistcoat on; they were all locked in, and the officer broke open the door, and took them, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Were they committed for the felony? - I do not know what they were committed for.</p>

               <p>Was not that the charge? - That was the very words I told the Justice.</p>
               <p>Then at that time you did not know you had been robbed? - I did indeed; upon my word, I tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Did you take up Cooper? - I did not find him.</p>
               <p>Has he ever been taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Is he under any bail at this moment? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He lived in Chick-lane, and you have seen him a dozen times; upon your oath, have not you said, that you would put him in the indictment to take off his evidence? - Upon my oath I never did.</p>

               <p>Did not he get from that club a sum of money to furnish him with that great coat? - He paid seventeen shillings to the club two years ago.</p>

             a great coat? - Yes; the landlord made off with money, and box and all.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive that money for the coat? - No never.</p>
               <p>Who was to pay for it? - The man that run away, his name is Hadnail; I borrowed half a crown of Johnson, that is all I borrowed of him, upon my oath; I was not in Johnson's debt before these clothes were ordered, he was in mine.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, had not you owed him three guineas for a twelvemonth when he got this coat? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath, last January you was not at all indebted to the prisoner Johnson? - I was not, I was indebted to him the guinea that he gave to me while the coat was doing; he gave me a guinea earnest for the coat, and the woman paid me ten shillings and nine-pence the remainder; the cloth was six shillings a yard, yard-wide, I bought the cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210127"/>Was there any pattern chosen for this coat? - Yes, she agreed; she said, six or eight shillings was no object in the breeches, make the best.</p>
               <p>The prisoner tried the coat, waistcoat, and breeches all on? - Yes, he said I owed him money, and I knew very well that if I left the clothes, he would not pay me; that was what Cooper said, that I owed him some money; Cooper said, that Johnson told him, that I owed him money; Cooper told it to the person that there was money due, Johnson never told me so.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - A person that lives on the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that there was an account between them, and they went to fetch Welch to settle it, because they were ignorant men? - Upon my oath there was no money between Johnson and me at the time; neither of them said any thing of the kind to me; I was to make the clothes without measuring, and to make them to sit Johnson.</p>
               <p>Had not you taken Johnson's measure? - No, not since I took it for the great coat, which was the 17th of January; she told me if I could not make them without the measure, she would buy them ready made, because they were going out of town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. What conversation had you with Burgess about this cloth? - Burgess has lodged with me half a year; he is an acquaintance of theirs: Burgess and he used to wear one anothers clothes, so I said I would take measure of Burgess; I never received any money, but a guinea; I did not owe him any money.</p>
               <p>When did you first think this to be a felony? - I said the very words I said here, and the Justice put it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Were they discharged? - No, they were committed, they were bailed.</p>
               <p>How came you not to get a warrant against Cooper? - I had no warrant against any of them, I only told the officer; I sent an officer after Cooper; I could not not take him; I saw him before this week; he came the other day, but he ran away; I had no officer.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his house in Chick-lane? - No, I never was inside the door; he was not at the house, I was told so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. I can bring witnesses to prove that I never left my house all the time? - I was several times there that night, I could not find them, and in the morning I was there before they were up, that was about seven.</p>
               <p>What o'clock were they taken up? - About a little after one; I had been waiting all the time, they could not go away; they had the door locked, and would not let us come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. Did not I go to your house that night for linen from your wife that washed for me at the same time, and did not you come in and abuse me? - He run in to get the remainder of his things, and I came in, and said, oh, says I, there is one of the robbers that took the clothes from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooper. The prosecutor wanted me to keep out of the way till the trial was over, for he did not want to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - Upon my oath, I never did.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Dailey's house; I remember this coat; Dailey told me that he owed Johnson three guineas.</p>
               <p>Was that before the clothes were sent home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you been present at any time when Johnson has been asking Dailey to make him clothes for the money that he owed him? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did Dailey tell you that he was afraid Johnson would stop the money? - Yes, he did; he mentioned the sum of three guineas, but not at that time; and seventeen shillings, the club money.</p>
               <p>Have you often seen Johnson and Dailey together? - I have; Johnson was always asking Dailey for the clothes, and he promised to make them as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>Dailey. My Lord; I only owed him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make such a declaration? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You never owed him in your life any thing but the half crown? - Nothing but the half crown; and the club money, seventeen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Johnson ever ask you to make any clothes for the money that was owing? - Johnson never asked me for any thing, only for the great coat of the club; that is the coat.</p>
               <p>Did you ever promise any clothes to Johnson from time to time? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did this last witness lodge in your house? - He does at present.</p>
               <p>The prisoners Johnson and York called five witnesses to their character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cooper called one witness to his character.</p>

               <p>"rob any dwelling house in the day time,</p>
               <p>"any persons being therein." Now this term rob implies in itself, necessarily, force and violence, and the construction has always been upon this, as well as upon other acts of Parliament, that though breaking and entering is not mentioned, they are included, and necessarily contained under the term rob: The construction upon this, and on other of parliament of the same nature, has always been so, that that the breaking must be of a dwelling house, in the same way as it is necessary to constitute burglary. The difference is, that offence must be committed in the night time, but this offence is in the day time, and some person to be therein, under this act of parliament. Now in the 13th year of his present Majesty's reign, there happened a case at the Old Bailey, the King against

It appeared, that the owner of the house let the whole of it in apartments to different persons, not inhabiting any part of it himself; Chandler rented a shop, part of the house, and the cellar underneath, at the rent of twelve pounds twelve shillings, but the owner took back from him the cellar, in which he kept lumber, giving him ten shillings a year for it; the entrance was into a passage by a door from the street, and on the side of the passage, a door opened into the shop, another into the parlour, and beyond that a stair-case led to the upper apartment, which shop and parlour was broke open; it was objected this was not the dwelling house of Chandler.

He was apprehended some minutes after, without it appearing he had made any application at the Pay-office, or even gone towards it, or taken any step whatever for obtaining the money made payable thereby. The Jury found him guilty, subject to the opinion of the Judges on this question; whether those circumstances amounted to an endeavour to receive the money of

            , within the true intent and meaning of the act of parliament that I have mentioned. This case has been taken into consideration by all the Judges, and very duly attended to, and it is their unanimous opinion, that the charge is supported by these facts, that it was an endeavour to receive the money of 
               <persName id="o17870221-1-person957">

            , within the true meaning of that statute. This question lays within a very narrow compass: it may be proper to observe the provisions of this statute: First, it provides against forging letters of attorney, authorities, or instruments for transferring stock, or receiving dividends, or forging the names of proprietors in, or to such letters of attorney, authorities, or instruments, or knowingly or fraudulently endeavouring to have such transfer received, by virtue of such forged letters of attorney or instruments: then it comes to the matter before us,</p>
               <p>"if any person shall</p>
               <p>"falsely and deceitfully personate any</p>
               <p>"true and real proprietor of a share in the</p>
               <p>"said stock annuities or dividends, and shall</p>
               <p>"thereby transfer or endeavour to transfer</p>
               <p>"the stock, or receive or endeavour to</p>

               <p>"without benefit of clergy." If the prisoner had received the money, he had accomplished the purpose, and then there could have been no possible doubt; but the act of parliament very sagaciously, and wisely too, provided that no person shall endeavour, or take any steps towards obtaining other person's money in the funds. Now the question was before the Jury, whether these were not unambiguous and unequivocal steps, towards what may be called the endeavour to receive the money? he comes forward; he personates and assumes the name of the real proprietor; he calls himself

The matter has been considered by all the Judges, and they were unanimously of opinion, that this did support the charge in the indictment, and that the prisoner was well convicted.</p>
               <p>There was another case of Moffat; with respect to that case, the Judges think it is fit to consider the matter further; he must remain.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I know not how to express my acknowledgements of your Lordship's goodness to me, as the bad state of my health renders me inadequate sufficiently to express my feelings, and as I think it impossible that any qualities your Lordship can impute to me, can give me such a place in your Lordship's consideration, which I have had the good fortune to receive; I must therefore attribute it to your large and extended benevolence, which has allotted me six weeks time to consider of my dreadful situation. From whatever motive my conduct arose, I beg to assure your Lordship, that I am now really sorry for repelling those tender feelings, which formerly actuated your Lordship, and the worthy Sheriffs; but, I hope that my unfeigned sorrow for such ingratitude will still find compassion: I now assure you, I will receive the offered mercy with the utmost gratitude to my Sovereign, and thanks to the Court and Sheriffs; and I beg liberty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210133"/>to assure the Court, that not withstanding I committed the crime, for which I was justly convicted; yet I can with the greatest propriety clap my hand on my heart, and call heaven to witness, that from the fatal hour of the forgery, I had not the least intention to defraud; but what is infinitely worse, I committed that forgery with a view of terminating thereby my own existence. My Lord, too early in life, I cultivated an attachment for a female friend, and the voice of experience, made no objection to that attachment; how comfortable should I have been, if I could have called her mine, but there was an insurmountable bar in the way, which time only could remove. I was an apprentice, and had part of my time to serve; then the fatal thought entered into my head, to fix on the rash act which I now lament as my greatest evil, and deplore as my sincerest misfortune: I doubt not but my sincere repentance may make me a valuable member of society, would my gracious Sovereign only allow me the indulgence of being joined in union with the object of my attachment, it would take off some part of my heavy distress: Allow me my Lord, so far to presume on your Lordship's goodness, that you will once more lay my case before the Throne, and that some degree of rational expectation may be allowed me to form such a hope; and in the pure feelings of a conscious heart, I solemnly assure your Lordship, that neither time, place, nor circumstances, or any thing short of death, shall ever erase from my mind those feelings of gratitude, and the sincerest thinks, which I owe for the humanity, and kind intercession of your Lordship and the worthy sheriff.</p>
                     <p>Court. I am glad that the mercy of your Sovereign, and the indulgence of the Court, have at length brought you to a proper sense of your duty, and to a becoming state of mind; I hope that that state of mind which has been produced by that mercy, will remain such as to render you hereafter an honest, and if possible, an useful member of society in another country; although the justice and the laws of this will forbid your remaining there. All that rests with me at present, is to declare the condition of the pardon, which his Majesty, has already thought fit to grant you by sparing your life, which was justly forfeited to the injured laws of your country; therefore your having with propriety accepted the mercy of your Sovereign on that condition, it only remains for me to pronounce an order pursuant there to, which is that you be transported for and during your natural life to the Eastern coast of New South Wales.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, I know not how to express my acknowledgements of your Lordship's goodness to me, as the bad state of my health renders me inadequate sufficiently to express my feelings, and as I think it impossible that any qualities your Lordship can impute to me, can give me such a place in your Lordship's consideration, which I have had the good fortune to receive; I must therefore attribute it to your large and extended benevolence, which has allotted me six weeks time to consider of my dreadful situation. From whatever motive my conduct arose, I beg to assure your Lordship, that I am now really sorry for repelling those tender feelings, which formerly actuated your Lordship, and the worthy Sheriffs; but, I hope that my unfeigned sorrow for such ingratitude will still find compassion: I now assure you, I will receive the offered mercy with the utmost gratitude to my Sovereign, and thanks to the Court and Sheriffs; and I beg liberty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210133"/>to assure the Court, that not withstanding I committed the crime, for which I was justly convicted; yet I can with the greatest propriety clap my hand on my heart, and call heaven to witness, that from the fatal hour of the forgery, I had not the least intention to defraud; but what is infinitely worse, I committed that forgery with a view of terminating thereby my own existence. My Lord, too early in life, I cultivated an attachment for a female friend, and the voice of experience, made no objection to that attachment; how comfortable should I have been, if I could have called her mine, but there was an insurmountable bar in the way, which time only could remove. I was an apprentice, and had part of my time to serve; then the fatal thought entered into my head, to fix on the rash act which I now lament as my greatest evil, and deplore as my sincerest misfortune: I doubt not but my sincere repentance may make me a valuable member of society, would my gracious Sovereign only allow me the indulgence of being joined in union with the object of my attachment, it would take off some part of my heavy distress: Allow me my Lord, so far to presume on your Lordship's goodness, that you will once more lay my case before the Throne, and that some degree of rational expectation may be allowed me to form such a hope; and in the pure feelings of a conscious heart, I solemnly assure your Lordship, that neither time, place, nor circumstances, or any thing short of death, shall ever erase from my mind those feelings of gratitude, and the sincerest thinks, which I owe for the humanity, and kind intercession of your Lordship and the worthy sheriff.</p>
                        <p>Court. I am glad that the mercy of your Sovereign, and the indulgence of the Court, have at length brought you to a proper sense of your duty, and to a becoming state of mind; I hope that that state of mind which has been produced by that mercy, will remain such as to render you hereafter an honest, and if possible, an useful member of society in another country; although the justice and the laws of this will forbid your remaining there. All that rests with me at present, is to declare the condition of the pardon, which his Majesty, has already thought fit to grant you by sparing your life, which was justly forfeited to the injured laws of your country; therefore your having with propriety accepted the mercy of your Sovereign on that condition, it only remains for me to pronounce an order pursuant there to, which is that you be transported for and during your natural life to the Eastern coast of New South Wales.</p>
