                  </hi>. I am a corn chandler at 150, Houndsditch—the prisoner called on me about 17th January—I can't swear exactly to the date—he laid a book open on my counter and said, "Will you join your neighbours in subscribing towards the Consumption hospital in Victoria Park?"—I said I had not anything to spare, but would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he stood talking some time and induced me to give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, as he said I should have the privilege of sending two patients to the hospital, and likewise a book published by the society—a little time afterwards I met him coming out of a public-house; that raised my suspicions that it was not altogether correct, and I wrote to the secretary—in consequence of the answer I got, I met with him again, and gave him in custody—I should certainly not have given him the money unless I had believed he was an authorised collector for the hospital—he shewed me a book with various names and a seal attached, authorising him to Collect.</p>

               <p>rather strange for an institution of that sort to send out collectors without; con<lb/>sequently I would not give it to him unless I saw some of my neighbours that had subscribed—I don't know that I said anything about authority—he then said that pretty well all Bishopsgate-street subscribed—I said, "I know Bishopsgate-street pretty well, show me some of their names,"—he then said that he was not allowed to collect in the main streets but in the back streets—I said, "Well, I shall not give you my half-crown; there are many persons going about unauthorised, therefore I shall not give it to you unless you tell me some one you know that I know"—he named several persons, amongst others Mr. Moore, in our street, whom I know well—I said, "I know him well, and if Mr. Moore knows you I will give you my half-crown"—I went with him to Mr. Moore—Mr. Moore said that he knew him, and knew his name to be Elstob—I went back again home with him, gave him my half-crown, and caused him to give me a receipt on a piece of paper which I tendered to him—the officer has it—he told me he was very much obliged to me for speaking about the receipt, and he would speak to the secretary and I have a receipt—I believed him to be an authorised collector—I would not have given him the half-crown unless I had believed it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This is entirely a misunderstanding on the part of these witnesses; there has never been any book different from that, as is evident from the fact that I was collecting at the very time I was given in charge, and that book was with me. There was another book that Mr. Wallis, a friend of mine, had, similar to that: this book was given to these parties at every shop I went into; there are only three here, but there are hundreds of others who can come forward; they had every opportunity of reading it, and it is not likely I should ask any persons to put their names to a thing without they had every opportunity of seeing what it was. I have written and published a work, and I was collecting the publishing expenses by subscription, and intended to give the proceeds of the work between the two Consumptive hospitals. I had a reason for giving it to them, and I will just read this over to you, "For the benefit of the Consumptive hospitals in Victoria Park and Brompton; "that was all they read, and they ran away with the idea that they had subscribed to the Brompton hospital; whereas if they had read the whole they would have seen what they had subscribed to. It says what it was for: "Towards the defraying the expenses of printing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186002270004"/>
               <p>and publishing a work written by Dryden Elstob, for the benefit of these hospitals; to be published by Mr. Cockerell, of Leadenhall-street." He has the manuscript of the work now. "Subscriptions earnestly requested, the profits of which are to be equally divided between the above institutions. "The work is entitled, "John Wolsey's Confessions on the day of the National Humiliation;" a copy free to each subscriber. Thomas Wallis is the only person authorised by me to receive subscriptions, and persons subscribing 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and upwards, may have a copy. The above institutions have no en<lb/>dowment, and the object of the donor is to benefit them—Dryden Elstob, author, and donor." The questions they put to me I answered with respect to my own work. "Are you a collector?" "Yes." They had only read the top line; I meant, "a collector for my work." All the questions they put to me were in relation to my book: it is not likely I should have walked into a person's shop and asked them to enter their name down for anything. It is not likely I should tell them it was something quite different from what was actually before their eyes. There are lots of gentlemen's names in that book that have subscribed pounds; they knew very well what it was for; it was all through their not reading and knowing what they were putting their names down for. The fact is they have subscribed to this work; they might put their name to a bill of exchange in the very same sort of way, and then away afterwards that they did not know they had done it.</p>

               <p>between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I was going up Regent-street, West<lb/>minster, to the pawnbroker's—I heard my husband at that time crying his fish—he gets his living by selling fish about the streets—after I heard him call I went up, as I generally do, to see how he got on with his fish—he swore at me, and said he could not sell them—I only asked him how he was getting on—he did not say anything more after that—I went a little way down the street while he was serving at two places—I thought he was coming back again and I stood at the corner of the street—instead of that he went towards home and I ran after him with the key of the room, which I had—when I overtook him all I said was "You had better take the key if you are going home, because you know where I have got to go back again"—he took the key but never spoke—he then went up Earl-street—he there stopped his barrow—I saw him take something off his barrow and come towards me, but he never spoke—at first I thought it was the little board that he scrapes the fish on, but I could not see—when he came within reach he struck at me and I put up my hands to prevent it—he did not speak then—I did not speak after that; I could not—he struck me in the neck—he only made one blow at me—all I said was that he had better not do that—I felt something stick in my neck—I don't recollect anything more—when I came to myself I was in the doctor's, Mr. Pearce's in Regent-street—I was in a fainting state—they were giving me water—they had bandaged my neck up then—I saw my bonnet—I could not see my neck; the blow was quite behind—my bonnet was stained with the fish, where the knife went through the cap—the bonnet was cut—I did not see anything in the hand of the prisoner—I am blind with the right eye—the prisoner met me face to face, and I turned my head—I turned the eye which was sightless towards him, to prevent him hitting me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—it is my husband's knife.</p>

               <p>—I was passing by Thomas's-brewery, in Westminster, between 7 and 8 o'clock on Saturday night, the 4th February—I there saw the prisoner and the last witness—they were both speaking at different intervals—I walked a few steps and turned round—after doing that I saw the prisoner come from his barrow—he, as I thought, struck her with his fist—he raised his arm—I did not see anything in his hand, but the next moment the prosecutrix cried out that she was stabbed—I went up to her—the prisoner walked away with his barrow—I found the prosecutrix bleeding profusely from her neck—two other men came up and took her to the doctor's, and I went in search of the prisoner—I could not find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer and live at Woolwich—on the 4th of February I was on London Bridge in a recess—the Rifle corps was going along—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket, and the chain was round my neck—when the Rifle corps came I am sure I had my watch in my pocket—while they were passing the prisoner came and stood close to my right side—I had my wife on my left side, and two friends were near me—the prisoner stood with his face towards my face, he was looking right in my face—I heard a click—I put my hand to my pocket and my watch was gone—I said to my wife, "My watch is gone"—as soon as I heard the click the prisoner ran across the bridge—when I spoke to my wife he was not a yard away from me—I said to my wife, "Mistress, that man has got my watch"—as soon as he darted off I followed him as far as I could—a captain or officer connected with the Rifle corps stopped me, and we had a little 1 bit of a scuffle—this happened on the 4th of February, and I was at the Mansion-house on the 13th and saw the prisoner—I am quite positive he is the man—my watch was worth six guineas.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When your attention was first called to him was he not running away <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was standing still—of course I felt flurried and ran after the man—it was when my husband said" That thief has got my watch" that my attention was first called to the prisoner—when my husband said that the prisoner was not close to him—the prisoner was between me and the kerb of London-bridge—I dare say at one time he was within grasp of my husband—when my husband said "That thief has got my watch" the prisoner was nearer to my husband than he was to myself—he was about a yard-and-a-half from me—I was on the other side of my husband—he was on the right side of my husband and I was on his left—he was opposite to me and he was going off away from me—after he ran away his back was towards me, but not when first I saw him nor for a second or two—he did not make a direct run, he walked first—his side face was towards me—I observed his face—his scarf is exactly the same that he had on then but his coat was not buttoned over—I cannot swear whether it is the same coat, but it had a velvet collar—it is very possible it was the same coat—I would not swear whether it is or is not—he had a cap on his head—he had no whiskers—his hair was much the same as it is now—I never saw him before—I saw him nine days afterwards; I saw him first come out of the prison-van—I was just in time to get to the Mansion-house as he got out—I went there to identify him, but I had no thought of seeing him in the van—he was shewn to my husband at the cell—I followed my husband and went on to the cell with him—and I saw the prisoner come out—my husband was not with me when I saw the prisoner get out of the van—I think my husband was with one or two detectives—I did not call his attention to the prisoner.</p>

I am assistant secretary to the asylum at 60, Grace church-street—I have gone carefully through the books of the prisoner; I have them here—I find no entry whatever of the nine guineas, or of the five guineas, which have just been given in evidence—there is an entry of a subscription of one guinea from Mr. Dunlock, September, 1859, paid to Lewis Wood, the collector; but no five guineas, nor nine guineas—there is a book kept with counterfoils of receipts given by the prisoner at the office—I have seen the receipts produced here to day—I have compared them with the proper counterfoils—they do not tally with the books, neither have they come out of them—the number of the receipt given to Captain Dunlock is forty, and the date, 1st February, 1859—the counterfoil is for a different person altogether—the receipt evidently does not come from the book; it is on larger paper—I do not know of any receipt book at the office with paper of this sort—it has been taken from some book that has been in legitimate use at the office at some time, but not at that time—here is the receipt, No. 17, dated 29th November, 1858—that is a receipt of one guinea from J. Lawson—that does not tally with the receipt in the book—both the counterfoils are for subscriptions, not for donations of nine and five guineas, and they are of different sized paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say those receipts are legitimate receipts, that is, they have been in use in the office; are there any counterfoils that will tally with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—there is nothing left in the office with which I can compare those receipts—I have gone carefully through the books—I believe that the old counterfoil books that have been in use for many years are all to be found in the possession of the society—these are taken from a hook of receipts—in the ordinary course the butt, that is the end of the book, would be left—I look at the number of the receipt and then compare it with the number left in the book—I have gone through the books for the whole of the year—I have also invited the prisoner, at the office, to see if he could find a counterfoil of this sum, and he could not—it would be his duty to enter all these receipts in a book—all the entries in this book are in his own hand-writing, but there is no entry of these two sums.</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the detective officers of the City of London—I took the prisoner into custody at Castle Eden, in Durham, on 16th February—I told him I was an officer, and should take him into custody for embezzling sums of money belonging to the Seamen's Orphan Asylum—he said, "I am very sorry; I was in hopes that the committee would have looked over it"—I brought him to London, and his portmanteau, in which I found this pocket-book, containing thirteen blank receipts from a book similar to the receipts which have been produced.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's.</hi> I have only this explanation to offer; the blank receipts which Webb has produced were in the pocket-book as he states, but they have been used by me ever since I have been in the office as secretary, in one way or other. In the end of the year we generally fill thirteen of those receipts, and if there was a dozen or more left they were cut off and used by me as occasion required. I used to go down to the asylum; it was frequently the case that persons in the neighbourhood would subscribe if there was a receipt left for them. I used to leave some receipts there with the matron: persons used to come to the office and say, "Now, I can get you two or three subscriptions if you can give me receipts to give to the people."It would not do for me to enter them in the books, because the money was not received till seven or eight days afterwards, so that it would not have corresponded; I entered them when they were actually received, and that accounts for the discrepancy between</p>

               <p>the dates and numbers which has been alluded to. With respect to the five and nine guineas, I can't say how it has been caused, except that for the last three years I have been an invalid, and I frequently made memoranda of what I did with sums of money I had received, and then took the book to my house in the evening and entered them there, and these very likely escaped my observation. I solemnly protest that I never had two books. Those receipts I carried in my pocket-book, and if there had been any moral guilt attached to the circumstance of giving the receipts, as has been alluded to, and not entering them in the cash-book, it would have been much better if they had been included in my balance in the cash-book, for you will see there was a balance against me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">It appeared from the evidence in this case, that the girl was not taken or enticed from her home by the prisoner; but that being out, she accidentally met him, and then went with him to the theatre, and from there to a coffee-house, where they passed the night.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">intimated that there was great difficulty in saying whether these facts would support the indictment; the meaning of the words,"taking out of the possession of the parents," implied a renunciation of her home, and could hardly refer to a temporary absence with an intention of returning.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that even such a temporary taking away, would be an abduction; the offence of abduction did not depend upon time or distance, but consisted in the withdrawing of the child from the possession of the parent; he referred to the cases of Reg. v. Ames, and Reg. v. Manktelow, in the latter of which it was held that although the girl voluntarily met the man, and went with him, yet the case came within the statute.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">entertained no doubt upon that point, but here the difficulty was whether the taking away was such a removal from the possession of the parent, as would satisfy the statute: whether in fact it was a taking away with an intent that she should not return.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called the attention of the Court to the facts of the case of Reg. v Ames, which he contended were entirely different from those in the present case.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after consulting with the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>, <hi rend="italic">considered it best to take the opinion of the Jury upon the facts, and reserve the case for the consideration of the Court of Appeal. The Jury, in answer to the queries submitted to them by the learned Judge, found, first, that in taking away the girl, the defendant knew it was against the will of the parents; and secondly, that his intention was merely that she should remain from her home for the night, and then that she should return to her parents.</hi>

                  </hi>. I was in the Kingsland-road in the afternoon of 1st February—I saw an omnibus and the deceased was close to it—I saw a cart driven by the prisoner, and when he came opposite to me he commenced flogging the horse with the handle of a whip or stick, and the horse started off at a furious rate—it went on about 40 yards, and the wheel caught the deceased and threw him down—his leg went under the wheel and his head fell on the kerb—the prisoner drove on between the omnibus and the kerb and knocked the truck over—I ran and picked the deceased up—I called a cab and took him to the hospital—he was insensible and I thought he was dead—when I got to the hospital I saw the constable with the prisoner—the omnibus was on the near side of the road—there was nothing between the omnibus and the other side of the road—there was enough room on the off side for the cart to pass—the prisoner did not pull up, he went on at the same rate—after he had knocked the truck over he got about 40 yards be<lb/>yond the truck, and I saw the reins down by the horse's legs—the deceased had been standing alongside of the kerb.</p>

The prisoner was left in my charge by Scott when he went to make some inquiries about this cheque—while Scott was away I asked the prisoner where he got the cheque from, and he said he got it from a man outside—I asked him where the man lived, and he said he saw him in the morning in Bishopsgate-street, at a coffee-shop—I asked him whether he had known the man; he said, "Yes, at Boulogne"—he answered "Boulogne," at once—I went with Scott and the prisoner to Mr. Bateman's, and then I brought the prisoner back in custody to the station—when we came out from Mr. Bateman's we were going on to Bishopsgate-street to the coffee-house—I told him I was going there—that was in consequence of what he had told me of having met the man there—he said, "It is no use going there now, the man's gone"—Scott gave me a coat to search—I found these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in it—I have no recollection of this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I am a timber merchant, and carry on business at 60, Old Broad-street—my former premises were at 35, Sun-street, Bishopsgate—on changing my premises sold some waste paper to Mr. Birkett, of Norton-folgate—at the time I sold it I was not aware that there were any cancelled cheques in the waste papers—I keep an account at the Bank of England—do not know the prisoner at all—these two cheques, which purport to bear my handwriting, are neither of them my writing—did not authorise anybody to draw them—these two cheques of 1852, on Prescott, Grote and Co. are both mine; they are both genuine cancelled. cheques—I bank with them as well as with the Bank of England—I am not at all aware how they came into the possession of the prisoner—I did not know what had become of them—they are the two which fell from between the coats—this note, purporting to be directed to Mr. Ingram, is not a genuine note—this request for the delivery of a cheque book is not my writing—since this investigation, I have discovered that some of the cheques which we were in the habit of making up monthly in packets were missing.</p>

I am a stationer, carrying on business at 27, Norton<lb/>folgate—the prisoner entered my service as errand boy a few days after 17th November last and remained till the time of his being taken into custody—I remember purchasing from Mr. Bateman, in the summer of 1858, some waste paper; account books of every kind—I was not aware when I bought them that there were any cancelled cheques amongst them—since this inquiry I have searched amongst the papers, and have found some cancelled cheques of Mr. Henry Bateman—the papers that I bought are kept in our warehouse behind the premises—we generally put them in bags, but I think these got behind some boards in the shop; I think they were taken out quite lately—the prisoner had access to that warehouse when the papers had to be carried to the paper mills and on other occasions—I received, in December last, from Messrs. Hearn and Company a cheque<lb/>book to be bound—it did not go positively through my hands, but I received it—supposing a volume were sent to my premises to be bound, the prisoner would have an opportunity of access to it in taking it to or fetching it from the binding shop, or in taking it home—it would be his duty to carry volumes in that way to the binding shop.</p>

V.—those which have been produced are two of the missing cheques; they are the first and the last—since we received the book we have kept it under lock and key; no one has access to it but myself and my partners—you can see from the book that the leaf has been torn out—both the cheques must have been torn out after the book was bound.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Turner of 127, Drury-lane—on 16th February a man told me to go to Mr. Mantel's and gave me a key to let myself in—I had been in the habit of going backwards and forwards there for many years—the prisoner was servant there; I found her in bed-she said, "I have got a bad cold and a pain in my back through a fall I had on Saturday, and hurt my back, and the chemist says I am to keep quiet for a few days and I shall be better"—I gave her some gruel and left her to do her work for her—I saw her again next morning; she was still in bed and I gave her more gruel—I went to her again at 7 o'clock that night, and she said, "If I tell you what is the matter will you tell any one?" I said, "No; what is it?" she said, "I have been confined with a baby;" I said, "I could not keep that a secret if it was my own daughter; where is it?" she said, "In my box"—she also said that it was yesterday at dinner time—this conversation was on Friday—I went again next day and saw her—Mr. Mantel afterwards came to town; I told him what was the matter, and next day I took Dr. Thain up to the prisoner's chamber—she denied it to him, and I asked her for the key of her box; she gave it to me and I opened the box in the doctor's presence, lifted out a bundle, and saw a female child.</p>

I am a bricklayer, and live in Henry-street, Kent-street; the prisoner has lived with me as my wife over seven years—we parted about six weeks ago—on Monday, 23d January, just after midnight, I was coming home from my brother's and saw the prisoner sitting on the step of the Sir John Falstaff public-house—she asked me what I had done with my woman; I made her some reply, but the pain that I have under<lb/>gone has caused it to slip my memory—it was not a reply likely to provoke her—I was perfectly sober—some words passed between us, but I cannot recollect them—she was angry; she had been waiting some time for me—I turned back to avoid her; heard a disturbance, and found her quarrelling with another woman who she was jealous of—there was no reason for her jealousy that I know of; I had not been living with her—some words ensued and she rushed at me and stabbed me—I ran to the nearest doctor's shop, and from there was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital, where I have been ever since—I had said nothing about her to the woman she was quarrelling with—I might have told her that she might give her a hiding; I do not know—I said something to the prisoner about her not having pluck enough to hurt her—I was charged once with cutting her head with a chopper, but I did not; I did cut it with a frying pan once when she was very much intoxicated—that was twelve or eighteen months ago—about nine months ago I broke three of her ribs—we have been leading a very wretched life and I thought it was time to part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller of 31, Cranbourne-street, Leicester-square—on 20th January the prisoner came to my shop and offered me a gold chain for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he said he had brought from the Crimea—I tested it—it was inferior gold, and I told him it was a Brummagem chain—I offered him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he went away, came back again and said, will you give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I ultimately gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for what I supposed was the same chain—I put it into the scale and it was the same weight silver, the same</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 137, Blackfriars-road—on 14th January I went to Mr. Harriss', a pawnbroker, in the London-road, to purchase a pair of boots—I saw the prisoner there and a man named De Grussa; they offered a chain in pledge to the pawnbroker's assistant for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but did not purchase it—De Grussa then spoke to me and said it was a beautiful chain; that the prisoner was in distress and wished to dispose of it—that it cost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he wanted 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but did not care whether he pledged or sold it—I said, "Well, if the pawnbroker does not give him what he asks I will give him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it if it is what he represents it to be"—he spoke to the prisoner—they both left the shop together and I with them—the prisoner put the chain in his pocket—I said to De Grussa, "I know your face, and I look to you as the responsible person"—he then interpreted for the prisoner, who took the chain out and wanted 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he then came down to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would not have anythng to do with it—he then said 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Well 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not of so much moment, I will give you that; I have not got the money, will you go with me to get it?"—the prisoner handed the chain to De Grussa, who went with me to Russell's the pawnbroker's to pledge my watch, and the prisoner left us, but afterwards returned and waited outside while I pledged it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the two men then went on before me—I had a sovereign before that, but in my flurry I was short half-a-crown—I said to De Grussa, can you oblige me with half-a crown—he said yes, but I then found I had it—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he went to De Grussa's house, which is a penny ice shop—he went into his parlour and brought out the chain and delivered it to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—I paid him six sovereigns and paid the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the chain is not gold—it is valued at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I pledged my wedding-ring and every little thing I had about me to raise the money—if I had not believed it to be gold I should not have given that price for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Swiss, and keep a shop at 36 1/2, Back<lb/>ford-street, Walworth-road—on the 14th January the prisoner came into my shop—I had not known him before—he spoke in Italian and said that he had a chain for sale—I said "I have got no money to buy a chain; I have got my family to keep"—he said, "Have you got time to come to the jeweller?"—I said, "It is Saturday and I am busy"—he said, "You will do me a charity"—I went with him and the jeweller weighed the chain and said it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him that the prisoner would not take less than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—and from there we went to Harris, the pawnbroker—the prisoner said he that had brought it from Sebastopol, and had been a fortnight in London and was in great distress and did not care whether he sold or pledged it—the prisoner spoke in a foreign language—the pawnbroker offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., than 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and would not offer any more; the prisoner took up the chain to go away, and Mrs. Ingram who was there said, "It is a fine chain, I will have it"—she went outside the door and said to me "I will have it," and the prisoner followed me—I believe the prisoner put the chain in his pocket after the pawnbroker looked at it—the prisoner wanted 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. outside—Mrs. Ingram said, "No, you said 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she agreed to give 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and ultimately pledged her ring and watch and made up the money—the</p>
