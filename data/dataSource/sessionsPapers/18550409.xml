                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 207.) On Saturday, 10th March, I was called by Mr. Kenyon, at a little before 2 o'clock, and saw the prisoners and a man named Alford, who is still at large, in the tap-room—they were quite drunk, and were given into my custody by Mr. Kenyon, who said that he thought they had been drinking his wine and spirits, as they had only had two pints of beer during the day—Redworth said to Shepherd, "You hold your noise, you b——y fool; if you <hi rend="italic">split</hi> we shall be transported"—Shepherd had not spoken, that I am aware of—previous to my putting the handcuffs on he was very violent, and said, "You b——r; if I had got my knife, I would cut your b——y throat"—they were so violent that the third man made his escape—I took them to the station—I cautioned Redworth; I did not tell him that it would be better for him to tell the truth—he told the sergeant that Alford and Shepherd were in the cellar, and that he waited outside and saw them—Shepherd made no reply—they were both handcuffed together—I then went back to Mr. Kenyon's to make further search—Ser<lb/>geant Roadknight came shortly after me—I was searching the premises, and up in a loft, over the skittle ground, I found seven pint and two quart bottles of wine, which I believe was sherry, and two bottles of stout, eleven altogether—they were covered over with a mat—I took them to the station.</p>

I reside at No. 9, St. Ann's-court—I am a japanner—my workshop is at No. 3—no one sleeps there—I locked it up on Tuesday night, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I left all locked, the outer door, the inner door, and a desk—there is a sort of lobby between the outer door and the inner door, which takes you up stairs to another workshop over mine—when you are inside the outer door you may consider you are in the workshop—I rent the one shop; the other was empty—I have the key of the outer door, which locked up all—I left the outer door and the inner door quite secure—I was fetched by the policeman some few minutes after 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning—I went to the workshop—the door was open, the hasp was broken—this is the hasp that was on the outer door—I left it quite secure—when I got in, I found the last witness and another policeman—the prisoners were behind them—the policeman asked me to look about, and see if I could see anything missing—I discovered a quantity of old handles and brass, and these tools were on the floor—the handles and brass had been in drawers in the workshop—this stock and bit had been in the desk—these were in the workshop—they might be about a yard from the entrance—I found Wallace, and Brown, and Summers there—they wished to make acquaintance with me, but I knew nothing of them—they said they came to lodge there—I gave them no permission to come there to lodge—I missed the stock and bit, and a saw from the desk—there was a small drawer, which contained forty or fifty farthings, and they were thrown under the bench—this clock and these brushes are mine—I had left this clock safe the night before, and it was going, and all these brushes were there—they are mine—I went to the workshop the next morning, and</p>

On Wednesday morning, about half-past 1 o'clock, Hurst came down stairs into the yard. with a bundle in her hand, tied up in an apron—she put it on the dust hill, and she directly took it down and put it by the side of her—it contained paint brushes; I suppose about twenty, or two or three more—I heard her ask a little girl that I have the care of, to take them over to Mr. Hull—I went out to her and said the child should not take them—she said to me, "Will you take care of them?"—I said, "No; you had better go and call Mr. Hull yourself, or I will go and call him," and I sent to him, and he came and found the brushes in the yard—I could not say which room Hurst brought the brushes from—it was known then that the other three prisoners were in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 15, Hyde-park-garden On Thursday, 8th March, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking in Kensington-gardens—I had not an outer coat on—my coat was buttoned—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket—it was not visible—I heard persons walking behind me—I did not turn round—one of them came behind me and put his arm round my neck, and put his knee in my back, and bent me back, and I was powerless—while I was in this position they pulled open my coat, tore the button a little, and took hold of my watch chain, and broke the key off in the hole in the waistcoat—the waistcoat was not torn—my watch was taken, and part of the chain, all except the key—they then left me—I could not tell whether there was more than one person—I saw two persons in front of me who were running towards the botanic walk—the robbery had taken place just by the round pond—I saw them running about twenty yards off—I know the prisoners to be the parties who ran away—I swear they are the two men that-ran from me—I saw Williams stopped by Croxford—Baker got away—I had just noticed the prisoners before I was stopped—when Williams was stopped Croxford had my watch, and Williams said now that I had got my property I might let him off—I did not see Baker taken—when I first saw him afterwards he was in custody—that was about half an hour after the occurrence—this is the watch and chain—the watch belongs to my sister, Helen Jane Sandeman—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Dowling. On Saturday afternoon, 17th March, about 3 o'clock, we were walking home together—there was a party of about twelve young men and boys, and three or four of them rushed against my husband, and threw him down—some were larger and some smaller than the prisoner; I call him a young man—after my husband was knocked down, the prisoner came up and struck me here (<hi rend="italic">on the temple</hi>), and cut me; the blow knocked me down—Regan held me down by the arm, while one of his comrades robbed me of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket; it was loose in my pocket—he then ran away, and then Regan let me go, and went off with his comrades—they all ran away—I got up, and found I had lost my 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew Regan well; I had known him about six months—I described him to the police, and next day, Sunday, they showed a man to me, but he was not the right person, and I would not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> against him—I saw Regan after that, every day till he was taken; he used to come to the window every day gambling—a policeman brought him to my door four or five days afterwards; he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of No. 20, Fore-street, Cripplegate. The prisoner was in my service about four months—in consequence of certain matters which had transpired, on 27th Feb. I marked four shillings and a sixpence; I put it in a piece of paper, and put it in my pocket; it remained there till tea time, between 5 and 6 o'clock, when I went up stairs to tea—I left the prisoner in the shop—my other shopman, Mr. George, was up stairs at tea with me, and Mumford, an apprentice—I had on a pair of heavy boots—I had suspected the prisoner for a long time—I went up stairs to the room above, and took off my heavy boots, and came down stairs very lightly, while the prisoner was at tea; I passed the door that was open as he sat at tea, and went down stairs to the shop—I put 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the marked money on the desk, and gave Mr. George the two other marked shillings—Mr. George was then alone in the shop; he had not then been up to tea—I gave George certain directions with reference to the two shillings—I then went up stairs again very lightly, to the room where I had gone before, put on my heavy boots again, and came down just as the prisoner was coming out of the dining room from his tea—he went down to the shop, and I went into the tea room—Mr. George came up about half a minute afterwards, and made some communication to me—I immediately went down stairs, looked on the desk, and there found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said to the prisoner, "Will you walk up stairs with me?"—he said, "Yes," and walked up—we went into the tea room—I shut the door, and said, "Mr. George, Mr. Richard<lb/>son, one of you two is robbing me"—I addressed both of them—I said to Mr. George, "Will you show me the money that you have got in your pocket, whether it is yours, or mine?"—he showed me his money directly—I think it was half a crown, and some coppers; I do not think there were any shillings, or sixpences—none of it was marked—the prisoner then said, "Perhaps you would like to see mine?"—I said, "I should like to see the contents of your pockets"—he pulled out a <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie.</hi> and in that was</p>

                  </hi>. On 27th Feb., Mr. Adams gave me two shillings, and also gave me certain directions—I took a note of whether they were marked or not—I saw that they were marked—as soon as the prisoner came down from tea I gave him a bill to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and likewise gave him the two shillings which Mr. Adams had given to me—I had made out that bill, in consequence of Mr. Adams's directions, before the prisoner came down from tea—I told the prisoner that a customer who was just gone out of the shop had paid it, and I had given the halfpenny in change—I requested him to place the two shillings on the desk—if I had received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a customer, it would be the ordinary course to give it to the prisoner, with the bill, and tell him to put it on the desk—that was done while Mr. Adams was away—the prisoner walked towards the desk—when he got to the desk he asked me whether I had taken any more money while he was up at tea—I said I had not—he said, "Then there is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. here altogether"—I had seen 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the desk five or six minutes previous to my giving him the two shillings—no one else could have taken a shilling away from there, except the prisoner—there was no one else in the house except myself—I then went up and made a communication to Mr. Adams—he went down, and shortly returned with the prisoner—after locking the door, he said to me, "Mr. George, some one has been robbing me; have you any objection to show what money you have? I have missed a shilling since I came up to tea"—I told him I had no objection whatever to take out what money I had, and I did so—the prosecutor looked at it, and said none of them were his—he then asked the prisoner if he would show him what money he had belonging to him—the prisoner took out his purse, and took from one partition money to the amount of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I am not certain to the exact amount, and said he thought that was all he had, but on looking in another part of the purse he discovered two sixpences more—it was a purse with several divisions—the prosecutor looked at them, and said they did not belong to him—the prisoner then said that was all the money he had—the prosecutor then asked him to search his waistcoat pockets, to see whether he had not any there—after a few seconds he drew forth another shilling from his waistcoat pocket, saying, "Oh, I have got another shilling"—the prosecutor looked at that shilling, and said that was the shilling he had lost, and he asked me whether it was not one that he had given me to give to the prisoner—I took it up and looked at it, and said it was the same—the prisoner said that he had changed half a sovereign the night before, and he might have had it in that—the prosecutor asked him where he had changed it—he said he did not know the name of the house—the prosecutor told him if he chose to go out of his house, and never put foot in It any more, he was at liberty to do so, but he was not to stay another minute in the house, if he did he would give him into custody—the prisoner had told me the previous day that he had no change in his pocket less than a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note after paying the washerwoman—that was about 1 o'clock in the afternoon—when Mr. Adams said if he stayed another minute he would give him into custody, he asked to have his box—the prosecutor told him if he remained another minute in the house he would call a policeman, and the prosecutor got up and went out of the room—the prisoner followed him, and he was given into custody.</p>

Bank of England note, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of the Not<lb/>tingham Banking Company—I sealed up the letter with those contents, and addressed it to Messrs. Southey and Co., 30, Parker-street, Lincoln's-inn Fields, London—I posted it myself at Manchester, about half-past 2o'clock in the afternoon—that is before the London mail leaves—I afterwards learnt that that letter had not reached its destination—this is the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that I enclosed (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

On 23rd March I went to Wel<lb/>lington-street, Strand, about 10 o'clock in the morning, with Eady—the prisoner came there about half past 11 o'clock—Eady pointed him out to me—after he had left him, I went across the road, and told him that I was a police officer; that he had changed a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with Mr. Eady, which had been stolen from the Post-office; that it would be necessary for him to go to the Post-office to explain; and I said, "I have no doubt you will be able to explain how it came into your possession"—he replied, "Yes"—he was not dressed as a postman; he was in plain clothes—I asked him his name, and afterwards asked him if he belonged to the Post-office, and he said, u Yes"—I took him to the Post-office—he gave me his address, and I after<lb/>wards went there with Peak.</p>

I obtained this note from the Bank on 22nd March—I traced it through different hands, and at length to Mr. Eady—in consequence of what I learned, I made a communication to inspector Thornton—I saw Thornton on the morning of the 24th, with the prisoner in his custody—I think the prisoner's salary is 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with the addition of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for extra duty—when he was brought in by Thornton, he was asked if he had changed a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Mr. Eady—he saidi yes, he had—he asked to look at the note—it was shown him, and he said., "Yes, that is the note I paid to Mr. Eady"—he was asked where he got it from—he said he picked it up in the Strand, between Holywell-street and Temple-bar, wrapped up in a bit of paper, in company with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and, I understood him to say, twelve sovereigns, but at Bow-street he said four sovereigns and a half—he was asked if there was any letter with it—he said, no; it was wrapped up in a bit of paper, and all that was on the paper was, "With Mr. Medhurst'a compliments"—he said he found it about three days before he paid it to Mr. Eady—he was asked if he had mentioned it io any one, or shown the note to any one—he said, no, he had not; he had been to a coffee-shop for eight mornings after he picked it up, to look at the Supplement of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, to see if it had been advertised—he was asked whether the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was a Bank of England note or a country note—he said he could not tell—he was asked what he had done with it—he said he had paid it to Mr. Thorpe, I think he said, of Jermyn-street—I know Mr. Thorpe; he is a betting man—I accom<lb/>panied Thornton to the prisoners lodgings, and there found three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, a deposit receipt for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a promissory note for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. On 21st March my attention was called to the state of a lad named Samuel Sullock, in Guy's Hospital—as regarded his general health, it was excessively low, and his mental condition was almost idiotic—he had a remarkably idiotic appearance, and had very great diffi<lb/>culty in replying to questions—we endeavoured to elicit whether that state was constitutional, or from his state of health; and whether he had ever had any fits—there were wounds over his legs, and on the abdomen, in different processes of healing; wounds on the hands, and bruises on the left hand particularly; a wound on the nose, and two wounds on the head, which were seen after the head was shaved—the wounds on the legs and body were only skin deep; that on the head had affected all the tissues external to the skull, considerable contusion being around the wounds on the head; the peri<lb/>cranium</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090031"/>
               <p>was separated, as the result of the injury; it ought to have been firmly in contact with the skull—I ascertained that before death, because I was called upon to make an incision, to see whether there was not some matter there—I attended him up to the time of his death, on the 25th; I saw him three or four times a day—I did not discover, during his life, that he was suffering from bronchitis, or from any positive disease—he had no cough that I heard—on the 22nd he rather recovered, and he ate a very good breakfast; but after that we never could get him to take nourishment, and he died on the 25th—I was present when the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made by Dr. Wilsh—all the organs of the body were perfectly healthy, with the exception of the lungs—the lungs were what is generally termed congested, the air cells full of fluid, the tubes of the lungs were inflamed, and obstructed by thick mucus—those are the usual signs of bronchitis—I should say that bronchitis was the primary cause of death—I examined the skull; it was healthy as regards the bone, and diseased as regards the sepa<lb/>ration of the pericranium from the bone—the separation was about two inches in diameter—there was no injury inside the skull, and the brain was perfectly healthy; there was no wound about the body which was sufficient to account for death—they were precisely such wounds as would be inflicted by a blunt instrument, those on the head especially.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Tapper and Son woollen drapers, of No. 74, Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday, 13th Feb., the prisoners came to our shop, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I did not know them before—they asked me to show them some black cloth to make an over coat—I cannot say which spoke first—I showed them several pieces—the tailor especially examined the cloths; I mean Cracknell—he selected the piece, and told me to cut off a quantity sufficient to make a coat—they selected satin for a waistcoat, some doe skin, for trowsers, and some material for trimmings; the articles came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Cracknell told me to pack the parcel up, that he was going into the City, and would call for the parcel on his return—he then left the shop, leaving Jackson there—I packed up the goods, and made out the bill—I gave Jackson the bill, and he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him to write his name on it, and he wrote "J. Smith," and gave the note to me—I asked him for his address, and wrote it myself; it was Bridge-street, Hoxton—there was a number, but I forget it now—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I keep a hosier's shop at No. 16, Jewin-street, and am a niece of the prisoner, Cracknell. On 10th Feb., between 10 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon, Cracknell came to my shop with Jackson—Cracknell said the person with him was going to Australia, and was wanting something in my way—Cracknell went up stairs to see my mother, his sister; she was then on a visit at my hous—while he was up stairs, Jackson purchased some goods; I cannot recollect all of them; there was some hosiery and handkerchiefs; they came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was going to Australia, and what he was purchasing he should be wanting—Cracknell afterwards came down stairs into the shop, and went to Jackson—I put the articles he had purchased into paper, and gave them to Jackson, and he produced what appeared to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Note—I asked him if he had not got change; he said, "No, he had not"—Cracknell was present at the time—I told Eliza Varley, my assistant, to go and get change—she was not gone long—she returned with change—I gave Jackson four sovereigns, and he gave me half a crown; that was in Cracknell's presence—on the following Friday, the note was returned to me by Miss Vickress, marked "forged" all over—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on receiving the note from Miss "Vickress, I went with her and another friend to No. 3, King-street, Commercial-road East, where Cracknell lived—we went in and saw him—I asked him if he could tell me anything of the person that was with him, that gave me the note—he took a written note from his pocket, and said he knew nothing of him any further than he had received this note—this is the note he produced—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, Feb. 13, '55.

               <p>knew nothing further of him, but that that was where he had to take the clothes to; upon that I returned home—in the course of the same afternoon, Cracknell called upon me—he said he was very sorry it had happened; that he had got quite the amount of goods in his possession; and I should not be the loser by the note—he said the goods belonged to the party that came with him, or something to that effect—he then left, and returned again in the evening, and we went to Miss Vickress—I took 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. With me—I gave that to Mr. Vickress, and received this note in exchange—Cracknell and I parted at the door of Mr. Vickress, and went dif<lb/>ferent ways—on the following Monday, I went to Drury-lane in company with a friend named Friend—I went there to receive the money for the note—Monday was the time appointed by this note, and I went in accord<lb/>ance with that suggestion—I found Cracknell there; he was standing at the corner of some street—there was no such place as the Star coffee-house—we walked about for some time; half an hour or more, perhaps—I saw Cracknell and his brother; the brother had a bundle, and there was another man named Lancaster with them—Cracknell said they had been looking for the Star coffee house, and could not find such a place, and he could not do anything further than to give me the clothes—I went with Mr. Friend and them to a public-house, and Cracknell put the clothes in a parcel, and gave them to us—upon receiving the clothes, Mr. Friend drew up this paper for me to give to Cracknell—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Received of Mr. Cracknell, two coats, and two pairs of trowsers, for money due, and if not called for in a fortnight shall become my property.

                  </hi>. I am the niece of Mr. Thomas Vickress, a wine merchant, of No. 45, Aldersgate-street. On 10th Feb. a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was handed to me by the barmaid, in Varley's presence—this is it—I wrote on it, "Markham, No. 16, Jewin-street, 10—2—55"—I placed it in the desk, and handed the change to the barmaid, who passed it to the bar—the note was afterwards paid into the bank with other money, and was afterwards returned to me, stamped "forged," as it is now—I afterwards accompanied Mrs. Markham to King-street, Commercial-road; we found Cracknell there—Mrs. Markham asked him if he knew anything of the party that had given her the note—he said he knew nothing more of him than that he had been working for him, and he believed he was going to Australia; or, he did not know whether he was gone—I said it was strange that he should take a party, of whom he knew nothing, to get a note changed with his niece—he said that he never hesitated in taking money himself from people that he knew nothing of, and never saw again, if it was in the way of busi<lb/>ness—he produced this note, and said that was all he knew of the man; he had received that communication from the party he was working for, and he was to leave the clothes at the Star coffee house.</p>

               <p>of ale and went into the parlour—Jackson came in about five or ten minutes afterwards, and asked if there was a gentleman named Cracknell waiting—I opened the parlour, and showed him in—when I went in they were talking about selling a horse—Cracknell had a horse for sale, belonging to his master, Mr. Matthews, I believe—I followed Jackson into the room, I did not take notice of how they saluted each other—I was ordered to bring in a pint of spiced ale—I went for it, and when I came back they were talking about the sale of a horse—I did not notice the names they called each other—I had nothing to draw my attention in particular to this matter—I cannot tell what it was that Cracknell said about the horse—they could not come to terms about the horse, and they were talking about a suit of clothing—I went in and out once or twice—I cannot tell you everything—I was in there when Cracknell measured Jackson for a suit of clothes—I heard the order given—Cracknell said he would make a suit for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were to be finished on that day week—Jackson said he should be up to market on the Monday, and they were to be brought to my place—they wanted change then for a note, because Jackson was to pay down 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit to Cracknell after he took the measure—Jackson first produced a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I could not give change for that, but I could for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he then produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I brought it out, and told Mrs. Lancaster to go up and get change for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she did, and Jackson followed me out and came to the bar—I got. the pen and ink, and said, "Write your name down," and he put down "Samuel Brown"—Cracknell was not present then, he was in the parlour—I also saw the name of George Groom on the note, above where Jackson wrote—this is the note <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave Jackson change, three sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—Cracknell was in the parlour during-this time—Jackson wrote the name at the bar—Cracknell came out after I gave Jackson the change, and he gave Cracknell a sovereign that he was to have for a deposit, and Cracknell wrote a receipt on a bit of paper, "Received, one sovereign," and he was to have the things made that day week—they had a talk together a bit, and they had another glass of ale, and stopped a quarter of an hour or so at the bar, and then Jackson left—I dare say Cracknell stopped half an hour or three quarters more with me talking—I put the note in my pocket, and when I went to bed I put it up stairs—there was no other note—on the Friday or Saturday afterwards, Cracknell returned to my house—he said, "I under<lb/>stand my niece has been taking a bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, Lancaster, and I hope yours is not the same"—I said, "I hope not, either"—I showed him the note, and he said, "We will go down to the bank with it on Monday morning"—I think this was on Saturday—I was rather uneasy to know whether it was good or bad, and I went down with it myself on the Monday—when I came back, Cracknell was at my place, waiting—"I said, "Cracknell, this is the same as your niece took, a bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he said, "Well, Lancaster, you shall not be the loser, for I will pay you as soon as I can raise the money."—I said, "Do, because I want to pay it away"—which he did; he even pledged his things to make me the money—I was not present when he pledged them, but I have no doubt of it—he paid me the money in three instalments—he looked at the note when I brought it back, and he saw the names on it—he did not make any remark upon them—in the course of the same day I went with Cracknell to Drury-lane, to see if we could find Jackson—Cracknell went to his brother s, in the Strand, to get the clothes—I went with him—he said he had received a letter to take them to the Star coffee house, Drury-lane—he had no bundle when he started—he went</p>

On Monday, 12th Feb., the prisoners came to the shop together, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I did not know either of them before—they conversed together at times—that enabled me to ascertain that Cracknell was a tailor—he asked for beaver cloth to make a great coat—I took some down at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—they both looked at it—Cracknell decided it not to be good enough, so I got others that were better—they decided upon what cloth they would have—took no notice of what they said to each other—they did talk to each other, and they decided to have better cloth, and I cut off the length they required; it was only for one—Cracknell then asked for doeskins for trowsers—I showed them some—they looked at several pieces—there was some conversation between them as to the length they wanted, and they purchased enough for two pairs of trowsers and two vests—Cracknell then said they wanted vestings, and I passed them on to Mr. Grant.</p>

On the evening of 15th March, about 10 o'clock, I went to Mr. Teede's warehouse—I had three empty casks shown to me, and I marked them—they were in the warehouse, and on the following morning I went with Balchin to watch the premises of Mr. Teede, in Bishopsgate-street—I got there about 7 o'clock in the morning, and about</p>

               <p>20 minutes before 8 Fahle came, and drove up a horse and cart to Mr. Teede's premises—I did not see him go in the premises, but go to the rear of them—it is a yard or alley, but no thoroughfare—I did not go up the alley—the cart went up the alley—I remained in view of the top of the alley—the back of Mr. Teede's premises open into that alley—Fahle came out again in about ten minutes—he had the cart with him, and two hogsheads in it—I could not see where he got them from—the alley goes from Bishopsgate-street into the yard, and turns to the left, so that I could not see where he went to—it is at the back of the warehouse—I still watched the top of the alley—when he came out with his cart, he went towards Bishopsgate Church—he stopped at Mr. Barker's public house, and I saw Good come to him and join him—it is about two minutes walk from Mr. Teede's—I saw where Good came from; he came from the premises of Mr. Teede—Fahle got up the alley first, and when he got to the public house Good came behind—I saw them speak together, and they went into the public house—Good came out of the public house and returned to the warehouse, and Fahle drove on to Cannon-street—I and Balchin followed him—I there saw Telchader with his pony truck—he backed up to the cart—it did not stop at any particular house; it was in the open street—I saw Telchader and Fahle together shove a hogshead from the cart on to the truck—Telchader drove the truck to Union-street—I and Balchin followed him—we left Fahle altogether—Tel<lb/>chader went to Ryall's house, No. 29, Union-street, with the truck, and Ryall came out and took the two bags into the shop—the bags were in the hogshead, and Telchader pulled the cask over, and assisted Ryall with the two bags—the cask was not taken off the truck, but merely tipped over by Telchader, and he took out the bags, and helped Ryall with them—he took them in front of him and carried them into the shop—it is a sweet stuff shop—Ryall was inside the shop when the truck came up—I was not near enough to hear whether anything was said before Ryall came out—Telcha<lb/>der drove away, and Balchin went and brought him back—I was in at Ryall's at the time—I went in as soon as Ryall took the two bags in—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "Waste," or "Dirty sugar"—I believe the word was "Dirty sugar"—I told him I must take him into cus<lb/>tody for receiving that, knowing it to be stolen—he said he had not bought it nor paid for it, or words to that effect—the bags were not open at that time—they were tied up.</p>

On the morning of the 16th March I accompanied the last witness to the premises—I got there between 7 and 8 o'clock—I watched, and saw the cart go in—Fahle was driving it—I saw it come out, and the two casks—I saw Good come from the rear of his master's premises, and join Fahle at the public house; they went in, and remained three or four minutes—they came out together, and were in conversation a short time—Good then left, and went back to his master's—I followed the cart to Cannon-street—I saw Telchader with the pony truck; I saw the cask transferred from the cart to the pony truck—Fahle and Telchader were in conversation a short time after the removal—they appeared to be in conversation before the hogshead was removed from the cart to the truck, but I was not close enough to hear—I saw Telchader drive to Ryall's, and Ryall came out and took the sugar in—I went after Telchader, and stopped him when he had got ten or a dozen yards—I asked him what he had taken into the shop—he appeared confused at first, and said he did not know, and almost directly afterwards he said he thought it was dirty sugar—he afterwards said he was employed to carry it, for which he was to have one shilling; that was, perhaps, a minute afterwards;</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I went out of town on the Tuesday morning—I had given instructions to the police on the previous day—I came home on the Friday evening—on Saturday morning a policeman called, and requested me to go to the Mansion-house—I went there and saw two gunney bags of sugar—these samples are the same description of sugar that was in them—I have been in business almost fifty years—I consider that I am well acquainted with sugar—this sugar is certainly not scrapings of casks—it is clear from a hogshead—such as this could not be scraped from a hogshead—this is foreign sugar—the sugar melted in this country would be quite different to this—I had a hogshead of sugar in my ware-house precisely of the same description as this—I took a sample of it with me to the Mansion-house, and I found that it exactly corresponded with that in the bags—I have the samples here—this sample was from the bags, and this was from the hogshead—in my judgment they exactly correspond—I believe them to be from the same hogshead—there is a peculiar smell about this sugar that I know it by—the smell is very much gone off from the small sample—the sugars that come from Porto Rico have this smell—I have not detected it in any other—we never put sugar loose into gunney bags—there is a small kind of bag used which comes from the Mauritius—we pack parcels in gunney bags, but do not pack sugar loose in them—here is a gunney bag which has been in wear for some time—the hogshead from which I believe the sugar was taken did not come from the Docks till the Wednesday evening while I was absent—I have the Dock weight of that hogshead—these hogsheads are not always full—they are subject to drainage—they do not waste 200 lbs.—they are usually full—when I came back I examined this hogshead—I directed it to be weighed—supposing it had been a full, and making every allowance for drainage, there could not have been a deficiency of from 2 cwt. to 21/2 cwt.—the hogshead was nearly empty—th e weight of it from the Dock was 103/4 cwt.—from my knowledge of these hogsheads it would have held about 91/2 cwt. or 10 cwt., but that would depend on the quality of the sugar put in it—it would have contained from 9 to 10 cwt. of this very kind of sugar—when I saw it on the Saturday morning it was three parts empty—there was rather over 4 cwt. and 12 lb. including the weight of the cask, which would weigh about 1 cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bryan's Defence.</hi> At a quarter before 7 o'clock that morning I left home; I had slept with my parents; I went to the coffee shop, and saw Redman and Thompson having their breakfast; when I had been there about a quarter of an hour a man with a shining coat came in, and said, "I have got twenty-one shillings and sixpence in copper; if you will give me a sove<lb/>reign you shall have them," and Thompson gave it him; I then got up to buy some tobacco, and the man said he had some very good cigars; I gave him half a crown for two half dozen; I showed him this coin; he said, "I have not got any other; you can easily pass it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson's Defence.</hi> I think it very hard; this officer says he saw us get out of the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and the prosecutor says he lost about 18 lbs. of cigars, and they would half fill the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and the officer must have seen them; we could not conceal all those cigars and this coin without its being seen.</p>

               <p>with Charles Oldham. The prisoner was our clerk—on 31st Oct. we had a bond for Turkish scrip left at our office—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was kept by the prisoner—this entry is in his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Oct. 31. 2,000 new Turks, for J. Rigg")—on 2nd Nov. I asked the prisoner for the four bonds, and afterwards, on the 14th, I discovered that there were not four—I had kept them in my desk in the mean time, and had kept the key—when I missed one it was half past 5 o'clock at night, and the prisoner had gone—I said to him next morning, "We have missed a Turk"—he said, "Oh, indeed!"—I said, "It must be found at once"—he said nothing, but tried to go out of the office, and then I challenged him, and said that I sus<lb/>pected him—he denied it, and tried to go—I said that he should not go until it was found—he said that he thought he could get it by applying to a man named Beach—my partner and myself set out with him there, and when we had got a few yards, I saw him speaking to my partner, who then said, in the prisoner's hearing, "Baker has confessed it all"—we then returned to the office—he persisted that Beach had got it, and my partner went with him, but I did not—they came back, and said that Mr. Beach was not within, but would be at 2 o'clock—at 2 o'clock I and Mr. Phillips were going to see Mr. Beach with the prisoner, and he escaped—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing—we received them—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Pray, for God's sake, have one day's patience; give me to-day, and to-morrow until 1 o'clock, and I will settle it, or blow my brains out. R. B." "The business is all mine; Beach is only a name. There is a Mr. Beach, a friend of mine, but he is as innocent as an angel. He has promised to advance me moneys to buy a Turk, and he will in a few days, if you do not go and tell him, although <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have told him my position. If you do go and tell him, I shall not get one penny. For mercy's sake, say, <hi rend="italic">will you give me time.</hi> only a little time to put the Turk right. If I am deprived of my liberty I can do nothing towards this matter; but, if free, I can do all. I do not want to go away; but if I must, I shall do so effectually. I know your high posi<lb/>tion, your views of justice. If you will give your word that you will not have me arrested until some day which you may name, Friday or Saturday, I will freely devote myself to doing justice to you to the best of my ability; but, if this is not granted me, I leave you to conjecture how I am to act for life's sake. Send me word by bearer what you will do. I will freely speak about the Turk as soon as I can do so without danger; but I cannot <hi rend="italic">write</hi> about it, as you will see.

From him—I put it to his credit, and am ready to account for it at any time; it was not under protest—blank cheques were not constantly left in your pos<lb/>session by my partner, that I know of.</p>

               <p>what time it was that he ceased to reside there with the Lamberts; I think it was about ten days before the 7th, a few days after Christimas—I knew the prisoner by the name of Mr. Burinelli—I do not know whether he followed any occupation; I heard that he was a tailor—on Sunday morning, 7th Jan., I was at the house in Foley-place—at that time Mr. and Mrs. Lambert were living in the house—they occupied the ground floor, the dining room floor—they lived in the front room, and slept in the back room—no one occupied the floor above that; there was a Mrs. Williamson in the house—she occupied the same room as Mr. and Mrs. Lambert in the day, but her bedroom was at the top of the house, the back room—she was in the house on the morning of 7th Jan.—about 9 o'clock on that morning I heard a ring at the bell—I came up from the kitchen to open the door and let in Mr. Burinelli—he asked me where Mr. Lambert was—I said, "Not up"—he then said, "Where is Mrs. Lambert?"—I said, "Not up"—he then said, "Where is Mrs. Williamson?"—I said, "Not up"—he then gave me his great coat and a parcel, and told me to take it down stairs into the kitchen—I took the great coat down stairs—as I was going down the stairs I heard the report of pistols; I heard two reports—I should think there was an interval of not more than a minute or two between the two reports; it was very quick—on hearing the discharge of the first pistol I turned to come up stairs, and the second discharge took place before I got to the top of the kitchen stairs—when I got to the top of the kitchen stairs I saw Mrs. Lambert—I did not see the prisoner at that time—Mrs. Lambert was bleeding from wounds on her arm and neck—she told me that Mr. Burinelli had killed her husband, and had shot her, and desired me to go immediately for a policeman—I went and fetched Sergeant Hayes—I afterwards saw the prisoner carried away from the house on a stretcher by the police—I never slept in the house in Newman-street; I used to do needlework, and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> backwards and forwards—I did not know that any intimacy existed between the prisoner and Mrs. Williamson, either at Newman-street or Foley-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I had been living with Mr. Latham, as his wife, for fourteen years, before this unhappy event occurred; we passed as Mr. and Mrs. Lambert—before we went to live in Foley-place, we lived in Newman-street; we occupied the upper part of the house—the prisoner lived in that house, I think for five or six weeks; he was an acquaintance of Mr. Lambert's for five years—he had been some time in the country, but I should think he had been in London about four or five months altogether, with the time he was in the hospital, and the time he was at our house—I do not know how long he was in the hospital; it was the Middlesex Hospital—when he came from there, he came to live with us in Newman-street; he was an inmate of ours, and associated with us as part of the family—we allowed him to take his meals with us, and he hired a bed room in the house—he continued in Newman-street till we moved to Foley-place, and he moved with us—Mrs. Williamson was lodging in Newman-street, not as part of our family, she had her own apartment—she is a milliner—she also moved to Foley-place when we moved—in Foley-place, Mrs. Williamson slept in the upper back room, and I and Mr. Lambert slept in the back parlour, on the ground floor—the prisoner slept on the second floor—for about a fortnight he slept in the next room to</p>

               <p>Mrs. Williamson, on the third floor; but then he removed down on the second floor—there are four rooms on the upper floor—the prisoner left the house on 28th Dec.—I believe he is by trade a tailor; he had not much to support himself during the time I knew him; but Mr. Lambert allowed him to live there, and gave him what he could afford to give him, which I think was about three shillings a week—he was always an idle, lazy man, I believe; he would never do, any thing—the reason of his moving from the upper room to the lower one was this; as we gave him his room for nothing we did not charge him for it, and the room on the second floor we thought we could not let to any one else, and as we gave him his room we thought he might as well sleep in the room which we could not let to any other person—he ceased to live there on 28th Dec., by the desire of Mrs. Williamson, wishing that he should not continue there—I had not the least idea that any intimacy had arisen between him and Mrs. Wil<lb/>liamson, not until after he was gone from the house—it was Mrs. Wil<lb/>liamson's desire that he should leave; Mr. Lambert was the one that mentioned it to the prisoner—after he left he did not come to the house for any purpose until the morning in question; but he sent a little boy twice with two letters to Mrs. Williamson—I did not know that little boy—I believe he did not wait for an answer—that was all the com<lb/>munication he had with the house after he left, to my knowledge—on Sunday morning, 7th Jan., I was sleeping in my bed room on the ground floor—Mr. Lambert was in bed with me—our bed room door was not fastened inside—I was awake when Burinelli entered the room; I had been awake some time—I heard the ring at the bell, and heard the door open, and heard him speaking to Mrs. De Beaux—I did not hear her go down stairs—I saw him enter our room—the bed was just behind the door; the door opened on the left hand, and the bed was on the left hand side—a person coming into the room, if he walked straight from the door would get to one side of the bed—that was the side on which Mr. Lam<lb/>bert slept—when the prisoner opened the door and came into the room I saw that he had a pistol in his hand; I only saw one, be had the other hand behind him—he said, "Mr. Lambert, Mr. Lambert! "and instantly shot him—he was quite asleep—the prisoner was well aware that Mr. Lambert slept very sound, and always laid till late in the morning—he died instantly upon receiving the shot—I at first pulled the clothes over my head, and then I jumped out of bed and ran round to see if I could get hold of the other pistol—I went towards the prisoner—I saw him change the pistol he had discharged into the other hand, and take the loaded one into his right hand—he did not say anything to me as I approached him; when I got quite close, going to take the pistol, he in<lb/>stantly fired—he was standing close by the wardrobe, about one or two steps from where he shot Mr. Lambert, and he was coming towards me—he was holding his arm up, with the pistol in his hand; I saw him raise his arm—the ball of the second pistol took effect in my arm and neck, and I am still labouring under the effects of that ball—the prisoner instantly left the room, and went up stairs—I cannot tell whether I fell or not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lambert and the prisoner, only when he was saying good bye and he was leaving the house—I never heard Mr. Lambert communicate to the prisoner any complaint that Mrs. Williamson had made—Mrs. Williamson and I were in partnership together in business—at the time the prisoner left I was not in the least aware of any improper intimacy between himself and Mrs. Williamson—I cannot tell whether Mr. Lambert was aware of it—he never communicated to me anything that Mrs. Williamson had said—I am not aware whether he knew of the intimacy or not—I was present when the settlement took place about the money, and the balance was given to the prisoner, it was in the evening, when he went away—Mr. Lambert reckoned it up, because Mr. Burinelli wished to pay for a fortnight's board while he was in Foley-place, and a fortnight's lodging for a room, but previous to that, during the time we were in Foley-place, he did not pay anything for his food or his room, only the last fortnight.</p>

"and he said, "Last Thursday week"—he spoke in broken English—I searched his lodging on that same day, about 12 o'clock, and found a carpet bag, contain<lb/>ing wearing apparel and some letters; I gave them to Mr. Jarman, the clerk of the treasury—this piece of paper was round the two letters—I did not find any books—there was one parcel of books in the carpet bag; they were printed books; I have them here—Sergeant Smith found them; I was present when he found them—there was also another parcel of books found in the pocket of his great coat, which was given to Sergeant Smith by the servant—there was a memorandum book among them—I found the letters on a table under two books; they were folded and directed, and this memorandum was wrapped round them.</p>

I said, "I think it would be better"—he then said, "I will go," and he went up stairs, and got his bag to go—he said he wished to speak to me alone, and Mr. and Mrs. Lambert left the room for a minute or two—I do not remember when Mrs. Lambert came in, but when he expressed a wish to speak to me alone, she was there—after Mr. and Mrs. Lambert left the room, the prisoner asked me to meet him, and I refused—he did not mention any place or time—he had some money, which he offered to give me, but I would not take it, and he then left—when I spoke to Mr. Lambert about the prisoner, I gave him a reason for wishing him to go—I was on the ground floor, and Mr. Lambert called me into the bed room, and asked me what made me so unhappy; that was the beginning of it—he had noticed that I appeared unhappy, and asked me that question—he guessed the cause, and I said, "I think it would be better if Burinelli could leave the house"—I told him I thought I was pregnant by the prisoner—it was directly after that, that the interview between Mr. Lambert and the prisoner took place—Mr. Lambert seemed astonished at receiving this communication from me—the prisoner was in the parlour, on the ground floor, at the time—Mr. Lambert said he would protect me, and he went into the other room, and ordered Mr. Burinelli out of the house—I remained in the bed room, whilst Mr. Lambert went into the parlour, until I was called in—I heard their voices in conversation in the interval, but I could not detect the words—I never saw Burinelli after he left that day, until I saw him after he was shot—I received two letters from him; I showed them to Mr. Lambert; I did not send any answers to them—I gave them to Mr. Lambert—one I threw away, and the other was burnt—I never received but those two letters from him in my life—the first letter was wanting me to go out; I forget the exact words of it—he said that he held my honour in his hands, and it was my duty to go out and see him, and he begged I should do so—I sent no answer to that letter—the first letter came, I think, on the Tuesday, and the second on the following Saturday; that was begging me to meet him at All Souls' church, in Regent-street, that evening, from 8 till 10 o'clock, and stating that he was going to Paris—I</p>

               <p>do not remember whether the second letter alluded to the fact of my not having sent any answer, or taken any notice of the first; I think not—about an hour before that letter came, an apprentice that I had, saw him in Foley-place, and he inquired of her how I was, and said he was going to Paris, but I received no other communication from him than those two letters—they were written in affectionate terms—on the Sunday morning in question, I was asleep in my room, and was awoke by a noise proceeding from the lower part of the house—my apprentice was sleeping with me at the time—my door was fastened inside—I heard some person ascend the stairs, and then try to open the door of my room—I called out, "Who's there? "the answer was, "Open the door; open the door"—I asked, "Who is it?"—I did not recognise the prisoner's voice at all; he seemed so agitated—he answered, "It is Luigi Burinelli"—hearing the noise previously, I thought something was wrong, and I said, "Where is Mr. Lambert?" he said, "Dead," and I think he said that he was his assassin, but I am not sure—he then went into the adjoining room—I heard the window thrown up, and I ran across my room, and looked out of the window, and I immediately heard the discharge of fire arms—my window looks out the same way as the window which was opened—I did not see anybody when I looked out of the window—I did not go into the room—the policeman came up and said, "Open the door; "when I opened my door, I had a view of the room into which Burinelli had gone—I then saw him lying on the floor, and bleeding from a wound in his face.</p>

               <p>not remember the precise month, as valet and butler—he continued in my service, as far as I recollect, about five or six months; in fact he hardly entered my service; but he was so strongly recommended to me that I took him into the house under the expectation that I should part with a servant who was then with me, but I did not part with that servant—whilst the prisoner was in my service his conduct was perfectly good, as far as I knew—I had to go off to Scotland myself shortly after he came into the house, and was absent for a considerable time, but I never heard a complaint, or anything but good of him; he was a universal favourite in the family, and among the other servants—he had a wife, as we afterwards found out—we were not aware when he first came to the house that he had a wife, but she died during the period that he staid with us—that circumstance threw him into the most exaggerated grief, he appeared quite inconsolable for days; nothing but weeping and agitation, unable to do any service whatever—my servant, Gitano, did not quit me; he went with me to Scotland, with a portion of my family, and the prisoner remained with the rest in London—the only reason of his not continuing with me was that I did not require him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and reside at Penshurst, in Kent, near Tunbridge. The prisoner came to Penshurst about April, 1851—he began to work for me at the latter end of April, 1851—he continued in my employment up to about March or April, 1854—he behaved himself remarkably well during that time; his manners were those of a very quiet, sober, steady, inoffensive person—I believe his associates were all fond of his company—he had married a woman of Penshurst; she died in childbed—that produced a change in him; he appeared to be under great depression of spirits and melancholy—that was in 1854, about the beginning of the year—it was about Jan. or Feb. that his wife died, to the best of my re<lb/>collection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any particular idea seem to haunt him at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing further than seeming so melancholy; he used to say, "Oh, dear! I shall die," and words to that effect—he was so ill then from the fistula that he could not work—I used to say to him, nonsense; not to be labouring under such impressions—that did not produce any particular effect—I do not know exactly how long that state of mind lasted—I believe there are witnesses who do—it began, I should say, soon after his wife died, and he was ill, I believe, till he came to London—I believe that was in the summer of 1854—I did not form any opinion as to the state of his mind at that time, but I thought he was very strange, and he appeared more so after he lost his wife; in fact, I did not see anything before he lost his wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he any idea about anything coming from his wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He used to say that his motions passed through it—I never heard him say anything about his bed being wet; it never was wet that I saw—at the time he went away he said, "Oh, Mr. Cook, I will be no more trouble to you;" I said, "Nonsense, Louis"—I did not wish him to go away—he started out at the door; I went with him, and we had not got many yards away, before he said, "Mr. Cook, I am no more trouble to you, I will throw myself in some river," and he continued crying for nearly half a mile where we went—I told him not to put himself out of the way, that if he wished to leave, he might go the next day—I very much wished him to come back that night, but I could not persuade him to come back—he cried loudly, and some persons heard him as we went along.</p>

I am gardener to Mrs. Stratfield, of Penshurst—I have known the prisoner about four years—I remember his marrying and coming to Penshurst—I also remember the death of his wife in childbed—I noticed a very great change in him after that event—before his wife died, he seemed a very respectable man, and a man very much respected in Penshurst by everybody, and after his wife died, he appeared quite an altered man altogether; his mind seemed very much bewildered—he did not appear to be in one state of mind two hours together, and expressed himself in that sort of way that he wished to die, and he did on one occasion ask me to shoot him—I did not hold with him in anything of the sort, but tried to persuade him different, but he never would hear anything that I had got to say—he appeared to listen at the time, but in a short time I saw by what he said that he did not listen to me—he appeared to give attention at the time, but afterwards he would make some speech by which I was certain he did not, which showed that he had not been attending—I remember on one occasion I was reading a book; I cannot recollect now what book it was, but it spoke of a man shooting himself and he said, "I think that is the best way, if anybody wants to die, to shoot himself—when he was under Mr. Valler's hands, he was receiving medicine from him, and he had formed the idea that Mr. Valler wanted to poison him with the physic, and the medicine that he brought him he poured into a saucer, and put a halfpenny into it to test it; it turned the halfpenny bright, and by that he said he proved that the medicine was poison; but still he kept going to Mr. Valler, and brought home I do not know how many bottles afterwards—I do not know whether it was the same sort of medicine, but by its appearance it was—I heard of this event by the newspapers.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090070"/>
               <p>about being operated upon, and had some difficulty in getting him to consent—after the operation, during the time of the healing of this little wound, he became very impatient, and very violent, and very irritable, and really, eventually, unmanageable—I applied dressings and bandages to the wound, and every day or every night I found that he had removed them, and not only had he removed them and torn them away, but he had been pulling himself about, so that he broke any little adhesions that might have taken place, and thus prevented the wound from healing properly—the wound was not likely to produce much pain; some degree of soreness, but not pain—the operation produced pain, but not else—the consequence of his tearing away the bandages, was, that it prevented the wound from healing as well as it would have done otherwise, and also protracted the healing—he still continued very violent and unmanageable after that, and ungovernable—the people in the house were exceedingly kind and attentive to him, remarkably so—I believe they did for a time pacify him and keep him in order, but he would break out again precisely in the same way—he after<lb/>wards went away from Penshurst—I should mention that he had a strange delusion with regard to this, that his water passed through this tistulous opening, which was perfectly absurd, because, before he left me, the wound was healed, and under any circumstances it would have been ridiculous—I considered that to be an utter mental delusion, quite so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean, you did not put your knife further in the second operation than the wound for the opening of the abscess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do so—I put the knife into the rectum, as far as I thought the fistula ex<lb/>tended, and then drew the knife out, opening the fistula.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the proper thing would be to introduce some<lb/>thing to make it adhere? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A piece of lint—the ordinary operations of nature would interfere with that to a certain extent—that would not keep up a certain extent of irritation and pain, because if the lint was properly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090071"/>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Surely when an operation of. nature takes place, it must affect a wound so circumstanced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not if the lint is well introduced—an exudation from the body would touch the lint, but not remove it—it would be a source of irritation to a nervous person—he appeared to labour under the notion that his urine came by the wound—he tore off the bandages, and so retarded his cure and aggravated his own sufferings—patients are very frequently irritable, and impatient under pain, but he was unusually so—he was very much depressed in mind by the loss of his wife, and was then brought down still lower by this attack of disease; he was not in a good state to sustain an attack of this kind—I said that his mind was unsettled for this reason, that I found he was complaining again and again to me of this extraordinary and unfounded delusion with regard to his passing his urine in this manner; that was the reason—he was under my care altogether, I think about three weeks or a month, and then I lost sight of him; I think he was at Simmonds's part of the time I was attending him—I do not think he went anywhere else at Penshurst after that—I think he then came to London; he did not appear to be in better spirits when he left, he appeared very much the same—I do not think I saw him for a fortnight before he left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The witness speaks of more than one operation; was that the case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the first operation was upon the abscess, the next was the operation for the fistula, and at the same time removing a couple of small piles—T think it was the day after opening the abscess that I operated for the fistula—there was no further operation as far as cutting was con<lb/>cerned; there was the dressing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and am assistant surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—I remember the prisoner's admission to that institu<lb/>tion; I referred to the book, and found that it was on 17th Aug.—I visited him almost immediately after his admission, either the same day or the day after—I found him exceedingly depressed—he had the remains of a small fistula; it was so trifling that it could hardly be said to exist—I asked him to allow me to look at it—he became exceedingly excited when the subject was mentioned, and showed great terror of an examination, or of anything being done that could at all give him pain—I observed great irritability about him when I first saw him, great excitability and extreme depression—I found the remains of a fistula, a very small sore which had not healed—I divided a very little bit of skin that was there—I told him that his complaint was exceedingly trifling, and that he would get well immediately; in fact, that there was no occasion for his having come into the hospital; upon that he put up his hands, in an entreating manner, and exclaimed in broken English, "My fistule, my fistule!"—I think the next time I saw him he stated that his water was in the habit of passing through this fistula—I made a very careful examination on that head, and there was not the least ground for it—I examined him repeatedly, on subsequent days, and reasoned with him, and showed him that it could not possibly be the case; I passed an instrument into his bladder, and showed him in every way that it was an impossibility—what I said did not appear to have any effect upon him; and I saw subsequently, more clearly, that it produced no effect upon him, when he became an out patient—he left the hospital on 2nd Sept., that was when the cholera patients were admitted—he left in consequence of our requiring the beds for cholera patients; he then became an out<lb/>patient—whilst he was an out-patient he had no bodily ailment—he was cured of his bodily ailment—whenever he came he stated that his water passed through the fistula—I took a great deal of pains, in consequence of his melancholy condition, and his apparently friendless condition, to show him that it was absurd; but you might as well have talked to a stone wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having observed the prisoner for this length of time, what was your opinion, as a medical man, as to his mental condition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could have no doubt that he was not of sound mind—from that circumstance I formed an opinion as to his power of judgment; he had no power of judging, and believed in the existence of that which was an absurdity, which did not exist—there was, no doubt, the existence of mental delusion—I saw him afterwards in the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your opinion of the unsoundness of his mind is based entirely upon that fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not entirely, but also from his exceeding depression and melancholy, and from the circumstance that I never could get any connected story from him; I never could get from him any account of how he came to suffer from fistula, who had operated upon him, or any intelligible account at any time—his mind seemed incapable of connecting his ideas together—he was exceedingly depressed—he said very little about his thinking that he had been unskilfully treated by the surgeon who had operated upon him—I have an impression that he said something of the land when first I saw him—I wrote to Mr. Valler, after the crime was com<lb/>mitted, when I found who it was—I felt persuaded that it was my duty to say that which I knew, therefore I wrote to Mr. Valler—the prisoner told me, in answer to the question, that Mr. Valler had operated upon him—he did not say he did not think it was skilfully performed—I said, when he first entered the hospital, my impression was that he spoke of his fistula, that it had been operated upon and no good had been done by it; but the question as to who had operateded upon him, was put recently, when in the hospital with, his wound, and I then asked him who had operated upon him—he was not suffering under piles when he first came in—I am positive there were not piles; fistula is a disease which frequently returns—I know that when I last saw him he was not suffering under fistula, when I last examined him—that was just previous to the murder—I have not seen him since in Newgate.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I have devoted myself for a great number of years to the question of insanity—I am afraid for more than thirty years—for the last sixteen years, I may say, I have given my attention exclusively to the subject of insanity, at least, I practice exclusively in that department of medicine—I have been present in Court during the whole of this trial—I have heard the evidence of every one of the witnesses who have been examined—I have formed an opinion with regard to the state of the prisoner's mind—I agree with the last witness, that the prisoner was not of sound mind at the time when these circumstances which have been mentioned occurred, especially the delusion, which is perfectly inconsistent—a man cannot be of sound mind, and have an absolute delusion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there any other grounds upon which you form that opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An apparent change of character, from being a very mild and inoffensive</p>

               <p>person, to becoming sometimes excited, sometimes melancholy, his thoughts often dwelling upon suicide, and eventually, from inadequate cause, committing a great crime.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'ENTEER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From all these circumstances, you give your opinion about his state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would be my medical opinion, if such a case was laid before me in any shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you formed in your mind any notion of what is an adequate motive for a great crime? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I speak only of the absence of an adequate motive—I conceive that a stronger mind than that of the prisoner, may be driven to crime by a combination of circumstances, bat they must be much more severe and trying, it appears to me, than those to which the prisoner was subjected—I do not profess to have any measure for the intensity of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the pain of rejected love, be in proportion to the intensity of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very difficult to answer questions of that kind—if I might explain myself, I should say that supposing the deceased person, the man who was murdered, had murdered the object of the prisoner's love, or some violent offence of that kind was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the object of attack was the person who had prevented the con<lb/>tinuance of an attachment, would that be a ground of hostility and revenge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not at all, in a person whose mind continued sound; it might be a subject of great offence, and continued pain, but not to lead to murder and outrage—no doubt some degree of attachment, and separation from the object of it, might form a motive for revenge, and in different ways in different minds—there is no doubt a tendency to assassination in different people—I believe the Italian temperament is generally considered more swayed to fatal revenge from jealousy than more northern people—the delusion with respect to the water passing through the fistula, I think quite a decided proof of unsoundness of mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of Newgate—the prisoner has been under my notice, during his confinement in the prison, from the day of his admission—I do not at this moment recollect the date of that—I saw him on the day he was brought in; it was about six weeks ago—I found him suffering chiefly in consequence of a wound, which he was said to have inflicted upon himself—after a few days he complained of a bleeding, which I attributed to the existence of piles, and which he allowed existed—I examined him—I found a small pile, which I considered indicative of internal piles, from which the blood proceeded—there was a small external pile, which is indicative of internal piles—generally speaking, when external piles are found, and bleeding has occurred, we presume, without putting the patient to further pain, that internal piles exist—I saw the appearance of an operation having been performed, on that part of the body, for fistula; it was not entirely healed—there was a little watery discharge from a little orifice in the skin, where it was abraded; that was the case when he came in, or within a few days afterwards; he did not tell me of it till then—that was the case when my attention was called to it—there was a little watery discharge, which is common under such circumstances occasionally, a very small quantity—he did not make any representation to me with respect to any discharge from that wound, in the manner which I have heard—he said that he passed blood from behind—he did not represent to me anything about water—he did not represent to me any gushing of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090078"/>
               <p>water; he did afterwards, because I asked him—he represented that he passed blood when he went to stool—I did not see it; I found that he most likely had passed blood—he did not complain to me of the passing of water, until I spoke to him on the subject—I had heard of it—I did not speak to him about it until this morning, nor did I hear of it, to draw my atten<lb/>tion particularly to it, until yesterday—I came down to the prison this morning for the purpose of asking that question—I said to him, "Did you ever say anything to me about water having passed from behind?" he then said, "My fistule"—that was all he said in answer at that moment—I said to him, "But did you ever think that you made water from behind?" and he answered, "I don't know that I ever did"—to the best of my recollection, that was all that passed this morning—during his stay in the gaol, I have had conversations with him almost daily—in the course of my attendance upon him, and in the conversations I have had with him, I have never observed any symptoms of aberration of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man were labouring under inflammatory action of the brain, would local bleedings have a beneficial effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If a person was maniacal we might not be disposed to pursue that plan of treatment; I should give him a sedative—bleeding would have a depressing effect, but every case must be spoken of per se—I have heard of persons being bled from the arm, for inflammation, or irritation of the brain—I have often heard of cupping in the neighbourhood of the brain when persons have been suffering from plethora—that is not disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would quietness and a regular diet have an improving effect upon that state of mind; would quiet, and regular diet, and bleeding restore his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is natural that quietness and regularity should improve the condition of a person thus situated.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And would restore an unsound mind to a sane state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a man was labouring under excitement, or insanity, bleeding, and regular diet and quiet, might relieve him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It it very rarely that bleed<lb/>ing is had recourse to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'ENTEER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that a regular system in prison in such circumstances as the prisoner was under here, would have a sedative and composing effect upon his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think anybody committed in an excited state of mind would probably be in a more quiet state of mind after being in prison for some time, and kept quiet and regular—if a person when committed was simply in an excited state of mind from the circumstance of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090079"/>
               <p>his being committed, I believe his mind would become more tranquil, calm, and composed, after being there some time; that is, supposing it was merely the excitement incident to his committal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From seeing the present state of mind, you would not attempt to speak of any previous state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only speak of that which I have known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GOURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he was labouring under depression, would that be increased or diminished by committal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he was labouring under depression, that depression might be increased by the fact of committal—in excitement of the brain, bleeding is not at all a universal remedy—in some cases it might, but in a great many cases, in the majority of cases, I should expect it would not be had recourse to—many people may have recourse to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider that, from all the evidence you have heard respecting it, to be an insane delusion of the mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive that impression was founded, in the patient, upon the slight dribbling of serous fluid from the cellular texture about the wound, which there must have been, even in that small place, exaggerated by his mind, that mind being intensely sensitive and excitable; I could observe that, in the conversation I had yester<lb/>day; there is a state of the body or nerves called hypochondriasis—I should conceive, considering the nature of the delusion, which was not in my eye strictly an insane delusion, considering the extreme excitability and</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the extremely excitable state of his nerves, you think that all the symptoms that have been spoken of, would be accounted for by hypochondriasis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All the symptoms that looked like insanity might be accounted for by that: hypochondriasis being a form set apart for those who are very nervous about their own health; a peculiar set of per<lb/>sons, whom it would be very unjust to call insane, persons who are peculiarly anxious and nervous on the subject of their health.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you, in the course of your practice, known cases in which per<lb/>sons labouring under hypochondriasis have imagined diseases to exist with respect to their own person, which had no foundation whatever in fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is more frequently the case that they exaggerate a symptom—I am assuming in this case not a complete imagination, but an exaggeration—that is my opinion in this case—it is more frequently that they exaggerate a symptom, and I imagine that to be the case in this instance—they may be generally traced to some trifling foundation—I certainly do not consider that persons exaggerating in that way, can be at all properly classed with those of unsound mind; you would extend a very dangerous excuse if you did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'ENTEER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> only saw the prisoner one day I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once—I have heard all the evidence here to day—I should not consider if a man thought his bed was swamped with water that that would be a delusion—I should use precisely the same method of explaining that as the other form I spoke of—if a patient held language to the effect that his bed was swamped, if it began from the slight ground which this person seems to have had, I conceive it quite natural, quite conformable with the laws of hypochondriasis, that he should go on exaggerating to any extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After he arrived at any extent, would you consider it had ever arrived at a delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, that is the fallacy of division; there is no end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you would consider that a man who said his bed was swamped, although it was repeatedly shown that there was not a drop of water of any kind in his bed, and that delusion being still persevered in, day after day, was not under delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a very strong case, I admit, there is no question about it—I do not consider incoherency, an element in making up delusion—inconsecutiveness is nearly the same thing—I should not consider inconsecutiveness and incoherency as tending to create a morbid delusion; there must be something beyond it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will just read a passage from the work of a gentleman whom, I am sure, you must have a very good opinion of (<hi rend="italic">Reading from page 26 of Dr. Mayo's own work</hi>): "In dealing with the two grounds which I have recently considered, for imputing insane delirium, namely, the presence of incon<lb/>secutiveness of thought in cases of certain delusions, how does the medical witness conduct his inquiry and arrange his evidence?—he makes, or he ought to make, each of these elements throw light on the other; where incoherency and inconsecutiveness exist there is little difficulty—continual inconsecutiveness, I believe, involves the presence of morbid delusions; that is, is sure to produce them"—do you agree with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, incon<lb/>secutiveness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090081"/>
               <p>and incoherenoy, when continued, are pretty sure to have delusion with them, and is a most important element in the proof of insane delirium—I do not observe, in the evidence given here, proof of inconsecutiveness of character in the conduct of this man—it may perhaps be an answer to your question, as far as I can give one, to say this, that I saw not that amount of disorder of thought, or any such extent of error in the succession of ideas, which would amount, in any fair reasoning or observation, to insanity; that takes in inconsecutiveness and incoherence too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will just read you, Lord Brougham's definition of a delusion; "A delusion is a belief of facts which no rational man would have believed;" do you consider that definition to be a correct one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it is much too loose, obviously so; I am sure Lord Brougham himself would declare so—the basis of a delusion is a fake perception—I believe I may say that a delusion is a false perception; that false perception may either be one of the special senses, or it may be one, corresponding with the delusion of the special sense of the understanding—a delusion combining both those would be a perfect delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a man fancied that he passed water in enormous quantities, and that his bed was swamped, and it was proved that he did not do it, and he was shown that the sheets were not wet, would not the two specifics for delusion exist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already explained that there is a form set apart, called hypochondriasis, which begins with certain grounds; now, a false perception, which is a real delusion, has no ground, but the hypochondriac starts upon perhaps most trivial ground, and the molehill grows into a mountain, and the expression of "swamping" perhaps takes place—that is a totally distinct thing from what I mean by delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not hypochondriasis occasionally merge into insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course there is an immense difficulty in drawing lines, but that would become a matter of fact—unquestionably, there must be in every science which is not a perfect one, a great deal of philosophical empiricism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that a man, whose judgment would not allow him to correct a transparent delusion, could exercise a sound judgment in other matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is often the case—I do not suspect that the person in the dock has exercised a sound judgment in any matter lately, but I allude to wisdom and experience—in such modes of delusion as belong to hypochondriasis, there are many men whose judgment is excellent, but who are exceedingly erroneous in other matters; they are unable to correct the delusion that they have in respect to their own health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find a delusion in respect of water, combined with a tendency to suicide, carried out in practice, would that be evidence of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I knew hypochondriasis to be the cause of the delusion, and the suicidal attempt—if a real insane delusion occurred, and the patient was of a plethoric character, and not of that sort of constitution in which bleeding disagrees with the insane, no doubt the loss of blood, by an accidental bleeding, or after an attempt at suicide, might temporarily benefit him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the effect of bleeding in a plethoric subject, when the vessels of the brain are in a state of congestion, bleeding would be useful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Moderate bleeding; but in insanity it is not right to take as much blood as the state of the pulse would indicate—moderate bleeding may, be beneficial, if the brain is congested—the prisoner has the constitution not of our clime; he has the Italian pulse, but a very small one, and a nervous constitution; and I should very much doubt whether</p>

               <p>bleeding would suit him under any circumstances; at least they must be very extraordinary circumstances—I carefully felt his pulse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, and have for many years paid marked attention to the diseases of insane persons—I was elected physician of St. Luke's Hospital in 1841, and have had a large practice among insane persons—I was directed by the Government to visit the prisoner, with a view to ascertain the state of his mind—I saw him yesterday, and had a conversation with him—it was before Dr. Mayo saw him—that was the only time I saw him—I was with him an hour and a half, conversing on different subjects—I did not observe any symptom of aberration of mind—I have heard the evidence in this case, and the acts attributed to him, as indicative of the state of his mind, by the witnesses, at different times—assuming them to be true, I should not, in my judgment, refer them to unsoundness of mind; I cannot consider them to have been the result of motiveless impulse; I mean the acts of violence—I have heard the history of the prisoner, and of his asking a man to shoot him—assuming those circumstances to be true, I should not refer them to unsoundness of mind—I should consider his impression that water came from his person in quantities in the bed, and that on one occasion he said that he swamped the bed, to be an illusion, the result of hypochondriasis, and not a delusion, the result of insanity—it is very common for persons suffering under hypochondriasis to take false views of the ailments of their own bodies—I find them frequently persist obstinately in those impressions—I do not consider it necessary to order such persons under restraint, or to treat them as insane persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LE BRETON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May I ask you if the belief that the prisoner's bed was swamped with water, although it was not the case, was not a delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, an illusion, the effect of hypochondriasis—the seat of hypochondriasis is generally in the nervous system; it is the effect of the nerves conveying false notices generally through the system to the brain—hypochondriasis may proceed to mental disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find, in combination with hypochondriasis, suicidal notions and tendencies, and general depression and melancholy, would you not consider that evidence of a mind not sound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not taken in the way you put it, without considering the whole circumstances of the case—it would go some way to constitute mental unsoundness—it would require delusion—the bed being swamped with water is an illusion, not a delusion—the difference between an illusion and a delusion, is that an illusion is objective—a delusion may be subjective, but the judgment must be involved—an illusion acts upon the brain—when a man is argued with, and shown to demonstration that no such illusion existed, the judgment would come into play, and be called upon to decide—if after that the illusion was persisted in I should conceive the judgment to be in fault—if the judgment is at fault there is not something wrong in the mind; not on a transparent fact like that, without hypochondriasis; not in the sense of unsound mind—a mind might be perfectly sound that would come to such a judgment—if a man believed that his legs were made of glass, and it was shown that they were not, that man would not have a sound mind—the distinction between the bed swamped with water and the glass legs, is, that the one is so palpably absurd on the face of it that it is a delusion—it is not palpably absurd that the bed was swamped with water when it was shown to be untrue; I should inquire if there were any reasonable grounds for the supposition; but where it is demonstrated that there is no water in the bed, it would be—where there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090083"/>
               <p>no reasonable ground for the supposition, then I call it a delusion—I do not say that the prisoner was under a delusion in this case; if I found that there was reasonable ground I should not consider it a delusion—the reason<lb/>able ground might be this; he told me that Mr. Henry had tried to per<lb/>suade him that he did not pass the water behind, and he said that he showed Mr. Henry the lint, and it was wet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider that the exuding of a small portion of moisture would be sufficient ground for the illusion, if the bed was dry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider it a great exaggeration of the fact—there is a progress in mental disease called the incubation—hypochondriasis is a very frequent cause of mental disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although a man may be hypochondriacal without being insane, is not hypochondriasis one of the conditions of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be, but there is something superadded—if great mental depression were superadded, hypo<lb/>chondriasis would not be a symptom of unsoundness of mind, it would be a symptom leading out of it—a suicidal tendency is very frequently one of the symptoms of mania—there are cases in my experience, mentioned in books, where a man, after brooding over some fancied wrong, and the commission of a crime, has suddenly recovered his mental faculties—the quiet and isolation in which the prisoner has been lately, may have had a beneficial tendency on mental disease, assuming it to have existed—it does not follow at all be<lb/>cause I found him without mental disease yesterday, that he may not have been maniacal on 7th Jan,—it may be so—taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, I do not like to give an opinion as to whether the prisoner was of sane mind last Jan.; I think that is for the jury to give an opinion of not for me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see him in Jan.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I see in this case clear proof of his having been suffering from hypochondriasis—the tendency of hypochondriac patients is to exaggerate an ailment of the body, that is a marked feature of the ailment—this impression of the prisoner about his bed, had reference to a supposed exudation from his body, which he exaggerated—that is not a circumstance that I should consider at all unusual in a person suffering under hypochondriasis—it is one of the most usual features of the complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the evidence respecting this prisoner, would you refer any act of his, of which evidence has been given to day, to the influence of an unsound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I answered that before, in saying that the acts which I have heard of, I do not consider to be motiveless, and therefore the result of insanity; that is, assuming the facts are true, that he was dis<lb/>missed from the house in the way that has been proved, and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Morgan, a milliner, in New North-road, Hoxton.

"—I gave the invoice to him; he wanted me to receipt it on the front, on the receipt stamp, but I would not; I thought if there was anything wrong, he could come upon me for having receipted it—he said, "You had better do it"—I said, "No, you will call in the morning and Mrs. Morgan will do it"—when I got home, I gave the cheque to Mrs. Morgan, and in consequence of what she said, I went back to Marion-square as soon as possible—I knocked at the door, and a female came up—I could get no intelligence of the prisoner, except that they said he was a friend of theirs, and he had come there and stopped about twenty minutes, and he had lodged with them about two years ago—I went back to Mrs. Morgan—the prisoner did not call the next morning for his change—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Rotheram, and Co., linen-drapers, in Shoreditch. I recollect the prisoner coming to the shop on 7th Feb., in company with a female—he asked me if we served the trade with ribbons—he made a selection of goods to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he ordered them to be sent to No. 21, Marion-square, Hackney-road—he was about two hours in selecting these goods with the female—I had an opportunity of seeing him during that time—it is my business to speak to all parties as they enter the shop—I spoke to him, and gave him a chair, and called a young man, named Parish, to serve him—Farish is not here—he was ill at the time the prisoner was committed, and he did not appear—the prisoner was there for two hours, and I had an opportunity of seeing him—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man—I should think it was about half past 3 or a quarter before 4 o'clock when he came, and it was about a quarter before 6 o'clock when he left—I cannot say whether the gas was lighted when he left, as I was in at tea when he left—the goods he selected were sent by the porter, Edwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Farish seen the man since? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has not—he was not at the Mansion House; he was confined to his bed.</p>

C. Hyde"—it was then treated as a discharged account—the prisoner continued to act till the latter end of Nov. last—he was suspended on 22nd Nov., and absconded a few days afterwards—I saw him again on the Fast-day.</p>

I produce a cheque for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was presented to me by the prisoner on 7th Feb., who requested payment of it—I refused payment of it—he wanted to know what was the difficulty, and thought he could explain it—I then requested him to inform me against what the cheque was drawn—he told me against cash paid in—I then required particulars, and he told me that a cheque for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid in—I asked him on whom it was drawn—he said that he could not recollect—I asked him who was the drawer, and he gave me an answer which I could not hear—I asked him a second time, and gave him a pen and paper to write the name down—I gave that paper to the principal of the office, by whom it has been lost—I have not looked for it—several cheques were paid in to his account anterior, but that was the only cheque for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the others have been for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pass book—nothing further passed, and the prisoner left—the numbers of all our cheques in each book agree—supposing this 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been paid in to his account, he would have had about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there.</p>

I have known the prisoner since 1850; he is a coppersmith—my father is an engraver—the prisoner knew my mother—I am twenty years old next birthday—when I first knew the prisoner, I was about sixteen years of age—he was then married—his first wife died whilst I knew him; he married again in 1851—he first paid attention to me at the latter end of 1850—he was then married—it was in May, last year, that he first bad connection with me—I became pregnant, and was delivered of a male child on 7th Feb. last—I first mentioned to the prisoner that I was in the family way on 18th July; he had then had intercourse with me twice—I told him that I was going to have a child—he then said, "That child must not be born alive, or else it will be the ruin of me"—he said he would get something to do away with it—he asked me if he was to give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and write a letter to that effect, would I say it belonged to some one else—I told him that I would not—he asked me to meet him again, and I saw him two evenings afterwards in the City-road; I mean in the road, not at any house—I told him that I was very uneasy—he offered to take a lodging for me—he did not give me anything then—I met him again a fortnight after<lb/>wards, at the corner of Beech-lane, Barbican; that was in the afternoon—he crossed over to the Prince of Wales coffee shop; I crossed with him to the corner, and he then gave me a pill, and said that would partially do it, and the next would do it altogether—I swallowed it in his presence—I did not remain with him, or have any further conversation with him then; he went away about two minutes after I had taken the pill—it was a dark brown pill, with bright spots, and it spangled—it made my face swell, and one of my eyes bloodshot, and it gave me great pain at the lower part of my stomach, and I felt very faint—I saw the prisoner again, between A week and a fortnight afterwards, at the same place, near Whitecross-street, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the evening—he then offered me a powder, and said that would nearly effect it—I did not take that powder; I tasted it, and took it home and destroyed it—it was two or three powders together; they were of a yellow colour, and very bitter—he gave me a pill abort a fortnight after that—it was not a pill of the same description as I had before; a different one—it made me spit blood, mixed with water, an hour or an hour and a half after I had taken it, and caused a deathly feeling, a very faint feeling—it was a very dark brown pill; the first pill was very large, the second was not quite so large—in Oct. the prisoner introduced me to James Scott; that was in the street, at the corner of Chiswell-street and Whitecross-street, in the same neighbourhood as before—the prisoner said to Scott that he would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he would do it—I went away and left Scott and the prisoner together—the next time I saw Scott by himself—that was two or three days afterwards—Scott then offered me</p>

               <p>some powders—I asked him to give them to me; he would not let me have them; he wanted me to take them in his presence, and I would not—I saw Scott three times altogether—on the last occasion, he Offered me a bottle of mixture; I heard him tell the prisoner that he had had to bribe the assist ant to get it before his master was up; he said it was oil of savin—Scott said that to Longman—I heard Scott say to Longman that the medicine would effectually do away with it, alluding to the infant—it was the oil of savin that he said that of—I did not take any of that mixture; he wanted me to take it in the Crown coffee house in Barbican; the prisoner was not present; he left Scott with me, and went by himself—I did not take any of the medicines that Scott gave me—I did not take it home; he would not give it me to take home—I did not take any medicine from the prisoner or Scott, except the two pills; it was offered, but I did not take it—after I had taken the second pill, the prisoner told me to tie a piece of tape round my stomach, and tell him day by day how much I decreased—I had not a very good labour—I have been ill for about four months altogether—my mother has met with an accident since, she sprained her ankle when she first went to look after Scott—I was attended by a nurse when I was delivered—Dr. Harris saw me afterwards, his assistant came too late to deliver me.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090103"/>
               <p>when they had no one to look after them?"—(my daughter did not show much that she was in the family way, even to the last)—he murmured out, "I can't help it now," or, "It can't be helped now"—I then spoke to him concerning certain abusive language that his wife had used concerning my daughter—he said she was in a passion—I then said to him, "Here is a pretty thing; when her father comes home she will be turned out of doors"—he then asked me if I had any confidential friend where I could send her for a time—I said I had not, and if I had I should not like to trouble them upon such a subject—my husband was at Newcastle at this time—after I had loaded the prisoner with every epithet I could think of, he said, "But you know, Mrs. Astins, the child may not live"—I said, "Live! it will live fast enough, if you will leave off playing your devil tricks with it!"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "You have been giving her drugs, for the purpose of procuring abortion"—he hesitated a moment, and then said, "Does <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi> say that?"—I said, "Yes, she does say so, and more than, that, I am in possession of all the facts of the case"—he then said, "Have you seen Scott)"—I said, "Yes, I have seen Scott; and the cowardly scoundrel ran away from me"—neither I or my daughter had mentioned Scott's name at that interview before he said that—he then said, "I can't help it now; what is done can't be undone; for Christ's sake, don't expose me, or I am a ruined man"—I told him I should immediately send my husband word about it—he then wanted to know if I could suggest any plan; if he could raise a sum of money, if I thought I could get Simmonds to marry her—I said I did not think he would; it was not very likely—he then asked me, provided Simmonds was agreeable, would I consent to deceive him on the subject of the pregnancy—I said, "God forbid!"—that was pretty nearly all that passed—he asked me several times if I would appoint an interview with him, or if I would write him a letter, and I refused to do anything of the kind—I wrote to my husband, he came home on the Thursday following, and we both went to the police station about it on the Saturday night—we saw Brannan, and gave him information—that was on the Saturday following the Tuesday upon which I had the interview with the prisoner—I have been ill for three months—I have been suffering from neuralgic pains of the head, and paralysis—I am not properly recovered now—my daughter was very ill indeed before her confinement—I noticed on one occasion, that her face was dreadfully swollen on the left side, and one eye appeared very much closed and bloodshot, and I noticed that she murmured in her sleep—on one occasion she complained of sickness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am surgeon at Guy's Hospital. On 21st March, the lad, Samuel Sullock, was brought to Guy's Hospital—Mr. Knight's partner, Mr. Barter, came to see him while he was in the hospital—I examined the boy—he was very dirty—he had several wounds on his legs, some on his body, others on his head, and some on his hands—the wound on the head I should call a small lacerated wound, with contusions around—he had a remarkably idiotio vacant stare—we had great difficulty in getting any information from him—I ordered his head to be shaved, that we might examine it more carefully—I first discovered two small wounds on the scalp, with the contusions I have described—on feeling one more attentively, I thought there might be some matter underneath; I therefore made an incision into the scalp, and there was a very little matter, not so much as I anticipated—I then found that the soft parts external to the skull were infiltrated as they are after contu<lb/>sion, and the membrane covering the external surface of the skull was detached, which was also the result of a contusion—I have no doubt that blows with a broom stick or scrubber, would have produced the appearances that I saw on the skull—a fall would produce they same result—one wound was on the left side of the head, in the frontal region, and one on the left temporal region—there were two wounds—on the legs we found some wounds healed, and some healing—they were peculiarly small wounds, which were said to have been the result of the bites of mosquitoes—I do not know whether that might be so; I never saw a mosquito bite—there were, I think, two wounds on the right leg, one nearer the groin than the other; it was a narrow wound, in great part healed; the other was a larger wound, not so much healed—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090108"/>
               <p>was one on the abdomen quite healed—they were such injuries as might have been produced by kicks about the body—they were abraded surfaces; they might have been the result of a kick—if the clothes had been on, and it had occurred three weeks before, I think it could scarcely be attributed to a kick—all the wounds I saw were undergoing a healing process—they could not have been inflicted within a day or two—there was one wound on the anterior part of the right thigh, which must have been five inches long, but exceedingly narrow; I heard that that was the result of a rope's end, and I think it very likely—there was no contusion about the wounds on the extremities—I apprehend the effect of a severe blow from a rope's end, with the clothes on, would be merely to raise the cuticle, and contuse the part, produce a blister, which would break, and then there would be merely the abrasion of the skin, which would be very superficial indeed—the wound I saw was very superficial, and quite consistent with that species of injury—the wound on the abdomen was rather oval than long—I should not call it a wound; there was a scar; there had been a wound evidently—there was just a little scab in the centre, round the cuticle—the hands were very much contused; the back of the left hand particularly, and there was an abraded surface, either on the ring or index finger, and also an abraded surface on the nose—blows on the hand with a stick, I should say, would be very likely to produce that appearance—I should think a fall would easily produce the abrasions I saw on the face—the boy was in the hospital about four days; he died on the 25th—the cause of death was bronchitis—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem examination</hi>—I discovered nothing more with regard to the wounds on the body—I examined more attentively the wound on the skull—I found the scalp very much infiltrated from the result of the blow—the body was otherwise healthy; there was not a diseased organ, except the lungs—the brain was particularly healthy.</p>

On 19th March I bought a number of sheep—I saw them that afternoon in a field at Brook Green, Hammersmith—there were four marks on them: a "T" on the face, extending from the forehead down to the nose; a red dot of paint between the ears; a slight red paint mark, older done, on the back, towards the hip; and an "H" on the back—there were thirty-one of them, including the leader sheep, which I had had twelve months, or a little more; it was tame, and when sheep came home from market, it used to run in first and they followed instantly—it was about half the size of the other sheep—on that Monday I saw the leader driven into the field, they were all there together—there was a private mark on the leader—I had bought it for a gentleman a few months back—we castrated it ourselves; and not being a usual per<lb/>formance with us, it took longer to heal; we had to dress the parts affected, and they had just got well—I live about a quarter of a mile from the field—on Thursday morning, about half past 9, my lad gave me information, and I went and found only eleven sheep left—I did not know Paulin, but I know now where his butcher's shop is—I went there on Saturday, from something that I heard, and saw three carcass of sheep resembling mine, and some joints of mutton of the same quality—I have killed some of the same sheep—a pair of hind quarters of the leader were hung close behind, hidden—I have them in court (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are the strings of the parts, which we cut across with a pair of tweezers, and I can undertake to say that this is part of the carcase of the leader—on the same day I went to Mr. Wighton's shop, and saw four carcases of sheep, throe in front, and one hanging in the row; and I said to myself, that is one of my sheep—I had no notion of finding any of my sheep there—on the following Tuesday I went to Mr. Corderoy's, in Long-lane, Bermondsey, and saw this sheep's skin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a red dot on this skin between the ears; it was on four out of the nineteen—this "T" is my own mark; that was on the whole twenty—this skin has been limed and washed, which has effaced the marks very much—here is the red paint on the hip—I did not look at the other skins; there were seven; but I was told that if I found any of mine, it</p>

From information I received, I went to Paulin's shop, on 24th March, and told him that he was charged on suspi<lb/>cion of stealing twenty sheep from a field at Brook-green, Hammersmith; he said, "I am innocent"—I afterwards took M'Leach—I saw a pair of hind quarters at the shop, which Mr. Fowkes identified, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—M'Leach said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

When M'Leach was brought to the station, I asked him where he brought the mutton from which he was carrying in Mary-le-bonne-lane that morning—he said, "I did not have any mutton"—I said, "You took some into a butcher's shop at the corner of Bentinck-street (Mr. Wighton's)"—he said, "Oh, yes, I took half a sheep"—I said, "Did not you take a whole one?"—he said, "No, I did not"—I had seen him that morning take a whole carcase of a sheep to Mr. Wighton's—I took Paulin's books, but found no entry of this transaction, nor of the sale of the fat—these are the books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

In the afternoon of 3rd Feb., I was going from London to Romford, and on the road I took up Bishop—I saw the prisoner with a gun in his hand, and just before him there was another man who had a gun—the other man said, "How do turnips go;" I said, "Half a crown a dozen"—I said to the prisoner, "You can't shoot;" he said, "I can shoot"—I said, "Shoot me," and be held his gun to his shoulder and fired—I did not hold a cap up, I was sit<lb/>ting down in the cart—we were both sitting down—I heard a report, and Bishop was wounded—he bled a great deal—he said, "Stop, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, I am shot"—and the blood trickled down his face.</p>

Betts search the loft, and find this lead under some straw and onion peel—I had been watching before, but was attending to the cows, and left Mrs. Betts there—I kept on the watch till about 7 o'clock in the evening, when the prisoner came again, and ran up into the loft—no one else was there—I heard something drop, and the prisoner ran down the steps again—I told Mr. Betts, and he was detained—I then went up into the loft, and found the lead about two feet and a half from where I had found it.</p>

On Wednesday, 21st Feb., I was on duty in High-street, Woolwich, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners there walking together—I followed them into Hare-street—I saw Motz go into a pork butcher's shop, kept by Mr. Matthews—he was served, and came out, and I immediately went in and asked the boy what he had</p>

               <p>purchased—a bad sixpence was given to me by John Pembury—I marked it, and showed it to him, and asked if he should know it again, and he said "Yes"—this is it—I came out and saw the prisoners again, walking up the same street—I lost sight of them for a short time—I saw them again under a gateway in Powis-street—they appeared to be looking at something in their hands—they came from the gateway, and I saw Motz go into Mr. Hills', a pork butcher's, in Richard-street—he was there detained by Mr. Hill—I went after Carroll round the corner, and I saw him coming from the gateway the second time—I took him into custody—I told him he was charged with being in company with another in passing a counterfeit six<lb/>pence—he said he had done nothing of the kind, and had not been with any one—I gave him into the custody of two persons, and I went and took Motz, who was going down the street—I told him he was charged with passing a bad sixpence—he denied it, and denied all knowledge of the other prisoner—I took them to the station—I went to the gateway, and found this leather purse, and in it six bad shillings and another bad six<lb/>pence—the same as those two which I had got from Mr. Matthews and Mr. Hill—on searching Carroll I found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers in his coat pocket, and one 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece; a small portion of tea, and three pennyworths of tobacco—on Motz I found a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, a halfpenny, and a tobacco box—I have no doubt the prisoners are the persons I saw talking together—I watched them a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>came to my senses I found myself in the station house, and I only had one farthing, and no hat—next day I found myself very much hurt at the side; I got worse and worse, and went home and went to bed; and on the Friday following I went to King's College Hospital—they told me there that one of my ribs was fractured—I have been attended ever since, and I am still suffering—I am bound up now, and am afraid to talk loud—I did not strike Blundell, or make his mouth bleed before he struck me—I did not spar at him to show what I could do when I was a young man—I did not reel against him and fall down—the account I have given is a true one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and live at No. 76, Princes-road, Lambeth. On Tuesday, 27th March, I was at the Jolly Gardeners—I saw the prosecutor go in there with his old lady, and he left his goods at our shop, which is about forty yards from the Jolly Gardeners—I afterwards went in, and found him there, and Blundell—Blundell wanted to toss him for a quartern of gin—he said he did not want to toss him, or to have anything to do with him—Smith had had a drop to drink, but knew what he was about—he told Blundell that sooner than toss for a quartern of gin he would pay for a pot of ale—he ordered a pot, and took out his money to pay for it—he took it from his right hand waistcoat pocket—I saw him pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the bar, and place what was left back again in his waistcoat pocket—Blundell saw that—I then saw Blundell hit the old woman a smack in the face, and after that he said to Smith, "We will have a tustle"—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the old man (Smith) down on his back, and at the same time slipped his left hand into the old man's right hand waistcoat pocket, and took out some money—he handed it over Smith's face with his left hand, to Collins; at the same time he picked up Smith's hat, and gave it to Collins—Collins put the cap he had on his head into the hat, and put the hat on—he remained in the house about three minutes afterwards, and then walked away—I walked behind him—the way in which Blundell knocked Smith down was by laying hold of him and <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> him down, and he fell a top of him, and while he was down I saw him kick him no less than twice or three times in the ribs—that knocked Smith <hi rend="italic">like silly</hi>, he did not know what he was doing—I followed Collins up two streets, and part of another, to find a policeman, but I could not see one—I then returned back to the Jolly Gardeners, and met two policemen—Blundell was then gone—the policemen went after him, and afterwards brought him back to the Jolly Gardeners—he was quite sober—Collins was tipsy, but knew what he was about, in my opinion—I should have known what I was about if I had been like him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Jolly Gardener's. On 27th March, the prisoners were at our house together for two or three hours—between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was cleaning the windows out<lb/>side; the windows are all round the house—it is a square house, and there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090135"/>
               <p>are windows all the way round—there is no tap room or parlour—it is all front to the bar—it is a gin palace; all bar—whilst I was cleaning the windows, I heard a disturbance, which caused me to get down the steps; it was a hustling, and a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and a woman was hallooing out, "Shall we fetch a policeman?"—I had not observed Smith there at that time—on hearing the noise, I looked through the window, and saw Smith on the floor, and Blundell on the top of him—I got down the ladder, and went into the house—Blundell had then got up—Smith was lying on the ground, seem<lb/>ingly insensible—I lifted him up; I was obliged to carry him—I took him to the other end of the shop, and sat him down, and then went back to get the mob out of the shop—I could not exactly tell whether his eye was cut at that time—I saw Collins by the side of Blundell when I came down off the ladder into the shop, and I heard Collins say to Blundell, "Let him have his hat"—Blundell immediately said, "I will see the b—d—first"—I then saw Collins put his cap in the hat, and walk out of the house—I did not exactly see how he got the hat—Blundell remained in the house for a short time, until he heard there was a policeman sent for—I went out to look for one, but could not see one—I endeavoured to keep in the house, to get the mob out—I heard the woman say that Blundell had robbed Smith, and she would fetch a policeman, and she went out once, twice, or thrice to get one—I have not seen that woman since—Blundell threatened to give her a crack, and he followed her out into the street to give her one, calling her all the b—b—he could lay his tongue to—a policeman afterwards came; Blundell was then gone—I did not see Blundell strike the Woman; he was quite sober—I believe Collins was quite sober enough to know what he was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons do you think were in the bar at the time the scuffle took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could hardly tell, on account of the mob; a very great mob came in, hearing words—there are five doors to the house, and parties were rushing in at all the doors; it is a very public place—we do a great deal of business—now and then we have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, but very rarely—we are not allowed to serve persons who are drunk—I dare say Smith remained in the house about half an hour, before he was taken to the station—he was in the public place, in the same position where I placed him, after picking him up—I could not very well keep my eye upon him all the time, as I was trying to disperse the mob—I do not know who was about him during that time; I did not see any one in particular.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier, and live at No. 2, Lower's-buildings. I recollect Wednesday morning, 17th Jan.—I had been to the Victoria theatre the night before, with my wife and three friends; we were returning home at 20 minutes or a quarter to 3 o'clock—it was my inten<lb/>tion to ride, and I went to the comer of the Palace New-road, Westminster, to engage a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, who said he would take us to Cadogan-pier, Chelsea, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know his name; I should not know him again—I went back to inform my friends, but they were going to walk home, and I said, "Perhaps the man will take me and my wife for less money"—I engaged this man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a man in Court</hi>)—he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the five, but the others walked home—I was about to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when a policeman came up; it was the prisoner—he said to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man that if he were he, he would not take the fare at all; he said, "Have your money first"—on that the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man said, "I want my fare"—I said, "How much is it? "—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">s"</hi>—I put my hand into my pocket, and tendered 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and then the prisoner said, "If I were you, I would not take the fare at all;" and then the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man said he would not take the fare—my wife said, "Do you think it is not 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? "and the prisoner said, "Go on, ma'am;" and pushed her off the kerb into the road—she said, "Who do you call ma'am? "and he went into the road, and pushed her twice—I took hold of her arm, and said, "Come with me to the station house, and we will see whether he will not take the fare—the prisoner then commenced pushing me very violently; it was a frosty night, and I had hard work to prevent myself from falling—I went down the Westminster-road, and he kept treading on our heels as we went down—we afterwards went to the station; he charged us with being drunk and disorderly, and making a noise, and we were locked up—I was sober, and so was my wife; we were not making a disturbance in the road—I tried to persuade my wife to go to the station, because she kept crying about her child—she did not threaten to twist the defendant's nose; no such word was spoken—she made no threats, and used no bad language towards the defendant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I recollect going to the Victoria Theatre, in Jan.; the performance was over about ten minutes to 1 o'clock—I had nothing to drink during the performance; I did not come out till it was over—I was with my husband and three friends when we came out—we went to a public house, and I and the females had a glass of gin and water and some bread and cheese, which I think they paid for—from there we went to a public house in Westminster Bridge-road—we did not go straight there; we met a person, and were talking in the street—four of us partook of half a pint of gin there—we had nothing else there—we were there about half an hour, and then went straight to a pie shop, in the Westminster-road, and when we had been there some few minutes, my husband went to get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and in consequence of something he said, I went out to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was in the street, and the man who my husband had engaged had gone, but there was another man a short distance lower down, with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner was there—our friends would not agree to go, because Pigram wanted 36<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so we bade them good night, and they walked away—my husband said, "Perhaps you will take me and my wife for less? "he agreed to take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was about getting into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, when the policeman came up and said, "Have your money first"—my husband offered the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he was going to take it, but the policeman said, "If I</p>

I am no relation of the prisoner, my name is not spelt the same—I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and was on the stand on the morning of 17th Jan.—Skinner came to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before mine, but did not engage it; he wanted to go for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the man said he would not go for less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then came out of a pie shop with his wife when the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was gone, and demanded of me to go for half a crown—I said, that as there were five, I could not go for less than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when his wife found that I would not go for half a crown, she got very passionate, and wanted to know where the police were; the defendant then came up, and from the opposite side four other policemen came up—I said, "Here are the police now"—the prisoner wanted to know what was the matter—I said that they wanted to go for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. under the fare, and I would not go—the wife applied to the prisoner to know whether he could not compel me to go—the prisoner said that he had nothing to do with that; if I did wrong they had got their remedy—she got very passionate, and the prisoner said, "We cannot have this noise here, the man will not take you, you must go on, ma'am"—she directly said, "Who do you call ma'am, I am no ma'am; if you call me so again, I shall wring your nose;" or, "wring the <hi rend="italic">snot</hi> out of your nose;" and then she repeated the same words, with some other expression which I do notrecol<lb/>lect—the prisoner then gave her a push on the shoulder, pushed her off the pavement, and said, "Why don't you hold your tongue, your tongue will get you into trouble"—they then walked a little way down the road, and I saw no more of it—I have known the prisoner for years, as a police<lb/>man on the beat, but nothing more—they were not at any time getting into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I would not take the five for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Skinner said, "Then <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and my wife will go;" and he said to the others, "You know where to meet us"—one of the policemen said, "Have you got any money? "and Skinner pulled out two or three 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces—the prisoner said, "You had better have your fare first"—I stood at the door of my <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and would not let anybody get in—I do not say that they were drunk, but they were the worse for liquor, the woman more than the man.</p>
