                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at no. 17, Tavistock-street, in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden. On the 24th of January I had a person in my employ named John Hall—I went to bed that night about five minutes past eleven o'clock—before I went to bed I fastened all the bolts and locks of the doors—I fastened the street-door myself—I have a coal-hole opposite the house covered by an iron plate—if the plate is taken up, a boy could get down—I have measured it—I came down stairs next morning (Saturday) at seven o'clock, and found a door, in the pas<lb/>sage leading into the shop, broken open—that had been locked and bolted the night before—I went into the shop, and found every thing in confusion—a square of the glass of the door had been cut away entirely—part of the door is glazed—the bolt of the door is inside—moving the glass would enable a person to undo the lock, the key being inside, but the bolt was forced—it was entirely broken away by force—it is not an outer door—I missed several pieces of black cloth, several rolls of kerseymere, a quan<lb/>tity of waistcoat-pieces, two suits of clothes, and the best part of the pro<lb/>pety of the shop—the plate was kept in a drawer in the kitchen, and from there were taken some silver table-spoons, some salt-spoons, gravy-spoons, nut-crackers, and a tea-caddy—the parlour door was forced open—I lost, in all, property to the amount of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would cost that to re-purchase it—the coal-cellar door has no fastening to it—if a person dropped down the</p>

               <p>hole they could get into the kitchen by opening a window opposite to the coal-cellar, which was shut down, but was never fastened—it required some strength to move it, for the servant never could lift it up—Hall was an out-door apprentice, and had been with me six months—he was appren<lb/>ticed for three years—I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Mr. Smith's service for six months. I have now come from the infirmary of Newgate—I have been there ever since the Saturday morning after I was taken—I have been in custody twice before, the first time was for being seen with a young man of bad cha<lb/>racter, I was put in Clerkenwell prison, and remained there a week; the other time was, nearly twelve months after, for being seen with two bad characters—the first time was about three years ago, and the last time about a twelvemonth ago—I was a month in the City Bridewell the last time—I am eighteen years old—I have known the prisoner Bird six months, and Saunders about the same time—I was in the habit of meeting them both at the Duke of Argyle public-house, in Laystall-street, at dif<lb/>ferent times, very often—I know a boy named <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—he is about eighteen or nineteen years old—he is not as stout as me—I also know a man named Mitchell, he lived in Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel—I became acquainted with him by seeing him in company with Saunders, and I became acquainted <hi rend="italic">with Charley</hi> by seeing him in their company—On Friday evening, the 24th of January, I met the two prisoners at the Duke of Argyle public-house, and for two or three evenings before—it was suggested by Saunders that my master's house should be plundered—he persuaded me to rob my master two or three days before the robbery was actually committed—we met at the Duke of Argyle public-house, in Laystall-street, to arrange it—Saunders, Bird, Mitchell, another man, and the boy <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> I believe, were present—we were together there on the night of the robbery; I be<lb/>lieve it was after eleven o'clock—Saunders asked me where the money was kept—I told him I did not know—he asked me where the plate was kept—I told him, in the back-parlour—Saunders proposed that the coal-hole plate in the area should be taken up, and that the boy <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> should go down it, get into the area, and make his way into the house—five of us went to the house, Saunders, Bird, another person, myself, and <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—Mitchell said he would buy any thing we got from the house—we did not go straight from the Duke of Argyle public-house to my master's, we went into a public-house in Holborn first—I do not know the sign, but it is on the left-hand side—I was never there before—Mitchell paid for half-a-pint of gin there, and wished us good evening—we then went to my master's—it may have been a little after twelve o'clock when we got there—the coal-hole plate was taken up by one of them, I do not know which, and the boy got down, went through the kitchen, and opened the street-door—I saw him go through the area window—I remained till the street-door was opened—Saunders was outside stopping by me there, about two or three yards from the door—Bird and the other man went in—Saunders said I had better go home, and to meet him at his own house, in Bedford-court, Bed<lb/>ford-street, eight o'clock next evening—I went away by his persuasion—I went to my master's next morning, as usual, and in the evening I went to Saunders's house, as he had appointed—I saw him there, and he said he had fetched the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Mr. Smith's house at three o'clock in the morning, and taken away the goods, which were put in the passage, to Mitchell's house, in Petticoat-lane, and there sold some of it, I believe,</p>

               <p>to him, and that there was a portion of the money for me, which he gave me, it was six half-sovereigns—that was all I received—I believe Mitchell is a Jew—Saunders said he had sold it to Mitchell the Jew, for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three sovereigns was my share of it—he said there were some cloths, velvets, two suits of clothes, and some plate, which he had taken away—I did not tell of this till I was taken into custody—I do not know when that was—I believe it was a fortnight afterwards, or more—I told the story to my master, in the officer's presence, and went with Weston the same even<lb/>ing to a public-house in Leather-lane, I do not know the sign—we went there with the intention of getting Bird, because that was the house he used—the officers were disguised—we found Bird there after a time or two—we went and took a walk, returned, and then found him there—I went up and spoke to him, and had something to drink—I then asked him to come along with me—(the officers were with me)—he said he would, and he did go as far as Greville-street, Leather-lane—I asked him two or three different questions—he said the boy that did the robbery was taken up, with some <hi rend="italic">screws</hi> on him—that is the <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> phrase for keys—I do not know what sort of keys they were—when we got to Greville-street he said he would not go any further—the officer then took him into custody—he used some vulgar expression to me, I do not know what it was, and said if he knew I was going to <hi rend="italic">split</hi> he would have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> for me—in going to the station-house he made a kick at me, and kicked the officer—he did not say any thing then, nor at the station-house, that I know of—I afterwards went with Montgomery and Weston the officers to Saunders's house in Bedford-court, and found him there in bed about three o'clock in the morning—I said nothing to him, but Weston said he was his prisoner—next day I went with Weston, Montgomery, and two or three more, to Mitchell's house, in Petticoat-lane—I do not know the time exactly, but it was about three o'clock—he was not at home—we found him at a public-house in Petticoat-lane, I do not know the name of it—I went into a good many public-houses, to fee if I could find him, and at last went to this one, where he was—I asked him how he did—that was all that passed—he was taken into custody then—I believe Montgomery took him—I believe he tried to get away when he came out, but Montgomery and an<lb/>other officer stopped him—I had not said any thing to him about what he was charged with before he tried to make his escape.</p>

               <p>that I bad been twice in prison—I swear that I saw Saunders on the Sa<lb/>turday evening after the robbery at his own house, about eight o'clock, or a little after, in his bed—it was then, that he gave me the six half-sove<lb/>reigns—I knew that morning that my master had lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of pro<lb/>perty—I took the three sovereigns as my share of it—I remonstrated with Saunders about the smallness of the sum—I did not get any more.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bird's Defence.</hi> On Friday evening, the 31st of January, I was standing at the door of a public-house in Leather-lane, talking to a female; I saw Hall and two sailors, as I supposed, on the other side of the way; they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060012"/>
               <p>crossed towards me, and went into the public-house where I was standing; I asked Hall who the persons were: he said, one was a brother of his, and another his cousin, and he said to the one he called his cousin, <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi> lend or give me a shilling; "he gave him one, and he paid for some gin with it. I then entered into conversation with him in presence of Weston, he said he and the two sailors were going to the west end of the town, to commit a robbery; he said the two sailors had not been long home from sea; that they were living at the West-end, and were going to the place that night; could I find some false keys or housebreaking implements to take with them, and asked me to accompany them; I said, I did not know where to find such things, nor what was fit for such a purpose; he said, "Come outside, and we will have a bit of talk about it." I went out with him and the two sailors; Weston said, "If we don't make haste, my lads, we shan't be able to do it to-night," and he called a coach, with the inten<lb/>turn, I supposed, of going to the West-end, to commit the robbery. When I ascertained their object was to commit a robbery, I refused to go any farther with them, and I returned back, intending to go back to the public-house which I had left, when Weston said, "You are my prisoner," and seized me by the collar. I said to Hall, "You b—, you persuaded me to do what is not right in presence of the officers to <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on me; you ought to be murdered;" those were the words I used, but they have been twisted and strained by Weston into something else. Had I not sufficient provocation to use those words? when men, whose duty it is to protect the public, come and lay down such a trap as this, trying to ensnare a man into a share in a robbery, and when he positively refuses to join in it, or go further with them, seize him as a prisoner. Now Weston says I was outside the public-house when they first saw me, and Hall says I was in<lb/>side; they directly contradict each other. Consider the number of police-men there at the time, (seven;) was there any necessity at all to come into the public-house to take me when I was standing outside with a female; as to resistance, I made none. I was taken to the station-house, searched, and no money or property found on me; policemen came to see me from every division in the metropolis, and none could say they knew or heard any harm of me; Mrs. Thorpe positively says I was not at the Duke of Argyle in company with Hall; Hall said there were seven persons assembled at that house the day the robbery was committed; Mrs. Thorpe said there was not: when she was first examined she said there was only me, but Weston induced her to get up a second time; he said, "You have come up intending to speak to Mitchell, and you forgot him alto<lb/>gether:" she then said she thought about three weeks ago Mitchell was with us, but Hall," she said, "was not there then." It seems to me that Hall brings this charge against me to screen the really guilty parties; he, no doubt, knows who they are, and he will go from here to enjoy with them his guilty earnings: knowing you will not give credit to such an abandoned and worthless wretch, I resign myself, gentlemen, into your hands.</p>

I was walking with a friend in Fleet-street, from three to five o'clock, on the 19th of March—I had a purse in my pocket which contained three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and a little silver—the first thing that drew my attention was a pressure behind me, and then a second pressure—I walked on—a person told me I had been robbed—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse, but I did not see any one near me—I am sure my purse had been in my pocket—I had a white pocket-handkerchief, which was hanging partly out of my pocket, not as I had placed it—the prisoners were both taken immediately—I saw my purse in the hand of the police-man—this is it—it contains the money mentioned.</p>

I have been acquainted with Caroline Tully eight years, and was with her on the 13th of March—I first met her about six o'clock in the evening, we both had something to drink—I was not the worse for liquor—she sat down and went to sleep after I left her in Crown-court, Wapping—she asked me to give her my watch to take care of, and I did so—I came back to Crown-court, she was there, and asked me to go and see if her father was come home—I went, and could see no light—I came down the court again and found her and two policemen—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Carry,</hi> give me the watch, I think I am more able to take care of it than you"—the prisoner was one of the policemen—I asked Tully where the watch was, she said she did not know—the other policeman asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about the watch, he said no, he had not</p>

On Thursday, the 5th of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the three prisoners at the bottom of Grundy-street, Poplar, loading tar-barrels into a truck—they were about three or four hundred yards from the prosecutor's premises, across two gardens—Hatch and Kerr were about putting up the last barrel when I saw them—Brisley was holding the handle of the truck—I had two other constables with me—we watched them down Dock-wall, and, consi<lb/>dering they were going to the premises of Mr. Turner, a purchaser of tar<lb/>barrels, at the Orchard-house, we went another way, through the East India Docks, and came upon them about thirty yards from Mr. Turner's premises—I took Hatch, and brought him to the station-house—I asked where he got the tar-barrels—he said he had bought them of a carman the night previous—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you ever see him before?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Whereabouts did you see him?"—he said, "In the Commercial-road; I had been to town that afternoon, to deliver some coals in St. Mary-Axe, and I saw a wagon, in East India-road, as I was coming home, with tar<lb/>barrels in it; I asked the carman whether he would sell them; after some few words he said he would; I offered him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; when I got op<lb/>posite the George the Fourth public-house, Kerr came up; he paid his part, and we had the tar-barrels, and took them to this place where you saw us loading them, and there left them till the morning, when you saw us"—I took Hatch and Brisley's shoes off, and went to the place where I had seen them loading them, and, in the garden of a man named Barrett, found some slight traces where persons had been walking—I then went into Mrs. Douthie's garden, which joins the prosecutor's premises, and which had been recently dug up for the purpose of sowing seed—pieces of the fence were broken off, and all the way up the fence were foot-marks which corresponded with those shoes—Hatch's shoes are very remarkable, they have no heel, and flow over the side—one of Brisley's has no heel, and the other only a bit of one, which could be discerned in the foot<lb/>marks—the tracks went close up to the fence where the tar-barrels were taken from—this was on Thursday morning, the 5th—after tracing them up to the fence, I went into the prosecutor's premises, and saw the foreman and Rogers—Rogers afterwards saw the barrels at the stationhouse, and identified one which he had taken the mark of the night previous.</p>

Holmes came to me on the 5th of March, while I was at breakfast, and in consequence of what he said I looked, and missed some barrels—I missed one which I had taken the head off from the day before—we always break the heads out as clean as possible, not to waste any tar, but this head was so fast in that two little bits remained at each side, in consequence of which a little tar had drained off, and there was the mark of the tar—I went to the station-house, and saw six barrels in a truck, one of which was the one with the two little ragged bits, which I had taken particular notice of the night before, and when that barrel was turned out it happened to be the very one of which Rogers had taken the copy of the mark—I saw the officers compare the shoes—it was a soft loamy soil, very fine, and without any stones in it—there had been a slight frost over night, which made the ground crisp at the top, and the impressions of the shoes were almost as perfect as if they had been taken in wax—one shoe in particular, with only half a heel, I never saw a more perfect one—and there were the prints of the tar-barrel hoops, as they were rolled along the ground from our premises to the place where they were loaded—there was also some dirt at the place where they were thrown over the fence, and there was a sort of tressel close by the place, which would make it convenient to get them over—I have known Brisley fifteen months—he bore an honest cha<lb/>racter—he supplied me with coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Gray, and am a laundress, living in James-street, Lower-road, Islington. I was taking some clean linen home in my cart with my lad, at half-past nine o'clock on the 7th of March—I was going to stop at Bucklersbury, to leave a basket—I felt the cart give a sudden sway—I turned, and there were two men with my basket—I cannot say who they were—they dropped it—one ran round the Poultry, and the other round Bucklersbury—this is the basket—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at it</hi>)—it contained the things stated—I picked it up immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and keep a preparatory school for young gentlemen, in Canonbury-place, Islington. On the evening of the 5th of March, about seven o'clock, or a few minutes after, I was walking with two of my pupils, Wilkinson and Fortescue, who are both eleven years old, through Canonbury-field—it is a regular highway—I overtook a man, who stopped when I came near him, drew a little on one side, and said, "I will thank you for some money"—I said, "I have none to give away"—he then went behind me, and on coming to the other side he said, "I have been told you have, and I must have some"—I said, "I have a few shillings only in my pocket," and felt in my pocket—he came close to me, showed me a pistol in one hand, and held the other for my purse or whatever money I had—I gave him my purse, on seeing the pistol, from fear—he held the purse up on my giving it to him, went behind me, and went away—it contained half-a<lb/>sovereign and two or four shillings, I am not certain which—I had not the opportunity of noticing his face, but I noticed his figure—I did not notice his voice particularly, I was too much frightened—the prisoner was thinner when I saw him at Hatton-garden than when I saw him in the field, but from his general appearance I then thought it was him, and I am of that opinion still—I did not see his face, as I had rather a thick veil down, and he kept rather on one side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you tell it was a pistol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From my observation of it—I saw the barrel and the mouth—there are other tubes like a pistol<lb/>barrel, but I think decidedly this was a pistol—he showed it to me to in<lb/>timidate me—he did not tell me it was a pistol, nor tell me he would do any thing to me with it—the mouth was not turned towards me—I saw the wood that supports the barrel—I bad my veil on at the time—It was not a very indistinct view that I had—my veil is not a very thick one—I have the same on now—I wear it to exclude the air, being subject to a cough—it was dusk—I will not swear it was a pistol-barrel.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Newton-street, Holborn. On the 28Ch of February I was at work at Messrs. Willis's, in St. James's-street—I left my hat and coat in the porter's room, between two and three o'clock, and in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock they were gone—there was a bit of wool and some wadding in the pocket of the coat—the wool and wadding have been found—these are them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> It is not an easy thing to swear to wool, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I have a particular mark on this, this bit of green worsted—if the worsted was not on it I should not have known it—it is not tied to it, it is loose and mixed with it—here is no mark on this worsted—I do not know the wadding by the quantity nor colour—I bought it in Windmill-street, Hay<lb/>Market, and had it about a fortnight—I use if in my business—I put it into my pocket at dinner-time—any thing might have been put in or taken out of the pocket, without my seeing it, when the coat was there—a great number of persons have access to where the coat was—I went in the back way—the door was open—there would be no difficulty in a person going and taking these things without being seen by the persons who were trans<lb/>acting business—these things were two or three yards from where the per<lb/>sons were—I was in the office, which is in front—I could not see the coats—I cannot say that this is all the wadding I had in my pocket—there was a very small dog there—I do not know whether they are in general more watchful than others—the dog was about a yard from where the coats were left—he did not bark at me when I went in—I did not search for my coat when I came away, but every part was searched—these articles might have been taken by a person without his taking the coats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the morning of the 3rd of April, and, about three o'clock, discovered some dirt on the lock of Mr. Chichester's area-gate, at No. 11, Lower Seymour-street—I had seen the gate at half-past one o'clock—it was all safe then—in conse<lb/>quence of seeing the dirt on the lock I looked into the area, and saw some things there—I rang the bell—the maid-servant came and let me in—I went down with her and another constable, and behind the area door, in the passage leading to the kitchen, saw the prisoner, without his coat, hat, or shoes, which I found afterwards in the area—I asked him how he came there—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "How did you get in?"—he said, "I am fastened in"—I said, "How came your clothes outside?"—I was going to open the door to fetch them in—I found the window-shutter of the housekeeper's room pushed open, and the bottom sash pushed up at its full height—the bar was forced out of its place, by which a man could get into the house—the housemaid came down, we went up stairs into the back-parlour, and found the plate-drawer standing partly open—I saw a quantity of plate in the drawer, and as some things were missed from it, I looked, but could not find them myself—I told the prisoner he must go to the station-house—he said, "This is a b—bad job; I never was in custody before, but they cannot hurt me; have they lost any thing?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Can't they find it?"—I said, "Not at present"—he said, "I came all the way from Brentford; I could not get a loding, and thought I would come and sleep here the remainder of the night, and tell the maids about it in the morning"—I found a knife and three keys on him.</p>

                  </hi>. In October last I was in the employ of Henry Heath, a hatter, at No. 393, Oxford-street. On Saturday night, the 12th of Oc<lb/>tober, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, dressed as a butcher, in a blue frock, knee-breeches, and three-quarter boots—he looked like a butcher—he asked to look at some hats, which I shewed him—he chose two, which came to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I never saw him before—he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, as I thought—I gave it across the counter to Mr. Heath, and he gave him change, while I got the hats ready for him—I asked him if we should send them home for him—he said he had his horse and cart waiting outside, and he took them away in his hand—I looked out at the door—there was no horse or cart near, right nor left—I have not the least doubt of his being the person.</p>

In October last I was residing at No. 21, Alpha-road, St. John's-wood—the prisoner is the son of Mr. John Fitzgerald, of Romsey, Hampshire—his mother died on the 7th of October, and was buried on the 14th, at Highgate Cemetery—I am her executor. On the Saturday before the Mon<lb/>day of her interment the prisoner went from my house early in the morn<lb/>ing—he had been stopping at my house during the whole time his mother lay dead, sleeping in my room, at his own request, in a make-shift sort of bed—on that Saturday afternoon he came to my office in the City, within a very short time of three o'clock, either before or after, and we went together up to the Cemetery at Highgate, to see in what state of preparation the vault was—we went by a Holloway coach from the Bank—we remained at Highgate probably an hour—it took us rather more than an hour to go, as we had to cross the fields, after leaving the coach, to get to the Cemetery—it was dusk before we left the Cemetery—we crossed some brickfields into the Holloway-road, and returned by an omnibus to the Angel at Islington—we got out of that into a Paddington omnibus, which took us to the Nightingale public-house, Lisson-grove, which is very near my residence—it must have been after six o'clock when we got to my house—I should say nearer half-past six o'clock than other<lb/>wise—from the time that be came to me in the City about three o'clock down to half-past six o'clock, when he arrived at my house with me, he was never out of my company a moment—the afternoon was very humid, and the ground at the Cemetery was very wet—our boots were very muddy and wet—having to cross the fields twice they got more so, and having been on the ground adjoining thevault—I changed my boots the moment I got home, and I think he did—I put on another coat and waistcoat—I did</p>

               <p>is cook also principally—sometimes it is rather uncertain what time I dine, when I cannot say what time I shall be home to dinner—I go home at five o'clock, and it takes half-an-hour to get it ready then, but I invariably order dinner at five o'clock when I know I am coming home—if I had any thing particular to delay me I should say six o'clock, which is not unfrequently the case, from unexpected arrangements—on the morning of the 12th of October I left the prisoner at home—I think the next time I saw him was when he called at my office, about three o'clock, I think, at all events it was previous to the office hour—I am not sure it was so late as three o'clock—it might have been two o'clock, as I thought his time was of less consequence than mine, and I might have appointed two o'clock—it was more than one o'clock—I should say three o'clock was the more probable hour, but I could not swear it—I should not have thought of fixing one, because it would be uncertain whether I could go with him at that hour—about the 12th of October it gets dusk about five o'clock—we went from my office to the Bank, and got into a Holloway stags at the corner of Moorgate—we got out, I think, where the stage stops—I know we had a tolerable walk—we saw the superintendent and four or five workmen at the Cemetery, and the master—they were making the vault—I believe a person named Moore at the corner of Rathbone-place, was the un<lb/>dertaker—there was nobody there from the undertaker to meet us or receive directions—I did not expect to meet any body there—I thought the vault would be perfected—the place is quite open, so that any body can walk in—the superintendent was superintending the workmen at the time—he knew me perfectly—I bespoke the ground of him originally—he is not here—I understand he has left the Company—none of the workmen are here, to my knowledge—we returned to the Angel by the same description of stage, perhaps the very same—I have no doubt of the hour, but cannot say whether I looked at my watch, or heard some clock strike, but I am certain we did not get home till half-past six o'clock—the prisoner remained with me at dinner two hours—he never moved from the table—I do not think he was away more than three-quarters of an hour—the funeral was fixed for Monday—he wished it on Sunday—I thought it was hazardous, as the superintendent informed me if the men worked all night the vault should be ready, but I did not like to depend on that—I am not quite certain that the undertaker had previous directions for its being on Monday, unless he had earlier notice, for it was my wish all along to be on Monday, thinking it should be a week at least, but Mr. Fitzgerald wished it on Sunday—the prisoner's mother lived at my house—she died there, and was buried from there—the undertaker came on Sunday night for fresh instructions—he concluded, as he had not heard from us, that it was fixed for Monday—I was at home all Sunday, except going to church—I am not certain whether the prisoner went with me lo church—I have not the same man-servant now as I had then—he is gone to a farm in the neighbourhood—he is not here—he did not wait at table—the housekeeper did—I did not know the prisoner was in trouble till he was actually in custody—he wrote me a letter—I had no knowledge of the charge against him till he was in custody—I had written a letter to him at Romsey, on the faith that he was there—I was not before the Magistrate on his coming up for re-hearing—I was in the office, but not to give evidence—it was last Friday, when he was finally committed, I think.</p>

                  </hi>. In October-last I was Mr. Leat's housekeeper. I remember the death of Mrs. Fitzgerald, and the prisoner's coming to my master's house—he slept there all that week—the funeral was on Monday, the 14th of October—my master usually dined from five to half-past five o'clock, never before—he came home on the Saturday to dinner with the prisoner—they came home later than the usual dinner hour, it was past six o'clock—MR. Leat changed his clothes, and the prisoner asked me for slippers, as his feet were wet—he took off his boots, and I gave him slip<lb/>pen—it was seven o'clock, or after seven, when I took dinner in—I attended on them at dinner, and took away the cloth after dinner—they were an hour and a quarter at dinner—I took some coals in afterwards, and swept up the hearth about half-past eight o'clock—at that time the prisoner was still with Mr. Leat—I took tea in at half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner was not in the room then—the bell rang afterwards for some more hot water—I went into the room, and the prisoner was there then—that was about ten o'clock, I think—he did not go out any more that night to my knowledge—they went to bed about eleven o'clock—I took Mr. Leat's bed candle up.</p>

Leat told me I was to come here—he did not ask what I could tell—I told the attorney what I had to say, and he took it down—my master was not by then—the other female ser<lb/>vant did not attend at the table—the 7th of October was the first day the prisoner slept at our house—I cannot recollect when he went away, I think it was in December—I cannot recollect whether it was before Christ<lb/>mas—the first I heard of his uttering forged notes was when I saw it in the newspaper, on Saturday morning—MR. Leat never told me he had heard of such a thing.</p>

I am a hatter, and live in Homer-street, Crawford-street, near Bryanston-square—during the fall of the last year I have been in the habit of doing little jobs to hats for the prisoner. On a Saturday, about six months back, as near as I can guess, he came to my house, and had a new crape put on his hat—as near as I can guess it was nine o'clock at night—he brought the crape with him—my wife put it on—it would take me half-an-hour to walk from my house to the Oxford-street end of Newman-street, or nearly so—I walk fast—when the prisoner left my shop he went in the direction of St. John's-wood, not towards Oxford-street, but the reverse way.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Miss Ann Longfellow, No. 11, Berkeley-street west. On the 29th of January the prisoner came, between twelve and four o'clock, and gave his name as Henry—he said he had seen Miss Longfellow get into an omnibus, and she had sent him to clean two front bed-room windows, and that he was to get his dinner with me—I was servant of all work—I said I did not think Miss Longfellow had sent him to clean the windows, because she had a man who constantly cleaned them—he said she did, and I gave him some water and a cloth to go and clean them—I did not know him before—I am quite certain it was the prisoner—he went up and stopped till I got the dinner ready in the kitchen—I then called him—he came down, and went out for a pint of beer—when he had dined he helped me shake the stair carpets—he went up stairs again, and came down while I was cleaning the front parlour—he said he must go out a little while, and would come back and finish—he went out, and I looked after him, but could not see him—he never returned—he had not cleaned the windows—he left between two and three o'clock, as near as I can guess—I went up-stairs about five o'clock, and found a bundle of shoes on the bed which 1 had never seen before—Miss Longfellow came back between nine and ten o'clock—I told her what had occurred—she went up-stairs directly, with me, and discovered that her boxes were broken open—I saw that myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live in Turner's-place, near the City saw-mills. On the evening of the 23rd of March I went out with a friend to buy a hat, we then met with some loose characters and they got into conversation—I think there were three ladies—I treated them to some gin and cloves—we went to three public-houses—I do not know the sign of the last, but it was near the turnpike—I came out and accompanied the prisoner whom I had become acquainted with at the second public-house, and he had gone with us to the last public-house—I went with him to the end of Henrietta-street, where he asked me to lend him half-a-crown—I would not—he then asked me to lend him half-a-crown on his watch—I was hesitating about it and he snatched the half-crown from my hand as I was about to return it to my pocket—he then knocked me down—the officer came and found me bleeding.</p>

On the 28th of February I came home about half-past six o'clock from work—I found her drunk, and said, "You have been drink<lb/>ing"—she said she had not, and got up to scratch my face—I said, "You have scratched my face many times, if you do it I will knock you down"—she sat down for half a minute, and seized the poker with her right hand—I saw it, and having had it twice before, I tried to get out at the door—she went round the table, and knocked me down on the sofa with the poker, which she held in both hands—she struck me over the head with it, and said, "Take that, you b——"—I was insensible for several mi<lb/>nutes, and when I came to myself she said I had better go to the doctor's—I opened the door, and got down somehow or other, and when I got to the bottom the landlady said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "My wife has struck me with the poker"—she put me on a chair, and bathed my head with some water—it bled violently—I afterwards went to Mr. Healey, the surgeon, who dressed my wound—I had given her no provocation but what I have stated.</p>

At the time in question I lived in Frith-street, in the parish of St. Ann Westminster—the prisoner was my servant of all work for between two and three months—on Sunday the 15th of March I Vent out about half-past six o'clock, leaving my cash-box in a drawer in my bed-room—she had access to the room, and had seen me every evening take my cash-box up stairs—it contained 3 sovereigns, 19 shillings, in silver, a bill for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a great number of papers, and a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forged note—I saw them safe on Saturday night about twelve o'clock—the drawer was not looked, but the box was—I went out at half-past six o'clock—came back about half-past eight, and met Hawkins at my door—in consequence of what he said I went up stairs and called the prisoner down—she was up in her bed-room—I asked her what she bad been doing—she said, "Oh, Mr. Fox, I have broke open your tin box"—I asked what she bad done with the papers and contents—she said, "Come up stairs, I will show you; the devil tempted me at the moment, and you can do what you like with me"—I went up and found the cash-box replaced, but broken open, and all the contents, except 1 half-crown in it—the forged note was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Boston-street, Regent's-park. On a Saturday, early in March, I was returning from Portman-square, going up Baker-street, close to the wall—the chapel clock struck five when I was in Port<lb/>man-square—I had a reticule in my hand, twisted round my arm, and the cord round my two fingers—a man threw his person upon me, almost felled me to the ground, and dragged at my reticule two of three times—he could not get it off, as he would have broken my arm if he did—it was a new re<lb/>ticule, with a yellow silk cord—his hat was over his face—I could not recognise his face—a woman was standing by the chapel—I called out, "Come and help me there," A thief—she stood like a statue, and never moved—he afterwards joined that woman—he did not leave me when I called out, but he squeezed my throat, and pressed me against the iron railing of the empty house which he attacked me at—I said, "Help, help!"—he said, "I will help you, if you will give me your bag"—I said, "Will I give you the bag? You shall try hard for it first"—he squeezed me almost to death, 1 have never had a day's health since—my arms have been black and blue for six weeks—I was full half-an-hour struggling with him, and not an omnibus or any thing passing all the time—nobody came to my assistance—it is most extraordinary—he took my reticule, with all the contents, from roe, and ran off with it—he snapped the cord, and all my fingers were cut, and my hand cut, as if it was with a knife—here is the mark now—he disabled me so, he got my reticule at last—there was a crimson silk purse in it, one sovereign of George the Fourth, quite a new half-sovereign of Queen Victoria, and, I think, five half-crowns—I had changed a sovereign in the morning, to buy some tea—there was also an emerald brooch in the bag, with a pearl, a large key of the house, and a pocket-handkerchief—I got up to Fin lay's public-house, and I saw him go up Adam-street with the woman—she opened the door of a house without knocking, and went in, and presently I saw the reticule thrown up in the air—he threw it into some house he was acquainted with—I do not know where it fell—I lost sight of it, but did not lose sight of him—I could not speak, I was so disabled—I saw Webster, the witness, and said, "Be so kind as to run after that man and woman, and say he has got my reticule"—I pointed the prisoner out to Webster—I continued on that side till a policeman came up to me, and said, "Make haste up, a young carpenter has secured the man"—I had not lost sight of him—I saw the carpenter take him—I saw him scuffle with him, and beating him, and trying to get away from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a copper-plate printer, and live in Skinner-street. On the 7th of March I was passing the prosecutor's shop on my way home, from half-past eleven to twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner in company with another young man—in a moment or two after I passed I saw him taking some cigars out of a hole in the window—he gave them to the other young man, who went away to the Wellington public-house in Shoreditch—I followed, and when I got to Worship-street the young man dropped some—I picked up some of them—I afterwards showed the policeman the spot, and he found one there—as I went in at the door of the Wellington public-house the other man came out—I afterwards met him outside with the prisoner—he bad nothing in his hands when he came out—he had taken them fn there—he escaped—I went back to the public-house again afterwards, and found the prisoner there—he was se<lb/>cured.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Flying Horse public-house, in Oxford-street.

On the 4th of April, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning, I had been cleaning the pots, and left them on the pot-horse—in consequence of what I was told, I went into the skittle-ground, where the pot-horse was—I heard some pots rattle, and went to the door of the water-closet—I saw the prisoner standing inside, with one pot in his hand, two on the seat, and one pot was on a form in the skittle-ground, about two feet from where the prisoner was—I asked what he was going to do with the pots—he said he did not know—he handed me the one from his hand, and said there were two more on the seat—I said I saw there were—he said he knew no<lb/>thing of them—I said I was sure he must, and collared him—he then went on his knees, begged pardon, and said if he came before a Jury they would take my word before his.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clerk in the prize-office at Chelsea Hospital in April, 1835—I continued there till the beginning of 1837, when there was a reduction of clerks, and I was put on a superan<lb/>nuation allowance—it was my duty to answer the applications of persons for prize-money, and for that purpose I had access to the prize lists, which would show the regiments, and the persons belonging to them entitled to receive prize-money which was not already received—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to the Hospital in 1835, and before that—he had the opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the mode in which business was done—I know Beresford Eaton, he has been a navy agent—I had seen Mr. Flinn repeatedly as an applicant for prize-money, and I was intro<lb/>duced to him by Mr. Eaton more intimately—I entered into an arrange<lb/>ment with Mr. Eaton and Lieutenant Flinn about information to be given by me with respect to prize-money—the agreement in the first instance was to furnish the names of some soldiers entitled to Diamante prize-money—Diamante is on the coast of Calabria—I was to receive two and a half per cent. for the information I furnished in that case—it was merely for giving information, whether they got any thing or not—after that I saw the prisoner more frequently—there was afterwards an arrangement</p>

               <p>made between Mr. Eaton and myself, on the subject of information as to the names of officers who were entitled to prize-money—that occa<lb/>sionally included non-commissioned officers—it was about persons entitled to prize-money of right, and also which had been forfeited by the lapse of time—I was to have five per cent. for that—I received a per-centage from Mr. Flinn himself on one occasion—I have frequently received a per<lb/>centage from Mr. Eaton—among other names which I furnished to Mr. Eaton, I gave him the same of George Langly, a sergeant in the St. Helena infantry, and also the amount of prize-money he was-entitled to.</p>

Q.</hi> How long were you in the office at the Hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went in 1821, and left in 1837—it was Mr. Eaton who first applied to me for information respecting prize-money—the first proposal was made about the Diamante prize-money—the first offer made to me was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I declined that, and said I would do it at a per-centage—Mr. Eaton made that offer for the information respecting the Diamante prize-money—Mr. Eaton frequently paid me a per-centage—I should think I have received from Mr. Eaton 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—my salary as clerk was 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year at first, and then 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no undertaking with any prize agent but Mr. Eaton for giving information, I swear that—I have taken this per-centage for the last five or six years that I was in the office—I never received any money from any agent except Mr. Eaton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I presume it is quite in accordance with the rules of the office that clerks were allowed to give information, and receive a per-centage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is contradictory to the rules of the office—none of the other clerks knew of that arrangement of mine, to my knowledge—I did not tell them of it—I did not receive any letter about Langly, nor did I see it—I was not aware the application had been made until the money was demanded—I had nothing to do with the corresponding department—I did not refer to any book to ascertain whether the man was dead before I paid the money</p>

               <p>—I will swear it—it is possible, if there was a mark of "dead" against that name on the list, I might have put that mark, but I certainly never referred—I took the name from a book before the money was paid, and entered it in a private memorandum-book of my own—I do not know whether the mark of "dead"—was against it then—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the original book</hi>)—there is no mark against that same—this is the book I copied the memorandum from—I do not think any body was present but Mr. Eaton, Mr. Flinn, and myself, when he asked me about the sergeant's prize-money—I have never received any per-centage on that money—I did not ask Mr. Eaton for it—I mentioned the circumstance to him when the money was paid, and he said he had not received it—I then mentioned it to Mr. Flinn, and he said he knew nothing about it—I should think it is eight or nine months back that I was first applied to for information as to this, it is since I have left the office—I think I then told all I knew, as I have to-day—I told it shortly afterwards—MR. Bicknell, the solicitor, applied to me—I wrote to him, and gave him the information—I first saw him personally, and told him I had abstracted some names, and into whose hands I placed them—I think I mentioned Lieut. Flinn's name in my letter to Mr. Bicknell, but not in my first interview, nor Mr. Eaton's—there was a suspicion against me—I do not think I have been threatened with a prosecution in respect to this transaction—there were several cases of this sort—whether this is one of which they entertained suspicion against me I do not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been generally threatened with a prosecution on account of the part you took in these transactions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, yes, perhaps—I be<lb/>lieve I have, but I did not understand you distinctly—I know I have acted in breach of my duty, contrary to Act of Parliament, and believe it is in the power of the Hospital to punish me—I believe I have not been threatened that I should be prosecuted and punished—there has never been a distinct threat made to me—I do not think Mr. Bicknell has ever said any thing distinctly to me about prosecuting me for it—he has certainly told me what he could do, but never told me, "I will do it," that I recollect—he has told me I am liable to be punished—I told Mr. Bicknell that I had received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for per-centage—he is perfectly acquainted with that—he has seen it from my own memorandum, and I have admitted it—Mr. Bicknell has my private memorandums—I did not give them to him—they were taken from me—my house was searched, I think, last May or June, the same day that Mr. Bicknell saw me, I think—I was not at home at the time—it was after that that I wrote to Mr. Bicknell on the subject—I wrote to him shortly after giving him an account of the transaction, it was not so full an account as I afterwards gave him—I think in Decem<lb/>ber I gave him the fullest account—that referred to a great number of other cases—he urged me to tell him all I knew.</p>

               <p>when I received the wound I did not cry out—I stood—somebody held me up, or I should have fallen—I did not hear him say any thing—he seemed to say some words exultingly, and then turned round and went from me—I went after him when I recovered a little, and said, "Why did you shoot me?"—he said, "Oh, it is only dust-shot"—the two young men, the pri<lb/>soner, I and my companions, then all went over the bridge together—he took off my handkerchief, and wiped the blood from under my eye, and said, "Oh, you are not hurt much, I see"—we then went on about three hun<lb/>dred yards—he then gave up the gun to one of the other young men who said something to him—he said, in answer, "Oh, I knew it was loaded, but it was only dust shot"—I afterwards said, "If you are any thing of a man you will come to a doctor's with me—when we got to the City-of<lb/>Paris public-house, the man with the gun went away—I, the prisoner, and another young man went up to the end of the pathway and the other young man then left—I and the prisoner were together with my two companions—we went to see a doctor, but he was not at home—before that I sent my brother to look for a policeman—after standing outside the doctor's about ten minutes the prisoner said he wanted to go borne, and if we wanted him we were to come to his house for him, and he would tell us where he lived—I said I could not leave him—I believe he told me where he lived, but I do not recollect where it was—we then crossed the street, and stood on the other side—we went to the Rising Sun public-house, at the corner of Globe-lane—we waited outside either ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he then wanted to go home—several people standing round said I must not let him go—we then went up to Bethnal-green church—there the policeman and my brother came up, and I gave him in charge—we then went up to several doctor's, who were not at home—we then went to the station-house, and Dr. Storey took about forty shots from my right arm, he examined my eye, and sent me to the hospital, where I have been ever since.</p>

Tinkler asked if he had taken these things—he made no answer—MR. Tinkler said he was not well, and I should wait till his son came from church, to go up stairs with the prisoner to search his box—when his son came we went up and found the locks and keys, and three keys fell from the prisoner on the floor—I took them up, and told the prisoner he dropped them—he said, "No, they dropped from the bed"—I said, "No, they are warm," then he said he had dropped them, and he had found them in an out-house—I found they unlocked the store-cupboard, the wardrobe, and the cellaret; and then the mystery was how the wine could be got out of the cellar, as we had no key that unlocked that—while we were in the passage, Mr. Tinkler's son came out and said the mystery was solved, that the key of the wine-cellar was in the store-room—the prisoner then acknowledged that he took the wine, and we did not go down to see.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you employed any body else to try to get the money for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A Mr. Howard, a person who cleared the brandy, promised me to pass the papers, to get back the duty—I do not think he did it at all, he only said he would do it—he is the person who took me to Mr. Cole—I never bought any thing of the prisoner—I paid 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Dillon and M'Donald within a month from this time—that was after this correspond<lb/>ence—the fact is, the prisoner charged me with three-quarter casks of</p>

               <p>wine, to make out a bill against me, and thinking my name was mixed up with two most respectable merchants, rather than my name should appear shuffling, I went to the gentlemen, and told them, as my name was men<lb/>tioned as buying the wine of them, I would take the casks, though I never ordered them, and I paid the money to Dillon and M'Donald—it was for wine purchased in my name by the prisoner—I paid it in consequence of seeing a letter from the prisoner, in which their names were mentioned—I have had the article.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of the certificates in the Long Room of the Custom House—I have the custody and delivery of the over-entry certificates. On the 25th of January a person applied to me in the name of Cabburn for an over-entry certificate—it was not the prosecutor—I told him I would give it on his producing the particulars, which are, the name of the ship, the voyage, when the duty was paid, and the amount required to be returned—without that I could not give the necessary paper—the party who got the papers from me did produce those particulars, and repre<lb/>sented himself as Cabburn, the proprietor of the lot—I delivered the certi<lb/>ficate to him—I made it out myself, and entered it in my book—this is the certificate I entered on that occasion—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Receiver-general's office in the Custom-house. I know the prisoner perfectly well—I recollect seeing him on the 25th of January in the Receiver-general's office—there was a person with him, who I do not know—it was not the prosecutor, I am quite sure—the prisoner presented this certificate to me—it was signed, "J. B. Cabburn"—all the parties named in the document, except Cabburn, are public officers—I asked the prisoner whether the person with him was the party named in this document—he said, "This is Mr. Cabburn," turn<lb/>ing round—I then required the prisoner to put his name to it—MR. Cabburn's name was already to it, and the prisoner put his name under it, in my presence—in consequence of that, I kept the certificate, and de<lb/>livered a ticket for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner—that ticket would authorize the prisoner to receive the money—the office requires the party himself to attend, unless he gives authority to any agent or party known at the office, but previous to doing that, his name must be registered at the office, and also the party authorised, and the document itself must be signed by the party—it does not authorise any agent to give a receipt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Ratcliff-highway. The prosecutrix was brought to me on the night of Wednesday, the 8th, to have her face dressed—her nose was cut across, at least it was divided—the bridge was broken, and her lip divided in two places—they were contused wounds, not such as a person would receive by a fall in the street—there are three distinct wounds—the one across the nose is a transverse one, the other longitudinal, and the other oblique—the cut on the upper lip was oblique and fiat over, so that the force must have been applied upwards, and there is an excoriation on the nose upwards, which would not occur in a fall—it was certainly not done by falling on the ground—this key would produce such appearances—it must have been applied with considerable violence—the wounds correspond with the key, and the key is stained with blood now.</p>

I remember Gaspar came home with the prosecutor—Hazell was in the house at the time—I heard them talk together most of the evening, they said it would be a pity for any one to meddle with his clothes, and they would take care no one should—they drank together—the prosecutor wanted some supper, and the prisoners fetched a loaf and some sausages—the prosecutor gave them the money—about two o'clock Hazell came into my room, and took off his shoes, and left them by my bed-side—I do not know whether he put on the boots—he went to <hi rend="italic">Sal's</hi> bed-side, and said to her, "Get up, we are going to <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> the sailor"—she said she would have nothing to do with it—about six o'clock in the morning the prosecutor came into my room, and asked me where the man was that brought him there—I said he slept in the next room, and the prisoners were gone, they had not come to bed at all that night.</p>

I took him to where I lodged; we had our supper, and I said to him, "If you will take my advice, put your clothes under your head, as we always do;" he was taken to bed by the servant-girl, who has run away since; there was no light in the room, and he could not see me; he never said one word when he saw this man take his boots; Brown is not to be believed—she says she heard me say I was going to rob the sailor, and why did she not tell the man by the side of her to go and tell the sailor? She said she would get me transported.</p>

About eight o'clock in the evening, of the 30th of March I saw these socks safe just inside the door—I saw them unusually working up and down—I ran to the door, and saw the prisoner with another lad run off—I followed, and saw the prisoner throw these socks up Marylebone-lane—I followed, and took him—they are called half-hose in the trade—some people call them socks.</p>

On the 10th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock, the two prisoners came to my shop and asked my daughter-in-law to serve them—I saw the thread lace box on the counter before them—they asked my daughter to go to the other end of the shop for something else, and while she was gone, Puddick took five cards of thread lace off the counter and gave them to Curry, who concealed them under her right arm, under her shawl—I saw them—I was in the parlour at the back of the shop—I came up and fixed my eye on Curry—I saw she had the lace under her right arm as she was sitting on the seat—seeing she was discovered, she burst into tears, took the lace from under her arm, and put it on the counter.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 17th of March, I went to Mr. Tem<lb/>pleman's cottage, at half-past eight o'clock, with two sheets of writing-paper—I knocked at the door, but received no answer—MR. Templeman used to sleep in the further room from a cottage inhabited by Mrs. Jarvis, and the further room from the door—the door opens into one room, and then you go into the other—there is a window to the bed-room—when I received no answer I went to the bed-room window, and found it shut down as usual—there was a short curtain to it inside—I was too short to see over the cur<lb/>tain—I then went to the sitting-room window, and found it open—I then returned home, and told my mother what I had observed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brown-buildings, Islington. I accompanied Mr. Lord and a policeman to Mr. Templeman's cottage, about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock—the policeman got through the window, opened the door, and let us in—I saw the deceased with only a shirt on, lying with his feet towards the fire-place, and his head towards the door of the room—the body was in the bed-room, towards the door, which is between the two rooms—he was lying on his back, rather inclining to the left side, lacing the window—his eyes were firmly bandaged with a stocking—if he had been alive, he could not have seen—there was a good deal of blood on the stocking, which I think must have been saturated with the blood on the floor, after it was tied on his eyes—I have no doubt his head had fallen on the floor, and the stocking got into the blood—his hands were securely tied by a cord in this posture—(<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—a small cord secured the other cord fastened between the wrists, through a noose in the cord, to make it more secure—I did not notice the wrists then—I did after the cord was removed, and they were galled, and the hands and nails blue—that would unquestionably show that it had been put on during life—I have no doubt he struggled—the blueness would be occasioned by the pressure of the cord—I observed several bruises on his face, a severe blow over the left temple, and a cut on the nose—the lower jaw was fractured on both sides—I observed four clean cuts on the back of the head, and one or two bruises on the breast bone, in conjunction with the collar-bone—his knees were much abraised, rubbed up, as he had, no doubt, been struggling on the floor—there was some blood on the floor immediately under the deceased's head—I should say perhaps ten ounces—the wounds would most likely continue to bleed some time—there was no contused wound on the left temple to cause the blood—I have no doubt a good deal of the blood came from the jaw, and also the clean cuts on the back of the head—the blow on the temple was most probably given by a blunt round instrument, similar to a policeman's staff—it might be done by a piece of wood—the same instrument might have produced the fracture of the jaw, and one blow might produce both fractures—I think the wound on the nose was from a kick, or something of that description, not done by a sharp instrument—the wounds on the back of the head were inflicted by a very sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they inflicted as with a knife, as if a person had cut, or a hatchet, as if they had struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Neither—I should say like a chisel, as if a chisel had been struck on the back of the head.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any teeth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I found one on the pillow, with a great deal of blood round it, and another on a chair, with a few spots of blood—I was present when a third was found by the police<lb/>man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060207"/>
               <p>—I examined the jaw, and found three teeth had been forced from the sockets—they were not front, but tide teeth—I think that was very probably done by the blow which produced the fractures—there were se<lb/>veral blows about the mouth, and I think one while he was lying in bed, from the circumstance of the tooth being found on the pillow, and the blood there—the tooth on the chair was as if it had fallen out when he got out of bed—I found a small piece of stick, about two inches and a half or three inches long, with hair attached to it, and saturated with blood—it was the hair of the head—it was dark hair—I can scarcely call it grey—this is the piece of splinter—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is hair on it now—a kick from the heel or toe of a shoe might have made the cut on the nose, if there were nails in it, and I think it might be done by a shoe or boot without nails—from the appearance of the body when I saw it, I should judge it had been dead fire or six hours—it retained a little warmth about the region of the heart—the body was quite cold—the time in which a body gets cold depends occasionally on the kind of death the person meets with—a body has retained warmth occasionally two days after death—ten or eleven hours is not at all an unusual time—I have no doubt, had the body remained in bed, it would have been warm a long time after it was—MR. Lord accompanied me—he was also present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the injuries which I saw on the body, produced death—I have no doubt the death was owing to the violence I have de<lb/>scribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the stocking fastened round the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was tied in a knot twice—the knot was formed in the stocking itself—the blow on the temple was above the stocking, over the temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it your judgment, as a man of experience, that the body had been dead about five or six hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is—I should ra<lb/>ther say a body would be more likely to retain heat two days where the party came to his death by violent means—a body would of course be more likely to get cold on the floor than in bed—it was a very cold night on Monday, and morning too—I should think there was not sixteen ounces of blood altogether on the pillow and floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the piece of stick is mahogany? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am no judge—it is saturated with blood, and the character of the wood is altered—it is splin<lb/>tered off a round stick—there is no doubt of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, would the blows you saw on the deceased occasion instant death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe the blow over the left temple would occasion instant death—I did not observe whether there was any matting or carpet on the floor—he might have been dead more than five or six hours—it is mere matter of opinion—saw nothing to render it improbable that he had been dead a longer time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It may have been fifteen, ten, or five or six, but it must have been five or six, that is what you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it could not have been less than five or six—I do not know whether it might have been fifteen, it is a very difficult question to answer—I should rather not pledge myself to a few hours, more or less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED LORD</hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Trinidad-place, Islington. I was present at Mr. Templeman's cottage with Mr. Roe, and saw the state in which the body was—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—in my judgment he died of the wounds I saw—the blow on the left temple would alone be sufficient to produce death—it produced concussion of the brain, and extravasation of blood—he would not be able to stir after that,</p>

               <p>the same blow producing a fracture of the skull, he could not struggle af<lb/>terwards—the struggling with the arms and knees must have been before—after the blow which fractured the jaw there might have been a good deal of struggling.</p>

Tuesday morning, and was there with the surgeons—I have produced the splinter of wood—it was cut at the police-office—I have had it examined, according to the prisoner's request, by a turner, who gave his opinion that it is "red saunders"—he described it as a very heavy close wood, coming from New South Wales—I searched the drawers in the deceased's sitting-room—the top drawer on the left hand side had been broken open apparently by a chisel or small crow-bar or something—I found in it two boxes, a quantity of papers, and two notes of the Bank of Elegance—one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—this is the mahogany box—it has a lock to it—it is not broken—it was shut when I found it, but unlocked—I found the key of it in the deceased's trowsers pocket—I do not think any violence had been offered to the lock—there are also a quantity of papers, bills, and memorandums—I found no money in the drawers, but in his trowsers pocket was a purse with three sixpences—that was in the same pocket with the key—the papers were apparently tumbled about a good deal—these notes, folded up in this way look like notes of the Bank of England—I thought they were so when I first found them—behind the door of the sitting room I found a chopper and a hammer in the corner between the outer door and the bed-room door—I do not think they had been used—I also found a hammer in the cupboard on the top of some clothes—that did not appear to have been used—I found no piece of wood except this—I found no weight except two clock weights—they were round at the bottom and flat at the top—they were in the further cor<lb/>ner of the sitting room, attached to the clock—I did not find any other weights in the bed-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Duchess of Kent public-house, Devereux-street, Dover-road, where I have been seven weeks—it is about four miles from Mr. Templeman's cottage—I have known the prisoner from seven to eight months—I saw him on the 12th or 13th of last March, I am not positive which—I think it was the 12th, Thursday—he came to the Duchess of Kent public-house about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and called fur half-a-pint of porter, and put down a penny, saying he had no more money—I did not take the money—I brought him a pint of porter—I then went out to deliver my beer—I returned about half-past eight o'clock—the prisoner was then standing on the outside, opposite the house, talking to a young man, a potman in the neighbourhood, named Richard Squires—there was no conversation between them after I came up—we had some porter together—as soon as we had had the pot of porter between us three, the prisoner and I walked up the street together—while we were walking together he said he had been ill, and was without money, and for want of money he was getting worse—he stated that he knew an old man who had got money—I asked him how he knew he had got money—he said he had heard he had bid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a cottage, and he had <hi rend="italic">flashed</hi> a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said if that was not enough he had got more—the prisoner said that he had put the notes into a drawer, and it would be like a gift to him, for he knew where to put his hand on it—he said he should like to have a right one along with him—I said, "A right one!"—he said, "Yes, a right one, or I could do it myself"—I asked him where the old gentleman lived—he said, "Oh, not far."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>at the time, and after Izod left, he lived in this cottage till his cottage was built—MR. Tiffin was building this cottage for him while he lived in Izod's—he took possession of the new cottage about two years back—I have known him as long as that—that is the only cottage into which he shifted—when I first knew him I was living at Mr. Ralph's, the William the Fourth public-house, at the corner of Park-street and Minerva-place—I left there because I got another situation—I did not like it—there was no other reason for my leaving—I went after that to the Craven Arms pub<lb/>lic-house, Bayswater—I was about twenty-six weeks at Mr. Ralph's the first time—I did not go with a character to the other place—I was eleven months at the Craven Arms public-house—after leaving there I went to work for Mr. Ralph a week, till he got a man, and then I went to the Hope and Anchor public-house, Islington—the landlord left the house, and Mr. Walton took it, and there were a few words between us, and I left—there was no charge against me—the words were about stopping out a few hours—I stopped out between four and eight o'clock—I went away of my own accord—the words were with Mr. Walton, who keeps the house—there had been no charge against me of any kind—there has been a charge, but it was not from Mr. Walton—it was from the Duke of York public-house, Glou<lb/>cester-street—I asked permission to go out; while I was out, a cash-box was lost, and when I returned home I was taken up on suspicion, and charged with stealing it—that might be between four and five years ago—there has been nothing further—I never was in custody before, nor yet charged with any thing—I lived at the City of London public-house—I was not in custody respecting any thing there—it it at the corner of Syd<lb/>ney-street and Dalby-terrace—I left there to take a beer-shop, after nine years' service—I left of my own accord—there was a cellar there—nothing was said about my conduct in that cellar—that I swear—that is somewhere about the time after I came out of Hatton-garden office—I went to live there again—I lived there about ten months—I opened the beer-shop be<lb/>fore I went to the Duke of York public-house, but it did not succeed—I know Mr. Jarvis's cottage very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long before the night Mr. Templeman lost his life, were you in Pocock's-fields do you think? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 9th or 10th I was there—I went to visit Mr. Allen of Wilson-cottage—I had lodged there some time before—there are two rooms in Allen's cottage and, an old back kitchen, and a wash-house adjoining it—there is about half an acre of garden—the privy is in the wash-house, adjoining the bed-room—you can go from the parlour into the little, kitchen into it, and you can go into the garden to get to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned something about what the prisoner said about a drawer, do you mean to say he said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I recollected that in my statement at the time I was at Hatton-garden at my last evidence—I think I recollected it at the time I was at Hatton-garden—I am certain I did—I have been twice to Hatton-garden—the first time was on a Satur<lb/>day—the Saturday after Mr. Templeman's body had been found on the Tuesday—I did not recollect it when I first went—I do not know any thing of this little mahogany box—I am not positive that I ever heard of a mahogany box—I think, but I have never mentioned it, because I was not positive of hearing of it—I can read—I have read an account of this in the newspapers—I read the newspapers between my first and se<lb/>cond</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you aware that in the conversation you say took place a rob<lb/>bery was intended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I understood his intent was to commit a robbery—it was mentioned only in my bearing—I did not suppose any violence was to be done to the old gentleman—I understood him to mean by "a right one," somebody to assist him, that he could depend upon—I understood there was to be a robbery only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you shocked at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I took very little notice of it—I named it to Squires when I went round at nine o'clock, and said I did not know whether it was intended or not—Squires lives at the Two Brewers public-house, the next house—I did not name it to any police<lb/>man—Squires said he did not think if he had any intention he would have named it—Squires is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think it was a joke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think he was joking—I took no notice of what he said, till I named it to Squires at nine o'clock, and neither of us took notice of it—it never entered my mind till I read—till I heard of the murder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic"> Q.</hi> Why name it to Squires if you thought nothing about it, and if you did think any thing about it why did you not name it to a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I named it to Squires, and it did not enter my mind afterwards till Squires told me he had read in the paper of a murder, and I read of it when I got home—I first heard of it on the Wednesday—Squires had read the paper, and named it to me—I do not know James Rogers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why should you object to let him the house if you had the letting of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he is a man so often out of work, and could not afford to pay his rent—I have been in business about twenty-four or twenty-five years, not always colouring religious prints, but latterly I have done them—I have done some thousands of prints for Mr. Fairburn, No. 110, Mino<lb/>ries, principally religious prints—I have occasionally done maps, plans, and charts—that is the only trade I have been in—I never kept a shop—I have been eleven years in my present lodging—I have a wife and family living with me—I have three children out of eight—they live as well as they can since my work has been stopped—my work has been stopped since this fatal occurrence—I have had one little job since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why could you not colour prints notwithstanding this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On account of my giving evidence—it got into the newspapers, and my master stopped the work—I suspect so—I do not buy and sell things at all—I never did to my knowledge—I bought this coat the other day, and I might sell it to-morrow—I bought every thing I have got on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you thought he really meant nothing, how came you to tell him he would be transported if he did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why he would if he did it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you considered he was in fun? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think he was in much fun—I did not think he was in earnest—he has laughed and joked with me many times before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you really think him in fun or earnest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should firmly believe now that he did mean it, but I did not believe he meant it at the moment—I should sooner say he was in joke than in earnest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why persuade him not to do it, then, and tell him he would be transported? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said if he did it he would be transported.</p>

               <p>nailing them about a fortnight before—they were then getting the worse or wear, still they were wearable—I had seen them everyday on his feet—at the time I saw him nailing them they were fit for wear, I am certain, and would have lasted much longer for nice fine weather than for wet—I have no recollection whether he went out alone or in company that morning—I have no recollection of seeing any body before he went out—the next time I saw him was, as near as I can tell, on the Tuesday morning about three o'clock—I was then lying in my own bed, and my wife likewise—he came into the house—it was very light at the time, the moon shining—it was the lightness of the moon—the instant he came into the house he went into his bed-room, as the door opens into the room—he opens his bed-room door and closes the front door while he passes to his bed-room—my wife said to him, "Richard, it is early," or "late," I am not sure which, and his reply was, "It is early"—nothing more passed—the next time I saw him was, I believe, between eight and nine o'clock on the Tuesday morning—we have no clock to judge the time, but as near as I can tell I saw him between eight and nine—I got up between six and seven—he got up between eight and nine—I was in my sitting room—he came into it, passed through, and went to the wash-house—the wash-house leads to the privy and to the back-yard—he remained in the wash-house, as near as I can tell, from twenty five minutes to half-an-hour—when he came out of his bed-room he had his coat and waistcoat on his arm, and I believe his boots in his hand, but I am not certain whether they were on his feet or in his hand—when he returned, he came through the room where I was sitting at breakfast, and went out at the front door—he went straight from the wash-house to the front door and went out—I observed nothing particular about him when he went out—I believe he had on the same clothes he has now—he had on the same shoes as I had made him, but they were blacked—when he was in a situation he blacked them every morning, but not at other times—how he got the brushes to clean them I do not know, but the brushes were in the back place when he was gone—they were my brushes and blacking—if he used it, it was my blacking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether, on this night, he used any candle or rush-light to go to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw Richard have a candle in our house all the time he was in it, unless he asked for such a thing, and that was very seldom—if he wanted one it was merely for a minute to get something out of the room, and he was supplied by our candle which stood on the table—I have not found any candle or rush-light about my premises since that night—he returned about a quarter past seven o'clock on the Tuesday evening, much about that time—I had heard of the murder about half-past ten, or near eleven o'clock—when the prisoner came home I was gone to fetch a pint of por<lb/>ter and a rasher of bacon for supper—when I returned he was sitting in my room talking to my wife—the conversation when I came into the house was, I believe; on the subject of the murder—the first time, I believe, I spoke, or Richard spoke to me, was, "It is a shocking thing: do you consider he could not have done it himself?"—the reply I made was, "Richard, how could it be possible for persons to do such things themselves, having their hands tied and their eyes blindfolded; is it likely?"—that is all the con<lb/>versation I remember between Richard and me, till afterwards—he was sitting at the table a few minutes after, then got up and went into the back place—he went through the wash-house, as if he was going to the privy—he said his inside was out of order, and he went out at the door as if</p>

               <p>going to the privy—he did not remain there more than six or seven minutes—I mentioned to my wife a circumstance which had occurred, and when he came back and sat down I was eating some bacon on a piece of bread—I cut off a piece of bacon—it fell on my knee, and went a contrary way to him—I then cut another piece, and it went towards his legs—I did it pur<lb/>posely, to satisfy myself of something I thought concerning him, that he had got a new pair of shoes—I had a suspicion that he knew some<lb/>thing about it—then I did a thing which I have no doubt he under<lb/>stood, I took the candle off the table, and put it between his legs—he directly put up his legs and hid his shoes behind the legs of the chair, and then began the conversation—he said he had been over the water to see his cousin, who had a pair of shoes which did not fit him, and he had jumped into them—before that, he said he should like to have something to eat, and asked if I would go and fetch him a slice of bacon and a pot of beer—I said, "Richard, why not go yourself and fetch it?"—he said, "You know I don't want to go out"—I knew that there was an assault warrant out against him—I fetched him a slice of bacon, a pot of beer, and half-an-ounce of tobacco—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it—he said he had been over to Clapham, Limehouse, Blackwall, and that way, and called on hit cousins and aunts, and they had given him some money—he did not say how much—after I had fetched the beer we had some conversation respecting the preceding night, what a shocking, dread<lb/>ful affair it was, how any body could have committed such a horrible crime—it was no more than common conversation respecting the murder—the con<lb/>versation took place chiefly with my wife—I did not pay attention, my at<lb/>tendon was engaged at that time—I recollect asking Richard how it was he was so late—he said he had been to Mr. Frimley's till twelve o'clock, and when he came from there he lit on some friends who detained him—I should say he was in bed before nine o'clock on Tuesday night, or about that time—when he had gone to bed, in consequence of suspicions I entertained, I bolted him in—I did not give information at all—the policemen came at eleven o'clock that night, as near as I can tell, and took him—I had at one time a cheese-knife in my possession, which I have since found—I had also a piece of wood in my possession—I believe it was plum-tree or damson, rather better than a foot and a half long, and about two and a I half inches wide, with sharp edges, and flat—it was very smooth—the edges were sharp—it was to set seams with—it is a heavy wood—I used it in my business.</p>

               <p>was in conversation with the prisoner that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I went to fetch some beer, therefore I could not—I went to fetch the beer and bacon after he came home—it was not his bacon I cut when I disco<lb/>vered his shoes, it was my own bacon—I did that while the prisoner was sitting at the table, before I went to fetch his bacon—I believe I ate my own supper before I fetched his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time had there been any conversation about the murder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The conversation might have been about the murder, but I took very little notice of any of the conversation, therefore am not bound to answer the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you to answer the question, had any conversation taken place about the murder before, as you say, you cut the bacon, and saw his new shoes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already answered that the conversation when I entered the house was on that subject, but I paid so little attention to the conversation between my wife and the prisoner, that probably I could not utter fifty words of the conversation the whole evening, unless the prisoner spoke to me—I mean, I could not utter fifty words of the conversation between the prisoner and my wife, except I had the leading point to lead to it, named—there was a good deal of conversation between him and my wife—I had some suspicion at the time I discovered the new shoes—I cannot say whether it was after that that I went and fetched the bacon for the prisoner—I believe I had eaten my own supper before I fetched it, but I will not swear it—I am not confident whether the bacon was cooked before or after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you went out to fetch the bacon, had you any suspicion as you have stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I had at the time, and before—I had before he came into the house—I fetched it from a person of the name of——I cannot recollect—it was about a hundred yards off—I was absent about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—on my return I found the prisoner sitting at the table in conversation with my wife—as soon as his bacon was cooked he had his supper, smoked his pipe, and went to bed—when I bolted him in his bed-room I said, "He is in, he shall never come out any snore by me"—if my face had been towards him I think he may have heard that, but my back being to<lb/>wards him, he might or might not—it is a question I cannot answer—I sever bolted him in before—I have merely put the bolt to to keep the children in of a morning, but not bolted <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in—the window of his room looks into the front garden—it is about two feet and a half or three feet from the ground—I cannot tell whether he paid me for the old shoes which I made him—what I have no dealings with I never answer, I left it to my wife—he paid her in part, whether she had the whole I cannot tell, I know nothing of it—I have been ill this twelvemonth, and have had very little dealings with any person whatever—I have done very little shoe-making within the last twelve months—I was once in the police—I left it, I think, eight years ago—I went after the first division that went to Whitechapel—I was in it, as near as I can tell, a year and four or five months—I left it entirely of my own accord, without any complaint being made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, do I understand you distinctly that there was a great deal of conversation that you cannot recollect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, distinctly, that I know nothing of whatever—if it were repeated, I believe, I might then tell, but not without, for I did not pay the least attention to it—I did not take any notice, very little indeed, for my thoughts were far beyond any conversa<lb/>tion</p>

               <p>—I did not want to hold any conversation—my two children slept with the prisoner—one is about six years old at Michaelmas, and the other four years old—they were in the bed with him that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you bar the door, I do not understand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had a suspicion he knew something of the charge—barring the door would prevent his getting out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could he not get out of the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he might, but he could not get into my room, and if he had got out of the door I did not mean to go to sleep—I was not particularly afraid of him, but I did not intend that he should have gone out of my house, without he did get up—if he did get up I should have given information—it was for the public interest as well as my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner lodged at our house, and did so on the 17th of March last—I do not know Mr. Templeman's cottage, I never saw it—I know it is but a short dis<lb/>tance from our house—I have never been to it, but I know where it is—the prisoner has been lodging with us nearly a twelvemonth, off and on—the last time he was with us for a whole week, the only week he has been with us since he had been at the Barnsbury Castle public-house—he was with us from Saturday night till the Tuesday week, a week and two days—he did not pay me—I never received any money from him for that, because he had none—he told me he had no money many times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Jarvis brought him some bacon and eggs on the Sunday morning, as he came on Saturday night—on the following Sunday, (the Sunday previous to the murder,) he asked me if I had any breakfast, he wanted some breakfast—I did not answer him, because we had none in the house ourselves—that was between eight and nine o'clock—he said he should go over the water to his cousin's, but his handkerchief was so dirty, and I lent him a stock of my husband's—he then went out directly—he returned at one o'clock in the day—I was at home—he said he had been out, and drank too much beer, and it had made him very ill on an empty stomach—he went out, and was very sick—he came in again, and I asked him if he would have some dinner—he said he was too ill—he asked if he might lie down—I said he might, and he did so—my little boy called him up at five o'clock, for me to make the bed, and put the children to bed—he had gone to lie down in his own room—my children slept with him—he got up, and came into the room where I was sitting—he asked me if I had got any tea—I told him I had not—he asked me to let my little boy go and fetch him some, for he had taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. while he was out—my little boy did fetch him some—he said, "I have got 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left"—he gave my little boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he fetched some tea and sugar—I made him some toast—he had his tea, and went to bed—on the following morning, (Monday,) before he got up, Mrs. Jarvis came, I think, about eight o'clock, or a little after—she came to my door and asked if Richard was up—I said, "No"—I opened the door, and she called, "Richard"—if the front door is open you can hear any body</p>

Q.</hi> Who washed for him when he returned to lodge with you for the week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—his dirty things were not sent to the wash—I never saw any in the house—they were not pot up in a bundle—none of his things were put up in a bundle—I never said any thing about a bundle—I never said I opened a bundle, to ascertain whe<lb/>ther they were two stockings, or odd ones—I have no recollection of say<lb/>ing any thing about the stockings being in a bundle—they laid folded to<lb/>gether on the box, one turned over the other, rolled up, and the one pro<lb/>duced to me was the one which laid outside—they were rolled up in a bundle, the same as a clean pair of stockings—I did not unrol the bundle—they were rolled up in the ordinary form of a pair of stockings, one doubled over the other—the one the money was produced in was the outer stocking—I did not unrol them at all on the Monday—I took them in my hand—I do not know who washed for him then—there was no mark on the stockings—I do not think the prisoner bad been out of place above a fortnight when he came to lodge with us the last time—he came and had a night's lodging now and then—I do not know how long he had left Mr. Bartlett, of the Barnsbury Castle public-house, when he came the last week—when he was in employment he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—we never made any agreement this time—I knew he was out of emyloyment and never asked him for any thing—if he had got any employment I should have ex<lb/>pected the same weekly sum—he did not board with us—it was the Sunday morning after the Saturday that he came that Mrs. Jarvis brought him some bacon and bread for his breakfast—it was on the Monday morn<lb/>ing she came and called him to come to breakfast—he was in bed, and she was outside the house—it was after eight o'clock, it might be ten minutes after eight—he owed us some money for his former lodging—he often, asked me for an account, but as he had no money I never gave it him—I never cast it up—it might be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more, if I east it up, because I often let him have his dinner, and any thing of that sort—he told me, several times during the week, that he had no money—he told me he was in great difficulties, and was without money—many times he men<lb/>tioned the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have ventured to say now that it was past two o'clock, were you always of that opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, always of opinion that it was towards morning—I was always of opinion it was past two o'clock when he came in—I am quite sure it was after two o'clock, according to the time it was daylight afterwards—to the best of my belief it was after two o'clock—I cannot say whether I was certain of the time when I went to the police-office, as I was very much flurried and ill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not believe, when at the police-office, that it was between one and two o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it must have been two o'clock from</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since you have been at the police-office, have you conversed with your husband about the time he came home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My husband said, when he came home, "Mary, Richard did not come home till morning"—I be<lb/>lieve my husband did not speak when the prisoner came in, because I spoke—I did not ask my husband whether he was awake, nor did I speak—I was out of bed three times to nurse my child—the prisoner got up between seven and eight o'clock next morning, and went through the wash-house to the privy—there is a catch to the privy-door—it is what I term a night-bolt—it shuts and bolts—there is another entrance to it from the garden—if the door is shut you must go through the wash-house—if the door is open you can come in that way—the bolt is in the wash-house—it is the wash-house-door bolt—the privy-door was off its hinges at that time—the privy joins the wash-house, and when in the privy you can go out of the privy into the garden—you cannot get into the wash-house without the door is left open—you can get to the privy, through the wash-house, without going into the garden—the privy has two doors—the door leading to the garden was off its hinges at that time—I heard of Mr. Templeman's death, I think, at twelve o'clock in the day—I had been out—my husband went up, and he told me all the particulars when he came home, of the old gen<lb/>tleman being murdered—I cannot remember whether be told me any thing about the state he was found in on the floor—I knew all about it, and be<lb/>gan to talk to the prisoner about it before my husband came in—when he came in he broke upon the conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was his going for the bacon and beer the only occasion when your husband went out that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—with the exception of that inter<lb/>val he heard every thing that took place—when my husband said Richard had got a new pair of shoes, I said, "I think not, I think he has blacked and shined his old ones"—he said so to me the moment Richard walked across the room, while he was gone to the privy—when he came back from the privy he asked my husband to fetch him a drop of beer, and I believe he went out to fetch it—I think he was eating his supper.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not after that, he talked so despondingly as you say about being such an unlucky man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was during the conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I re<lb/>plied, "I don't need a warrant"—he then said, "What do you want me for then?"—I said, "I suppose you have beard of the murder?—it is that I want you for"—he smiled, and said, "If I was as innocent of every thing as I am of that, I should not have much to fear"—I do not recollect his saying any thing more then—as he was packing up his clothes to dress himself, I found 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his trowsers' pockets, all in shillings—while I was counting it, I asked what money he had, and he said 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in his waist-coat-pocket I found seven lucifer matches, and two duplicates for a pair of trowsers and a jacket, dated, "22nd February, 1340, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and "25th February, 1840, 35."—one in the name of Richard Gould, and the other in the name of Ann Jarvis—on the way to the station he said that a pot-boy at the William public-house had taken a warrant out against him for an assault, and it was that he supposed I was after him for—I had missed him for some time, and asked where he had been—he said, "To Norwich"—I searched him at the station-house, and took off his feet a pair of new shoes, or ankle-boots, which I produce—I asked him where he bought them—he said, in Kent-street—a constable who was standing by, said, "The Borough?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—I then asked him what he had done with his old ones—he replied, "Thrown them away"—shortly after that, I minutely examined his clothes, and took from him this waist-coat, which he was wearing at the time—he had three waistcoats on—two besides this—this was the middle one—this waistcoat I noticed at the time was stained with blood, and it is also burnt in one particular spot, as if a cinder or a pipe had fallen on it—on my saying that the waistcoat</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and carry on business in Lincoln's Inn<lb/>fields, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields—I occupy the ground floor for offices—my servant sleeps on the premises, and takes care of the house—I let the other part out in chambers. On the 7th of September last, the prisoner Thomas Chapple was acting as porter to my establishment, and his wife Sophia was the laundress—they slept on the premises, and had the charge of them when the gentlemen had left—the front room on the ground floor I occupy as my own private room—that communicates with the back room, which is the office, by means of double doors—one of them is covered with red cloth—there is a side door also from my room leading to the passage—that is within the hall doors—as you go in there are the hall doors then, a side door on the left hand to go into my private room, and then there are double doors from my room into the back room or office—it is usual to keep the hall door fast during the day, because the street door is generally open during office hours—the hall doors are fastened by a spring lock, which cannot be opened on the outside without a key—it is generally opened by means of a pulley in the office—my side door it secured by a spring lock that cannot be opened from without except by a key—no one can get to my office by the side door, unless they have a key or it is opened from within—there are two keys of the spring lock which is on the side door—one of them I kept myself, and the other was kept by Thomas Chapple, with strict orders not to admit any one but himself and his wife, to clean the room—I did not allow even the clerks in my business to go in there—on Saturday, the 7th of September I went up-stairs to dinner be<lb/>tween twenty minutes to five and five o'clock—I should rather incline to think it was about ten minutes to five o'clock—I dined in my drawing-room, which is the room over the ground floor—before I went up I bolted the double doors leading from my room to the office, according to my usual practice—I went out at my side door and drew the door to after me, which fastened it so that it could not be got at but by means of a key—Thomas Chapple waited on me at dinner till about half-past five—I staid up-stairs altogether about an hour and a quarter—I came down about ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock—I took the key of my room out of my waist-coat pocket, put it in the lock, drew back the lock as usual, and went in—immediately on entering, my attention was called to the door of my iron safe, which was standing wide open—I have a writing table in the middle of the room—I passed by that on one side, and saw several keys, some of which I have since understood to be skeleton keys, lying on a bundle of papers on the writing table, and a small piece of iron—I found the keys of that iron sale lying on the carpet opposite another iron safe, which had not been opened—one of the drawers of ray iron safe was lying on the carpet empty—when I left the room the drawer of the iron safe contained three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, twelve table-spoons, two gravy spoons, and a soup ladle, and an old-fashioned gold watch with a double case—they were all gone—I had usually kept the keys of my iron safe in one of the drawers of my writing table, which was locked up—when I saw the iron safe open I went round the writing table on the other side, and saw the drawer where my keys were kept was open, I missed from that drawer a canvass bag containing seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and five sovereigns screwed up together, and some loose sovereigns—I also missed a gold seal, three or four mourning rings, and a small watch</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060236"/>
               <p>chain, which were all together in a piece of paper in the same drawer—I missed from another drawer in the same table an old pair of black trowsers, an old coat which was lying loose in the room, and a blue bag which I think was on one of the iron safes—I gave an alarm, and the servant came up—I found that Thomas Chapple was not at home—he returned in about half-an-hour—I told him what had happened—he accompanied me to the station-house at Bow-street, and the inspector returned with us—I had not at that time any suspicion of Thomas Chapple, and on my speaking to him about the robbery, he men<lb/>tioned several names of persons whom he suspected—he mentioned my clerk Widdows, and a young man named Roberts, who had called at the office that morning—I mentioned to the officer what I had heard from the prisoner, and in accordance with his advice the lodging of Widdows was searched, but nothing found—in consequence of what Thomas Chapple said to me, I gave him directions to watch Widdows, at the suggestion of the officer, and on the Monday evening, about ten o'clock, he came to me, and said he had been down to Widdows—f think he said he had followed him, and watched him home—I at last entertained very strong suspicion against Thomas Chapple, and on the 13th I gave him into custody—Pocock, the officer, had found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, under a stone in the wash-house, and also on Thomas Chappell a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which made 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it was on the Thursday before the robbery that Thomas Chapple had said he had no money, and I gave him a sovereign to pay for beating carpets and other things—when he was given into custody I told him to tell me what he knew about the robbery—he cried, and said he could not say any thing without criminating others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector at the station-house at Bow-street. On Saturday, the 7th of September, I accompanied Mr. Porter to his chambers in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I first examined his hall-door, the side-door, and the door leading from the front room to the office, to ascertain, if I could, by what means the robbery had been effected—there were marks of violence on the red door leading from the front room to the office, but the door had not been opened—there had been an attempt, which appeared to have been made with a small crow-bar—there was no mark on the outer door—MR. Porter and Thomas Chapple accom<lb/>panied me in my examination—I looked on the carpet in the private room to see if there was any thing lying about, and my attention was directed to that part near the door leading to the office, and there was no key lying on the carpet, I believe—I observed, in the presence of Thomas Chapple, that I could not tell how they got in, as the door had not been opened—I was then near the side-door leading to the passage, and Thomas Chapple stooped down, as though he would pick up something, and he produced this skeleton key—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—he said, "Oh, this is the key that opened the door"—I am quite sure it was not on the ground where he ap<lb/>peared to pick it up from, before he made that observation—the key has been filed, and it is broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Thomas Chapple and his wife, and assisted in the business of the house at Mr. Porter's. Thomas Chapple had two children—on the Thursday before the robbery I was in the kitchen down stairs with the children, and saw one of the children at one of the dresser drawers which Thomas Chapple used for keeping his papers in—the child picked a key out of the drawer—it was like one of the keys produced—Thomas Chapple was in the kitchen at the time, the child produced the key to him, and he said, "Put down that key"—the child put it back in the drawer—on the next day I went to the drawer myself to look for a bit of sealing wax, and I saw the key then in the drawer—I took it in my hand and looked at it, as it looked such a curious key, I had never seen one like it before—Thomas Chapple was then in the kitchen—I asked him what key that was—he said it belonged to Mr. Lee, up-stairs (a gentle<lb/>man who had been a tenant of the chambers up-stairs, but who had left more than two years)—he said it was a little padlock key that had belonged to Mr. Lee—on the afternoon the robbery took place I was looking in that drawer for something, I forget what, and the key was not there then—I took every thing out of the drawer—on that afternoon I was in the front kitchen—there are two kitchen windows, and I could from thence see any body passing out of the doorway at Mr. Porter's—I saw the prisoner Charles King (whom I had seen once before) about half-past five o'clock, as near as I can recollect, coming down from the steps out of the passage—there are railings before the house, and the window gave me a command of the railings—he had a blue bag under his left arm—he went away very quickly—I saw him come down the steps—I could not see whether he had been inside the house, but while I was in the kitchen I heard footsteps in Mr. Porter's private room before I saw him—I had seen him once before in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I do not know exactly the day, nor how long before the robbery—I did not know his name at that time—I had been out walking with Thomas Chapple, and was going in when I saw King, and he whistled, at which Thomas Chapple nodded his head—that was all that passed—after this robbery I was taken to the prison by Mr. Collier, the officer, to see if I knew any person—I saw Charles King there, and selected him from a good many others—on Saturday morn<lb/>ing, the day of the robbery, Thomas Chapple said he bad no money, but he should have some by and by, and I thought he was going to take one of the gentleman's books for some money—he said, could I lend him him half-a-crown—I said, "No," and I did not think Mrs. Chapple had any—he said, "Oh nonsense, Mr. Porter gave her a half-sovereign yesterday"—MRS. Chapple was present at the time—he put his band down her bosom, and took half-a-crown from her—she was tipsy at the time (she was in the habit of getting tipsy)—Thomas Chapple then went out—I think it was about half-past twelve or one o'clock—he staid out about three hours—when he came back I told him his face was very red—I do not know whether he had been drinking, but his face was very red indeed—I remember Mr. Porter's dinner time that day, and the alarm of the robbery, and I saw the state of the room—in the course of the same evening, after the robbery, the prisoner told me he was going to Dublin on the following Friday—on the Sunday evening as I was sitting in the kitchen with him he said he had some money under ground, and he</p>

I said, "No"—he said, "Charles King"—I did not know him by the name of Charles King at that time—Chapple walked home with me—we went through Regent-street—he said he had had a letter from Dublin from his sister—he said he had written to his sister to send him some money to pay for a solicitor for his brother Charles—he did not say whether the letter he had received was an answer to his or not—as we were going up Regent-street we met Sophia Cox, with some other wo<lb/>man—Chapple called Cox aside, he spoke to her, and gave her the letter.</p>

On Thursday or Friday morning, the 13th or 14th of Septem<lb/>ber, Charles King came to my house between eight and nine o'clock—I had a lodger named Lewis, who was an acquaintance of Charles King—I was at that time confined to my house with a broken bone—I remained in the room while Charles King and Lewis were breakfasting—they entered into conversation, and I heard Charles King, say to Lewis, "There is a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">chaunt</hi> for that job at Porter's, in Lincoln's Inn-fields"—I also heard, from a question that Lewis put to King, that they had sold some plate at Child's, in Goswell-street-road—I did not hear any more particular con<lb/>versation about that—King came again on the Saturday morning, and said he did not know what he should do or where he should go to—Lewis advised him to go to Boulogne—King said he had to meet Chapple in the Dials, to arrange where to go to—I will not be exact about the Chris<lb/>tian name he used, but it was Chapple—King left my house then—I saw him again on the following Tuesday, at this end of London-bridge; but on Monday, the 16th of September, a twopenny post letter came to Lewis, by the last post in the evening—Lewis asked me to read it to him—it was from Charles Chapple to Lewis—I read it to Lewis, and afterwards burned it—in consequence of what I observed in that letter, I went, for the purpose of apprehending Charles Chapple and Charles King on the Tuesday—on my arrival at London-bridge I saw Charles Chapple and Charles King—(I did not know Chapple at that time)—they were together—I do not know whether they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they bad carpet bags, and were both dressed in Macintoshes—my lodger, Lewis, was with them—I gave in<lb/>formation to the policeman on duty, but they escaped—there is no doubt but Lewis told them I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Nelson-place, New-road, and am a plumber. I knew Mr. James of Little Cumming-street—I was there on the 12th or 13th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon—I went into the front parlour to wait for James, and after I had waited a little time, Lewis, who lodged there, (I do not know his Christian, name,) I think it is William,) and Charles King came in—Charles King produced a watch and asked Lewis to wind it up for him—Lewis asked him what he had given for it—King said he had taken it out of pledge for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a pound, and he would have kept the gold watch, but Chapple made him sell it with the plate—I was looking through the parlour window, and thinking the conversation rather strange, I paid more attention than I should have done—Lewis asked King what were the amounts of the notes—King said, "Tens and hundreds," and that they had received between 200 and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I then turned round and said, "Gentlemen, you have got a good booty or prize, where did they come from?"—Charles King said, "From the lawyer's in the fields"—they did not stop above five or six minutes—James was at that time ill in bed—when the others were gone, he came down, and I told him the moment he came down—on the Tues<lb/>day following James came to me, and in consequence of what he told me, I went with him to London-bridge, to apprehend Charles King—I know the hotel at the foot of the bridge—after waiting some time I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive to the foot of London-bridge, and just at the moment I saw King and another young man close to the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but I cannot say that I saw them get out of it—there is a way out of the hotel which leads to the water-side, and I lost sight of them—I afterwards went with Mr. James to Mr. Porter's to tell what I knew.</p>

I was on duty at London-bridge on the 17th of September—James and Magrath applied to me to take some persons into custody, but I searched, and found nobody—I saw a number of persons about, but none that I can identify, except the prisoner Charles King—I had seen him and another person pass in a very hurried manner, within two minutes of the time I was spoken to—they had carpet bags with them, and Macintoshes on, and were going to<lb/>wards the steamer.</p>

               <p>found her in the front parlour—I told her she was suspected of being con<lb/>cerned in Mr. Porter's robbery, at No. 22, Lincoln's Inn-fields—the said she knew nothing about it—I asked if she had got any money—she said, no, she had not got any—I asked when she had seen her son Charles last—she said, "About a fortnight ago"—I asked if she knew where he was—she said, "No"—I searched the room, and while I was doing so she walked to the door several times, and endeavoured to go out—I pulled her back, and told her I could not allow her to go out—I found no money nor property relating to Mr. Porter's robbery—I then asked if she had got any money about her—she said, "No, not a farthing"—I asked her to show me her pocket—she pulled out some papers—I said that would not do for me—I felt, and there was something hard—I told her to take her pocket off, and she gave it me—I found in it fifty-one sovereigns and 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I asked whose that was, and where she got it—she said, "From Eliza Plant," and at that moment Pocock, who had left the room, brought Eliza Plant in in custody—I told her that Mrs. King said she had received that money from her—Eliza Plant said, "Yes, I brought it up, and gave it her; I received it from Charles King"—I told Ann King I should take her on suspicion of the robbery—she said, "If right takes place, others will suffer for it as well as me"—(Plant cohabits with Charles King—I afterward caught them in bed in Nottingham-place, Seven-dials)—I went to Southampton-court, where I found Sophia Cox, Henry Cox, and Selina Kemp—I found a coat there, and in a drawer in the wash-hand stand I found a life-protector—I asked Henry Cox whose coat that was hanging behind the door—he said it was his—I said I should take it—Sophia Cox looked at me, was very much confused, and asked what I wanted to take that coat for—I said I thought I knew a person who had worn it on a cer<lb/>tain day, and I should take it—I then took them to the station-house—on the 5th of October I went to Brook-street, New-road, where Charles Chapple lives—he was not at home, but came in directly—I asked if he had got any money—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a bag, containing half-a-sovereign and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I asked if that was all he had got; he said it was—I then searched him, and in his trowsers pocket I found five sovereigns wrapped in this piece of green baize—I asked him if they were his; he said, no, it was his master's, Mr. Semple, of Camden-town, and he had received it for a bill for him yesterday—(there is a Mr. Semple keeps a timber yard, and Charles Chapple worked there)—I said he must go with me to Mr. Semple's to know if he had received it for a bill for him—he then said, "Oh dear, it is no use telling a lie about it; I picked it up in the Park yesterday, I found it"—I said he must go with me on suspicion of being concerned in Mr. Porter's robbery—I put him into a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and he said, "I have been drawn into it"—I asked him when he had seen his son Charles—he said, "About a month ago"—I asked if he knew where he was—he said. "No"—I had been in search of Charles King ever since September, and took him on the 21st of February, in bed with Plant, at No. 21, Nottingham-place, Seven-dials—I told him to get up—he got his trowsers, and I said I should search them—he said, "No, I shall put them on"—I said, "It is no use"—I took them, and in the pocket was this bag, with four skeleton keys in it, which he put into my band—I looked about the room, and found a bundle of sixteen skeleton keys on the coals in the cupboard—I took Thomas Chapple in the same house where his father was, on the 21st of February.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of john stevens, and live at No. 22, Praed-street, Paddington. I know the prisoner—I received her child into my care nearly nine months before its death—it was a fortnight and a few days old when it came to me—it died on the 31st of March, or Wed<lb/>nesday morning, the 1st of April—it was very well on the Friday before its death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had it been poorly before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not lately—on the Friday before it died, in consequence of a letter I received, I went to the prisoner, who was living at Mrs. Kelly's, No. 49, Hunter-street, Brunswick-square, as wet nurse—I saw the servant first—the prisoner came down stairs to me, and asked me how I was, and how the child was—(the child's name was George Michael)—I said the child was very well—she asked me to walk into the parlour, which I did, and she said she had an old frock for the baby, and a bottle of medicine—she gave me a bottle which was full—this looks like the bottle—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it was tied down with a bit or paper inside the cork, and a piece of white paper outside round the bottle, and sealed with wax—the paper was not fastened on the bottle—the cork was tied round—the paper was wrapped round the bottle—I could not see what was in it till I got home—when she gave it me she said it would do the baby's bowels good—I said the baby was very well, and did not want medicine—she said it had done her mistress's baby good, and it would do her baby good—she said I was to give it one tea-spoon full every night—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060253"/>
               <p>she said if any thing happened to the child I waft to let her knew directly—I do not recollect that she said any thing more—she said I might expect a doctor on Monday next, about five o'clock—I rather think she laid Dr. Reid, but I am not certain of the name—this was on Friday, the 27th of March. The prisoner paid me for taking, care of the child—she gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the first five months, I believe, and then I spoke about falling it to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I lowered it to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for one month, and then I fell it to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that waft the rate when the child died—the doc<lb/>tor did not call on the Monday—when I got home I took both papers off the bottle—I did not open the cork—the contents looked dark, something of a treacle colour—I never took out the cork—I took off the paper directly, to see if there were any directions—I never gave the child any of the contents of the bottle—I stood it on the mantelpiece directly, where it continued till the Tuesday, not intending to give it to it at all—I keep the house, but other people lodge in it—on the Tuesday afternoon I left the room at half-past four o'clock—there was myself, my daughter, who is eleven years old, the baby, my little William, who is five years old, and Richard, my son, who is three years old, in the room up to that time—those were all the persona in the room—about half-past four o'clock I was called out of the room—the baby was very well indeed then—all the persons I have named were in the room then—I could not say whether the bottle was on the mantel-piece at that time, but it had been there all that day—I had cleared the mantel-piece about eleven o'clock, and it was there then—I did not remove it afterwards, nor any body else to the best of my knowledge—when I saw it at eleven o'clock it was in the same state, as to the contents, as when I received it—I kept it for fear the doctor should come—I thought, in consequence of what she said, a doctor might come, and I meant to ask him how I should give it—when I went out of the room at half-past four o'clock I left the baby sitting on the floor, playing with my chil<lb/>dren—it was awake and lively at that time—at six o'clock I went into my parlour—I was in the kitchen, and I heard Richard cry—I thought he had fallen, and went up into the parlour—I found the baby then lying on the sofa asleep—I went and took him up in my arms, and his hands Were clenched—I could not open his fingers—I spoke to him, and endea<lb/>voured to rouse him—I said, "George, George"—he looked up, and closed his eyes again, aft if he was going to Sleep—I told my girl to go and fetch a pennyworth of castor oil, and gave the child half of it—he then went fast asleep—I looked at the mantel-piece directly I came in—the bottle was on it, and half the stuff gone—I sent my girl for a doctor, and called up a midwife who had been with me at a labour in the house—the medical man who came first was Mr. Sellick, assistant to Mr. Philpot—they looked at the child, and asked me what I had been giving him—I told them I had given him castor oil, but my little boy said something.</p>

               <p>—MR. Sellick took the bottle with him—he brought something and gave the child directly, and ordered hot water and things for it—I gave the things they advised—they ordered it medicine and a hot bath—I did every thing in my power—he seemed in convulsions, but quite asleep—he never awoke up all night—he died about twenty minutes before five on Wednes<lb/>day morning—I sent Mary Batty for the prisoner about nine or half-past nine o'clock on Tuesday night—she came—I said, "Look what trouble I am in"—she said she could not help of it—I drew her attention to the child—she went and looked at it—I told her what my child had told me—she came and sat down by me, looking, at the child, which was on another person's knee, who lived up-stairs—I said the child was very bad, and told her my little boy had given it the medicine out of the bottle—I asked her if the doctor had given it to her, and she said, "Yes"—I sent for Mr. Philpot while she was there—he asked her where she got it—she said the doctor near there, or something of that sort, I cannot exactly say what.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say where she got it from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said something about round the corner—she stopped about a quarter of an hour—she came again next morning, about ten o'clock—the child had been dead some hours then—I asked her to go into the other room and see it—at first she objected—she never made no notice—she said, "No," but after a little while her cousin, Esther Jones, who lives near me, said, "Go, Kate, and see the child"—she then rose up, and went with me and her cousin into the room—she looked at the child—she said, "It is better off," or something like that—she did not say she was very sorry—MR. Philpot was not sent for that morning—she went out, and said she was going to Mr. Philpot's house—nothing had been said about him—she was absent about a quarter of an hour—MR. Philpot lives about two minutes' walk from me—when she came back, I asked her if she had seen Mr. Philpot—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if it was all right, if she had had the medicine from the doctor—she said, "Yes"—I asked her whether it was doctor Reid—she told me, "Yes"—I did not ask her any thing else—she said nothing else—she stopped from ten till two o'clock that day—I did not see her again till she was brought to our house by a policeman, on the Saturday night—when she gave me the bottle, she told me to give it one teaspoonful of the stuff every night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Philpot, a surgeon near Praed-street, Paddington. I was sent for to Mrs. Stevens's on Tuesday evening, the 31st of March—I got there about five o'clock, or it might be a quarter before—I saw an infant there—I examined it—it was perfectly insen<lb/>sible—I smelt its breath, and could perceive the odour of laudanum—this bottle was shown to me—I examined it—there were a few drops more than there is in it now—it is pure laudanum I should say, from the smell and taste of it, and from what I see here—it is such as they sell in the shops for laudanum—the state of the child was such as might be produced by taking laudanum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of laudanum administered in that state would produce the effect you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One drop has been known to do it—it is never safe to administer one drop to a child—one drop would not produce the effect I found, but one drop has been known to poison a child—a tea-spoonful would—about sixty drops is an ordinary teaspoonful—that if rather a large dose—this bottle would contain about an ounce—half of it would be about half an ounce—a teaspoonful administered to an infant nine months old, such a baby as I saw, would be certain to destroy life—I gave it some medicine—castor oil would not be likely to do harm nor good unless it acted as an emetic—if it had, it might have done good—mustard and water would have been better—it appeared a hopeless case from my first seeing it—I first saw the prisoner on Wednesday morning—she came to Mr. Philpot when I was there, and said, "My poor little one is dead"—she asked if I was the gentleman who had seen the child—I told her yes—she said she was sorry to lose the child when it had attained that age—she then asked if there was likely to be an inquest—I said in all proba<lb/>bility there would be an inquest, and asked her whether she had inquired into the mistake—(I had heard people talking about one medicine having been given for another)—she said yes, she had been to Dr. Reid's, and that Dr. Reid had told her it was his young man's mistake—she said the young man had given it in mistake for another mixture off the counter—I then left her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the bottle precisely in the same stole in which it was handed to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it has rather evaporated—there might have been two or three more drops than there is now—there is now very likely one drop—there was about three times as much as there is now—the Coroner tested it—it has been very trifingly diminished by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able clearly to say that the mixture which is in this bottle has not been adulterated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that for certain—if adultera<lb/>ted by water, whatever quantity was given would certainly produce less effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If laudanum has been in a pure state in a bottle, and afterwards mixed with water, would the spirit remain, or would it amalgamate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would if shaken together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician. I live in Bloomsbury-square—I know the prisoner—she was confined in Queen Charlotte's lying-in hospital last year—I procured her the situation of wet nurse in the family of Mr. Kelly—I never furnished her with any medicine for her child in March—none was furnished by my house to my knowledge—she did not call at my house on Tuesday evening the 31st of March to my knowledge—I did not see her at all—on Wednesday evening the 1st of April, a little after five o'clock, I found her waiting in my room, and asked if she had come with a message from Mrs. Kelly, who is a patient of mine—she said she did not, that she had a favour to ask me—(I had not then heard of the death of the child)—as she hesitated very much I inquired what it was—she then said that her child was dead, that a coroner's inquest would likely be held upon it, and that she wished me particularly to attend the inquest—I in<lb/>quired if the child had met with an accident—she said it had—I men<lb/>tioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060259"/>
               <p>that as I was not conversant with the facts of the case, my attend<lb/>ance would be of no use, but I would attend if I was summoned—she then hesitated good deal, and stated that it was not at her own request exactly that she wished me to attend, that the child had had laudanum given to it by a child in mistake, and that the medical man who had seen the child said it would be necessary for me to attend—she made use of the expression, "If I am hanged for it, I could not support the child on my wages"—I then asked her the circumstances of the accident—she said she bad sent some laudanum in a bottle to be given to the child, and that it had neither label nor direction upon it—recollecting she had mentioned that a child had given it laudanum, I said to her, "But of course you directed what quantity should be given, or was to be given"—she replied that she had directed a teaspoonful to be given at night—I then told her I was exceed<lb/>ingly sorry I had asked her the last question, and still more sorry that she had answered it, that if I was summoned on the coroner's inquest I should be on my oath, and should have to repeat the whole conversation—I advised her to say no more to me on the subject—I felt it my duty to communicate what I had learnt to Mr. Kelly, and she was dismissed from their service—she came to me on the Friday to inform me that she had been dismissed by Mr. Kelly, and to ask me if I had heard any thing about the coroner's inquest, and that, if there was to be none, would I intercede with Mr. Kelly to take her back again—nothing more passed then—on the Saturday even<lb/>ing I saw her again—she came to consult me professionally on the state of her milk—I gave her advice, and she then asked me if I had heard of the coroner's inquest—I had found a summons on my table the moment before to attend the inquest—I had just come in—I showed her the summons, and told her so—she asked me if she might call the next morning to in<lb/>quire the result—I told her I should be happy to give her any professional advice, but on the other part of the subject I had rather she would inquire up at Paddington.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a book-stall, in Carnaby-street, Golden-square. Some time ago I was indebted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a person named Scott, for which I received a summons—I attended the Court of Requests, at Westminster, and was ordered to pay the sum in four weeks, with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—I went to the Court, I think, on the 28th of November, to pay the money, and saw the prisoner in the Court, opposite the place where the money ought to be paid in, where they call people's names over—I was looking about, and the prisoner said to me, "What is your business?"—I said I had come to pay in some money which I was sued for by Mr. Scott—I had the order with me, and showed it him—he said, "It is all right, I can take your money; it will be perfectly light"—I had not known him be<lb/>fore, nor did I employ him—I understood him that he could take my money for the Court—I firmly believe he said, he was an officer of the Court—he said he could take my money, and it would be perfectly right—he said he had not got a pen and ink there, but if I would walk with him over the way, he would take my money and give me a receipt for it—I went over the way with him, and paid him the money, because I believed him, from his own words, to be a lawful officer of the Court to receive the money—I paid it under no other impression—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the debt, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the costs—he gave me this receipt on a card—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Received the debt and costs due to Mr. Scott, of the Gas Company, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Charles Duneclift. Nov. 28"—when he gave me this card, with this receipt on it into my hand, I said, "Now, sir, is this perfectly right?"—he said it was perfectly right, and I should never hear any more of it—on the 9th of March a distress was put into my house for the same debt, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more costs, and I had to pay it twice over—I never taw nor heard any more of the prisoner.</p>

Coutts in the Strand were his bankers—I told him I did not want money just then, nor want to part with it, but I said, "Whatever you do, do not take any thing on it"—I gave it to him again, and cautioned him not to make any thing on it—I would not take 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound, because it would be paid some day, but he might inquire the day price on it if he liked—he took it, and said he should be going up to his banker's in the course of the day, and he would inquire—he afterwards said that if I liked, if I doubted it, he would give me cash for it—I said, "No, my own document is what I want"—he said, any time I wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have it, that he had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing at his banker's—I was out when he came home—I did not come home till the evening, and did not see him that night—I believed him to be a respectable person—I never asked him for his board and lodging up to that time, but I have latterly—two or three days after I gave him the certificate I said, "Respecting that transfer that I gave you to ascertain the value of, you have not given it me again"—he said, "Oh dear, I did not see my banker, he was not within, but at any time you shall have it"—we were to go to his banker's, but we could not go then—he said, "If you are afraid I will give you the cash"—I said, no, I wanted my own pro<lb/>perty—he said, "I will go and inquire about it"—(I have never had it since)—I went with him to Coutts's about a month after the transaction—he said he was going up Leadenhetll-street, and asked me to take a walk with him—I went, and he went up and spoke to one of the clerks at Coutts's—I thought it was on business—that made me contented, thinking my document was safe at Coutts's—he was not apprehended on my pre<lb/>mises—he was taken on another charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at Stratford. The prisoners came to my house on Wednesday, February 26th, between one and two o'clock—they brought a work-box, and on asking them where they got it from, they said they found it on the New-road, leading to Barking, that a coach was on before, and they thought the box had dropped from that—I asked how long they had had it in their possession—they said nearly a fortnight—I asked if their friends knew they had found it—they said yes, and said they had been all over Plaistow to different parties to try to find out the owner for the box, but could not—I said I should not buy it of them, I thought I knew the party it belonged to—I said if they would call on Friday night, or the Saturday, after I had made necessary inquiries, I would tell them more on the subject—when they brought the box they wanted me to purchase it—I am sure they asked me to buy it—it was tied up with string, in brown paper, very carefully as if it was packed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Broadway, Deptford. On the 7th of February, between six and eight o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and requested to take some shawls to show Mrs. Collins, of King-street, Deptford—I asked if she came from Mrs. Collins—she said, "Yes," and I gave her two shawls—I think the price was marked on them—on the following day I sent Arthur Osborne to Mrs. Collins, and on his return I gave information at the police station-house—MRS. Collins had been a customer of mine for some time—I had seen the prisoner at my shop once or twice before—I gave credit to her representation that she came from Mrs. Collins, and parted with them for no other purpose than for her to show Mrs. Collins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Collins, a traveller, and live at No. 5, King-street, Deptford. I have known the prisoner four years—I did not send her on any message on the 29th of November last—I know Mr. Watts—I did send her there for some linen on the 25th, which was the first time she came to work in my house—I had a child dying on the 29th—I did not send her for any thing on the 7th of February—I never saw her between November last and the 7th of February—she did not bring any shawls to me—I never authorised her in any way to apply for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I examined the body of the child after death—I never saw it alive—the chest and abdomen were very healthy, except a small portion of the lungs adhering to the chest—that would not cause death at all—I found the blood vessels of the head very much coagulated, and a quantity of water in the cavities of the brain, which was the cause of death—many causes would produce that effect, such as a blow on the head, or a fall on the head, and dentition with young children might cause it, or when the stomach and bowels are not in good order—it had all the teeth a child of that age would have—they were all quite cut, and had been so, I dare say, for a year—dentition could not produce the effects I saw in that child—a blow on the head, or disease of the stomach, might produce it—there was no symptom of disease of the stomach at all—the child appeared to have enjoyed very excellent health—if it was thrown with violence by the throat, and the head went against the fender or stove, concussion of the brain would be the consequence, and that, jointly with the terror of the child, would be sufficient to produce death—if the child was quite well before, I should judge that that violence was the cause of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would excessive terror effect this alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it would—terror at seeing the mother ill used might cause unusual sensation in the brain which would bring on reaction, and the same ap<lb/>pearances would ensue—I should say that trembling violently was one of the sufficient causes to produce the effect—I must have observed the sto<lb/>mach to be out of order if that had been the case—I saw nothing in the state of the stomach which should cause the child to complain of pain in it—if the head is bad for two or three weeks, the stomach generally becomes weak, and sickness would ensue from compression of the brain—that would account for violent pain in the stomach—all the symptoms I per<lb/>ceived could be accounted for by terror and anxiety—I saw no external marks of violence, but it must have got well in three weeks;—the parents did not point out any place where I could discover a mark—they pointed out a scar on the left part of the throat, which had evidently not been long there—it might have been five weeks, I cannot say—I have no doubt the symptoms about the brain and head arose from a recent cause—it could not have arisen from a blow six months previous—no doubt a previous accident would produce a predisposition for such a cause, if the brain was then affected, but if the functions were all right it would not.</p>

I belong to the ship <hi rend="italic">Felicity,</hi> which was lying in Gould's Dock—the prisoner, who was mate, was paid off in February—before he left he went with me, to take the articles stated in this indict<lb/>ment to be washed—soon after, he left the ship, and when I went for my clothes they were gone—from what the washerwoman told me, I suspected him, and about six weeks after I saw him on board a vessel, as we were going down the river—he told me he had got some clothes of mine—I said I knew he had, and collared him—he went down below, and pulled my clothes out of his box, all but one stocking, which he could not find—I gave him in charge—these are my clothes—I never gave him authority to get them from the washerwoman—they were clean when he got them, and he has worn them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police officer. I took the prisoner—I asked him how he got the clothes—he said he got them from the washer-woman, and he had done wrong, but was drunk at the time—he said the prosecutor did not allow him to get them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went with him, and left some things of my own to be washed, and when I went for them the washerwoman asked if I would take his things, as we both belonged to one vessel. I took them. I got tipsy, and the vessel he was on board of left the dock that night. I then went on board another vessel, and when I returned I saw the pro<lb/>secutor going by in a boat; I hailed him to come and fetch his things. I said I had worn them, as I was short of linen; but I would make him any recompence; he would not take less than half-a-sovereign; that was more than they were worth, and be gave charge of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old.

On Wednesday, the 11th of March, I ordered some tares to be lightered by her—on the Friday morning I saw them landed at my wharf between ten and eleven o'clock—when the last sack was landed I spoke to Mr. Scott and examined the tares, and found one sack deficient—I said to Mr. Betts, in Long's pre<lb/>sence, "There is a sack of tares short, how is this, William?"—he turned to Long, and said, "How is this, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>?"—I saw he wanted to say some<lb/>thing to him in an under tone, and I turned away—I did not hear what passed—I looked round almost immediately, and observed Long shoving off in a lug boat towards the road where Vandervorde's barge was lying—I got into a skiff and desired William Betts to row me under the stern of the road, and observed Long in the act of having a sack of something hove on his back—I saw him carry it from abaft the rigging of the barge, and throw it off his back—by this time I was on board Vander<lb/>vorde's barge—I went to the fore part and asked Long what he had done with that sack of tares—he said, "I have it here, it is all right;" and I saw the sack, which I supposed was the tares, lying in the lug boat, which he had shoved off—he had hove the sack over the head of Vandervorde's barge into the lug boat, and he shoved the lug boat from the road to the <hi rend="italic">William Henry,</hi> and with the assistance of a man on board, he got it to the head-sheets of the <hi rend="italic">William Henry</hi>—I then went to the cabin hatchway of Van<lb/>dervorde's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060283"/>
               <p>barge—I called to Vandervorde—he came up—I said "How is this, Vandervorde, that you had a sack of oar tares on board your barge?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it, I have not seen the sack"—I said I should see about it—I believe the sack was mine—I saw it in the lug boat, and it was the only sack in the boat that was full, and I saw it was one of mine—I went on shore and spoke to my partner—when I got on the wharf Long said to me, "I thought I had got a sack of tares over, and I did not want to get the meter into any scrape or trouble"—I said it was a parcel of nonsense (in the course of business Long would have the meter's ticket describing the quan<lb/>tity)—I went in a skiff to the Thames police-office—as I was passing under the stern of Vandervorde's vessel, I saw him on board—he called to me, and said, "Mr. Nash, I hope you don't think I know any thing about the sack of tares—I said, "I don't know any thing about it, I am going to the Thames Police, and I shall leave them to sift the matter"—he said, "I hope you won't go any further in the matter, you can't think that I know any thing about them"—I went on, and met Mr. Evans, the police-inspector, in his boat—we went back to the wharf, and found that Long had left—he had instruction to go and work something else—MR. Evans then went, on board Vandervorde's, then came and told me something, I afterwards went to the corn-market, and saw Vandervorde there—I said, "Mr. Evans, the inspector, has been looking for you, and he will be here at two o'clock—Vandervorde said, "Very well, I will see him," or "I will be here at the time"—I sent my own sacks for the tares, and the sack produced is one of mine—the tares that were in it on board Vandervorde's vessel are the same kind as those I had—I have a sample from them and from the bulk—I cannot identify them, but I believe them to be the same.</p>

I was at Nash's-wharf on the Friday morning when these tares were delivering—there were about ten quarters in the barge when I came down at the end of the delivery—Nash said to me, in the presence of Long, "William, there is a sack short, there ought to be thirty-nine quarters and a half"—I asked Long how it was—he said, "I have got the sack, it is all right, I will go and fetch it"—he jumped into a lug-boat, went ahead of the road, and Mr. Nash told me to row him off in a skiff, which I did—we rowed round the stern of Vandefvorde's vessel, and Long went ahead—I observed him go and take the sack of tares from abaft the mast, and Mr. Nash walked forward into the sailing barge—I saw him go up to Vander<lb/>vorde—the sack was put into the lug-boat—I heard Vandervorde say, at I was going to the police-office, be hoped Mr. Nash would not go any fur<lb/>ther with it.</p>

I am a corn-meter, and live in Red cross-square, Tower-street—I was on board Vandervorde's vessel on Friday morning, the 13th of March, I had to master some corn there—I got, there about seven o'clock in the morning—I saw Long come on board about half-past seven—Vandervorde and I were speaking together relative to the corn that I was about to deliver—Long came and said, "I have got the sack of tares," or "brought the sack," or "a sack of tares"—I saw nothing particular in his manner—Vandervorde replied, but I did not hear what—Long did not remain on board more than a few seconds—about nine o'clock in the morning I saw Vandervorde on boarde Long's barge, which was lying alongside Vandervorde's vessel—he was in the act of up-ending a sack of tares which was on Long's barge—Vandervorde said to me, "Brother Fellowship, tend me a hand," meaning me to assist him in get<lb/>ting the sack on board his own barge from Long's—I was on board Van<lb/>dervorde's barge from the lime of Long's coming, and saying he had brought a sack—I did not see any sack removed from Vandervorde's barge to Long's—I was measuring corn below, and a sack of tares could have been removed without my seeing, it—a man assisted Vandervorde with a kind of pulley, and I assisted in getting it on board Vandervorde's barge—I hooked it on—there was a small rent in the bottom of the sack—I can swear to the sack—soon after the sack was hoisted on board Vandervorde's vessel, I heard him call for a sack, and one of his men replied to it—the man asked him what sack—he said, "Any one of ours"—then one of his own was brought to him—he held it up, and I said it was as bad as the one they were going to shoot it out of—they were shot out of one sack into the other—Vandervorde was standing by the side, assisting in holding up the sack—the sack they were in before had the name of Nash on it—about an hour after Long came on board, and inquired for the sack of tares—he said, "Where is that sack of tares? it is wrong; for God's sake let me have them, or there will be such a piece-of-work about it"—I do not know to whom he said it—Vandervorde was there—I did not hear him ask for any thing—that sack could not be found at first, it was afterwards found and brought—I did not see the re-shooting of them—I went down soon after—I heard Mr. Nash on board.</p>

On Sunday, the 4th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was going into my own house, and observed a hearth-rug on the grating before the window, where it had no business to be—I pulled the bell to go in, and saw the hearth-rug slide off the grating, and go down underneath into my premises again—I went in, and met the prisoner at the top of the cellar-steps—I went to where I had seen the hearth-rag fall to—I saw nothing there—I came up again—I went down with a light, and found the hearth-rug under the cellar-steps, where it had no business to be.</p>
