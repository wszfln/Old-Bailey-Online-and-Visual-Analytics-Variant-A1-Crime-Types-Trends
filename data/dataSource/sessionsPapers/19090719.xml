                  </hi>gasfitter and ironmonger. I have been in busi<lb/>ness in partnership with the prisoner at 65, Fenchurch Street. On June 15, 1909, I went to the office, when assistant Herrick caught sold of me and twisted my arm. Prisoner came in with a police<lb/>man. Prisoner punched me twice in the head, carried me to the door, punched me again, and threw me down, when I became un<lb/>conscious. I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where I re<lb/>mained six days as an in-patient. I was not asked to leave the shop. The policeman was looking on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am getting better now. I had not been to tat office for two years for fear of the prisoner's violence. I took the premises with prisoner on a two years' agreement and he has since obtained a 21 years' lease, dated July 16, 1908. Prisoner hat done that in fraud. Prisoner has robbed me of the business. Before ping to the office I reported it at the station and the policeman was sent on.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK PRYKE, </hi>878 City. On June 15, at 9. 46 am., I was ceiled in to 65, Fenchurch Street, to eject the last witness. The assistant said he wanted prosecutor outside. Pro<lb/>secutor said, "I am a partner in the firm." Prisoner entered the shop, struck prosecutor two blows in the face, and said, "You are a partner in the firm, are you? I will give you partner." I said to prisoner, "Do not knock the old man about." He ceased striking him, and then gathered him up in his arms; they both struggled towards the door, and prisoner pushed him out, when he fell on the back of his head on the pavement and became unconscious. There are two steps from the doorway. I took the prosecutor to the hospital, where he was seen by the doctor and admitted. I then returned and charged prisoner with assaulting him, occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190008"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prosecutor clung to the doorway and pulled several things down in the struggle. There were no marks on his face. Prisoner did not use greater violence than was necessary in getting him to the door, twit in pushing him out, considering the prisoner is a young man and prosecutor is an old man, unnecessary force was used. Prisoner lost control of himself.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK LEWIN, </hi>854, City. On June 15 I entered the shop and saw prisoner bodily carrying the prosecutor out. When he got to the door he released him, pushed him, and he fell on the pavement and became unconscious.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not think it necessary to interfere while the prosecutor was being carried out.</p>
               <p>In reply to the Recorder, Mr. Elliott said he could not justify the assault.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES ROBINSON, </hi>164 N, son of the prosecutor. I knew that my father was going to the shop—not on my advice—and I went there.

On May 31 (Whit Monday), between 10 and 10. 30 p.m., I was on the lawn in front of my premises; two or three hundred people were there. I saw prisoner and Charles Hearne apparently fighting Jack Hearne. I pulled Charles away, and, the fight being over, was talking to him, when prisoner rushed past me and struck at Jack with a belt. I closed with prisoner and got the belt from him. All the men had been drinking, but were sober. I had not seen the commencement of tat row. I saw Jack the next morning; he seemed then all right; at just came round to beg my pardon for the row.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know that there were other fights going on in the grounds on this night. These men may have had an extra glass or two, being holiday time, but they were not ad drunk that I could not serve them; I do not suppose they were exactly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PARROTT, </hi>surgeon at the Hayes and Harlington Cottage Hospital. I saw Jack Hearne on June 4; he was suffering from a septic wound over the left frontal eminence about three-eights of an inch long; he came to me daily for treatment for 10 or 12 days; then he wanted to go to work, and, as the wound was quite healthy, I told him he could do so. On the Tuesday before he died he complained to me of slight headache; three days later he was still suffering from headache; I sent him to the hospital; that might became violently delirious and eventually died unconscious. A blow with the buckle end of the belt produced would cause sees a wound as I saw. On the post-mortem examination I found that the wound had penetrated the outer table of the frontal bone; the table had become carious, and septic matter had become absorbed through the thin inner table and produced an abscess in the brain, which was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is quite possible that the wound became septic from the occupation followed by deceased (that of a pig feeder).</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR LOUGH, </hi>247 L. On this night I was on duty about opposite the oyster shop. I heard two loud reports, and saw Archer running away. Prisoner was holding a pistol in his right hand. I rushed across the road and seized prisoner. On the way to the station prisoner said, "I only wanted to shoot the two women;</p>

               <p>they lobbed me the other night; I hope I have not shot anyone else." The pistol produced is the one prisoner was holding.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM REED, </hi>187 L, spoke to taking Archer into the hospital.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">SYDNEY BUTTON, </hi>L Division. I was on duty at Kenning<lb/>ton Road Police Station when prisoner was brought in just alter mid<lb/>night of July 7; he appeared quite calm and collected; he smelt of drink; he had a wound on the left side of his head. I told prisoner that the woman he shot in Waterloo Road was dead; he was about to speak, and I cautioned him; he then said, "She robbed me at Tabard Street. last Friday; I met the two women to-night; we went and had sausages; I want(ed) to shoot the two women, and when I came out I fired at them."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner had a peculiar dazed appearance. <hi rend="smallCaps">EVEREST</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LAVALLE, </hi>Divisional Surgeon, said that he saw the prisoner about 12. 15 a.m. on July 8. Prisoner's manner was calm and col<lb/>lected, but he was in a dated condition, and under the influence of drink; he had a slight cut on the scalp; this might have been caused by the blow from Vandersluis's stick. Witness assisted at the post<lb/>mortem examination of Archer; the cause of death was hemorrhage from a bullet wound of the lung.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner's appearance was consistent with his string being continually under the influence of drink for six weeks.</p>
               <p>Detective Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM EUSTACE, </hi>L Division. On my read<lb/>ing over to prisoner the charges (murder of Archer and attempted murder of Vandersluis) he said, "I did not intend to shoot the man; it was jammed." On examining the revolver (a Browning pistol) I found it was jammed with an empty cartridge. I went to the room at which prisoner had been staying at the "Trafalgar Hotel, " York Road; there I found a travelling trunk and portmanteau. In the trunk were two boxes containing 41 cartridges; a licence issued in South Africa to possess a Browning pistol; a naturalisation paper issued at Johannesburg; and some discharges showing that prisoner had worked in the merchant service as a fireman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There ware 19 discharges, some marked "good, " some "very good? " none "bad"; there were also several characters from engineers of vessels. Prisoner arrived in England on May 18, and since that time had been continually under the influence of drink. Prisoner had on him a watch, no chain.</p>

                  </hi>4, Balmoral Road, Willesden Green. In October, 1906, I adopted the little girl Fletcher and she lived with me till June last. Daring the past two years she went to school in Pound Lane with my little boy aged five. On Jane 15 she went with him to school in the morning; she came back for dinner about half<lb/>past 12 and went to school again about 10 past one. My boy came home at a quarter to five without the girl and I went to the police station at six o'clock. The clothes now produced are those worn by the girl on that day; they were all clean and in good order when she left home. I have never seen prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BROWN, </hi>the little son of the last witness, said that he and Fletcher had got to the entrance of the school when the girl told him she was going to blow her nose and ran away from him behind the bushes; then she said good-bye to him. He went to look for her but could not find her, so he went in to school alone. He never saw prisoner.</p>
               <p>P. C. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES BATTERSBY, </hi>405 X. In the early morning of June 19 I was on duty in Cricklewood and saw prisoner loitering about; I saw him go into three empty (partly built) houses; on my going to<lb/>wards him he ran away; I followed and eventually caught him and took him to the station on a charge of loitering. Later in the morn<lb/>ing when I had charge of him to take him before the magistrates he said to me, "I want to confess that I murdered a little girl at Edg<lb/>ware on Tuesday afternoon." I then handed him over to Detective Tritton. I did not know the man at all. Nothing was known up to then of the disappearance of the girl Fletcher, except by the police.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM DOWNING, </hi>9 X, who was on duty at Willesden Green Police Station, and took the charge (of loitering) said that prisoner gave the name of John Westwood, no fixed abode, labourer; he was perfectly sober, and cool and collected.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">TRITTON, </hi>X Division. On the night of Jane 15 I was at the station when Mrs. Brown came to report the disappear<lb/>ance of the child; a search was instituted, with no result. On the morning of the 19th when prisoner was brought in on the charge of loitering and gave the name of Westwood, I asked him why he had gives that name, as I had known him previously as Burgess; he made no reply. A little later, on what Batters by told me, I again saw pri<lb/>soner, and, after being cautioned, he said: "I want to make a con<lb/>fession. On Tuesday I took a little girl from a field near Round<lb/>wood Park. I took her on the tram to Edgware and into a field behind the stack. I murdered her; I stabbed her with my knife; I got her behind a stack. The knife was this knife, " which he pro<lb/>duced. "She wore a straw hat with a band on it. " I showed him a piece of stuff that had been handed to me by Mrs. Brown; he said, "That is the sort of dress the girl was wearing. It was about half<lb/>past two when I took her away. It was near the brook. I put her into it" Later in the day I was present when the body was taken from the Edgware brook. (Witness produced the clothing found on the body and floating in the brook; these were the articles identified by Mrs. Brown.) While taking prisoner to the station he made this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190018"/>
               <p>further statement: "I went to Watford on Wednesday and east back on Thursday and looked into the brook as I came along, to make sure the girl was there and she was still lying where I left her is the water."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Until prisoner made the confession we did not know that he had killed the child; it was on his information that we found the body.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JACK PIPE, </hi>X Division. On being charged with the murder prisoner said, "I choked her with a piece of my muffler, then stabbed her; I laid my coat under her because the grass was wet and f—d her; the blood on my coat was from her. "</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CECIL W. COOKE, </hi>divisional surgeon, described the condition of the child's body, which was consistent with prisoner's statements, ex<lb/>cept that there were no evidences of outrage. There were some marks of strangulation, nine wounds about the neck, twenty about the heart. The pocket-knife produced (handed to the police by prisoner) could have caused the wounds. The cause of death was hemorrhage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This is an extraordinary and abnormal crime, and points to the murderer not being in his right mind; it was pro<lb/>bably a case of lust-murder, or Sadism.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner, Mr. White called</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DYER, </hi>medical officer of Brixton Prison, who said he had had prisoner under observation since June 7 and had also knows hut in <hi rend="smallCaps">1906</hi>as an inmate of Dartmoor Prison. Witness's opinion was that prisoner was of a low mental state and that at the time of the murder he was suddenly seized with a fit of violently uncontrollable passion, due to chronic mental enfeeblement, and did not know or appreciate the nature and quality of his actions.</p>

At about 4. 45 a.m. prisoner, whom I knew very well as a licensed porter, said, "I want one of the hindquarters for Miller." I said, "Are you from Miller? " He said, "Yes." I said, ''Are you sure? " I then delivered to him a hindquarter of beef, value ₤5. At about eight a.m. I taw Miller's own man and went to look for prisoner, but could not find him. On Wednesday, May 19, I saw him in St. John Street. He said, "I near they want me for having a quarter of beef out of your shop? " I said, "Yes, you had better come and see my governor." He came into the shop and saw Mr. Martin, who asked him what he had done with the hindquarter and who had tent him for it. He said, "A tall, dark man sent me for it, " and that he had put it in a van standing out<lb/>side the "Triangle Hotel, " which is a coffee house in the market. He said he had never seen the man before, but he would try and find him. The next day the came to the shop and said he had been unable to find him.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I said that Mr. Miller was a tall, dark man. Miller had nothing to do with the buying.</p>

I saw nothing of prisoner till June 30, when I saw him in Mare Street, Hackney<hi rend="smallCaps">, </hi>going into a public-house with three other men. I said to him, "Medcraft, you know what I want you for? " He said, "Yes, for a quarter of beef from Grimaldi's."

I hold a warrant for your arrest for obtaining a quarter of beef from Fitler and Kilby on May 27 last." He said, "I don't know anything about it." I said, "You have been away from the market since this affair." He said, "Yes. Mr. Grimaldi told me I should lose my badge, so I threw it away and sold my smock. I went to Epsom during Derby week. Since then I have done no work except holding horse's heads, or anything I could get. He was taken to Snow Hill police-station; the warrant was read to him. He said, "I don't know that I was in the market that day. " He was before the magistrate on July 1 when Bines identified him.</p>

I do not know the number of his badge, but he lives Homerton way. He told me to say "Ward"—they knew him, but they would not know me.

I went with her to Hollington Street, Highgate New Town, to see her boys; we took toys and sweets, and we saw her little boys and gave them the sweets. The prisoner came cut of the door and snatched them away and trod on them; he told me if I came there again with my sister he would have me locked up. My sister is alive and outside the Court.</p>

                  </hi>(Messrs. Thomas and Robert Walter, pawnbrokers, 51, City Road, E. C.). I got to know defendant in 1898, when he was introduced to me by a customer whom I have known for 25 years. I had transactions with prisoner in 1898 and 1907. He called upon me early in January in the present year and represented that he had a friend coming from Paris who wished to buy a pair of single stone diamond earrings for his wife, the price to be approximately ₤120. I bad not any in stock just the size he wanted, and he asked me if I could get in a selection for him to see. In all I showed him five pairs. This would be a few days previously to January 15. He selected one pair, which he said he thought would answer the purpose of the value of ₤137 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was arranged that he should telephone to me to make an appoint<lb/>ment. He subsequently telephoned that his friend was to be at his flat on Friday, January 15, at 12 o'clock, and the suggestion was made that I should be there a little before 12 to see which of the two pairs should be shown to his friend. I kept the appointment at prisoner's flat, Cleveland Mansions, 14, Albion Avenue, Maids Vale. After some little time there was a knock at the door. Prisoner went outside to open it, and brought into the room a woman, saying, This is the wife of my friend. She has come to say that her husband cannot keep the appointment, but will be here later." She left to</p>

               <p>visit, as prisoner said, a French lady who lives opposite, and re<lb/>turned in a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes. I waited on for some time. Prisoner said, "My friend does not seem to tarn up. Would you care to leave the earrings with me and I will show them to my friend, and I will undertake that either the earrings or the cash shall be in your hands at four o'clock to-day." I agreed to leave toe earrings, and he produced then a certificate for 250 shares in the Newfoundland Pulp and Timber Territories, Limited. I told him I did not know whether the certificate was worth anything, but I would accept it conditionally; there was no transfer, and I had never heard of the company. Before I left he gave me a receipt: "Received of T. R. Walter and Son, one pair single atone diamond earrings, price ₤137 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I undertake to return the earrings to them at or before four o'clock to-day or to hand them the cash by the save time. I place in their hands a certificate for 250 ₤1 shares in the Newfoundland Pulp and Timber Territories, Limited, not as security but as bona-fide of good faith, to be returned to me when the matter if settled." I wrote out the receipt, and he signed it W. R. Jack." After I had left the earrings I went back to my place of business. As prisoner did not come to the shop at four o'clock I began to get anxious, and sent my assistant up to his flat with a letter which was brought back to me unopened. While the messenger was absent I received a telephone call from prisoner, I should think about a quarter past fire. He said, "I have sold the earrings but my friend has paid me in French notes. I am endea<lb/>vouring to change them and will bring you the cash." I replied that he need not trouble about that as I would accept French notes. He said, "Very well, I will come along to you at once." I did not see him again until after his arrest. I went to his flat the same evening with the police. We waited there until 10 minutes past one in the morning, and a sorry vigil it was. No one came. Next day a warrant was issued on my application at Marlborough Street Police Court. I have had no communication from prisoner of any sort or kind. I have never seen the earrings since January 15 nor any part of the money. I have never known prisoner by any other name than "W. K. Jack."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have had five transactions with prisoner and made a profit each time until the last. I bought a necklace of him for ₤406. When the lady came to the flat she and prisoner spoke in French, which I do not understand. I told prisoner I had no objection to leaving the earrings with him. It was, I am afraid, the introduction of his friend's wife that put me off my guard. drew out the receipt to show prisoner had got the earrings. I had no proof of it unless I had some acknowledgment from him. The previous transactions were in the way of advances. Prisoner tele<lb/>phoned to me from the neighbourhood of Piccadilly. The certificate did not operate in my mind in the slightest degree when I handed over the jewels; he would have had them without the certificate. The certificate was his suggestion, not mine.</p>

                  </hi>I am assistant to Mr. Bosher, pawn broker, 464, Edgware Road, and live on the premises. On Friday, January 15, in this year, prisoner came to my master's shop about 2. 30 p.m., produced a pair of diamond earrings, and asked Mr. Haycock, the manager, to lend ₤100 on them. Haycock replied that he could not lend more than ₤80. Prisoner said that would not suit him, and took the earrings away. That was all that was said on that occasion. He came back the same afternoon, about a quarter to four, and said he had decided to take the ₤80. Mr. Hay<lb/>cock asked him for the receipt for the earrings, and he said he had not got it. Then Mr. Haycock said if he had not a receipt he could not have anything to do with them. I had seen prisoner in the shop on a previous occasion, when he pledged something which was redeemed.</p>

He said Yes, and that he had bought them in Paris. I asked him if he had a receipt for them, and he said No. I asked him the lowest sum he would take for them, and he said ₤85. As he had no receipt I told him I could not deal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I remember the date because on the following morning Mr. Walter rang me up and told me the earrings had been obtained from him.

The total number of shares was 601, 457 of ₤1 each, of which 600, 000 were issued as fully-paid for consideration other than cash. There had been numerous substantial transfers of the shares from February, 1908, to May, 1909, viz., 10, 000 on February 17, 23, 000 on September 10, 20, 000 on December 14, and 10, 000 on April 20 of this year.

With regard to the transfer of the 250 shares from Norse worthy to Jack, witness had no information as to the consideration for the transfer.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). My full name it William Alexander Robert Jack. In January last 1 met in the street a French gentleman whom I had known in Paris. We spoke of several things, and he told me that perhaps I could help him to get a pair of earrings for his wife. He knew when I was in Paris that I had dealings in jewellery. I telephoned to Mr. Walter, who said he had several things to show me, and afterwards I went to Mr. Walter's shop, and we subsequently arranged that he should show the things to this gentleman at my flat on Friday, January 15. Whilst we were waiting the wife of the gentleman called, and I told Mr. Walter if he did not want to wait longer he could leave the things with me. He told me he was not by himself in his house of business, and it was not his custom to leave things, and there was hesitation on his part. I then told him I would give him the share certificate as security just for a few hours, and he said, "If you will give me that I will leave the earrings until half-past four." He then made out the receipt, and I signed it. About half an hour after Mr. Walter had gone my friend came. I showed him the earrings and he said they looked rather dear. I said he could show them to somebody before he bought them. We then took a cab to go to Gerrard Street. We stopped on the way in Edgware Road at the pawnbroker's (Bosher, s) to ask how much they would give on the things. My friend would not go into the shop because he said he could not speak English well, so I went in myself. As Bosher would not give more than ₤80 we went on to Gerrard Street, where I stopped the cab at the telephone office. Before we arrived there my friend told me he would give the ₤137, but he would pay me in French notes. While I was telephoning he said he would go to</p>

               <p>his hotel, the Villa Villa, in Gerrard Street, and show the ear<lb/>rings to his wife. I afterwards went to the hotel to ask for my friend, and was told he had not been in since the morning. Know<lb/>ing he had acquaintances at two or three places in the City I went about in a taxi-cab trying to find him, but was unable to do so, being always told by his friends that they had seen him the day before for the last time. I was myself going to Parts in two or three days, but instead of waiting that time I started for Paris the next morning to try and find him. About a month after I met him in Paris. I called a policeman, but the commissaire told me that he could not take notice of the offence as it had been committed in London. I did not write to Mr. Walter, because I expected to be able to make up the amount to him by doing further business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not go back to my flat on the night of January 15. I knew that next morning the brokers were in. I told the landlord's agent he could take the furniture, worth perhaps ₤30 or ₤40, for the rent. I had received the certificate for the transfer of the shares the day before. I know that the transfer is dated November. I gave Mr. Norseworthy a promissory note for the shares. I do not know that on January 18 Mr. Norseworthy got judgment against me for ₤275 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in respect of that dis<lb/>honoured promissory note. Mr. Norseworthy issued a writ against me in December. The name of my friend was Rostint. I have been in England three or four times since January. When I went into Bother's shop I did not want to pledge the earrings, but only to know how much he would lend on them. I was not bound to accept Mr. Walter's appreciation of them. I did not go to Atten<lb/>borough's shop in Shaftesbury Avenue the same afternoon. I went there two months later with some emerald earrings; quite a different transaction altogether. Those earrings came from Belgium. I did not know that Mr. Walter was making a claim against me for the earrings. I thought as he had security he would wait. I had given the security before the judgment of Mr. Norseworthy. The shares were quite free when I gave the certificate. I never went near Mr. Waiter from the day I got the earrings.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ANBERT SQUIRES, </hi>recalled. Although the pris<lb/>oner has not been previously convicted in England, there is no doubt he is an international swindler. He is wanted at the present time by the French police and the Belgian police for frauds of a very extensive nature, and there is a warrant also in existence for his extradition for obtaining a pair of diamond earrings. He was sentenced about 18 months ago by the Paris Court to four months' imprisonment for obtaining a pair of diamond earrings valued at 46, 000 francs. He travels backwards and forwards between France and this country, and stays at West End hotels. Although he was born in France his parents are English.</p>

               <p>Prisoner married his first wife in October, 1906. Last year he met the woman wish whom he went through a form of marriage, pro<lb/>fessing to be a single man. She is now in the West Ham Union In<lb/>firmary, where she is expecting her confinement.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">MARSHALL.</hi>I have seen this young woman in West Ham Workhouse, and she says during the time they were living together he treated her very well. She has no complaint to make against him at all. I have a letter he has written to another woman in Leytonstone offering marriage. Prisoner said his first wife had chucked knives and forks at him, threatened to do him in, made him asleep in the w. c., and laughed at him through the window. She had been out with fellows and had written to a soldier in India to come over and pay him. This had led him to do what he had dons.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Travers Humphreys prosecuted; Mr. Lambert defended Honori Quinot; Mr. E. G. Moran defended Rachias.</p>
               <p>Dr. H. J. M. D. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALI BARKER, </hi>10, Bentinck Street. Marylebone, Quinot and his wife were employed by me from December 29 till the beginning of February last as manservant and cook. They came from an agency kept by Rachias at Notting Hill. I used to spend the week-end in the country, and during that time my house was left in their sole charge. I missed various things, but cannot say I con<lb/>nected their loss with them. The pearl pin produced is my property, The two sheets produced have my name on them. They are my property. The pillow-case produced is exactly similar to some we have. I do not see my name on it. The panama hat produced is exactly similar to one I missed; it now has a different ribbon. I have been shown a quantity of other ornaments by the police, which I identified as my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lambert. Quinot and his wife were recom<lb/>mended to me by prisoner Rachias. I had no other servants at Bentinck Street. If one had an afternoon off I should expect the other to remain in the house. That would be arranged by my wife. I am certain they were not expected to go out together.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190031"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moran. I know Rachias keeps an agency for the supply of servants; as far as I know they are chiefly foreign.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR SPRINGER, </hi>M Division. I arrested Rachias on May 8 at 102, Westbourne Grove, on another charge. I proceeded to search his place. He keeps a servants' registry there. He has really two rooms divided into four. The bedroom is partitioned off, and one part is used chiefly for storing utensils. I found a long box is me bedroom, and when I proceeded to search it he said, " That is all right; all the things in that, the linen and that, belongs to me." In the box I found the two sheets marked "Sale Barker." The pillow-case was on the pillow on the bed. On the chimney piece I found some ornaments, which have been identified by last witness, and a number of other articles, including a pair of links in a pair of cuffs. In one of the drawers in the room I found the panama hat. I found also the box which is at the back of the court bearing the initials of Mrs. Sale Barker. In that box were a quantity of things which have been identified by last witness. It was corded when I found it. Rachias said it had been brought there by the man Quinot, and he protested against us opening it, but we did to. The hat-box was in the small partitioned-off part of the bedroom; there was no natural ligt to it, and we had to use artificial light to search. I found in the long box, which Rachias said contained his own linen, a tablecloth which has been identified by Miss Irwin. It hat on it "Gainsborough House" in black letters plainly printed. He said he had given the man Quinot a shilling for it.</p>
               <p>Croat-examined by Mr. Lambert. Quinot was not present at the interview I have been describing; he was not arrested till two days later. There was some bedding in the room where I found the large box, but no bed. The box was corded at it is now; we used the same cord. I had no opportunity of calling Quinot's attention to Rachies's satement that he had sold the tablecloth for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because he was in the country at the time. When he was arrested we were not justified in asking questions. Rachias objected to our opening the hot. He said the man Quinot had brought it there. He did not say Quinot brought the other box there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Morau. The box was corded; it would have fallen to pieces otherwise. Rachias protested against it being opened. I think his words were, "Don't open that, because Mr. Quinot it not here." He merely said the other box contained hit own property; nothing else was in it. He did not obstruct us in any way.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS TATTENHAM, </hi>M. Division. I was with last wit<lb/>ness when Rachias was arrested and when his rooms were searched. Two days afterwards I arrested Quinot and his wife at Horsham. I told them they would be charged with receiving a quantity of property, of Dr. Sale Barker's and other persons. I spoke to them in English. Quinot said, "I did not steal." The woman said, "Me steel, not my men. It my box. Rachias take it from 10, Bentinok Street. Me no give him tablecloth; he steal it; not give me money for it." She said this in the presence of her husband. Mrs. Quinot subsequently made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190032"/>
               <p>a statement to me, not in the presence of Rachias. On May 12 I went to 6, Pickering Place. The Quinots gave me that address. I found in a room there two large trunks. In those trunks I found a quantity of property, including some towels marked "Gainsborough House, " and some articles which have been identified by Dr. Sale Barker Prisoners lodged there prior going to Horsham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Dr. Lambert. When I pointed to the initials on the box she did not say Rachias took it from Bentinck Street. Before the magistrate I said, pointing to a box, "She said Rachias took it from 10, Bentinck Street." I do not wish to contradict that not Pointing to the sheets she said, "Me no steal them. Rachias cant to Bentinck Street to see me. Honori in the kitchen. Me go out Rachias thief. Take them very quick. Then pointing to some other things which I had got laid out she said, "I steal them; no my man. " The two boxes that were at Pickering Place were ordinary domestic servants' boxes and had no marks showing which would be the hus<lb/>band's or which the wife's. They are facsimile boxes. The stolen goods were found in both boxes. I cannot say whether more was in one than the other. Apart from the things I took for the purpose of this case the contents consisted chiefly of their own wearing apparel. The garments in the man's box were neatly folded up.</p>

                  </hi>16, Pembridge Road, W. The silk handker<lb/>chief handed to me came in with a parcel of Rachias's washing on May 5, I think. Rachias brought it himself. We washed it and after wards it was handed to the police. These two lady's nightdresses were washed at our laundry. They came with Quinot's linen. The Quinots came and asked me to send for the laundry. I did not notice the initials on the nightdresses till the detective came in and had a look at the parcel. One has the initials "F. S. B."; the other has been picked; there is only the "F, " and the "S. B." has been picked out. I did not do that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lambert. We wash by machinery. The machinery would not interfere with the initials. The handkerchief was not with Quinots' linen, it was in Rachias's. Quinots' linen was sent home and brought back again to the shop; it was to be kept.</p>

I saw Rachias at his servants' registry and engaged Quinot and his wife as cook and manservant. They came on October 5 and stayed till November 16. I did not miss anything while they were with me. Afterwards there was a tablecloth missing. I thought it was missing at the laundry. This tablecloth has my mark. I cannot swear to the tablecloth. The towels also have my mark. I did not give any towels to the Quinots while they were in my employment.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190033"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lambert. The tablecloths and towels would go to the laundry to be washed. I attended to that myself, with the aid of the housemaid. The woman Quinot did not suit me. The man afterwards wrote asking me to take him back. I replied offering to take him as a waiter.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT SAUNDERS.</hi>On May 17 I read the charges to all three prisoners together at West London Police Court. I addressed then in French. Rachias said, "I know nothing about Sydney House. The pin I admit giving to my sister, but you have to prove I stole it." Quinot said, "I understand."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lambert. Mrs. Quinot made a statement in French. I interpreted it to Mr. Tattenham, who took it down in writing. She signed that statement, and it was read over to her after wards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILCOCKS, </hi>6, Pickering Place, Bayswater. I first saw the two male prisoners about three months ago. Rachias asked if we bad a bedroom or bed-sitting-room. I showed them a bedroom, and it was decided to take it for Quinot and hit wife. They came and stayed about a week. When they went away they kept the room on, paid t week's rent for keeping me room and the two boxes. When they first came in they had only a small portmanteau. I do not know who brought the two boxes. I only saw them the day they were going away. They had been gone about a week when the police came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lambert Mr. and Mrs. Quinot stayed with me over a week. They did not tell me they were going to a situation in the country. I heard that from another person. I let them the room while the landlady was not there. She looked after them. I used to see them passing in and out. I did not see the boxes come; I was only told they were brought.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I have pleaded guilty to this charge. I was born in Belgium. I was about 19 when I married Quinot in 1907. We carried on business in Brussels for some little time. I saw an advertisement in "Le Soir" for a Belgium married couple, offering ₤40 a year. My husband replied to the advertise<lb/>ment, and we were sent with a letter to Mr. Rachias in London. We paid him an engagement fee of 50 francs. He procured us a situation about a month afterwards. I do not remember the address. We were there about three days. A month after that we went to Mrs. Irwin. We were there, I believe, more than three months. I took the table<lb/>cloth and towels from her place. My husband did not know I took them. I took nothing else from her. I left there because I was not a good cook; I had never done any cooking. After another situation I went to Dr. Barker. By that time I had learnt some cooking. I was at Bentinck Street about three months. Then Dr. Barker found my husband and myself a situation with a friend of his, Mr. Wise. My husband did not know anything about the things that were re-</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190034"/>
               <p>moved from Dr. Barker's house. We were the only two servants there. We could not go out together. At one time Rachias used to come there practically every day. Sometimes my husband would be there and sometimes not. I only heard of the pearl pin after we bad left Dr. Barker. I did not take it. Rachias took it I took the cigar case. I could not say how the things were taken. They were in the trunk and Rachias took it away. My husband was not there at the time. I packed the things that went to the laundry at Pembridge Road. I only sent washing once there. I made the list out in French and my husband wrote it in English. He did not know the night<lb/>dresses were not mine. One of the boxes that went to Pickering Place was mine; the other was my husband's. I have always said my hus<lb/>band knew nothing about the things I took.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moran. Rachias asked me to steal a chain at Dr. Barker's. Sometimes Rachias lent us money because we were without. I stole the articles in the box. I did not take it to Rachias. He took the box away. I had no home at that time in which to place a box. At Pickering Place I had a box with my own things in. I never sold articles to Rachias. I cannot say what I was going to do with the things I stole from Dr. Barker. Perhaps I was going to keep them. I never stole anything in my life before coming to Eng<lb/>land. I stole things from Mr. Wise and Mrs. Irwin. My husband never saw those things; they were in my trunk. As to the night<lb/>dresses, one is a nightshirt, the other a chemise. I do not know where they come from. They could not have been found in the trunk, because I did not take them. Nobody suggested I should steal things. I took two necklaces from Mrs. Wise, ft was not to steal them; one was worth sixpence. She told my husband. He was very cross with me.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I have been in this country two years and carry on the business of a servants' registry at 102, Westbourne Grove. The box that contained the stolen property was brought to me by Madame Quinot herself. When I got the box I did not know the articles were stolen. It was corded. I do not know if it had got a key. She told me she was going into the country and wanted me to keep the box; it was too much trouble travelling with it and was clothes she did not want for her service. I told the con<lb/>stables it was not mine; it was Madame Quinot's. When the con<lb/>stables found the pair of sheets in one box I told them I had received them from her, and I told them I had got another box of hers. They asked where the box was and I showed them. I found both the other prisoners employment in several places. I often lent Madame Quinot money. About January she came to my office and said she wanted some money; did I know someone who would buy a pin and cufflinks ✗ She told me the pin was her husband's. I bought them for 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I gave the pin to my sister. I told her I had bought it. Madame Quinot asked me if I would keep the pair of sheets and tablecloth. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190035"/>
               <p>said "Yes, " and put them in another box. I did not know she had stolen the things. She told me she had forgotten to put the things in the box. I do not remember buying anything else, except the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She brought the box herself. I did not look in it at all. I did not see the initials on it. I should not have known what they meant if I had seen them. I lent both her and her husband money when they were in difficulties. I was not at all surprised that Madame Quinot was in possession of a pearl pin and sleeve links. She told me it was from her husband. I did not know the value of the pin. I do not think it can be worth ₤20 or ₤10. As to the ornaments, perhaps two days after the brought the pin and links she said, "Will you keep me these? I cannot put in my trunk, it is too fragile. " If I had known they were stolen I would not keep the box. I think it likely these people would own such china ornaments; they told me they had been established in Belgium before. I do not know why they should not bring china ornaments with them. As to the panama hat, she told me she could not put it in the box; it was too full; it might get spoilt in the box. She took it out of the box and said, "Keep it. " This was in my office. I did not see her un<lb/>cord the box. She did it up again. She told me she had something to take out of the box and something to put in. As to the silk hand<lb/>kerchief, I had been to see Quinot at Mr. Wise's; I had no handker<lb/>chief with me, and she lent me the one which I was supposed to give back to her. I saw the initials on the corner of it. I asked where she got it, and she said Dr. Barker had given several to her husband. As to the pillow-case, Dr. Barker cannot say it belongs to him; it is my own property. I recognise it very well. The things that were in the long box I believe I told the officers were my own. I did not see the officer take two sheets from my box—I could not say; it is three months ago. There was one box containing all my own articles and another from which articles-were taken belonging to Madame Quinot. The police say they showed me two sheets with the name of Sale Barker on. Madame Quinot had taken them out of her box and for<lb/>gotten to put them in again. She asked me to keep them for her, end I put them in that box. This was the same time she took out the panama hat. I did not look to see whether they were marked or not Madame Quinot will tell you I did not know What was in the box.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">TATTENHAM</hi>recalled. Rachias came to this country in July, 1907, and went into a situation as manservant for a short time. After that he went into a registry office in Church Street, Notting Hill, as clerk. After that he started business for himself. He gets a great number of French people over to this country. He gets fees from them of two or three guineas, and places them in situations they are absolutely unsuited for; consequently, after a few days they are sent adrift and thrown on the benevolence of French people. We have several complaints of his taking women there and seducing</p>

               <p>them and robbing them. No doubt the proceeds of larcenies are sent abroad. He is associated with men engaged in the white slave traffic and observation has been kept on him in that direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I say he is connected with the white slave traffic He is associated with men who get women over from abroad. There has been no conviction against him until this matter.</p>

Previously to this prisoner had often spoken about getting some one to adopt the child. Next day I got the child ready and prisoner called and took it away; I have sot seen it since. (Witness identified a number of articles of clothing presently spoken to by Br. Roe and the police.) The 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was paid regularly for a time, but eventually prisoner owed me ₤3 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. As day after the child left prisoner came to me; she said the had beta discharged from her place for being a little late home the pre<lb/>lists night; she had with her a square cardboard box and a brown paper parcel. I asked her how she had left the baby the night before. she said, "All right" but she did not seem to care to speak much about him. On May 7 prisoner left me, saying that she was going into temporary service in Santos Road; she took with her her box sad parcel. On May 24 she left Santos Road and came back to me. she brought with her a tin box; she remained with me until the police came. I several times asked her if I could see the baby. She said I could not, as it was too far away and too expensive to go, but I should see him some day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had frequently discussed with prisoner the ques<lb/>tion of getting the child adopted or taken into some home. I am certain that she said her friend lived at Holborn; she did not men<lb/>tion Waterloo.</p>
               <p>Evidence having been given of the illness and unavoidable absence of Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">HARRIETT</hi>D<hi rend="smallCaps">EANE, </hi>her deposition was read: "Prisoner entered my service at 87, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, on April 22; she brought no luggage, out a small cardboard box. Her clothes were sot satisfactory, and I cannot say that I was satisfied with her. She ewe on a Thursday, and on Friday week we mutually agreed that she should go at the end of the month. On May 5 it was prisoner's night out; she should have been in at 10 p.m.; she was late. I spoke to my son; I heard prisoner come home, but did not see her; it was just turned half-past 10; she left my service the next morning; I did not see her."</p>

May 7, prisoner came to me as a temporary servant; she thought with her the cardboard hat box produced. On the Monday after she came, about 7. 30 a.m., I noticed from my bedroom a smell of taming below. I called down to prisoner asking what she had burn<lb/>ing she said, "Nothing." The kitchen fire had been lighted on the Monday and the Tuesday. On Tuesday morning when I was in the kitchen I noticed that there was a great quantity of ashes in the grate.

               <p>Cross-examined. Mine is a nine-roomed house. The kitchen stove is a rather large one. It was a week or two before I gave evi<lb/>dence at the police court that I was first asked about noticing a smell of burning. It was on the Monday or the Tuesday, but I think the Monday; I noticed it when I opened my bedroom door. I cannot say that the smell suggested burning fat. I had not noticed any extra consumption of coal.</p>

I saw her afterwards from time to time, and gave her assistance to keep the baby—alto<lb/>gether between ₤4 and ₤5. On the morning after her leaving the Salisburys she came to me. She said she should not go into service again. I asked her what she had done with the baby. She said she had given it to a woman in Waterloo Road and should not lee it any more. She could not tell me who the woman was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.

I examined the white shawl produced; it bears stains of mammalian blood. The cardboard box produced has at the bottom stains of some fluid containing blood. As the result of decomposition in a body shortly after death s serous fluid sometimes exudes from the mouth or nose; that would produce a similar stain to those on the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I cannot tell where the bloodstains on the shawl might come from. The average weight of a well-grown male child aged seven months would the 12 lb. to 15 lb.; there would be s small amount of hard bone.

I said, "I want you to tell me where your baby is that you took away from new on May 5." She said, "I cannot tell you where it is; I took the child away because I was in money difficulties with Mrs. Edwards. I had met a woman in Euston Road about a fortnight before I took the child away; we got into conversation; I was with her an hour; I believe she was a woman who walked the streets: she did not tell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190039"/>
               <p>me who she was or her name. She asked me what occupation I fol<lb/>lowed; I told her I could not follow any as I had a child. I made to appointment to see her at Waterloo Station on Wednesday, Hay 5, at 8. 30 p.m. That night I took the baby away straight to Waterloo Station and gave the baby to her. I do not know the woman's name or where she lived. I was pleased at the time to get the child away, because I could not keep it. I do not know who I gave it to. I have never seen the baby or the woman since. I did say to the women, 'Are yon keeping the baby in London? ' She said, 'No, in Baited, Sussex. '" She told me, further, that the child had been registed in the name of Reginald Jack James, that it had not been vaccinated, and that nobody had advised her to get rid of the child. I asked her for a description of the woman. She said she was about forty years of age, medium height, medium build, very dark, and ill mod in a dark straw hat. Prisoner upon this was detained at tat police station.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD BADCOCK.</hi>On June 3, at 9 a.m., I saw prisoner at Wandsworth Police Station, and after the usual caution she made a statement which I took down in writing and she signed. (The statement was similar to that made to Barrett.) Two hours later prisoner, who was sitting in my office, volunteered another statement, which I also took down in writing, and which she signed. I had said absolutely nothing to her about making a further statement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cassels submitted that this statement was inadmissible, being made as the result of an improper inducement by the person in authority. (R. v. Thompson, 1893, 2 Q. B. D., p. 12.) (The officer had said to prisoner, after she had told the story as to giving the child to a woman, "she is not a fit person to have your baby, and yon must tell me all you know about her in order that the baby may be put in safety. Before you say anything I must tell you that I shall write down what you say, and if any harm has come to the baby at your hands you will be charged, and anything you say will be used in evidence against you. ") There was no sufficient caution; prisoner was not told that she was not obliged to say anything at all or that she need not say anything to incriminate herself. Prisoner's statement was the result of "a feeling of fear" induced by what the officer had said to her; what he said to her amounted to "pressure." (R. v. Berriman, 6 Cox, p. 398; R. v. Knight and Phayre, 20 Cox, p. 711.)</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice held that the statement was admissible. Prisoner was properly questioned about the disappearance of the baby, to give her an opportunity of removing all suspicion against her. The caution given before the first statement was sufficient to justify the officer taking the further statement two hours later.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. Prisoner's second statement was as fol<lb/>lows: "I choked him with my handkerchief at West Hill and burnt me body so that there should be no evidence against me. I took him from Mrs. Edwards's alter eight o'clock, went up West Hill, pushed my handkerchief down his throat, and choked him; then I put him in my coat and carried him to Mrs. Deane s, where I wee in service; the son let me in. I put him in my hat-box, and when I left my place the next day I took him to Mrs. Edwards's, and the next I took him under some things in the box to my new place, Mrs. salisbury's, and burnt the body in the kitchen stove on Monday morn<lb/>ing before anybody was up. The lady had told me they only used the kitchen stove on Monday, so I waited for then. There was nothing left. As the fire burned, so I poked lit down till I could get the top</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190040"/>
               <p>of the stuff down. I could not afford to pay for him, and go thought it better to get rid of him and start fresh. I have always had too much my own way and got about town too much. I do not know who the father was, but I think he was a gentleman's servant. I knew you would find out I had not told the truth about the woman, and feel better now it is off my mind. I could do nothing else; I could not afford to keep him. I had him at 5 or 7, Engadine Street, South<lb/>fields, on October 28, a nursing home. I left there when he was a month old and took him to Mrs. Edwards. I took him away fast her on May 5, Wednesday." I afterwards went to Mrs. Edwards's house, and there found in the room that bad been occupied by pri<lb/>soner the cardboard box and the tin box produced. The latter con<lb/>tained the white shawl and some baby's clothes. On prisoner being charged with murder she made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner had been detained at the station short nine hours when A took her first statement. As to her second state<lb/>ment, I did realise, after the first sentence, that it was in the nature of a confession, but I did not stop her; the had no caution other than the first caution. Between East Putney and Waterloo there it I pretty frequent service of trains during the day.</p>
               <p>No evidence was called for the defence.</p>

The jury were probably aware that in cases similar to this the death sentence was not carried into execu<lb/>tion. but it was absolutely necessary to see that, in cases of this kind, for the protection of infant life, the punishment enacted by the law should be pronounced.</p>

I have known him as living in Hendon. I went home, told my husband, and the next morning between eight and nine he went with me to the police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Purcell. I have had 14 days, not for soliciting, but for refusing my name and address. I have been con<lb/>victed of soliciting. On July 3 I left home about 9 p.m., and left my husband in Kilburn at 9. 30. McMillan did not stand me a drink in the Lower Welsh Harp or go to the roundabouts with me. He did nothing to me except to assist me to get away home.</p>

What I had from the woman I paid for and I left her with Jack McMillan on the grass in Dollis Road. I went down the Edgware Road. McMillan followed me. McMillan said he was tired and we went in a field and lay down on some hay—it was then about two a.m. Lambert was with us. I woke up. McMillan was gone, and we went back towards where we had left Mrs. Tobin, when we found Jack McMillan crawling about on his hands and beet at the same spot. I and Lambert walked towards him and found a purse on the grass close to the road containing 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. silver, 41/2d. bronze. and two tramtickets. I had 7¼; d., Lambert had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I threw the purse down near where she had lain and McMillan picked it up again.

I cautioned him and read Fowler's statement to him. He said, "I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the money, and knew who the money belonged to." At 8. 45 p.m. I was with Detective-sergeant Durgin in Church Street, Hendon, when I saw McMillan. I told him we were police officers and that be would be taken to the police station and charged with being concerned with Fowler and Lambert in stealing a purse containing two half<lb/>sovereigns and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver from Mrs. Tobin at about 11. 15 p.m. on July 3 at Dollis Hill, near the Lower Welsh Harp.

She said, "It cannot be ₤1 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I was only there four days." I conveyed her to Notting Hill Police Station.

On July 8, at 125 p.m., I was on duty at Fresh Wharf, when I saw prisoner deliberately jump off the parapet of London Bridge, falling about 30 ft. into deep water. I ran to Old Swan Pier, when I found that James Windsor (who is not here) had clutched the prisoner as he floated by. Windsor said in the hearing of the prisoner that he straggled a lot and seemed to try to get out of hit clutch as he was getting him on to the pier. Prisoner said his head was bad—he did not know what he was doing. He was taken to Guy's Hospital, where be re- mained until July 12, when I arrested him on a warrant. He said, "I jumped off the bridge because my head was bad."</p>
               <p>Prisoner stated that he did not intend to take his life; he jumped off because he could not control himself—his head was very bad at the time; he was very much better now and he would promise never to do such a thing again.</p>

                  </hi>73, Approach Road, Victoria Park, engi<lb/>neer. On February 25, 1909, I desired to borrow ₤10 or ₤12. Prisoner agreed to arrange 14 for me and I drew and signed a bill for ₤15 at three months at his suggestion, which I gave to him. He said he could get it discounted for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I promised him ₤1 for his trouble. Prisoner was a business friend. I saw him two or three days afterwards, and he said that he could not get the money until inquiries had been made. About 14 days afterwards he told as he could not get it discounted. I said, "Yon had better bring tie bill back to me and I will destroy it." He told me afterwards at had got the hill back and had torn it up. On June 2 I was served with a summons at Shoreditch County Court. I tried to see prisoner for several days, and at last found him in his office and asked him what he was going to do about the bill—what he meant by it He told me he had been dodging me for several days, trying It pay up the money, as he had discounted the bill, and so that I should know nothing about it He has paid ₤8 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had paid ₤6 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined I received a letter from the holder, Mr. Myers's solicitor that was the first intimation I had that the bill was not destroyed. I saw Myers and told him I had been told the bill had bees destroyed. I saw prisoner six or seven days after receiving the litter. I did not tell him that he had told me he had destroyed the bill. The case was taken before the Registrar. Prisoner voluntarily paid up ₤8 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I was advised to pay the balance in order to save costs. I gave information to the police at Old Street after being served with the summons and prisoner was charged with fraudulent conversion.</p>
               <p>Tee Recorder suggested that prisoner should pay the balance, and that if so the prosecution might be withdrawn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor said the costs amounted to ₤9, and did not accept the suggestion. I did not ask prisoner what he meant by telling me he had destroyed the-bill. Three months before he swore to me that he had destroyed it I applied for leave to defend in the county court. I filed an affidavit in support of the prosecution, stating that the prisoner had repeatedly told me that he had destroyed the bill. I have never drawn or signed a bill before. I do not remember on September 1, 1908, drawing a bill at two months for ₤18 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which prisoner accepted to accommodate me; if there is such a thing it must have slipped my memory. (To the Judge.) Prisoner did not borrow</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190046"/>
               <p>money for me on any occasion or sign an acceptance for my accom<lb/>modation. (To Mr. Ramsden.) Prisoner did not ask me for a loan and suggest that I should accept a bill of exchange. I have known prisoner five or six years and have had several business affairs with him. I have a patent for an antivibrating electro lamp, which is being pushed by Ventura. Ventura has had the use of prisoner's office. I did not accept this bill for prisoner's accommodation. I have given prisoner a sovereign or half-sovereign when he was hard up. I felt sorry for the man—he used to be in a big way of business at one time. He did not lend me ₤4 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in April, 1908. I bad a cheque from him for ₤4 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was cashed and he had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it. I told prisoner I only wanted the money on the bill for three weeks or a month, and he suggested it was easier to discount a bill at three months.</p>

                  </hi>recalled. I say emphatically I have not made use of bills accepted by prisoner, nor have I obtained an overdraft from my bank on such bills. After the bill in question had been drawn I asked prisoner to discount a postdated cheque for ₤17; it was made out to Ventura and prisoner obtained the money for it; the cheque has been renewed three times and was dishonoured on July 5. The bill in question is accepted by me payable at the London City and Midland Bank and is signed "Arthur Newall and Co." The bill is marked, "No account as accepted." I have been trading at Alexander Newall and Co. for six years. My account was originally in the name of George Townsend, my partner, and was changed into the name of "Alexander Newall." That is why the bill is marked in that way. I was sued by the holder and made an application to the Registrar for leave to defend and to postpone the action until this prosecution was concluded. I do not know if that application was made without notice to the other side. It was done by my solicitor. I was not present at the hearing.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I gave the prisoner the cheque drawn payable to Ventura I did not know that he had had the money on the bill from Myers. It is untrue that I accepted the bill in order to make a loan to the prisoner.</p>

The bill was dishonoured and my solicitor sued in the Shoreditch County Court. The money has been paid into court. After my solicitor wrote to Newall he called upon me. I had never seen him before. He asked if I had seen prisoner. I said, "Yes." He said, "I am going to see him; I do not know what be it going to do about that bill because he has got to pay the bill" This was after the bill was dishonoured. He asked me if I had seen Mr. Brampton. I said, "Yes, Mr. Brampton was here and he promised to bring me some money for the bill. He has not done it yet, and,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190047"/>
               <p>of course, I want the money from you or from him." He said that he had not had the money, that Mr. Brampton had and he would see what Brampton was going to do—that Brampton was supposed to pay the money. I said I would give him till to-morrow and that I should have to press him as he was the acceptor. He asked me what try the best I could do. I said if he would bring me ₤5 to-morrow I would arrange to take the rest by weekly instalments. He came two days afterwards and asked if I would go to the police court to give evidence. I said I had something else to do, but if I was sub<lb/>poenaed, of course, I should have to go. He said his solicitor had advised him not to pay. He did not say prisoner had been entrusted with the bill and had converted the proceeds to his own use instead of bringing them to him. (To the Judge.) Prosecutor never told me that Brampton had said that he had torn the bill up.</p>

On June 17 I went with Sergeant Hall to arrest prisoner at Boundary Road, Tottenham, where he lives and carries on business. The door was opened by the prisoner. I told him we were police officers. He said, "Yes, I know what you want; I know what you nave come for"—he was undressed at the time and had just got out of bed—" that wicked woman, has done this. She knew that I was previously married; I told her that my wife was alive." I said, "You have not given me a chance of telling you what I have come for. I have come to arrest you for bigamy with Miss Cheeseman." He replied, "I knew site would do this. It is all spite. She knew I was married. I said I was a widower at the church. I have not seen my wife for 15 years and by law I can assume she is dead." When the charge was read to him he said, "Yes, quite right." I saw prisoner's wife (Drucilla Mary) the day before yesterday. Lat<lb/>terly she has been living with her father at New Southgate—two and a half miles distant.</p>

                  </hi>On August 1, 1908, I went through the cere<lb/>mony of marriage with prisoner at the Church of St. John the Evan-gelist, Palmer's Green. The certificate produced is the certificate of our marriage. Before the marriage prisoner said he had been mar<lb/>ried, but his wife was dead, but he did not tell me when or where he had been married or where he had lived or anything of that kind. I first heard rumours that his wife was live about October, 1908. I told prisoner I had heard that his first wife was alive. He said that if she was alive he could marry again at he had not seen her for 14 years. Then he said he did not know whether the was alive or dead; he had not kept her; she had deserted him 14 years ago, and since then he had kept the children, but had not kept her I afterwards went to the house where the first wife was living. That came about by my finding in a drawer the address of the Newalls (prisoner's wife's father) on a Christmas card, dated 1905. Prisoner had told me that Newall was his first wife's name. I asked him for the address of Newall. He asked me what I wanted it for. I told him I had heard that his first wife was alive, and he said that even if the was alive he could marry again. I have had a child since I have been living with prisoner; it was born on March 20.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been living on terms of affection with prisoner all along. He has been kind to me and a very good hus<lb/>band. Prior to going through the ceremony of marriage, I had conversation with him about his first wife; he told me she was dead, but he never said a word about burying her—dead to him or some<lb/>thing of that sort. I do not remember that he said she was legally dead, because he had not heard anything of her for 14 years—"dead to him, but not in the abstract, " something like that was what he said. He told me before we were married that she had left him in 1895, and since then be had charge of all the little children. After we were married he told me he had advertised for his wife, and showed me the advertisements in a number of copies of the "Isling<lb/>ton Gazette, " amongst others those of July 15, 16, and 17, 1895 I burned a number of them in a fit of temper; I went to the police in a fit of temper; I am very sorry for it now. I cannot remember the prisoner showing me a copy of another advertisement in the "Daily Mail" in August, 1907. He also told me he had bought a law book in order to see what his position was, and that, according to the "Unfee'd Lawyer, " not having heard of his wife for seven years, he was free to marry again.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. It was after I had been put upon inquiry as to his first wife being alive that I went over to New Southgate.</p>

                  </hi>wife of John Garrett, 157, King Henry's Road, St. John's Wood. I am prisoner's sister, and was present on May 14, 1884, at his marriage with Drucilla Mary Newall. I last saw her in this Court two days ago. As to the circumstances under which she ceased to live with him, I only know that they did not agree very well at the last, but they were together a good many years, I know that he urged her and always wished her to return, and other members of the family have begged her to do so; but she told me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190049"/>
               <p>only the other day in this Court that the did not want him and would not return to him under any circumstances. On May 16, 1906, I was present at the funeral of my father at Finchley Ceme<lb/>tery. Prisoner was also present. We went in the same coach. I thought I saw Drucilla at the cemetery, and I said to my brother, "I believe that it Drucie over there, " but he did not answer, and I thought he did not hear me. After we came away from the grave all the ladies got into one coach, and all the gentlemen into the other. A young lady in our coach beckoned to Drucilla, and she came and shook hands with us, but my brother was not present. I did not see her at the graveside. She did not tell us where she was living then, but merely shook hands and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were 40 or 50 people at the graveside sad the was not in front. A number of people were standing in front of her and there were other funerals at the same time. Pris<lb/>oner was on terms of very great affection with our father and we were all very much upset.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM</hi>Berry, 11, Clinton Road, Watt Green, Tottenham. I am brother of prisoner, and on May 16, 1906, attended the funeral. I saw my brother's wife Drucilla standing betide the grave when we arrived. I was in the first coach and prisoner in the second. I cannot swear whether he came up at the time she stood at the grave. I also saw her go to the graveside after we had left it. I cannot say whether my brother noticed hear. Early in the spring of this year my brother told me he thought he could get married again. I said I did not think he could. He said, "Yes, William, I can, " sad I aid, "You know best, " or "You know better than I do." Hs did not then tell me that he was married again.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS HALL, </hi>Wood Green, gave corroborative evi<lb/>dence of the arrest. Prisoner said, "I knew the would do this. It is all spite. I told her my wife was alive before we got married. I pat myself down at a widower at the church. I have not teen my vim for nearly 15 years, and according to my law book I can assume tat is dead." Witness said to him, "I have teen your wife. She mid she met you face to face one day about two years ago in Limes Avenue, New Southgate, the road in which aha it living now with W father." Prisoner replied, "Well, I did not tee her. I know her father lives there, and hat done for seven years. I called on Him about two years ago, but I did not ask him if my wife was dead. He was too insulting." On the way to the station he said, "I advertised in the 'agony' column of the 'Daily Mail' somewhere about August, 1907. I received no answer from my wife."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was very excited when we went to arrest him, and was talking very quickly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green submitted there was no case to go to the jurv. The Common Serjeant said there was a question for the jury whether prisoner did not know that his wife was alive. There was plenty of evidence that she was at the funeral of the father.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green: There is no evidence that he saw her there.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant: Two people saw her present on that occasion. He could use his eyes. There is plenty of evidence here. It is a question for the jury.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). My wife left me in 1895. When I went through the form of marriage with Miss Cheeseman in August, 1908, I did not know my wife was living—that I will swear. I advertised for her seven or eight times. I had been courting Miss Cheeseman from the previous January. Before I went through the form of marriage I said to her, "Look here, Miss Esther, if you have me you will have me with your eyes wide open. I cannot tell whether my first wife is dead or alive. I have adver<lb/>tised for her and been to the police station about her. " She said, "I see by 'Lloyd's' John you can remarry, " and did not teem at all upset or anxious. I do not remember my sister at the funeral calling my attention to the presence of my wife. I had my eyes in my handkerchief all the time. I did not see my wife at all that day nor had I any idea she was present. If I had known my wife was living I should not have married Miss Cheeseman. I will swear I did not say to the police officer, "I told her before I mar<lb/>ried her that my wife was alive." I said I thought she was deed, and that if she married me she would do so with her eyes wide open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My wife left me because she was verminous, and I told her I could not put up with it. It is not true that I turned her out; I advertised for her to return. She said she left me because of my cruelty. I urged her to return because she was the mother of my children. I do not know that she said she would rather die than return to me. In all she left me four times. She used to drink and was verminous, and I lost a good fried fish busi<lb/>ness through her; 1, 400 lice were combed out of her head, was very fond of her but for her condition. I inquired several times of her father whether she was alive. The last time would be seven or eight years ago. I said, "Do you know anything about my wife? " He replied, "I know nothing about her, John, and do not want to know." I do not know that my children have been in communication with their mother. They did not to my know<lb/>ledge spend Christmas with their mother two years ago. do not know that they received communications from her. I know nothing about the Christmas card which my wife found. If my father<lb/>in-law had behaved well to me and to my children I should have gone to him before the second marriage, but he was unapproach<lb/>able. I thought as my wife had deserted me she was legally dead.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I did not by cruelty give my wife reason for leav<lb/>ing me.</p>

                  </hi>I am a servant to Miss Brooks, of 5, Oxford and Cambridge Mansions. On September 29 I posted a letter containing a cheque to Messrs. Elliott, coal merchants. On 30th prisoner, brought a note about four o'clock in the afternoon and wanted to see Miss Brooks. Miss Brooks being an invalid lady, I said I would sot disturb her from her rest. The conversation took place at the hill door. Prisoner raised his hat as I opened the door. I noticed that he was bald. I asked him to leave the note, but he would not tare it. He said it was far too late for him to come back. He took the note away and called the following morning about 10 o'clock. He then handed the note back to me and I took it straight to my mis<lb/>tress's bedroom. Before doing so I asked him into the hall and timed the electric light up and he sat there with his hat off. When I returned I said to him, "Miss Brooks will not keep you long." Miss Brooks shortly afterwards rang the bell and I received from her a note addressed to Messrs. Elliott and Co., which I handed to pris<lb/>oner and he went. I did not see prisoner again until June 18 of this year, when I was asked to identify him at King's Gross Police Station. Several men were present, two very much alike, but when their hats were removed I had no hesitation in identifying prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen prisoner before September 29. I hesitated two or three minutes, or perhaps two or three seconds, as to whether I should disturb Miss Brooks. I waited in the kitchen till Miss Brooks rang the bell, but my kitchen door was open and I hid my eye on prisoner all the time. At King's Gross Police Station I pointed out another man as being like the man who had called. The inspector told me to touch the man I identified. I then asked to hive the men's hats taken off. I was looking for a bald man and I recognised prisoner immediately his hat was taken off. There were others who were partly bald.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have no doubt that prisoner is the man who called.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL TOMLIN, </hi>V. Prisoner was charged at Clerkenwell Police Court on June 18. He replied, "I know nothing about it. I am innocent." At the identification he was placed with eleven other men. The witness Ellen Smith, after looking at them, pointed out mother man somewhat similar to prisoner, and said, "That is like him. " The inspector in charge of the identification told her to touch the man if she knew him. She asked the inspector to have their hats removed, and, that having been done, she walked up to prisoner, touched him, and said, "That is the man."</p>

                  </hi>warrant officer, Shoreditch County Court. I have been in the high bailiff's office for some 33 years. On July 1, 1909, I held a warrant of the Judge of the Shoreditch County Court for the arrest of prisoner under the Debtors' Act and committal to Brixton Prison. On the afternoon of that day I went with two men named Anderson and Daly to the goods office of the London and North-Western Railway, Elden Street, Anderson being in the employ<lb/>ment of Otway's creditors and Daly one of my assistants. I waited outside while Anderson went in. Otway came out and I told him I had a warrant for his arrest at the suit of the Whitefriars Financial Company for the amount of ₤1 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He disputed the amount, saying it should be only ₤1 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I told him there was an extra 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the extension of the warrant. After I had read the warrant to him he said, "Do not show me up outside the station. Walk a little way this way, " and I did so. When we got opposite the North London Railway Station he said, "I can pay you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week." I said, "My dear sir, I cannot take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week. You must pay ₤1 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or go to Brixton for ten days." I also asked him if he could get the money at his office. I said, "I am willing to go back to your office to get the money if you can get it inside." He said it was of no use; he would pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. I said again I must have the ₤1 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. When I told him he would have to go to Brixton, he said, "I will see you b——d first." He was on my right-hand side, and immediacy darted into the roadway between two omnibuses. I ran after him and caught him by the front of his coat by the right hand. He then pulled away from me with a jerk, lifted up his right hand and arm, and brought it down on my right arm, dislocating the top joint of the third finger. I called out to the plaintiff's man, "He has broken my finger." He then ran away. I followed him, and found he had been stopped by Daly and a police-constable in Blom<lb/>field Street. I went to Bishopsgate Street Police Station and left</p>

               <p>him in custody with the inspector with the warrant, and than went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital in a cab. I was put under gat and the dislocation reduced. I have not yet returned to duty. The injury was a very painful one, and for three nights I got no sleep whatever. For some time I had to wear a sling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew prisoner was a clerk in the employ of tat London and North-Western Railway, hut I did not know how many years he had been there. Before taking a man to Brixton we always give him an opportunity of paying the money. There was totting in my attire to suggest a bailiff of the county court, boa I told him I was.</p>
               <p>Re-examined, I showed my finger to the constable, but I do not recollect whether I said, "Look what he has done to my finger." I did sot hear prisoner say, "How did yon manage that? "</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HARRY</hi>C. H. <hi rend="smallCaps">ANDERSON, </hi>clerk in the employment of the White<lb/>friars Financial Company. On July 1 the prisoner was owing the company a sum of money. I went with last witness and Daly to the offices of the London and North-Western Railway Company, and went in to see prisoner. When we came out I told him that the gentlemen approaching were warrant officers. He said he would make an offer of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per month. I told him I had no authority to accept that. I heard prisoner suggest to Hickling that he should sot be shown up, but would walk along the road, and Hickling and prisoner walked towards Liverpool Street, the latter being on the kerb side. Prisoner stepped quickly into the road. Hickling imme<lb/>diately followed, and held him to prevent him escaping, and pris<lb/>oner seemed to turn or pull round, and I remember seeing his arm come down on to the officer's coat. Otway then escaped and ran across the road info a street adjacent with several persona after him. I saw him arrested, and followed behind to the station. When he came came before the inspector he said he did not see how the injury to Hickling could have occurred, and mumbled something about his hands having been in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This debt was incurred about nine years ago. I could not say whether the ₤1 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. represented one or many instal<lb/>ments. I cannot say whether prisoner was present when the committal order was made. He was present when his Honour made an order for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month, but he did not comply with the order. I under<lb/>ted he has been employed by the company for a great number of years. I did not near Hickling say to the constable, "Look here what he has done to my finger." I did not hear prisoner say to Hickling, "How did you manage to do that? "</p>

                  </hi>assistant to Mr. Hickling, gave corroborative evi<lb/>dence of the interview with prisoner. With regard to the injury, he did not see how it occurred, but when prisoner ran away he blew his whistle and halloed out, "Stop him! " and prisoner was stopped in Blomfield Street. Afterwards Hickling came up with his finger damaged and had prisoner arrested by the police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before prisoner attempted to run away Hickling was not holding him by the coat or in any way. I heard Hickling</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">REUBEN HENRY, </hi>374, City. On the afternoon of July 1 I was on duty in Bloomfield Street. In consequence of a statement made to me by Hickling, I ran after Otway and arrested him. He was then being detained by Daly. I did not hear prisoner say to Hickiing, "How did you happen to do that? " referring to his dislocated finger. Prisoner was taken to the station and charged with assault. In reply he said, "How could I assault him with my hands in my pockets? " When the arrest was made in Blomfield Street prisoner said, "If I have injured him (Hickling) it was an accident."</p>

                  </hi>M. D., house surgeon, St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On July 1 I attended Hickiing at the hospital. I found the last joint of the third finger of his right hand dislocated side<lb/>ways. I put him under an anaesthetic and reduced the dislocation. It was serious because it was a lateral dislocation, a lateral disloca<lb/>tion being much more rarer than a dislocation forwards or backwards The dislocated joint was bent sideways over the little finger. The injury was painful and I put the finger in splints. He was attended by his own private doctor afterwards. I saw him a fortnight later. The finger was still swollen and tender, and movement of the joint was very painful. Such an injury could only have been earned by direct violence, a blow or a fall, or I have seen such dislocations as the result of wrenches in machines.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If Hickiing had been holding a man by the coat and the man had violently wrenched himself away, I should think it very improbable that such an injury would have been so caused. There were no bruises on the arm or hand. If the injury had been caused by a blow I should have expected to find she arm inflamed, but there was no inflammation whatever on the arm or hand with the exception of the finger.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I am a railway clerk and reside in Accacia Road, Walthamstow. I am married and have four children. I have been in the employ of the railway com<lb/>pany for 26 years, and this is the first time any charge has been made against me. Some years ago, in conjunction with somebody else, I signed a promissory note in favour of the Whitefriars Finan<lb/>cial and Investment Company, who subsequently got judgment against me and an order for committal. On July 1 Anderson came into the office and asked me to go outside, where I saw Prosecutor and Daly. I was talking to Anderson and they joined us. After Hickiing told me I would have to go to Brixton for ten days, I said "Do not touch me here." He then caught hold of me by the left sleeve. I wrenched my arm away and ran across the road into Blomfield Street, where I waited till Hickiing and his assistant came up to me. I did not, when Hickiing said, "You will have to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190055"/>
               <p>go to Brixton, " say, "I will see you b——d first"; I do not indulge in those words; that is manufactured. When I wrenched myself free I did not use my right arm at all. I cannot say whether my right arm came into contact with his. I never had any intention of getting my from the officer. When I saw Hickling's injured finger, asked him how he had done it. He said, "Ton have done it, and I will give you in charge. " I said, "I cannot make out how you have done it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I asked to be allowed to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. I was trying to get myself a bit straight. I could not have got the money in the office. I cannot suggest how the injury was caused; I believe he did it himself. He might have caught it in a bus coming across the road. I should be sorry to do such a thing to a man like that. I said at the police station I knew nothing about the assault.</p>

                  </hi>57, Metropolitan Buildings, Albert Street, Mile End, E., hotel porter. On July 5, about 12. 15, I was in Pedley Street. I was held by three men, who took my watch chain. One man threw his arm round my neck and held my head in the air. I called for help and followed them. I next saw them about half a minute after<lb/>wards being brought down Code Street by two constables. The value of the chain is about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I did not lose my watch. I do not recognise either of the prisoners. I cannot say if the men who robbed</p>

               <p>say to the officer, "Look what he (prisoner) has done. He has broken my finger." I did not hear prisoner say anything in reply.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">REUBEN HENRY, </hi>374, City. On the afternoon of July 1 I was on duty in Bloomfield Street. In consequence of 4 statement made to me by Hickling, I ran after Away and arrested him. He was then being; detained by Daly. I did not hear prisoner say to Hickling, "How did you happen to do that? " referring to his dislocated finger. Prisoner was taken to the station and charged with assault. In reply he said, "How could I assault him with my hands in my pockets? " When the arrest was made in Blomfield Street prisoner said, "If I have injured him (Hickling) it was an accident."</p>

                  </hi>M. D., house surgeon, St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On July 1 I attended Hickling at the hospital. I found the last joint of the third finger of his right hand dislocated side<lb/>ways. I put him under an anaesthetic and reduced the dislocation It was serious because it was a lateral dislocation, a lateral dialoca<lb/>tion being much more rarer than a dislocation, forwards or backwards The dislocated joint was bent sideways over the little finger. At injury was painful and I put the finger in splints. He was attended by his own private doctor afterwards. I saw him a fortnight later. The finger was still swollen and tender, and movement of the joint was very painful. Such an injury could only have been caused by direct violence, a blow or a fall, or I have seen such dislocations at the result of wrenches in machines.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If Hickling had been holding a man by the cost and the man had violently wrenched himself away, I should think it very improbable that such an injury would have been so censed There were no bruises on the arm or hand. If the injury had been caused by a blow I should have expected to find the arm inflamed, but there was no inflammation whatever on the arm or hand with the exception of the finger.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I am a railway clerk and reside in Accacia Road, Walthamstow. I am married and have four children. I have been in the employ of the railway com- pany for 26 years, and this is the first time any charge has been made against me. Some years ago, in conjunction with somebody else, I signed a promissory note in favour of the Whitefriars Finan<lb/>cial and Investment Company, who subsequently got judgment against me and an order for committal. On July 1 Anderson came into the office and asked me to go outside, where I saw Prosecutor and Daly. I was talking to Anderson and they joined us. After Hickling told me I would have to go to Brixton for ten days, I said "Do not touch me here." He then caught hold of me by the left sleeve. I wrenched my arm away and ran across the road into Blomfield Street, where I waited till Hickling and his assistant came up to me. I did not, when Hickling said, "You will have to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190057"/>
               <p>go to Brixton, " say, "I will see you b——d first"; I do not indulge in those words; that is manufactured. When I wrenched myself free I did not use my right arm at all. I cannot say whether my right um came into contact with his. I never had any intention of getting my from the officer. When I saw Hickling's injured finger, asked him how he had done it. He said, "You have done it, and I will give you in charge." I said, "I cannot make out how you have done it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I asked to be allowed to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. I was vying to get myself a bit straight I could not have got the money it the office. I cannot suggest how the injury was caused; I believe hi did it himself. He might have caught it in a 'bus coming across the road. I should be sorry to do such a thing to a man like that. I said at the police station I knew nothing about the assault.</p>

On July 5, about 12.15 at night, I was at the corner of Brick Lane and Buxton Street, a matter of 200 yards from Pedley Street. I heard cries of "Help" in the direction of Code Street. I stood there with another constable. We directly afterwards saw two men running towards us from the direc<lb/>tion of Code Street. They saw us and turned round and ran in the opposite direction. We gave chase. I caught Malony and the other policeman caught Wood. There were no other persons in the street whatever.</p>

My husband gave me some money to get the supper, and I did not notice. I thought it was a fight. I did not want to see it. I turned my back and someone told me the policemen were leading them down to the police station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were in Brick Lane close to Pedley Street. I should think it was about 100 yards away from Pedley Street. I am not really married to the prisoner. I have been living with him now four years.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Attorney-General (Sir William Robson, K. C., M. P.), Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Rowlatt. and Mr. Graham-Campbell prosecuted; Mr. G. Tully-Christie appeared for the defendant.</p>
               <p>The "Indian Sociologist" was first printed by the defendant in May. It was edited by one Krishnavarma, a British Indian subject, resident in Paris, a prominent leader of the Indian "Nationalist" movement, who openly advocated the doctrine of political assassina<lb/>tion. The July number, the immediate subject master of this prose<lb/>cution, contained an article which the Attorney-General described as one of the worst that could possibly have been-published, containing the clearest and most criminal incitements to murder.</p>
               <p>On behalf of the defendant Mr. Tully-Christie called one of several available witnesses to character:</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK MYNOTT</hi>said that, having known the defendant all his life and had every opportunity of studying hit character, he could testify that his general reputation at regards character and loyalty was excellent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tully-Christie said the defendant was a man of the highest character and had never mixed himself up in anything relating to politics. It had been merely the want of exercising proper care in preparing the proofs which had brought him into hit present position. The proofs of the article in question were sent over from Paris and arrived on the morning of Jane 26 with a letter from Krishnavarma asking that they should be immediately sent bank to Paris, if pos<lb/>sible the same day. Without opening the packets of proofs the defendant handed them over to his manager, who set op the type. The defendant had never even seen a copy of them. Of course, it could not be said that that was any excuse for the pub<lb/>lication of this disgraceful and scandalous libel, but counsel asked the Court to take into consideration that it was merely a technical offence on the defendant's part. He had no knowledge of Krish<lb/>navarma and was even unable to tell the police what his address was. Only two copies of the July number were circulated in England; one of these was given to the police and the other to an illustrated paper. Counsel asked the Court to take into consideration the facts and to deal with the defendant as leniently as possible.</p>

               <p>The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said: Arthur Fletcher Horsley, you have certainly adopted a very proper course, so far as what you have done since this charge was made against you, and I am quite willing to take the view that you did print tins very ter<lb/>rible and wicked article without taking sufficent care, and without knowing, it may be, exactly what the contents were. I have no in<lb/>tention of repeating any of the paragraphs from the article; I cer<lb/>tainly do not wish to give them any greater publicity. They have been properly described by the learned Attorney-General as being deliberate and direct incitings to murder and a wicked attempt to justify those incitings by suggesting that political assassination it not murder. I am quite sure that you would be the last person in the world who would wish to be thought to endorse any such suggestion It must, however, be borne in mind that very great mischief is done by these articles. Any student of history—any student of what has happened in the last 50 years—must know perfectly well that the evil which these articles do is not always traced or discovered; but when it is discovered it is shown undoubtedly to exist to a very large extent, and you have brought yourself within the law by printing for the proprietors of this paper this article. While I am quite willing to believe, and do believe, that had you known and appreciated the character of the article you would have stopped it at once, I am obliged to observe, in the interests of justice, that you had had warning which ought to have made you more careful. The terns of the May article and the language of the June article were such that you ought not to have accepted without some care articles coming from the same source. I admit that you seem to have recognised that afterwards. Further, while, as the Attorney-General has said, from some points of view the interview with the police was in your favour, because I believe that you honestly said that you would stop the publication if there was any objection to it, the reply given by the police, which they were bound to give you, that they had no right to interfere, and would not interfere, if you kept within the law, was a warning which ought to have made you more watchful. I say this, not in the least for the purpose of throwing any doubt upon the sen<lb/>tence with which I began, that I believed you were careless and had no—what I may call—direct criminal intention in publishing this article. But it must not be forgotten that the intention may be gathered from the article itself, and people who carelessly publish such articles must understand that it is no defence, if from the article itself a libellous or seditious or malicious intention can be gathered, to say that they themselves had no intention of publishing it. I cannot pass over this matter without some punishment I think it would be of the worst example if that were done, because, as I have said, what has happened—it may be in consequence of such articles as this—is patent to all of us at the present moment. are probably aware that by provisions of statutes persons convicted of seditious libel are ordered to be treated as first-class misdemeanants—that is to say, you will not be subjected to the ordinary incidents of prison life; but it would not be right that it should be thought that a person can—even by carelessness—publish such articles without punishment; <rs id="t19090719-54-punishment-52" type="punishmentDescription">

Pri<lb/>soner raised his arm and rapidly fired four shots in Sir Curzon's face—into his eves. Sir Curzon collapsed at the fourth shot. Aftar a short interval there were two more shots, but I did not see in what direction they were fired. I ran to prisoner to prevent anything further being done, and others also rushed to the spot. Prisoner had his right hand free and he placed the revolver to his own temple, but there was merely a click. With assistance I got him down. I asked him, "What have you done? Why did you do it? " Prisoner looked at me quietly but did not say anything. He later on said, "Let me put my spectacles on."</p>
               <p>Sir <hi rend="smallCaps">LESLIE PROBYN.</hi>I was present at this entertainment. About 11 o'clock I was in the Jehangir Hall, going towards the exit door, when I heard the sound of three or four shots. On going forward I saw the prisoner, who fired another shot; he then held the pistol straight in front of him and apparently fired another shot. He next turned the pistol round to his own temple. I immediately went at him, held his arms, and got the pistol from him. There was a struggle, and I hardly know what happened, as I fell down and in<lb/>jured my nose and rlbs. I handed the prisoner over to a police-con<lb/>stable, also the revolver.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES ROLLESTON, </hi>another guest at the entertainment, spoke to hearing five shots. One shot was fired deliberately by Pris<lb/>oner at a native Indian gentleman in evening dress. The gentleman—Dr. Lalcaca—fell backwards. The body of Sir Curzon Wyllie was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190063"/>
               <p>lying three or four yards away. Witness asked prisoner his name and address, and he gave them as "Dhingra, Ledbury Road." Wit<lb/>less, speaking to him mostly in Hindustani, asked what could be his motive for the crime. He replied, "I will tell the police."</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK NICHOLLS, </hi>476 B said that on being called to the Imperial Institute he found prisoner being held by several gentlemen, and he took him into custody. On his being searched there were found in prisoner's waistcoat pocket the pistol and the dagger produced.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK EADLEY, </hi>B Division, who was with Nicholls, spoke to the arrest and the finding upon prisoner of the second revolver and cartridges.</p>
               <p>Superintendent <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED ISAAC, </hi>B Division. On the early morning of July 2 I saw prisoner at Marylebone Police Station. The charge was read over to him and he nodded his head.</p>
               <p>Sub-Divisional Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES GLASS, </hi>B Division. At the police station I took the charge against prisoner. On its being read over he said, "Yes, " nodding his head. I said, "Do you wish any of jour friends to be communicated with? " He replied, "I do not think it necessary to-night, they will know later on.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT DRAPER, </hi>B Division. I was present at West<lb/>minster Police Court on July 2. Just before being remanded, prisoner said to the magistrate, "The only thing I want to say is that there was no wilful murder in the case-of Dr. Lalcaca; I did sot know him; when he advanced to take hold of me I simply fired is self-defence. ''</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS NEVILLE, </hi>123, Sloane Street. On July 11 went to the Imperial Institute and there saw the dead body of Sir Curzon Wyllie. Later that night I saw prisoner at the police station; he seemed quiet, calm, and collected. I asked him whether he was hurt, and he said "No." I felt his pulse; it was quite regular and normal. On making a post-mortem examination of Sir Curzon Wyllie I found a bullet entrance wound on the right eye, with an exit wound at the hack of the neck; another two wounds on the left eye and at the hack of the neck; two other wounds, one below the left ear, the other over the left eyebrow, the bullets being found in the head. The cause of death was injury to the brain; death must have been instan<lb/>taneous.</p>
               <p>This concluded the case for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice (addressing the prisoner.) Do yon wish to give evidence in the box or say what you have to say there?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say. I admit that I did it. This evidence is all true. I should like my statement read.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Do you wish your statement read that yon made at the police court?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes.</p>
               <p>The statement was read, as follows: " I do not want to say any<lb/>thing in defence of myself, but simply to prove the justice of my deed. As for myself, no English law court has got any authority to arrest and detain me in prison, or pass sentence of death on me. That is the reason I did not have any counsel to defend me.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190064"/>
               <p>"And I maintain that if it is patriotic in an Englishman to fight against the Germans if they were to occupy this country, it is much more justifiable and patriotic in my case to fight against the English. I hold the English people responsible for the murder of 80 millions of Indian people in the last fifty years, and they are also responsible for taking away ₤100, 000, 000 every year from India to this country. I also hold them responsible for the hanging and deportation of my patriotic countrymen, who did just the same as the English people here are advising their countrymen to do. And the Englishman who goes out to India and gets, say, ₤100 a month, that simply means that he passes a sentence of death on a thousand of my poor country<lb/>men, because these thousand people could easily live on this ₤100, which the Englishman spends mostly on his frivolities and pleasures. Just as the Germans have no right to occupy this country, so the English people have no right to occupy India, and it is perfectly justifiable on our part to kill the Englishman who is polluting our sacred land. I am surprised at the terrible hypocrisy, the farce, and the mockery of the English people. They pose as the champions of oppressed humanity—the peoples of the Congo and the people of Russia—when there is terrible oppression and horrible atrocities committed in India; for example, the killing of two millions of people every year and the outraging of our women. In case this country is occupied by Germans, and the Englishman, not bearing to see the Germans walking with the insolence of conquerors in the streets of London, goes and kills one or two Germans, and that Englishman is held as a patriot by the people of this country, then certainly I am prepared to work for the emancipation of my Mother<lb/>land. Whatever else I have to say is in the paper before the Court I make this statement, not because I wish to plead for mercy or any<lb/>thing of that kind. I wish that English people should sentence me to death, for in that case the vengeance of my countrymen will be all the more keen. I put forward this statement to show the justice of my cause to the outside world, and especially to our sympathisers in America and Germany."</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Do you wish to call any evidence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No. I only want the statement to be read.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Do you wish to say anything more?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is another statement on foolscap paper.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Any other statement you must make now yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But I don't remember it now.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. If there is anything you wish to say to the Jury say it now. You can say anything you wish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was taken from my pocket among other papers.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. I don't care what was in your pocket. The question of what you have written before has nothing to do with this case. You have got to say anything you wish to the Jury. What you have written on previous occasions or what was in your pocket is no evidence in this case. If you wish to say anything to the Jury in defence of yourself say it now. Do you wish to say anything more?</p>

               <p>Mr. Tindal Atkinson, K. C. I have been instructed to watch this case on behalf of the family of the man who has just been convicted. I here been instructed to say that they view this crime with the greatest, abhorrence, and they wish to repudiate in the most emphatic way the slightest sympathy with the views or motives which have led up to the crime. Further, I am instructed to say, on behalf of the father of this man and the rest of his family, that there are no more loyal subjects of the Empire than they are.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Mr. Tindal Atkinson, although the course may have seemed somewhat unusual, having regard to the nature of this crime and the wicked attempt at justification in some quarters, I am very glad you should have said that on behalf of the members of the family.</p>

                  </hi>6, Hart Lane, Great Tower Street, law stationer. On July 5, at about four p.m., I was in Commercial Street, near Flower and Dean Street, when English made a run of about 10 paces towards me, seized my gold chain, and snatched it away with a gold locket value ₤14 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran off through the buildings. I was not wearing the watch. I have no hesitation in identifying him. I had not seen him before. I lost sight of him through the further end of the buildings. I next saw him at the sation. He was seated on the form by the door as I entered, and I immediately said, "That is the villain who took my chain." He denied it. Just as English ran down the court Ballard (whom I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190066"/>
               <p>had not seen before) followed me up as I was running after Eng<lb/>lish. I said to him, "Chase that man—he has got my chain—I will pay you." I had hardly said the words when he caught me with both hands between the elbow and the shoulder, and gave me a very clever throw, which pitched me on my left shoulder on to the ground, dislocating my shoulder. I picked myself up and chased them into Flower and Dean Street, although in great pain. Ballard ran into Thrawl Street. Both were soon out of sight. I turned back into Commercial Street and went into a warehouse to rest when the police informed me one of the men was caught I went into Commercial Street, identified English who was in custody, and gave a description of Ballard. A quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards I was asked to go into the station yard, where I picked Bal<lb/>lard out from among nine other men. Directly the door was opened I said, "That is the man who knocked me down." Ballard is a very tall man; many of the other men were tall, though not to tall as Ballard. I have no doubt he is the man. The divisional surgeon was sent for and found my shoulder was dislocated I was taken to the London Hospital, where the arm was set. I have been treated ever since by my private doctor at Margate. I live at 13, Connaught Road, Margate, and come to London four times a week to see after my property. My arm is not yet right; it is going on rather slowly; I am 63 years of age.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hawtin. I was going from Whitechapel along Commercial Road, and was at the corner of Flower and Dean Street as near as I could fix the time at 4. 10 to 4. 15 p.m. I am very nimble on my feet. English ran down Flower and Dean Street, I followed him perhaps 30 yards, running fast. I heard Ballard behind me, looked back and saw him. After he threw me over he continued running in the direction of English. I swear it was not an accidental push. It was done as I was on the run; he ran on as fast as he could. I was not excited, but was very determined.</p>
               <p>To English. When my chain was snatched I was alone—I was not with a woman. had been in a public-house at the corner of Flower and Dean Street and a woman importuned me. She was not with me when you took my chain.</p>

                  </hi>107, Rothschild Buildings, Thrawl Street, dealer. On July 5, at about 3. 30 p.m., I had been sitting outside my house reading the paper for about 20 minutes, when I saw English with two other men walking towards the gateway from the buildings into Flower and Dean Street. I fix the time by his being arrested at 3. 55; one of the men with him was tall. I could not swear it was Ballard. Five or 10 minutes afterwards I heard prosecutor scream cut, "Stop thief, He has stolen my chain, " and the two men ran through the buildings followed by the prosecutor. English was running alone, followed by a tall man, and another running alter him. They went into Thrawl Street. I gave chase to the corner of Montague Street, when I saw English caught by a constable. I had not seen the prosecutor before his chain was stolen. I did not see Ballard caught.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190067"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hawtin. When Ballard was put up for identification I could not identify him.</p>
               <p>To English. I did not see you snatch the chain.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED PADDOCK, </hi>179 H. On July 5, about four p.m., I was in Brick Lane, at the corner of Osborn Street, when I saw English walking along Went worth Street, about 250 yards from the buildings, keeping well under the houses with his cap pulled over his eyes and coat collar turned up. It being a warm after<lb/>noon it aroused my suspicions, and I followed him into Osborn Street and caught hold of him and said, "Tom, what is the matter; what have you got your collar turned up for? " He said, "I sup<lb/>pose I can have it up if I like." I told him I was not satisfied and I should take him back. I took him towards Franks, the last wit<lb/>ness, when Franks said, "Governor, they have knocked a man down sad stolen his chain." I said, "What do you think of that, Tom? " Mr. Hawtin objected that this was not evidence against Ballard. Held that as evidence against English it could not be excluded, although it was not evidence against Ballard.</p>
               <p>English replied, "I am always getting wiped up for someone else." I took him through Wentworth Street and Thrawl Street, when we met Police-constable Willis; I spoke to him and took English on to Commercial Street Police Station, where he sat down. A few minutes afterwards prosecutor was assisted in by Willis. As soon as be got through the door he said, "That is the villain who stole my chain." English made no reply.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN WILLIS, </hi>333 H. At four p.m. I received information from the last witness, made inquiries, and learnt that prosecutor had been robbed of a chain. I found him sitting in a warehouse at 46, Commercial Street. He gave me a description of the man who had assaulted him and I assisted him to the station. I then walked back up Commercial Street to Duval Street, where I saw Ballard. I told him I should take him into custody as answer<lb/>ing the description I had had given me by a gentleman of a man assaulting him in Flower and Dean Street. I did not say robbing him. He said, "You have made a mistake. I have been asleep in the lodging-house." He was taken to the station and put up with nine other men, one or two of whom were quite as tall as himself; prosecutor immediately picked him out without any hesitation. Franks did not identify him. Ballard is about 6 ft. 1 in. or 6 ft. 2 in. in height.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hawtin. I will swear that the man stand<lb/>ing next to Ballard was of the same height as near as possible, judging by the eye. It would be about 4. 30 when I arrested Ballard in Duval Street. He was standing outside a lodging-house with several other men chatting. As I walked down he crossed the road away from the others and walked away. He seemed quite unconcerned. The de<lb/>scription of Ballard was given to me by prosecutor as I was assisting him to the station.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT AYERS, </hi>463 H. On July 5, at 3.50 p.m., I saw the two prisoners (whom I knew quite well) in company with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190068"/>
               <p>two other men, in Commercial Street, opposite Spitalfields Church, going towards Flower and Dean Street. About 4. 10 p.m. I saw English in custody of Paddock. Paddock said to me, "If yon see long Ballard, bring him in."</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawtin objected to this evidence. The Recorder. It is undoubtedly evidence against English, bat it dots not affect the case, and therefore I will not take it</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am quite sure it was 3.50 p.m. when I saw the prisoners. (Deposition was read, "It was four p.m. when I saw Ballard; I am quite sure; I looked at the church clock.") I said ten minutes to four. The deposition has it that I said in chief "at four p.m. on the 5th of July"—I have made a mistake, no doubt. It must have been four o'clock. I was looking at the clock as I was proceeding to lead the children across the road. It must have been four o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). On July 5, at about three p.m., I went to my lodging-house in Duval Street and sat down in the kitchen for about half to three-quarters of an hour and tried to get a sleep, but I could not as the place was so close. I then sat by the door talking to the porter Smith and another man for half an hour. I was afterwards standing at the door talking to some men outside. That was about 15 or 20 minutes past four. I then saw a man who works for Mrs. Carter and I went across the street and asked him, "Are not you at work to-day? " Two constables then arrested me, and one said he should charge me with having some<lb/>thing to do with somebody who had stolen a chain. From three p.m. to the time of my arrest I remained in and just outside the lodging<lb/>house. I have never seen the prosecutor and had nothing to do with the robbery. (To the Judge.) I was not with English. I have known him for three or four weeks—I know his young woman. When placed in the yard I was the tallest among the nine men who were put up with me. I was the first man among the nine. Prosecutor said, "You are the man" as soon as he walked into the yard. I denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know Police-constable Ayers. He is mistaken in saying he saw me with English. While I was talking to the man who works for Mrs. Carter, the constables came up to me and said, "We are going to arrest you for being concerned in robbing a man of a chain." I told them I was innocent and went to the station. That was the first I had heard about a chain. I understood the con<lb/>stable to say, "Robbing a man of a chain"—he may not have said it. I know" he said, "Robbing a man." The lodging-house is 20 yards from Flower and Dean Street. Between three o'clock and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190069"/>
               <p>4.15 I had plenty of time to go to Flower and Dean Street, but I never left the place. I am 6 ft. 13/4 in.—with my boots on I should be 6 ft. 2 in. I was taller than the man who stood next to me. It must have been a quarter past four from the time I went into the station. It was five or 10 minutes to three when I went into the lodging house.</p>
               <p>The Recorder suggested that the evidence as to what was said to Polios-constable Ayers was in Ballard's favour, and recalled Ayers.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT AYEBS, </hi>recalled. (To the Recorder.) As Police-constable Paddock passed me with English in his custody he said, "If you see Long Ballard bring him in. "</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED PADDOCK, </hi>recalled. (To the Jury.) When I passed Ayers with English in my custody, I said to him, "If you see Long Ballard bring him in." I had not seen the prosecutor at that time. I had seen Franks. Franks had not given me any description. As I was taking English through Thrawl Street he was surrounded by a very hostile crowd, and, from the information I received from the crowd, and having previously seen Ballard in company with English early in the afternoon, I made up my mind the other man concerned in the robbery was Bal<lb/>lard. That is why I said to Ayers, "If you see Long Ballard, bring him along." I knew English and Ballard well, and had seen them together between two and three p.m. at the top of Flower and Dean Street, when I was on duty in Brick Lane.</p>
               <p>The Jury asked what the remarks of the crowd were; question disallowed.</p>
               <p>Ballard's name was mentioned by the crowd—the crowd was hostile to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHILES</hi>Blown, 5, Tendy Street. I have been for seven yeans porter employed by Cressingham, lodging-house keeper, Duval Street, Spitalfields. I attend under subpoena. On Monday, July 5, I was in the kitchen all the afternoon. I know Ballard as a customer. I came back from dinner at three p.m., and saw Ballard sitting on a form in the kitchen. I went on an errand to Bax's at 4. 20; Ballard was there then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was sweeping up and putting crockery away and saw Ballard there until 4. 20. I saw the time as I passed Spital<lb/>fields Church. There were a number of others there—there are 240 lodgers altogether; at 4. 20 there may have been 30; I could not give yon the names of the others. Bernard Kelly was there. I was frit asked to give evidence when I got my subpoena on July 22. I remember July 5 because I had to take a lot of coke in that day. Ballard has been has been a lodger for about nine months. He was not asleep. He was sitting in the same place all the time. The lodging<lb/>house is three minutes' walk from the corner of Flower and Dean Street—about 100 yards. (To the Judge.) I did not see him asleep—he was trying to go to sleep—he looked as if he woke up out of a doze. After that he came and spoke to me.</p>

               <p>there talking to me till about 4.30. I went out then and had a glass of ale. When I came back I heard he was locked up—I had been away about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I would not be positive for a few minutes. There were other men there—Charles Brown, Thomas Smith, and several others—I daresay half a dozen. We were talking sitting on the form on the left of the door as you go in. He was sitting there the whole time. If Ballard says that he moved and was sitting first in one place and then in another there would be a mistake made.</p>

On July 5 I came home at three p.m. and I saw Ballard sitting in the kitchen talking to two other men; he was there about 11/2 hours. At about 4. 30 I went down to the washhouse to wash and I heard at about five p.m. that he was locked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I arrived at three p.m., made a cup of tea, and sat opposite Ballard. I did not see any coke being taken in. Ber<lb/>nard Kelly, Charles Brown, the porter, and two or three other men I knew were sitting there—about a dozen. Ballard was sitting in the same place on a seat that runs by the fireplace from the time I went in to the time I went out.</p>

I went through Wentworth Street when the constable, seeing my coat collar up, stopped me. I would like my mother to be called to prove that the prosecutor was with a woman at the time his chain was taken from him. My mother has found it out since I have been under arrest. It would be something that somebody has told her.</p>

                  </hi>of Evans and Gregory, working jewellers, Tanner's Hill, Deptford. On the morning of June 10 prisoner came to my shop and asked for some watches to sell on approval. He said hi was foreman in a firm where 200 men were employed, and that he old watches among the men, and he would sell some for us if we lied. He showed me a watch and said it was one he had to sell for another firm in the neighbourhood, and he asked me if he could take two on approval, as he had customers for them. I let him have one gent's gilt watch and a lady's black oxidised watch with a bow brooch on it. I gave him the appro, notice produced. The price of the gent's watch was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the lady's 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the brooch 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether. When prisoner took the watches away he wrote his name and address on paper produced. He came back to the shop about three days afterwards and said he had sold the watches but had not got the money yet, and I asked him to let me have it as soon as he could. Soon alter this I went with the detective and identified the lady's watch at Mr. Urry's, the pawnbroker's, and the gent's watch at Mr. Belsham's.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. You did not pay me for the watch. I have never received a penny from you in my life. I never gave you a receipt for the money and two warranties. I did give you two blank forms of receipt with blanks for the price so that you could fill in the amounts when you sold the watches.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I did say before the magistrate that I was sorry for what I had done, but that was in reference to the other watch of Mr. Spikins, and not to these two watches at all. I bought these watches and paid for them and had the receipts in my possession and the written warranties, and they were taken away from me at the police station at Greenwich and produced before the magistrate, and he saw them and was perfectly satisfied. The consequence is those watches are mine. I had a perfect right to pledge them, and I did pledge them because I could not get any money in that was earned and my children wanted food. I am a builder and decorator, and sometimes I have a pound or two and sometimes not a penny or two, and often I cannot get the money in after it has been earned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did pay for the watches and got receipts for the money. Those receipts were produced in evidence before Mr. Arthur Gill, the magistrate. The document produced here has been made and manufactured. Detective Melville had the receipts in Greenwich Police Court, and if he has not got them now he ought to have them, and I should like him to produce them. Mr. Gregory worried me for the money and I got the money and took it to him. I think that was about the 14th, after I pawned them, but the time he received the money is on the bill. I did not tell him that I had pawned them because it did not matter to him what I had done with the watches so long as I paid him. I pawned the watches because my children wanted food. I had a lot of money due that I could not get at the moment, and I was not going to see my children hungry, as an Englishman. I did not say at the police court that I had paid <hi rend="smallCaps">MT.</hi>Gregory and had got the receipts, be<lb/>cause I was hushed up there and told I should go for trial.</p>
               <p>By the Court. I did say at the police court, after being car tioned, I regret it. I did it in innocence. I did it to get food for my wife and children. I had money coming in. I hare no witnesses." I did regret it, but that was in reference to Mr. Spikins's watch I said that I was wrong in not saying I had paid Mr. Gregory, but they had the receipts in their possession, and the magistrate was perfectly satisfied about it, because he asked Mr. Gregory if it was his writing. Mr. Gregory so worried me for the money you would have thought he had a lease on my life for this paltry 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I went and paid him the money, as I had a</p>

Prisoner decamped is the direction of Whitechapel Road. (To the Judge.) Prisoner was rifling prosecutor's pockets. They all ran off.) Prisoner said, "All right, governor, I will go quiet. I took him back to where prosecutor was. A crowd had collected. When we got to where prosecutor was, prisoner said, "Go for it, boys." Someone tripped me then. I bid s struggle with prisoner, during which I saw prisoner hand a watch and chain to someone in the crowd. Someone blew my whistle. I had previously blown it in the chase. Two other con<lb/>tables came up, and I handed prisoner to them. When charged at the station prisoner said, "I deny it." I went with prisoner to the cell.

I did not see anyone's arm round his neck. I saw you running and said, "Come back with me, Francis." I saw you pass the watch and chain. I said to the policeman that took you to the station, "Take this man to the station while I look for the prosecutor."

                  </hi>5, Park Place, Eltham, wife of Dr. Thompson. On August 27 we were living at 10a, Park Place. On that night my house was safely shut up and my property secure. The next morn ing I found the house had been entered and a number of articles stolen, including electro plated tea caddy produced, bearing my initials, "M. A. T." The tea was emptied on the carpet. A number of other articles were taken.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190075"/>

On September 7, 1908, at 10 p.m., my house was secure. At seven a.m. the next morning I found it had been entered and a quantity of property stolen, including electro plated cream jug, sugar basin, and pair of sugar tongs produced. The crab pick produced I am not sure is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are no special marks on the jug and basin except that they fit a large strawberry dish, which I have at home. I have not had the articles home to identify them.</p>
               <p>H<hi rend="smallCaps">ARRIET LOUISA MARTIN, </hi>East End, Harvey Road, Blackheath. On the night between September 19 and 20, 1908, my house was broken into and a quantity of silver and plated goods taken, including two dessert forks, two dessert knives, two fish knives, pickle fork, and sugar basin (produced). I identify the fish knives as having a dol<lb/>phin blade and as being similar to others of the set which I produce. One of them has my crest similar to the crest on spoon produced—griffin rampant. I recognise the sugar basin by the pattern. I have had it many years, and have no doubt it is my property. It is sot hall-marked.</p>
               <p>A<hi rend="smallCaps">LFRED ELLIS, </hi>23, Spencer Gardens, Eltham. On October 1, 1908, between seven and eight a.m., I found my house had been entered daring the night and property to the value of ₤50 was miss<lb/>ing, including plated sugar basin and cream jug produced. A quan<lb/>tity of silver goods were also stolen. I identify the jug and basin as similar in pattern to the teapot I produce, which belongs to the use set.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The jug and basin are the same set. They have toss in use for 25 years and constant cleaning would obliterate some of the marks. At the station I and my wife were shown a large quantity of similar articles and we immediately picked these two out without hesitation as our property.</p>

On October 12, 1908, I found the house had been entered and a quantity of silver and plated goods stolen, including the butter dish, knives, and forks produced. I have been 12 years in Mr. Donovan's service, have constantly cleaned the articles, and I recognise them by my master's crest, an eagle, upon them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Some of the forks have not got the crest—I only identify six which have. When I went to the police court the other forks were tied together with the ones that had the crest on, and they are similar to those which have been stolen.</p>

On October 13, 1908, I found my house had been broken into and a quantity of property, including toast rack, two serviette rings, two knife rests, crab pick, sardine server, butter knife, meat skewer, and tea infuser produced, which I identify, and which I picked out from</p>

               <p>a quantity of other articles at the police station, as mine and my husband's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A number of other articles were stolen, includ<lb/>ing some very old silver. The serviette rings are marked with my son's initials. I know the butter knife by its having a loose handle, and I am sure the articles produced are mine.</p>

                  </hi>I have been 16 months servant to Henry Williams, 21, The Circus, Greenwich. When I came down on the morning of May 2 I found the house had been entered—I think through the kitchen window, as there were marks on the sill outside. I missed a number of articles, including silver coffee pot, match stand, and hand bag produced. The hand bag is my employer's and was taken from the dining room. I know the coffee pot and have cleaned it every week. On June 10 after a conversation with a police officer I went to No. 10, Little Turnstile, a shop where all sorts of second<lb/>hand articles are exposed for sale, where I saw the coffeepot in the window. I entered the shop as a customer, saw the prisoner, and was shown a number of coffee pots, including that produced. The</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190077"/>
               <p>next day June 11, I again saw the prisoner at the shop, and said, I have called about the coffee pot I spoke to you about yesterday."He took it out of the window and said the price was 16<hi rend="italic">s.; </hi>I offered him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d.; </hi>he said "15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., " and I agreed to buy it at that price. I saw in the shop the match stand produced and asked prisoner what he wanted for it. He said Is., and I agreed to purchase it. I gave him a sovereign, received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and the receipt produced, on a billhead of the prisoner's, left the shop, and gave my two pur<lb/>chases, the coffee-pot and match box, and the receipt to Inspector Baxter outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The coffee-pot was in an exposed position in the window, and I identified it at once as my master's property; the match box was in the back of the window. There was a large number of other electroplated and silver goods in the window and about the shop. The first day I told prisoner I would call about the coffee-pot the next day, and when I called again it was in the-same position in the window.</p>

                  </hi>134, Lewisham Road, licensed valuer. Coffee<lb/>pot produced is of Norwegian manufacture, is known as Norwegian silver, is about 40 to 50 years old, and weighing 171/2 oz. Its value is about ₤5 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is the value I should put on it for probate. It it composed of about two-thirds silver, the remainder being probably tin. Norwegian silver is never hall-marked. There is a manufac<lb/>turer's mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I hold a license to value goods for probate and other purposes, and am also manager to Peppercorn Brothers, dealers in second-hand and antique furniture, silver plate china, etc., of Deptford they have four shops. I say this is Norwegian silver from my put experience. Other foreign silver goods are composed of a mixture of silver and alloy. I last dealt with a piece of Norwegian silver a fortnight ago. The manufacturer's mark tells me it if Nor<lb/>wegian. I should say there is ₤3 worth of pure silver in it—about 11 oz. Manufactured as it is, it is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce. A dealer in such articles would know this is Norwegian silver if he understood his business. I have sold pieces of Norwegian silver with that identical mark. The value of mid-Victorian silver depends on the shape and form it is made into; it may be worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce. I could not say what this would fetch under the hammer—that depends on the bidding of the public.</p>

On May 16 I took my sister, who is a cripple, in a bath chair to visit the Holborn Empire for the afternoon performance. Desiring to leave the chair I went to 10, Little Turnstile, where I saw Titlow at the door and asked him if he would take care of it. He spoke to the prisoner, who was inside in the shop, and they agreed to look after it. After the performance we found the chair outside; Titlow assisted my sister into it and wheeled it to Aldgate, near where we live. I identify Titlow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have never seen Titlow since. I came to give evidence because the sergeant came to me. I gave Titlow our address, as he expressed a wish to call upon us.</p>

                  </hi>I am now undergoing a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment for burglary., passed on June 8, 1909, at Newington Sessions. Amongst other cases to which I pleaded guilty was the burglary at Mr. Williams, 21, The Circus, Greenwich. I stole frost there the coffee pot, match box, and bag produced. I know the prisoner. I was introduced to him by a man living at Bruce House. I, Kemble Street. He took me up to prisoners shop one morning<lb/>I had an overcoat and two pair of boots; he told prisoner that I was all right, that be need not be frightened of me. No name was given by me. I was then passing under the name of Titlow. I had a long conversation with prisoner About stolen property, and prisoner told me if I had any stolen stuff he would buy it, and he said, "Always tell me where it comes from." I told him I "went out" sometimes—that is an expression used meaning to commit burglaries—prisoner understood me perfectly well After that date I committed various burglaries in Grove Park, Camberwell, Cole<lb/>raine Road, Blackheath, and The Circus, Greenwich. I entered Donovan's house in Coleraine Road on October 12, and took spoons, forks, toast rack, black bag, and plated butter dish inscribed with the name of Donovan. I can only recognise the butter dish pro<lb/>duced. I left Donovan's house between five and six a.m., and went straight to prisoner's shop, arriving there about 9. 15 a.m. knocked four times at the side door—that was the signal agreed with the prisoner. Prisoner came out and opened the shop; I went inside and showed him what I had got. He said the butter dish was not of much use because it had the name on. He gave me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>for the lot. I told him thev were stolen from Blackheath. On May 2 I broke into 21, The Circus, Greenwich. I may have done</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190079"/>
               <p>one or two other burglaries between October and May. I have been a ship's cook and steward. I did no work between October and May. I got a little outside help. I did not steal anything daring that period. I saw prisoner on several occasions in his shop—I used to go there and talk with him. On Sunday, May 2, I took from Williams's house a silver coffee pot or teapot, two salt cellars, two pepper boxes, two match stands, and a brown bag. The; coffee pot and bag are those produced. The match stands were similar to the one produced. I left there at six a.m., went to my loadings, 17, Royal Place, getting there in about five minutes, went over to Poplar, came back again, and about one p.m. I took ft cab to my lodgings, and took the stuff over to Poplar. From Poplar I went in the afternoon to prisoner's house. When I came downstairs to get into the cab I had two overcoats, a small parcel, and the brown bag produced. I got to the prisoner's shop about three p.m., gave the usual signal (four knocks), and prisoner opened the door. I told him I had got a bit of stuff and showed it him. He said it was rough stuff, not worth much, and offered me ₤1 for the lot, which I accepted, leaving the bag and its contents. The bag contained the coffee pot, two salt cellars, two pepper boxes, and two match stands—the coffee pot and match stands being those produced. I told him I had stolen them from Greenwich. The coffee pot had a much smaller knob than it has now. On May 15 I recollect Miss Morris coming with her sister to the music-hall and leaving the chair. I was pass<lb/>ing sad had called at prisoner's shop. I remained there, kept an eye on the chair until Miss Morris came out, helped her sister into the chair, and wheeled it to Mansell Street for her. I have been to prisoner's shop since. I served in the South African Light Horse for six months during the war and received a good discharge and a medal bearing my name "J. H. Titlow" and my regimental number. In May, 1909, the prisoner lent me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the medal. Prisoner knew my name was Titlow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was sentenced to 18 months' hard labour. No alteration has been made in my sentence since I have given evidence; the hard labour has not been remitted. I was introduced to the prisoner by "Ginger Lee"—he lived at Bruce House, where I was living; he is now undergoing a term of imprisonment. I do not remember being asked at the police court who had introduced me. I told prisoner I was a ship's steward—he has seen my discharges also. I said I should go away if I got a ship. I did not say that I was attending sales and going in for a bit of dealing. I was not doing so. Nearly every week between October and May I called at prisoner's shop and offered things for sale. It is true that between October 12 and May 2 I committed no burglary. On two or three occasions I sold prisoner pawntickets. I never told prisoner I was doing a little dealing until I could find some other ship. I never told Prisoner my name was Blakey or Blackie. I never used those names. The name I used to go out in was "Norman." If I pawned anything it was in that name or "Cook." Prisoner and his wife always used to call me "Darkie." On the first occasion I saw him I did not offer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190080"/>
               <p>him pawntickets—I sold him an overcoat and two pairs of boots. I may not have said at the police court that prisoner told me if ever I got any stolen stuff he would buy it—I said something approaching it. I told him I had stolen the goods from Blackheath. I made a mistake this morning in saying I got 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the goods from Cole- raine Road—I was mixing it up with another robbery. I do not recollect what he gave me for them. He gave me a sovereign for the stuff from The Circus, Greenwich. I would go to him and say<hi rend="smallCaps">, </hi>"I have got some stuff here, " there would be a discussion as to the price, and we would come to terms. When I came to the shop with a parcel he knew I had got something. From October to May I came to the shop openly and if ever I was passing I looked in. On May 15, when Miss Morris left the chair, I was about there from three to 5. 30 p.m., occasionally getting a little light refreshment at the public-house. As a rule I sold prisoner something two or three times a week. I always went there to sell anything between 9. 15 and 9. 30 a.m. He used to open the shop about 9. 45. The things I took between October and May I had from others who I understood had stolen them. In those cases I told prisoner it was stolen, hit not where it was stolen from.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Some of the property I disposed of to prisoner had been stolen by other people. On two or three occasions in October I went to prisoner's shop with • Ginger Lee." On other occasions I have always gone alone.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST BAXTER, </hi>R Division. On May 27, 1909, I went with Sergeant Bedford to 10, Little Turnstile, and saw the prisoner I told him we were police officers and said, "I have a man named Herbert Titlow in custody for committing a burglary at 21, The Circus, Greenwich." I told him that a quantity of property had been stolen and read a list (produced), which I also gave him to read, showing the articles which had been stolen from Mr. Williams. He read it and said, "No, I have not seen or bought anything like that this week. I do hot know anybody by the name of Titlow." I said, "He was seen leaving your shop yesterday morning." Prisoner said, "I do not know such a man. You can search my place if you like." I said, "Yes, I will accept your invitation, " and I made a search of the shop and the whole of the premises. I found none of the things mentioned in that list. I described the personal appear<lb/>ance of Titlow to him. He said, "I do not know the man—I never saw or heard of him." I asked him particularly whether he kept any books. He said, No, he did not. I afterwards received infor<lb/>mation, saw the coffee pot in the window, and sent Eva Bird to the shop as a customer. She afterwards handed me silver coffee pot matchbox, and receipt (produced). On June 18 I went again with other officers, saw the prisoner, and said, "You remember my visit ing you about some stolen property." He said, "Yes, I remember. " I then said, "I am going to arrest you for feloniously receiving cer<lb/>tain property which was stolen from 21, The Circus, Greenwich, on May 2 last." I told him I had caused certain property to be pur<lb/>chased from him, which he denied having seen on my previous visit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190081"/>
               <p>the coffee pot and matchbox. He said, "I remember the lady. You must do as you like." I took prisoner to Bow Street and re<lb/>turned and attended the searching of the premises. I showed him the coffee pot and match stand and told him they were the articles the subject of the charge then preferred against him, having been purchased by Eva Bird, and I showed him the receipt. He said he remembered a lady purchasing those articles and that he had given a receipt. I made a thorough search of the premises. Behind the outer in the shop I found the small bag which Williams and Dob<lb/>son have identified; in a drawer in the sitting-room on the first floor I found the butter dish (produced)—I had seen that on my first visit, bet had not recognised it as an advertised article; I spoke to the prisoner about it, and pointed to the inscription. He said, "That is as old thing that has been packed away these 20 years." I took possession of a large quantity of miscellaneous property, which was spread out for various persons to inspect, including most of the articles which have been identified by the various witnesses—there are one or two articles which have been recovered elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was a large quantity of china and miscel<lb/>laneous goods—everything which yon might expect to find in a general shop, spread out in the window, on tables, and in drawers. I noticed the butter dish with Donovan's name on on May 27, and found it there again on June 18. The coffee pot was exposed for sale in the window. Two-thirds of the stock was exposed for sale, and the rest laid away in drawers and under the counter.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I have been 30 years London as an antique dealer, dealing in antiques, glass, copper, inter, silver, plated goods, pictures, and miscellaneous things connected with the antique business. I have been 21/2 years at Little Turnstile; 2₤ years in Sandiland Street, a few doors away. Nearly everybody in London knows my Old Curiosity Shop, close to the Holborn Empire. Titlow first came to me nearly 12 months ago, and induced me on the first occasion to buy some pawntickets. I had never seen him before. Mr. Baxter has a lot of pawntickets which Titlow has sold me. After selling the pawntickets he told me at bed been a ship's steward, had lost his ship through drink, and pending getting another ship, " he said, "I am going back to my old business, buying lots at sales." He asked me what I particu<lb/>larly wanted. I said, "What I most want k old antique brasses or any old Sheffield plate." He said, "If I get hold of anything nice I will bring it you and show you." From that date up to about the middle of May every week or 10 days I have bought something from him, firmly believing that he was a dealer buying these little lots; because they are all the fag ends of the burglaries he has com<lb/>mitted—I have never bought anything good—any of the silver from the burglaries he has committed. All this is absolute rubbish. When the detective searched my premises there was only one solid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190082"/>
               <p>silver teapot in the window—I think that was the only piece of silver I had in the place. Everything I purchased from him was electro-plated—I daresay it is one-third of what the detectives have taken away. Every week or 10 days he offered me something, coming quite openly and generally staying and chatting for 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour. I always looked upon him as a very decent sort of man who was really getting his living at sales all these little things that he brought me corroborated his state- ment that he was a dealer, because there is nothing in any one of these articles to make me suspicious that he had stolen them. Everything I bought from him I put in the window or outside on tables. I admit this is a Norwegian made coffee pot, there is it least 50 to 70 per cent, of alloy in it. If I had sold it for a silver pot I should have been prosecuted for it. I can prove by son fortis in a minute that it is not standard silver; there is at least 50 per cent, of alloy in it, either tin or pewter. I bought it as a heavily silvered plated pewter pot, and, in my judgment, after 40 years' experience, I swear the pot is not worth a penny more than 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I bought it of Titlow for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and marked it in my window at 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I have put the acid on it there is a terrible tint of green shade. Standard silver should turn black with the acid. There is no foreign silver that will come within 20 per cent, of English stan<lb/>dard silver. I never heard the name of Ginger Lee until Titlow mentioned it here. He introduced himself to me and gave his name as Blackie, and to corroborate his statements he produced some sea<lb/>men's papers—of course, it did not interest me and I did not read his papers. When Baxter came to me on May 26 he read me s list of valuable silver stuff that had been stolen, and I said, "I have never seen it." Baxter then said, "I have arrested a man who was seen entering your shop this morning at nine o'clock with s bag. He was followed from your shop to Blackheath." It is an absolute wicked lie for Titlow to say that he told me the things were stolen or that I asked him to let me know always where the stuff came from. He never mentioned such a thing to me. No man would buy such rubbish if he were told it was stolen. My wife and son frequently buy things. On an average we have a dozen people every day coming in to sell things. Many men buy little lots at sales and come round to supply the trade. I generally look at the police list every morning at about a quarter to eight a.m. I just commit it to memory. If anything which is offered is suspicious I should not touch it, and if there is anything in the "Gazette" which we have bought I should immediately tell the police. The shop is usually opened at 7. 45, always by eight a.m. I generally am down to take the milk at seven a.m., then amuse myself in sweeping the loop, taking the shutters down, and having a smoke. It is an absolute lie for Titlow to say he knocked four times by way of a signal. He him self says he came at 9. 15; the double-fronted shop was open and no signals would be required. The butter dish with the name of Dono<lb/>van on it was taken out of pledge by me quite six months ago, with some other goods which were on a pawnticket I bought from Titlow.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190083"/>
               <p>On May 26 the detective asked me about it and I said, "It is a bit of old rubbish, not worth erasing and resilvering." It was in my bureau with a lot of rubbish. It would cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to erase and re-Silver, and I should not get 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; it is only white metal. No one would buy it with another person's name on it; there is no glass inside to it. I swear I have never had the slightest knowledge that he has ever brought me or that I have ever taken out of pledge anything which I bad the slightest suspicion had been stolen. Every<lb/>thing I have bought has been put in the window or on little tables outside. On May 26 I allowed the detectives to turn over everything is the house from top to bottom, and the officer said, "You have got nothing that we have come for." Between May 26 and my arrest on June 18, not a single thing hat been removed except such as have been sold in the ordinary way. The very things that have been proved to be stolen were in the window on June 18. If I had known they had been stolen by Titlow I had three weeks in which to remove them, and, of course, should have cleared everything away if I had been guilty of knowing they were stolen. With regard to the ₤50 worth of foods stolen from Mr. Williams, the whole lot of things I have bought from Titlow are worth about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He brought me two or three articles with the coffee pot; I allowed him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the pot and nearly a sovereign altogether. I did not tell Baxter or anyone else I had had the butter dish 20 years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have a license to buy and sell gold and silver, for which I pay ₤3 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I know the value of silver plate when I see it. I gave Titlow 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the Norwegian coffee-pot. It may weigh 171/2 oz I did not change the knob. I think the match, box came at the same time. It would be worth 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. new. I sold it for 1s. I took the bag out of pledge with some other things two or three months ago—before I got the coffee-pot. I am not sure whether it was that bag—I buy a lot of bags. I never bought this or any other bag on May 2. This bag was found behind my counter on June 18. I do not know how it got there—probably my wife or son may have bought it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1s. I got the butter dish about Christ<lb/>mas<hi rend="smallCaps">; </hi>I bought the ticket no doubt before that from Titlow for about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I could not tell you what else was on the ticket—some other plated stuff; I buy dozens and dozens of pawntickets. To the best of my recollection the ticket would be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three or four articles, including this butter dish, in a bag. Of course, I had not seen the goods. We trust they are worth what they are pawned for<hi rend="italic">, </hi>but sometimes we lose money by taking them out. I believe the Pawnbroker was Harvey and Thompson. I have not inquired, as I have been in Brixton. I was represented at the police court by solicitor and counsel. I could not tell my solicitor where to make inquiries. I had a large quantity of pawntickets, which Baxter has taken. A crest, initials, or monogram is no indication that things have been stolen. This butter dish, dated 1865, is 50 years old, and such things are very commonlv bought from pawnbrokers. The rubbish that Titlow brought me were saleable things. I call any-</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190084"/>
               <p>thing under 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rubbish. The butter dish is not worth 1s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>If Baxter says I told him I had had the butter dish 20 years it is an absolute lie. I never said any such thing. Any remark made about the butter dish was made to Baxter. It is not true that I told him I had had it 20 years. It is an absolute invention to make the case up. Mr. Baxter has not told you what I said to him when he said he had arrested the man that day. I look at the "Police Gazatte" every morning at a quarter to eight. I do not remember reading this entry, "Butter dish presented by Ilex Swimming Club to Edward Donovan." When I got the butter dish about Christmas no doubt I read the inscription. I did not think anything at all of it—it is the kind of thing that would be bought at a saleroom, and I should not recollect what I read in the "Gazette" three months before. About one-third of the goods produced I either bought from Titlow or took out of pawn on tickets I bought from him. I called Titlow "Blackie"-that was the name he gave me when he showed me his seamen's papers; I did not look at his papers. I have never seen his medal and never knew he had been in South Africa. I should say I have seen Titlow fifty times at least. Baxter described him as a tall, dark man. I told him I never heard of the man Titlow or heard of the name, and that I did not know the man. Baxter never said he was a seaman.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I buy pawntickets I trust to the pawnbroker not lending too much. (To the Recorder.) Pawnbrokers will allow you to inspect the articles on paying the interest. That is a small matter; it might be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or a 1s. (To Mr. O'Connor.) Pawn<lb/>tickets are offered for sale by thousands in Debenbam's and other auction rooms; I have bought loads of them; I have not seen them sold by auction.</p>

               <p>Prisoner was stated to have been under the notice of the police for 10 years as a receiver of stolen property; he had given evidence with regard to stolen property found on his premises. In 1904 his wife was convicted of brothel-keeping and fined ₤10 and ₤10 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs, prisoner being acquitted. The police information was that he received the whole of the proceeds of burglaries, but disposed of the more valuable property. One hundred and thirty pawntickets were found, in many cases the goods having been pawned by the prisoner. Pro<lb/>perty from 16 burglaries had been found on prisoner's premises, or the pawntickets relating to it.</p>

                  </hi>I am managing partner in the firm of George Smith and Co., saddlers, of 151, Strand; the senior partner is Mrs. Mar<lb/>garet Smith; she is an elderly lady, now bedridden. The firm occupy for their own business the ground floor of their premises, and sublet the upper storey as offices. In October last the first floor (one large room, partitioned off into three rooms) was to let, and for that purpose was in the hands of Chapman and Co., estate agents. Burrows, giving the name of James Mander, or Manders, called on me and applied for those offices, saying that he was carrying on an insurance broking business. I referred him to Chapmans, telling him that if his references were satisfactory I would accept his tenancy. On October 30 I received a latter, on paper headed "10, Camomile Street, E. C., Travellers' Society, Limited—Registered for the recovery of lost property, " signed "James Manders"; it offered the rent of ₤95</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190086"/>
               <p>and gave as references "Councillor F. A. Rawlings and A. Y Harper. "I handed me letter to Chapmans, and was subsequently shown two letters received by them from Rawlings and Harper; one, signed F. A. Rawlings, stated that the writer had known the gentle man referred to for five years and could recommend him as a respect- able, desirable, and responsible tenant; the other, signed A. Y Harper stated that the writer had known the gentleman named for seven years and could recommend him as a respectable and solvent tenant. I accepted the references as satisfactory, and the agreement was entered into and the tenancy commenced. In addition to Burrows, who was constantly there, I frequently saw the man I now know as Harper. Burrows introduced him to me as his colleague, mentioning his name I once asked him what his name was, and he said Watts. There was a month's rent due on December 16 and another on January 16; neither was paid. On my speaking to Burrows about the arrears he said he had had the money, but had used it for buying some other business. I spoke rather strongly, and he said I must not excite him, because he was suffering from hemorrhage; he promised to pay by January 23 or leave; he did neither, and I put the matter in solicitors' hands. On February 27 I asked him what his real Dane was and he said it was Mander. He left on March 1. The matter was put in the hands of the police, and this prosecution instituted. I gave evidence at the police court on June 3; on the evening of that day Rawlings called and saw me; he said he had come to express his regret at what had happened, and that if he had known what son of characters Harper and Burrows were he would not have given the reference he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Huntly Jenkins. Burrows did carry on a business at 151, Strand; he had a lady typist there. These premises had been empty for some time and I was naturally anxious to get a tenant, but it is wrong to suggest that I was troubling only about my rent. I informed the police about this matter before I commenced civil proceedings against Burrows for the rent due. I have on pre vious occasions had satisfactory references as to tenants who have turned out to be unable to pay their rent. Burrows had no com<lb/>munication at all with Mrs. Smith; she left the business entirely to me; she is an invalid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. I never saw Rawlings at 151, Strand. When he called on me on June 3 I saw nothing wrong in my giving him an interview. He did tell me that until the police court proceedings he had had no idea that Burrows had been unable to pay his rent, and be asked me why I had never informed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. It was on February 25 that I asked Harper his name. I said to him, "What is your name? " and Le said "Watts"; I am certain he did not say "What? " He said "Watts. It's a cold morning" I said, "It will be hotter later on.</p>

                  </hi>My father and myself are landlords of 10, Camo<lb/>mile Street, E. C. On September 2, 1907, Barrows took offices there frost us at ₤30 a year; he carried on business as J. Manders Burrows, instance broker; afterwards the name of the Island Insurance Com<lb/>pany was put up, also the Travellers' Society, Limited. Besides Burrows, Rawlings used to come; he said he was secretary of the Island Insurance Company. The rent for the first two quarters was paid; Burrows left at the June quarter; ₤2 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., pert of that quarter's rent, was unpaid. The letter of October 30, signed J. ganders, addressed to Messrs. Smith and Co., is on paper headed "Travellers" Society, Limited, 10, Camomile Street; at that time Barrows had no authority to use that address.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Huntlv Jenkins. When he left Burrows found is a new tenant, who is still there and paying his rent.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Curtis Bennett. All my transactions with Rawlings have been satisfactory.</p>

                  </hi>assistant of Messrs. Furber, estate agents, 3,, Warwick Court, Gray's Inn. In May, 1906, I was concerned in the letting of 36, Camomile Street to Burrows; he came to me with hawling, and one of them handed me the card produced, "Mander Barrows and Co., insurance and mortgage brokers, 10, Camomile Street; Mander Burrows, F. A. Rawlings, G. B. Myers." They said they were over in No. 10 in very small rooms and wanted larger rooms. They took four rooms on the first floor of No. 36, at the rent of ₤110 per annum. The name they pot up was "The Island Insurance Company, J. Mander Burrows, manager." Burrows and Rawlings attended there regularly. The first quarter's rent, due September 29, not being paid, the bailiff was put in on the 30th; thev continued to occupy the offices till November. After they left letters came addressed to the Island Insurance Company and to Rawlings; they were handed over by Rawlings's request to Harper, who called for then. To Mr. Curtis Bennett. At the beginning of the negotiations it was the Island Company that wanted the offices; we said we preferred letting to individuals, not to companies, and the tenancy was taken in Barrows's name. To Mr Frampton. During the tenancy I saw nothing of Harper. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT E.</hi>H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAMS, </hi>managing clerk of Messrs. Furbers, spoke to authorising the distress for rent; some amount was realised, but there was still a balance due. When Harper called for letters witness asked him for Burrows's address. Harper declined to give it or to five his own name and address.</p>

                  </hi>clerk to Messrs. Furbers, solicitors.

I read the sum<lb/>mons to him. He said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi>It has got to come." I was also entrusted with service of the summons on Harper. I did not see him pence<lb/>ally; I left it with his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Huntly Jenkins. Burrows complained to me that 2 o'clock in the morning was late for me to serve a sum mons. He did not say, "If it has got to come you might serve it at a reasonable time." He said, "It has got to come." I took down the words in my notebook. I have not got the book here.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">CRUBENETT, </hi>P Division. On May 29 I served the sum<lb/>mons on Rawlings. He said, "What does this mean? I had nothing to do with 151, Strand." I said, "The premises were obtained by James Manders Burrows by references given in the name of Menders. He said, "If I gave him a reference I honestly believed what I stated in it. That is not fraud. I did not get anything by it; I had nothing to do with the premises in the Strand. Burrows told me that he was connected with some company, but I had no connection with it. I should not pay much importance to giving a reference in the name of 'Manders, ' as 'Manders-Burrows' is a hyphened name Looking at the reference letter signed Harper and the letter to Chap<lb/>mans signed Manders Burrows, in my opinion they are both written bv the same hand. I have searched the files; there is no "National United Assurance Company" registered under the Companies Acts or under the Friendly Societies Acts.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190089"/>
               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins submitted that there was no case to go to the jury as against Burrows. At the time he took the premises in the Strand, he honestly thought that when the rent became due he would be able to meet it. It was for the prosecution to show affirmatively dishonest and fraudulent intent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett, on behalf of Rawlings, and Mr. Frampton for Harper, also submitted that there was no case.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I have known Burrows about seven years. I knew that he was secretary of the Harrow Liberal Association and an ex-officio member of the National Liberal Club. He lived art a good and well-furnished house at Harrow. I had not seen him for about a twelvemonth previously to my giving him this reference. I had no personal acquaintance with Rawlings. In the autumn of 1908 I met Burrows; he told me he was looking for offices, and asked if I would give him a reference. I said I should be very pleased, and I did so. At the time I certainly believed that he was a man who would meet any obligation he entered into. After be took possession he was very ill, and, as I was then doing very little be asked me if I would call in at 36, Camomile Street when passing and get letters. That was the only connection I had with 36, Camo<lb/>mile Street. At the time I gave the reference I honestly believed that Burrows would prove a responsible and desirable tenant, or I should not have given it. I frequently looked in at the office, but I had nothing to do with the business, nor was I a clerk to Burrows. Owing to his bad state of health I occasionally volunteered to help him, and would write a few letters at his dictation. I was never paid anything for doing this. On the occasion when Scott stopped me in the corridor and asked my name I was astonished at his impertinence, and I exclaimed, as a man naturally would, "What! "</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I first knew Burrows about 1902, when he was with the British General Assurance Company. I next knew him as managing director of the British Union Company, I being a director and secretary of that company. It was wound up about 1906. Bur<lb/>rows and I were directors of the Empire Provident Federation, Ltd.; that went into voluntary liquidation. I was next interested with Borrows in the British United Assurance Company; that was wound up in October last. The company accepted insurance risks to the amount of over a million; it had no tangible assets. When I was asked in Chapman's letter as to my knowledge of "James Mander" it excited no suspicion in my mind. Burrows was frequently known as Manders. At the Strand offices there was a lady typist. I do not know a Mr. Field; I never wrote letters in the name of Field; I signed some letters for Burrows in the name of Field. I am quite sure I did not tell Scott that my name was Watts. (Letters were put to witness signed by him in the name of S. J. Field, secretary of the National United Assurance Company.) I know now that that com<lb/>pany is not incorporated or registered. I was not secretary of the company. I had nothing to do with it, except writing letters to help</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190090"/>
               <p>Barrows. I did go to the offices of the Registrar of Friendly Societies with the application to register the company; I did not give the name of Field; the application form was signed Field; it is not signed by me. In the list of signatories there appears the name of A. H Waits; I was not one of the signatories. I never saw anyone named Watts at the offices.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett asked his Lordship to enter this as a verdict of Not Guilty; fraudulent intent was a necessary ingredient is the conspiracy charge, and the Jury had found Rawlings "Guilty of conspiracy without fraudulent intent. "</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul said that that was an impossible verdict. Con<lb/>siderable discussion ensued, and the Jury, having the formal indict<lb/>ment, read over to them, were again asked for their verdict. Even<lb/>tually they found Rawlings not guilty of fraudulently inducing Mar<lb/>garet Smith to execute the memorandum of agreement by false pre<lb/>tences, not guilty of obtaining the agreement by false pretetecs, guilty of conspiracy with Burrows and Harper to defraud Smith and Scott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Travers Humphreys intimated that the view of the prosecution was that Rawlings and Harper had taken a minor part in these transactions.</p>

At a quarter to two in the morning of July 1 I was on duty in Victoria Docks in company with Sergeant Pearce. We saw prisoners, with whom was another man. I saw them acting in a suspicious manner, going down the quay and jumping on the barges. At that time in the morning no one but the crews of the various ships or lightermen and the police had a right to be in the docks. Prisoners boarded the ship "Geelong, " belonging to the Blue Anchor line. I disguised mvself by taking off my uniform and putting on a serge jacket. I followed them on board the ship</p>

One ran to the right, one to the left, and I grabbed the third man, who was Downey. Downey. I arrested at the bottom of the gangway. The other man got away. I saw the men searched. Downey was wearing two pairs of trousers, one over the other. One of the pairs of trousers and a pair of socks were identified by the drip's donkeyman. There was also a discharge book belonging to Duggan. Sergeant Pearce and I afterwards examined the ventilator, which we found had been unscrewed. After I blew my whistle two of the permanent labourers of the Port of London Authority came to my assistance.</p>

Shortly afterwards I came on deck and saw Constable Latham struggling with prisoner Downey. Duggan was standing at the bottom of the gangway as Downey was being taken down and was arrested by Constable Latham. Neither man had any business on board the ship, so far as I am aware.

I received postcard produced, and on May 19 prisoner called on me and said he had been in the employment of John Aird and Son for 15 years as traffic manager, that he was authorised to take on five men to load trucks at the Kensington Sewerage Scheme, Warwick Road, which would last four years, that the pay would be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 61/2d. per hour and overtime, that I should be under his orders, and that he would engage me. I then paid him ₤2 and he wrote out agreement produced. I parted with my money believing his state<lb/>ments. At that time I was living at Sewardstone Road, Victoria Park. He advised me to move so as to be nearer to the work and I removed to Brooke Green at an expense of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. On June 3 I received postcard produced from prisoner asking me to meet him at Warwick Road, when he showed me letter produced from Moores demanding the return of ₤2, as Moores had obtained a situation, and threatening to communicate with Messrs. Aird. Prisoner asked me to let him have the ₤2, which I gave him. He then wrote agreement produced, stating he had received ₤4 on loan, and guaranteeing I find me employment on the Kensington Sewerage Works. On June</p>

               <p>6, the day before work was to begin, I received a message from pris<lb/>oner that the work would not start at Warwick Road, and that it was no use my going. I went to Warwick Road, notwithstanding, and found prisoner in a public-house, when he told me that the stuff had not come in. I have been there several times since up till June 17. I then made inquiries at the office of John Aird and Co. and saw prisoner at his lodgings. He said he could not help it, he and done all he could, but the stuff had not come in. He arranged for me to go the next morning to Belvedere Road, Westminster. That night I received another postcard (produced) expressing sur<lb/>prise that I should have gone to the office, and saying that I had taken his 15 years' character away, and asking me not to come to Belvedere Road. I went there notwithstanding and told him I had been advised to put the matter in the hands of the police. He per<lb/>suaded me not to do so. On June 22 he promised to give, me ₤1. I had then pawned everything, even my wife's wedding ring, but he did not bring it. I then heard he had been arrested and I communi<lb/>cated with the police.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN MARSHALL, </hi>K Division. On June 26, 1909, at 1.40 a.m., I, in plain clothes, was with Detectives Payne and Hancock in the Barking Road. I saw prisoner with another man at the corner of Victoria Place, outside the "British Empire beerhouse. Prisoner pushed the side door, then went round and pushed the front door of the beerhouse, and then crossed over, the other man standing at the corner of Victoria Place. I stood up and watched. In five or six minutes they both crossed the road Prisoner got up the door post of the front door and remained there for some time. Someone came along, and he got down and went round the corner. After a time he returned and reached up to the fanlight by standing up on the ledge. I heard a thud of something falling; the prisoner got down; a policeman in uniform then came by with another man, and the two ran quickly round the corner.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190907190095"/>
               <p>The prisoner then came out of Victoria Place, crossed the Barking Road, and passed where I was, when I caught hold of him. I said, I am a police officer and shall take yon into custody for being a suspected person, and perhaps you will be further charged." He commenced to struggle. I shouted to Payne, who came back and helped me. Payne fell to the ground. We ultimately got him to the police station. Hancock ran after the other man, but could not catch him. At the station we found upon prisoner a glass-cutting wheel, a knife, two boxes of matches, a piece of brown paper, two keys, and a piece of dried fiver produced. I returned to the place where I had seen him and found a bottle of treacle outside the beerhouse. As treacle is used with brown paper for deadening the sound when window is cut; the liver might be need for quietening a dog. I said to prisoner, "What did yon hare this piece of brown paper fort? " He said, "I have been framing photos to-day, and that is vast I had left."I found the hinge of the fanlight at the public<lb/>house was broken, and the fanlight hanging down. There were two marks made on the side door, apparently with a tool like that pro-</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The distance from the beerhouse to where I stood was about 50 yards. It was dark where I stood. I distinctly saw prisoner as he passed under the lamp. On the second occasion I did not lose sight of him. Another man was taken to the police station, and after inquiries he was allowed to go, as he satisfied the police as to what he was doing there. I did not ask prisoner to satisfy me, because I had seen him at the window. The other man arrested was shorter than the prisoner. Payne did not strike prisoner. I believe prisoner has been earning an honest living since be was last discharged; I have not seen him in bad company.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH PAYNE, </hi>K Division. On June 26, at 1. 40 a.m., I was with Marshall and Hancock near the "British Empire" beer<lb/>house, when I saw prisoner there with another man. Prisoner tried the doors of the beerhouse, the other standing at the comer; they went away. Prisoner then returned, got on to a ledge; someone went by, and he got down and went across the road. He came back again, got on the ledge, and reached to the fanlight. I heard a thud; prisoner got down and ran down Victoria Place with the ether man. A policeman and another man walked by; prisoner walked across the road and commenced to run down King Street with the other. I gave chase to the other man when I heard Marshall shout to me. I rushed back and assisted to arrest the prisoner. He was very violent at first. I found the bottle of treacle produced, which 1 showed to the prisoner. Treacle and brown paper are commonly used for deadening the sound of broken glass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was about 30 to 35 yards from prisoner. I recognised him by the lamp when he was at the fanlight. I am sure he was the one at the fanlight. He had no mark or blood on his face when we got to the station. He said he knew nothing about the treacle.</p>

I was aroused by the police at 2. 30 a.m. and found the hinge burst off and the fanlight hanging down. In Barking public-houses close at 11 p.m. There were scratches on the glass of the fanlight. I keep two dogs in the house, an Irish terrier and a small dog, which are known in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The fanlight was undoubtedly burst open from the outside.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). On June 25 I came home from my work at six p.m., when I met a man I had knows about three weeks, who asked me if I would accept a job as stoker at Beckton Gas Works. I said, "Yes, " and he promised to meet me at 11 o'clock that night at my young lady's house. Before he left me I asked him to lend me a glass cutter as I was making some photo frames, which he promised to get for me. I went to my young lady's house; she had not come home from work and I went on to my mother's, where I saw a knife which I had borrowed from my young lady's mother a fortnight ago and took it to return to her. I went back to my young lady's house and she gave me the sheet for the backs of the photo frames. I forgot to return to her the knife. I put the brown paper in my pocket. About 11 p.m. the man knocked at the door, and asked whether Bert was in. My young lady said, "He is having supper upstairs." While this man was waiting there he said, "Have you got a glass cutter? " I said, "No." He said, "Here is one, " and gave me the glass cutter found upon me He then said, "If we can see the foreman at Beckton I think there will be a fair start for us." We went to Beckton, but did not see the foreman. On my way home, in the Barking Road, I saw two constables, who arrested a man, and I distinctly heard them say, "I arrest you for attempting to break into that beerhouse"; they took him to the station. I walked round to Victoria Place, where the foreman was supposed to live. My friend said, "This is the house." It was unoccupied downstairs, but was occupied upstairs. The detectives rushed out of the urinal and collared me. I struggles at the start, but as soon as I saw it was detectives I never struggle any more. They hit me a blow in the mouth, the mark of which is now on me, and took me to the station. The man was there whom they had arrested before. After they found these things upon me the charged me with the offence and let him go. (To the Jury.)</p>

I can bring three different witnesses to prove how I came in possession of these things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had the piece of dried liver to give to my young lady's cat and to a tame rat that she keeps. I gave the piece to the cat and I kept the other piece for the rat; he had some of it.</p>

Prisoner said, "Yes, " sad the man then gave him the glass cutter (produced), which pris<lb/>oner had asked him for, and which he put in his pocket. He wanted it to cut the glass for photo frames for me. They left to go to Beck too Gas Works and I did not see them any more. The next morning, is I was going to work at 8. 10 a.m., I saw the other man and asked aim where Bert was. He put his hand to his collar like that (de<lb/>scribing) and said, "I got away."—he told me he was locked up. Prisoner used to fetch a piece of dried meat every evening for my tame rat.

On June 13 last I received information that No. 84, Barking Road, a pawnbroker's shop, belonging to Mrs. Mary Hammett, had been entered during the night. I examined the premises with Sergeant Reid. It was just after nine a.m. I found an entry had been gained by climbing over a low wall at the near and forcing an entrance into the basemen of the shop. I found the shop was ransacked and jewellery tickets and other articles strewn all over the place. The manager examined the shop in my presence and found that a large quantity of jewellery had been taken away. On the 15th, in consequence of inquiries I made, I went, with Sergeant Reid, to 9, Rathbone Street, Cuming Town, a small working jeweller's shop. I went into the back kitchen of the shop and saw the elder Lyon and his son. I said, "We are police officers, and from inquiries made I believe you have a large quantity of stolen jewellery in your possession, which was brought here this morning" Edward said, "No, I have not bought any jewellery this morning of any kind; I never buy anything like taht William said, "No, governor, that's a fact; we have got nothing here." I said, "Well, I am going to search your premises." Edwsrd then said, turning to William, "Where it <hi rend="largeCaps">HP</hi>and William said, "In the drawer." I opened the drawer and fund a paper parcel, which contained ladies' dress rings and other articles, a list of which I produce. I told them they would be charged with breaking and entering the premises of Mrs. Hammett, and, further, with felo<lb/>niously receiving the property now found in their possession. Edward said, "This is a nice thing." William said, "I wish I had gone to sea, and I should not have been in this." They made other state ments, in consequence of which I arrested the other prisoner later on. I took the Lyons into custody and handed them over to Sergeant Cleveland. Later on I went with Sergeant Cleveland and Sergeant Reid to Barking Road and found prisoner Tindling outside the "Royal Oak" public-house. This was about one o'clock on the same day. I told him he would be charged with the two Lyons with breaking and entering 84. Barking Road and stealing articles of jewellery. He said, "I know nothing about it at all, nor the Lyons Sergeant Cleveland took him to Canning Town Police Station, pend<lb/>ing my arrival. Later on that same day I went to 28, Quadrant Street, Old Canning Town, where I saw a man named Schwab, I found at his house 36 gentlemen's silver watches and 22 ladies' silver watches and other articles, a list of which I produce. I took him to the station, but he was afterwards released. When all four were at the police station I brought them out into the charge room and told the two Lyons and Tindling that they would be charged together with breaking and entering and receiving the property found their possession, and I told the fourth man that he would be charged with feloniously receiving. Tindling said, "I do not know anything about it; I never saw Lyon."Edward said, "Yes, you saw me last night about it." Tindling said, "What time do you say the stuff was stolen? " and I told him between 12 p.m. on the Saturday and</p>

                  </hi>All I know about the ease is that I was in the shop on the Monday evening, the 14th, attending to a customer. My wife was at the shop door, and while she was there this young man (Tindling) came and said that two young men wanted me over the way. I said I was too busy. That was between half-past nine and 10. I closed the shop and went inside and had a smoke. Soon alter that my son and his wife, who had been out for a walk, came in. I told ay son that the young chap had bean in and was over at the public-house. He said!, "I have seen the dark young chap, and two chaps want me to sell some stuff for them" I said, "You had better not have anything to do with it" Next morning my son said, Will you walk round to Canning Town Railway Station and meet thus young chaps who have some stuff to sell? " I said I was too busy, but he said it would not take long, so I said, "All right, " and I went with him, and we met the two chaps and they took us down the side of the station to a private house and gave my son three parcels. My son took two of the parcels to Schwab's and the other one we took right home. We were not gone more than three-quarters of an hour. That is all I know of the case any more than you know yourself. I am innocent of the whole affair. We had not been in a quarter of an hour when the detectives came in. I have been in business for 30 years, and I have never had a stain on my character before. I have five children. The shop does not belong to me; H belongs to my son. He said, "If I take the shop, will you manage it for me? " and I said, "I do not mind. "</p>
               <p>Inspector You, further examined. The parcel was in the drawer. tied up neatly, and it was only because of my determination to search the place that they admitted where it was. All the silver articles had been taken away and were subsequently found at Schwab's.</p>

When you came to oar place you said to father, "You have some articles you bought this morning well knowing them to be stolen, " and father said, "No, we do not do anything of that kind; we never buy anything unless we know where they come from." I then turned round and said, "Thai is quite right, we have got some articles, but we are innocent that they were stolen."</p>
               <p>Bv the Court. Nothing like that was said. As a matter of fact, William was trying to dispose of a ring by throwing it in the fire<lb/>place, and I seized his hand and took it from him. It was a lady's half-hoop ring with the stones removed; the ring was buckled up, but it has been identified by the pawnbroker as part of the stolen foods; it bears the stock mark of the firm.</p>

There was about ₤195 worth of stock in the jewellery window. I was called at nine next morning by a police-constable, and, on examining shop, found it had been broken into and about ₤200 worth of stock missing. I recognise the jewellery produced to me as being all Mrs. Hammett's property.</p>
               <p>F<hi rend="smallCaps">REDERICK CAVANAGH, </hi>manager to Mrs. Hammett. I identify jewllery produced as belonging to her. Its value is about ₤195. I should say the entire lot is here. The bent ring produced is part of oar stock. It had five diamonds in it, but I do not know what has become of them.</p>

Edward Lyon has been in business as a working jeweller for about 32 years. There is nothing known against him by the police. He has had several shops in the neighbourhood of Finsbury, but I am informed that he lost each of the businesses through drink. The last few years he has been in the districts of Canning Town, Plaistow, and Barking, where he has had s small working jeweller's business. He has borne an excellent character during the whole time except in the years he gave wav to drink and lost his money. He has been at Rathbone Street about three months. The police knew nothing about him except that we received certain information that people who robbed ships sometimes took watches to him. William Lyon is a butcher by trade and he has also been to sea. He has had butchers' stalls m Canning Town and Poplar. Butchers in the district have given him a good charac<lb/>ter as a hard-working, honest man.</p>
