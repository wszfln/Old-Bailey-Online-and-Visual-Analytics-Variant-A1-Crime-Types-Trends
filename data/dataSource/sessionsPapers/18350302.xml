                  </hi>. I live in Tooley-street, Southwark. On the 31st of January, the prisoner came into my shop, which has an inner door, at nine o'clock or a few minutes after nine in the evening—he first came to the door and looked in at the outer door—I was standing at the end of the counter—I saw him come to the door and look in—I have two doors to my shop—there is a lobby—the outer door was open—the inner door was on a latch—it opens with a brass knob—I saw him take hold of the knob, turn it, and come in—I am certain that door was shut—when he came in he turned to the window, put up his hand, took hold of a pair of trowsers, looked at them, and looked at me in the face—I was standing at the end of the counter, about three yards from him—he took the trowsers in his hand and turned to look at me—I was about to step to him, expecting he was going to ask me the price—he caught down another pair which hung by the side of them, and run out with them both—I called "Stop thief"—two or three persons followed him to the end of an archway, and he got away—I am lame—I never saw my trowsers afterwards—he was taken up on the following Saturday—I am certain of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Dolphin Tavern in Mare-street, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney. The prisoner had been in my service three or four months, to carry out beer and wait in the public-house—he slept in the house—on the morning of the 7th or 8th of February I re<lb/>ceived some information, and on the 11th of February this happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were examined about this on the 7th of February? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning of the day I was examined I heard the prisoner come down stairs about six o'clock—I partly dressed myself and came down a few stairs—I heard him strike a light, and open the parlour shutters in the passage, and I saw him open the street door—I was on the staircase—I saw him come back and go into the front parlour, and take a chair, which he took out at the front door—I then went up stairs into the Assembly Room, which is directly over the parlour—I had left the Assembly Room window open previously, about eleven o'clock at night, before I went to bed, having suspicion—I looked out and saw him place the chair under the bar-parlour window, which was not open—he had a candle and candlestick in his hand—the chair was outside in the street—just as he placed the chair there, a customer came and asked him for some<lb/>thing to drink—he said his master would not be up for an hour—I then went into my bed-room, fearing he might come up—I had not been there two minutes before I heard the bar-parlour window pushed up—I went to the window, and saw him getting into the bar-parlour—I ran down stairs, saw him go into the bar to the till, put his hands into it, and take copper money out—I had left nothing in the till but copper money—it was partly marked, and partly unmarked—I was directly opposite him, at a sash-window—there is a blind outside the win<lb/>dow, so that he could not see me—I stood at the bar door, which is in the passage—that door was locked, but the door communicating with the bar-parlour is never locked—I was standing by a glass door, which had a blind</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020007"/>
               <p>to it, which prevented him seeing me; but the blind being outside, I turned it a little on one side, which gave me an opportunity of seeing what he was about—he had a light with him, and I had none—I saw him open the till, and take copper money out, and put it into his jacket pocket—it was quite dark at the time—I then saw him go into the bar-parlour, and get out of the window—the till is in the bar, which joins the bar-parlour—he got out at the same window—he put the blind as it was left the night before, shut the window down, and brought the chair in—I went up stairs and stood in my bed-room listening for half or three quarters of an hour—I heard nobody come in; and about seven o'clock the prisoner, as usual, came up and knocked at my bed-room door—I came down stairs directly—the pri<lb/>soner went into the cellar to clean the knives and forks—I unlocked the bar door, counted the money, and missed twenty-eight penny-pieces, all of which I had marked—the till was not locked—any body in the bar might open it—I immediately sent a person for a constable, and gave the prisoner into custody—I accused him of taking the money, which he denied—he was searched in my presence, but nothing was found on him—I went into the cellar, where he had been cleaning his knives, and found one penny-piece only, marked, close by an empty rum-puncheon, at the back of it—he had been in the cellar about twenty-five minutes—I am sure it was one of the penny-pieces I had marked and put into the till the night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is the bar-parlour accessible in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By a door from the passage, and then you can walk from the bar into the bar-parlour—when the sash bar door is locked at night, nobody can get in without break<lb/>ing the lock—the door is between the passage and the bar-parlour—I had locked the bar and parlour door the night before, and I noticed that this, window was left unfastened, about a quarter before twelve o'clock—it was the prisoner's duty to fasten it—he had gone to bed then—I did not fasten it myself, having some suspicion—this might be on the 7th of February—I had no character with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. When you saw me in the bar-parlour, why not take me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I thought somebody else was concerned in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was never my orders to fasten up the front of the house—the parlour shutters were never more than put to, and the window had no catch to it.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I live in Maiden-lane, Islington. On Sunday, the 8th of February, about twenty-five minutes after two o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Castle-street, Long-acre, in the parish of St. Giles—I met the prisoner and two other men in company together—they were standing at the corner of Castle-street—after I passed, they fol<lb/>lowed after me—then one of them came in front of me, looked me in the face, he then went back and spoke to the others—I continued walking on—I went up Short's-gardens—they all three followed me—I went on one side for a necessary purpose—I then crossed the road, and they followed me—the prisoner came up to me at the corner of Charles-street, and Drury-lane, St. Giles—he said, "You are the b—who wanted to fight me"—and at that instant, he knocked his head against my face with violence, knocked my hat off, and knocked me against the wall—I did not fall—he snatched my watch out of my fob, and my handkerchief out of my pocket—the watch-chain and all went together out of my fob, and he snatched a silk handkerchief out of my pocket—I had not attempted to strike him—I never saw any of them before—I never spoke to them—I am sure the prisoner is the man who did this—he ran as hard as he could—I halloaed "Stop thief"—he dropped the handkerchief as he ran—I picked it up all over mud, in the middle of the road—I saw him run into a house, No. 3, Charles-street—I called out "Police"—a policeman came directly, and saw him running before he got into the house—I went to the house with the policeman—the door was open—it is a private house—we went up stairs to one room, and knocked at the door—they were some minutes before they would open the door—at last a man opened it, who was rather intoxicated—I found the prisoner in the room, lying on a bed, with a rug over him, and his clothes and shoes on—I have not the least doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Avery Baker, who keeps the Crown and Horse-shoe public-house, Holborn-hill, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. Last Friday night, at eleven o'clock, I went up to my bed-room, on the second floor—I found the bed-room door open—I had locked it myself at four o'clock, and put the key into my pocket—I had it in my pocket when I got to the bed-room door—my husband also has a key—I did not go into the room, but I could see my drawers were open, and my clothes scattered on the floor—I immediately ran down stairs, without going into the room, and, on the first floor, there is a stair<lb/>case door which locks—it is kept locked to keep the parlour customers from the bed-room—I ran down stairs and locked that door after me, to keep the prisoner secure up stairs—I had not seen or heard any body up stairs, but the prisoner followed down the stairs close after me, and tried the door which I had locked—he then got over the banisters—I called "Stop thief" or "Thief"—he came through an opening on the stair<lb/>case, over the banisters, above where the door was locked—I seized hold of him by the collar, and continued calling "Thief"—he broke from me, and went into the front parlour, where he had been with two friends taking refreshment—the front parlour is on the first floor—I followed him into the parlour, and laid hold of him again, and kept calling "Stop thief"—he broke from me, and ran down the stairs—(there was no key in the bed-room door, when I saw it open—it must have been opened by a false key—there was no violence used to the door)—he ran down stairs into the passage—my servant and a witness stopped him in the passage—I went up stairs afterwards with the watchman, and found a hat on the second flight of stairs, beyond the door which I had locked, between that and the bed-room door—the prisoner had no hat on when he came through the opening by the banisters—I found a masonic apron of my husband's in the hat, and two handkerchiefs of my husband's—the apron had been in a drawer in my bed-room—a light-coloured silk handkerchief was also found in the hat, which did not belong to us—I went up to my bed-room with the watchman—I found all the drawers open, which I had left shut, but not locked—I saw my husband's shirts and things thrown on the bed, and some on the floor—two shirts and a shawl were picked up in the passage, when the prisoner was seized down stairs—I could not see any thing in his hands, when he passed me—the shawl is mine, and the shirts my hus<lb/>band's.</p>

On the evening of the 18th of February, I was at the top of Saunders' gardens—I saw the three prisoners and another there—I saw Edwards with five knives, four pen, and one pocket-knife—Harris said, "I will have this," and Sheen said, "No, I will have this"—Edwards said, "So you may," and they tossed for the odd one—there were five knives altogether—they all said if I did not be off they would slap me in the eye—I was going to the doctor's for my sister—I said, "I will send the policeman after you," and they all walked away—a policeman came up—I afterwards went to the Shakspeare Theatre in the Kingsland-road, and pointed out Edwards, who was sitting in the pit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of a beer-shop, No. 4, Wilstead-street, St. Pancras. On Monday, the 29th of December, I was at home the whole day—there are only two small rooms on the ground floor—they are about ten by twelve feet—the tap-room is nearly square—there is a com<lb/>munication from one room to the other—one is the parlour and the other the tap-room—I had very little business that evening—I could see what was going on in the tap-room from the parlour—I was not out of the house the whole day—Charles Miller, one of the Criers of this Court, called about dinner time, a little after one o'clock in the afternoon, and did not leave till after nine o'clock, just before shutting up time—James Waldie was there, Edward Wood, Stephen Slough, Thody, the turncock, Poulton, the baker, and John Dobing—Dobing did not come in till towards seven o'clock—the defendant did not come into the tap-room or parlour that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your ordinary place, in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends on how the rooms are filled—if there is plenty of company, it is not usual to mix with them—if an old acquaintance drops in, I sit down with him in the parlour—I was in the parlour with Miller, nearly alone, from six to seven o'clock—one or two came in and went out—it is quite impossible that the defendant could have been in the tap-room five minutes and I not observe him—there was no card-playing there that evening by any body—there was no game called blind all-fours played—I have got my licence (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was served with this information and summons on the 3rd of January—the information is dated the 31st—I pleaded not guilty to it.</p>

               <p>to do, I sat down with him—he was in the parlour about seven o'clock—I do not know that I was there exactly at that time—we were chatting—he had one glass of ale, which I believe lasted him all the afternoon—he had nothing else from me—the parlour is at the back of the tap-room—this model (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is not like it exactly—there is a very great dif<lb/>ference—I was occasionally in the bar—Miller and I were not sitting in the bar drinking brandy-and-water—I do not drink brandy-and-water—we were not there—this model is incorrect in many respects—the bar is correct—the parlour is not, for the staircase is taken off it—a person in the bar can see into the parlour—I could not see into all parts of it—if a man sat with his back here, I could not see him—there were very few persons in the parlour that night—Waldie and Poulton were occasionally there, and then in the tap-room—Miller was in the parlour the whole time—he was not in the bar with me at all, nor any person—there is not room—I know nothing of blind all-fours, it is a game I never saw in my life—there were no cards in my house that night—I have no cards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person might bring cards in their pocket, and play without your knowing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think not—not without my seeing it—I can sit in the bar and see into the room—I was alone when in the bar—there was nobody but Miller in the parlour at that hour—all the other persons were in the tap-room just at that hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you from the parlour see into all parts of the tap-room, so as to see if people are at cards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I know very well a party at cards could not be made up without being seen—I should think so—it is impos<lb/>sible to see through a brick wall—there is not room for three or four per<lb/>sons to play and not be seen, for the door is so wide, and it was open all the time—it is impossible that four persons could be playing at cards without my seeing them—one person might hide himself if he chose, but I do not think he could come in without my seeing him—they go through the tap-room into the parlour, and through the passage into the tap-room—the de<lb/>fendant could not come in without my seeing him—if that model was cor<lb/>rect, I could convince you, but it is not at all like it—I should not like to swear that in the parlour I was sure to see every body who comes into the tap-room, but I believe it to be impossible—it is quite impossible for four persons to play without being seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turncock to the New-River Company, and live at No, 3, Brill-place, Somer's-town. I was at Gosden's beer-shop on Monday, the 29th of December—I went there at six o'clock in the evening, and staid until eight o'clock—I sat close against the bar in the tap-room—I could see into the parlour from where I sat—I could see if any body came into the house—I never saw the defendant come there between six and eight o'clock—there was no card-playing at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 43, Johnson-street, Somer's-town; I am one of the Criers of this Court, and have been so nearly twelve years. I have known Gosden for years—I was at his beer-shop, in Wilstead-street, on the 29th of December, on private business of my own—I went there at one o'clock, and staid until nine at night—I sat in the parlour—I was there from one o'clock till nine without leaving the house—I occasionally went to speak to him at the bar—he was sitting with me the principal part of the time, there being nobody else in the room for at least four or five hours, I can be certain—I never saw the defendant till he was brought up here to traverse—I was at Hatton-garden, but my attention was not called to him—I could overlook the tap-room from where I was sitting in the parlour—I am confident that four persons could not be playing cards with<lb/>out my seeing them—there was no card-playing there at all, either in the parlour or tap-room—the bar is not large enough for it—I should think business was very slack that night—there were not above six or seven per<lb/>sons there—I cannot say how soon after this I was called on to recollect what passed, but I remember it perfectly well, by Gosden having to attend a summons at Hatton-garden next day—he asked me, as an old friend, to go with him—I said I could not be of any service, and did not go—I am quite confident there was no card-playing that evening—I would not have stop<lb/>ped there a moment if there had been.</p>

On the 4th of February, about ten o'clock, in the morn<lb/>ing, I went into my kitchen, leaving the shop for about five minutes—on returning, the prisoner was in the shop—he had taken one boot, and was in the act of taking the other—he laid it down when he saw me—he asked if I could tell him of a situation, on my asking him what he did there—I said I did not know of one—he went out—I missed a pair of boots—one of them laid on a table by the shop door—I went after him, and asked what he had done with the boot—he said he had not got it—I said he had—he pulled it out of his pocket and threw it at me—the iron heel struck me over the eye, and caused me to faint—it cut my forehead, which bled very much indeed—the doctor attended me above a fortnight with it—the pri<lb/>soner ran away, and after I recovered myself I called my husband—I de<lb/>scribed the prisoner to the policeman, and he brought him to our house on the Friday following—I recognised him in a moment by his dress and features, and his eye being sore—I should know him twenty years hence, I noticed him so particularly—I have not a doubt of him.</p>

               <p>never rejected as bail, to my knowledge, but really I cannot positively swear it, but I do not believe I ever was in my life—I never remember such a thing occurring.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What business had you at the Bail Court on this occasion, the 25th of November? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been to Westminster to receive some money of a person named Foulkes, and as I passed, I merely called in, nothing more—I knew Warren before several years—I knew Brookes by sight be<lb/>fore—I have spoken to him, but I do not know that I spoke three words to him in my life—I never knew him, or spoke to him, till within twelve months—I will swear I have not spoken twenty times to him within the last twelve months—I never saw Griffiths before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to stay to see this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They asked me to go and have a drop of something to drink—they had no money to pay for it—that was at the Horse-shoe and Stump, in the Westminster-road—that was after we went out of the Bail Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What caused you to be a witness of this transaction in the Bail Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely called as I came by, to see what was going forward—I am partial to hearing trials, and have been so all my life, and when I came into the passage, there was Warren—it was purely accidental that I came by and went in—I lent him some money afterwards.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not advance your money to complete the fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I lent him the money to get the discharge—I lent no money at the Bail Court—I would not lend money to assist in a fraud—I never knew of the fraud—I did not know what they were about, or that they were doing wrong, till they shared the money next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard a man perjure himself by assuming a false name, and a residence you knew to be untrue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had nothing to do with that—I staid in Court on purpose to hear what they would do—he told me he had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year left him, and as he owed me 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I <hi rend="italic">cocked</hi> my ear, and tnought I should get some of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am included in this indictment. In November last, I had transactions with Mason—I did not know him before—he was in the King's Bench prison when I saw him—I went on business into the prison, and a Mr. Hutchinson introduced me to him—Mason told me he was confined there for £250, and wished he could get two bail who could justify him out—I undertook to get two persons—I gave notice to Mr. Pocock, the solicitor, of the bail I had found—on examining them, I found they were not sufficient, and would not take them into Court—I afterwards saw Mason in the prison on the subject, and told him the bail had failed to justify—he seemed very much disappointed, and wished me to employ others, if I possibly could, who could get him out—I told him it was very difficult to get two bail who could justify for so large a sum—he said he did not care how it was done, as long as it was done, and he wished to know if I could get two bail, that we might <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> it—he said some thing to that amount—the meaning of that is, to get two men, no matter what they are, and to swear they have served notice, when it was not served—I said I would do no such thing, and never did such a thing in my life—I said I would have nothing more to do with it—after this inti<lb/>mation from Mason I saw Brookes a few days afterwards—he asked me if I had been engaged for Mr. Mason—I said I had, and that I put in two bail, which could not justify—he told me be could find two that could justify for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I told him Mason would be very glad to treat with him, or any body else, on the subject, if he could do it, and he was at liberty to go to him, if he liked—Brookes and I parted—I went to the King's Bench prison every day, having some friends there I used to go to see every day—I saw Mason again—I went in consequenca of a messange—I saw him in Mr. Purcell's room, where he was dining—he told me there wers two persons there, named Gray and Warren, who were ac<lb/>quaintances of Mr. Purcell's, and they were to be his bail, and came to inquire whether the money was lodged—I said I did not know them—Mason said the bail wanted money to pay the justification—I told him not to give them any thing, but to send some person down to the Court to pay it—he said he had nobody he could confide in, except his mother—he had nobody to send to her, as it was rather late in the evening, and re<lb/>quested I would meet her down there to see that it was right—I agreed to do so at the public-house called the Magpie and Stump—I did not see Mason after this conversation—I saw him after the justification, on the same day—in the evening of that day I saw him in company with Warren, Trussell, and Hackham—Warren wanted money to take out the order—they had none, as Mason's friends left me before the justification—Mason said he would give him no money till he brought the discharge—Warren was very angry, and went away without any money—Mason asked me about it—I said he had better pay—he said he would not till he had the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to say "to that amount?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I used the word—it was to that amount—I did not mean those words.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whet word did not you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The gentleman says, I said "to <hi rend="italic">buffet it</hi>," or words to that amount—I said Mason was very much disappointed that they could not justify, and said he would give any money to get it, and could not I get two bail that could <hi rend="italic">buffet</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He said that at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he asked if I could get two bail to get him out; and I said it would be difficult to get</p>

               <p>persons to so large an amount; and then he said, could not I get two per<lb/>sons that could <hi rend="italic">buffit</hi>—I think that followed immediately—he did not say any thing else that I recollect—after the bail had been justified, I went to the public-house, as the parties were waiting there to take some refresh<lb/>ment—I had met the other parties there, who were waiting for me—they were writing affidavits and instruction for counsel to support the bail—I had not the slightest notion of any fraud—Mr. Brookes told me he could get two bail to the amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I told Mason that I thought it had been regularly procured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you expressed your opinion that the bail was regularly procured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the night on which they told me that Warren and Gray had called upon me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were you first applied to, to turn evidence against the defen<lb/>dants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not applied to—I was a prisoner in Whitecross-street prison, for debt, and after the detainer was lodged against me, I wrote the whole particulars to the Governor—I was never applied to, on the part of the prosecution, to give evidence—I told the prosecutor I was willing to come and state all I knew—I said so in Whitecross-street, the day before yesterday—I had a statement, in writing, of the whole particulars to be given—I was eleven years in the service of Mr. Crowder—I was arrested for debt—that is the only reason why I left him—it is six years ago—I was never in any other prison but Whitecross-street—I went through the Insolvent Court, six years ago, and seven years before that, through family misfortunes—I have not had any regular employment since my return from the Continent—I was looking for persons to employ me to justify bail in the king's bench prison—have never been bail myself—I justified bail, last vacation, at chambers—the stationery is the principal part of my business—I never saw Griffiths before that day—I had seen Warren in company with Collier—I never had any transactions with him—I did not see the affidavit made that day, in the name of John Daniels, to my know<lb/>ledge—I did not see it sworn—when it was sworn, I was at the Magpie and Stump—I was there about twelve o'clock—it was too late to justify at ten o'clock—Broockes came over and said it was too late, and they went to take it at the rising of the Court—I cannot recollect that I prepared the affidavit—I wrote one or two documents—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) that is not my handwriting, nor any of it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the bail-piece</hi>) that is my hand<lb/>writing—I did not see Warren at No. 4, Surrey-road, on the night of the justification, for after he left Bench I followed him and could not find him—the day after, when the discharge came to Mason, they all went to</p>

I was in the King's Bench Court when the bail was justified—I was counsel on the occasion to oppose the bail—I cannot say particularly at what hour I received the brief—it was after the regular justification of bail was over—I do not recollect who delivered the brief to me—I know the defendant Brookes—I took a technical objection in my opposition, and waived it at the request of Brookes—I have written to that effect on the brief—that refreshes my memory of the transaction—I have no doubt it was a valid objection—the Judge seemed desirous I should waive it, as it was beside the merits of the case—to the best of my belief, Brookes mentioned Mr. Pocock's name to me, as if Mr. Pocock wished it to be waived—that it was the wish of Mr. Po<lb/>cock, that I should wave all objections—previous to that, some lapse of time had taken place in consequence of the argument on the objection—it was after that lapse of time that I was spoken to by Brookes to waive the objec<lb/>tion, and the impression on my mind is, that he said it was Pocock's desire—Mr. Ball was counsel on the other side—the bail justified—I am not sure whether the brief was given to me in the passage, or in the Court—when I went into the Court the regular business was proceeding—I had not the least idea of any thing irregular having taken place till Mr. Pocock came to my chambers about it.</p>

This brief has my name signed to it—I never delivered that brief, nor did my clerk, by my authority—there was no notice of bail servesd on me on that action—there was a former notice—no such notice as that an<lb/>nexed to this brief was received at my office—I never had notice of this bail—a notice was served before, which was not persevered in—I never had such a notice as this—there is "P. Palmer" to the notice—I went to Bar<lb/>nard's Inn—I could find no such person either as solicitor or otherwise—I made diligent inquiry: I went to Griffiths, and I saw him, and said, "I find you have become bail for Mason, and justified for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is that true?"—he looked astonished, and said, "Mason, Mason: I don't know such a person; I never heard of such a person"—I said, "Then that is singular; there must have been a gross fraud committed, as I see by the bail piece that you are put down as one of the bail"—he said, "I never was bail for Mason, or any other person, and I will take my oath of it"—I said, "Well, it may be material; will you make an affidavit of it?"—he said, "I will, at any time"—that was all that took place.</p>

               <p>—I saw Mr. Thessiger hand the brief over to Mr. Ball—Mr. Ball called Mason's bail, and the usher said it was too late—a gentleman said it was the last day of term—the Judge said at the rising of the Court he would take it, or if then was any opposition, it might be called on any time in the day—Sheridon went back to Mrs. Mason, and told her it was too late, and we must keep the bail there all day till the rising of the Court—Mrs. Mason said she would go, and leave that gentleman to advance the money to Sheridon, as it was wanted to pay the Court fees—he paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for putting in bail to one of hit own actions—he did not give Mr. Thessiger the fee, but I saw him give it to Mr. Ball—the gentleman was tired of waiting—Sheridon said, "Why, Brookes, they have not ap<lb/>peared to oppose the bail, perhaps they do not mean to oppose it?"—he has always conducted the law business, and I am sorry to say, though I knew it was not legal, I was instrumental in producing bail to him at times—I had no idea but he had, as usual, given notice—he had shown me notice of two men before, one named Farmer, and the other Nelson—he did not think them sufficient, and did not justify—he said, "Here is a gentleman, who will go down to any counsel?" as the Judge said, if opposed, it should be heard—I then wrote the notice—the one notice had been given to Mr. Ball; he pretends he drew the notice from a copy, but he drew the notice, and I at the same time made a remark, "I will go down and see if any body I know it there"—I met Mr. Heaton coming out of the Court—a gentleman and I went down—I introduced him to Mr. Heaton—he gave Mr. Heaton the copy of the notice, and the brief and fee—Mr. Heaton went and spoke to Mr. Ball, and the gentleman said, "I am afraid it will not come on till four o'clock, I will be back by then"—he did not come back—Mr. Ball called the bail, and Mr. Heaton said he was in<lb/>structed to oppose the bail, which he did—after the justification, Gray and Warren went over to the King's Bench, to Mason—he said, "I will go over and see if Mason will give some money, now we have justified"—She<lb/>ridon went over with him, and they came back and said Mason would not part with any money—Mason said he would not believe Warren was one of the bail, and would give no money till the discharge came—next morn<lb/>ing Warren met me and Gray at the public-house, Fleet-street, to procure the discharge—Sheridon said, "I will not go up to the Rule Office, for I am known there"—I had no reason to suppose any thing was wrong, there<lb/>fore it is a conspiracy against me, by Gray and Sheridon—I said, "Very well; here, Gray, I will show him as far as the office"—he went and paid the money, came down, and said, "I have got the Rule"—Sheridon said, "You must send down to the signer of the writ, and get the discharge"—I went as far as the King's Bench prison—they went and came out, and said, instead of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all they could get was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Vernon, but Mason had made up 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his own pocket—we went to the pub<lb/>lic-house in the Blackfriars'-road, and the money was divided—Warren said, "I shall detain 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he paid Gray, who had borrowed half-a-sovereign at the public-house, which I forgot to mention, at the Gibraltar, in order to pay the expenses, and he received 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his trouble—so he was right in saying he received 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he grumbled at it, saying, "I was the whole and sole person in bringing it forward"—as to Mason knowing any thing of it, I am sure he could not, for Gray was not in the King's Bench till the justification, and Mason knew nothing about him—it was Sheridon asked me to find him two respectable persons.</p>

               <p>Tipling could do every part of the screen, but he never did it in the shop—these are not nicely finished, they are very rough work—I cannot tell whose work it is—it does not seem to be one who has had much practice—I never heard that Tipling and Cord said that I had been to teach them—I heard them say before the Magistrate that I took osiers there—Tipling has said he would do me all the injury he could, because I gave him a month for stealing my shoes—he was always quarrelling, and making what disturbance he could between his mistress and me—we were not the best of friends—he set us all in arms—he has threatened several times to leave my master, and set up in business himself—I do not recollect that he said so in my master's presence—my mistress dies the goods—Cord splits them, and my master's father and I have done them—I never went to Tip<lb/>ling's—I cannot tell where he lives—it is in the Edgeware-road—I never gave him any osiers to work up—when Cord took the osiers, Charles Orton was there—I did not ask him to assist me in taking Cord's cap off—my matter was at Hammersmith at the time—I told my master when I saw him.</p>

I came to town on Sunday, the 15th of February, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and found somebody had entered the house—my dressing-case was broken open, in the front bed-room, on the third floor—several drawers were also open, and the contents of the dressing-case taken away, and the case itself thrown under the bed—there were marks of a knife or sharp-pointed file, which I picked up in the room—a closet in another bed-room on the same floor was broken open—the draw<lb/>ing-room was entered, and a cabinet of minerals opened, and several things taken away—the silk of the piano-forte cut off, and some wearing apparel taken away—I saw the print of a foot on the floor of the front attic, from the window to the door—I saw marks along the leads of the house—my opi<lb/>nion was, that the thieves had entered that way—I have made inquiry, and rather think one window had been left open at eight o'clock at night—the amount of the property taken was from 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner is a stranger—he had no right on my premises—I thought I knew his coun<lb/>tenance when I first saw him.</p>

On Saturday night, a little before eight o'clock, I was going out at the street door, and saw something dark in one corner of the ground-floor passage—I called my mother two or three times, and then I saw it move—I screamed out, ran into the street, and shut the street-door after me—I had the door open when I saw it—what I saw was down in the passage, by the stair-case, not near the door—I rang the bell—my mother came with a light to open the door, and saw two bundles on the mat, which did not belong to us—I then went for my father, who came home—he and the officer brought the prisoner from the cellar, as soon as my father came home—he was quite a stranger to us.</p>

               <p>coming in—I got out of bed, left the room, and alarmed Mr. Bradbee—he returned with me to the room, and there we saw the prisoner sitting in a chair—Mr. Bradbee then fired a pistol, which he had with him—he meant to fire it at the man, but I do not think he fairly saw him—Mrs. Bradbee was with us—we then left the room, went into the back room, and gave an alarm at the back of the house—the watchman broke open the street door, and came up stairs, and took the man in the front room—I did not look out of the window to see how he had got in—the house was under repair, and I suppose he got up the scaffolding—I had never seen him before.</p>

The prisoner was one of my fellow-seamen, and came with us from Shields—the crew consisted of five—William Colson was the master—I and the prisoner came on shore on the 22nd of October—my brother was with me—we went to buy several small things for the passage back—there was a difference between my brother and him at the public-house, at King James's stairs, that night—they had a few words—the prisoner struck my brother across the table—I asked him what that was for—he made no more to do, but struck me in<lb/>stantly—we went to the door, and there were several blows between us on each side—we were parted by a policeman—my brother and I took a boat and went on board immediately—we came on shore again in about ten minutes, in the same boat, and went to an eating-house to get some sup<lb/>per—that was about eleven o'clock at night—I staid on shore about half</p>

               <p>an hour—my brother staid there all night, and persuaded me to stop with him, but I went back to the vessel without him, after waiting on shore half an hour—I had not seen the prisoner since the policeman sepa<lb/>rated us—when I got on board, I went to the hatchway and asked who was there—he said, "I am"—I knew his voice—I looked down, and saw there was no light—I heard his voice as if he was sitting on his chest.</p>

I came on shore that day, and parted with the prisoner shortly after he went on shore—I fell in with him again shortly after—I saw him and the prosecutor at the public-house, and saw what passed between them—I heard George Dixon say to the prisoner, "How came you to say Mark Grady would not carry me?"—the prisoner said, "No more he would," and then the prisoner struck George Dixon—they began to fight—the pri<lb/>soner then abused Dixon's family, and said they had not a good word to give any body—Robert Dixon then jumped up, and said he would fight him, if he came to the door—they fought a few minutes, and were parted—both went into the public-house, and the prisoner and I went in as well into, the same room; then tie prisoner called to me to go and drink in a little room backward, and not stop with them—I said it would be better to make it up, and all go on board together—he made no answer to the proposal—he wanted a pot of beer—we came back to where we had left the Dixons, and they were gone—what passed about making it up was in a private room—he said nothing to that—I immediately returned into the room where we had left Dixons, but they were gone—the prisoner and I went and got a glass of spirits each, and went on board directly—it was about half-past eleven o'clock—the Dixons were not on board then—the prisoner and I went down below to go to bed—I took off my clothes in<lb/>stantly, and said I thought I would not strike a light, as we had to be up two hours after, to go off—I pulled my clothes off—the prisoner did not take his clothes off, nor go to bed—he did not say why—I did not get into bed, as the prisoner said to me, "Here: he is coming"—I knew who he meant, as only three of us slept on board in the forecastle—he hardly said so, before Dixon asked, "Who is below?"—the prisoner said, "I am below; what do you want?"—Dixon said, "Come on deck, and I will fight you; you cannot say there are two upon you now"—very abusive words took place between them, and in an instant Brady jumped on deck all at once; but I did not know what he was going to do—it was a very moonlight night—when he jumped on deck, I heard a man fall on deck, apparently—I went upon deck instantly, and as I passed the prisoner, he said, "I have done him; there he is lying"—Dixon was lying on the deck—I took hold of him, and set him on ray knee—I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "You have done it; this is a bad job, man"—he made me no an<lb/>swer—I saw blood running down from Dixon's head on my shirt—he was quite insensible—I thought he was dead—the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">rather much</hi> intoxicated at the time—he said nothing more to me—the policeman came on board directly—I did not see the handspike—I had come from Shields with the prisoner—he had been another voyage with me in the ship—I have seen him in liquor before—I did not notice any ill-temper in him be<lb/>fore—he and Dixon had had a few words before in the passage up, I heard the prisoner say Robinson would not carry his brother George up—that was in our passage—he said Robinson would not carry him in the ship—whether it was for a bad character, or what, I do not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Samuel Sherwood and Rich<lb/>ard Mason Wood, type-founders and printers'-brokers, Chiswell-street. One part of their premises comes into Artillery-court—the prisoner has been in their employ about two months—he was a printers'-joiner—I was present when the preliminaries were gone into between him and Mr. Wood, in the early part of December—he was to take the place of the journeyman who was then working for us—it was expressly en<lb/>gaged that he was not to do work at home, or to take materials home—I then left London, and when I returned I found him at work there—he was to be paid as the other men, from time to time, for the articles, deducting the timber that he had from time to time to make the articles—he was to give up working at home for any one, but to come and work as a journeyman there—he received money in the course of his employ, till such time as I could put his account square—I have seen the book in which his entries were made, and consider he has been overpaid—I have no other account of what he did, but by a book which he kept him<lb/>self, with which Mr. Wood furnished him when I was out of town—that book was missing on the Monday before these articles were taken—I saw it again in the hands of the prisoner's solicitor at Worship-street—I remem<lb/>ber, about a fortnight before this occurred, Mr. Wood accusing him of stay<lb/>ing away, and he said he supposed he had been working for somebody else—He said he had not, except a job of carpentering, which was not our trade, for a person to whom he owed some money—Mr. Wood said, "Mind, I shall not allow you to do so; but if it is so, all is well"—on Wednesday morning, the 18th of February, I came down stairs to go into the counting-house—I live on the premises, and am generally the earliest up—I am ge<lb/>nerally up at half-past eight or nine o'clock—the prisoner knew that was my habit—on that morning I received information, and went to the prison<lb/>er's work-room—I missed all that I had seen there before, on which he had been working, and for which he had drawn money—I missed part of two ruling-machines, twenty dozen of reglets, and about forty deal boards—I did not miss the mahogany—I made inquiries, and went directly to the prisoner's house in the Curtain-road—he was then at his solicitor's—I saw the deals in his passage, and the oak-staves in the court—the reglets are made from them, and we had missed staves, which were bought through the medium of the prisoner—he said he knew where there was a lot of staves to be sold—they were, perhaps, more than we should want, but they would do well to season: and he had the money to pay for them—I did not find any reglets, but I have seen some since, belonging to Wood and Sherwood—he had not been at work on the deal boards at all, and he had no authority to take them—he certainly had no authority to take a van at eight o'clock in the morning, and carry those things away.</p>

I found the prisoner there—he put the wood and things into the van as fast as he could—I never knew the van loaded so quickly—a little boy brought them out, and the prisoner put them into the van—I said to him, "I can't load them so fast as this"—he said, "It don't make no matter, they are not going far"—when it was loaded, he told me to go on round the corner—he went on with me to the corner of Crown-street, and we had a drop of something there—I then went on, as he told me, to No. 86, Curtain-road—we then unloaded the van as quick as we could—he put some of the things in the yard, and some in the passage, I believe, but I was in the van all the time—he then paid me—I told my master where I had been, and said I thought he appeared very hasty—I have brought the articles here in the van.</p>

On the morning of the 18th of February, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 86, Curtain-road—I found twenty-nine deal boards there—this piece of mahogany was given to me by Mr. Wood—Fitall pointed out the reglets to me—I found the ruling-machines—they are all in the van down stairs—the prisoner came in while I was waiting for the van—I told him he was charged with fe<lb/>lony—he said, "What for?"—I told him for stealing those planks and staves from Mr. Wood—he said, "Mr. Wood! what does he mean by that? I think I shall indict him, and you too"—I told him he was in my cus<lb/>tody—"O, I am not going to run away," said he; he was walking up and down the room, but all at once I missed him—I saw him going out at the back door—I went into the yard, but could not see any thing of him—I saw there was a stand against the wall, with some dirt on it—I could not find him till about seven o'clock the same evening, when he was in the Baker and Basket, in Worship-street—I desired him to come into my custody, and told him he should not get away that time—he said he should not come out—I sent the landlord to get two persons to assist me, and we took the prisoner—I found on him these invoices.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hatton, in Middlesex, near Hounslow, and carry on the bone-cutting business. I was in town on Tuesday, the 20th of January, near Smithfield, at the corner of St. John-street—I met the pri<lb/>soner there—I never saw him before—he was alone—it was about two o'clock, or a little after—he asked me if that was Smithfield, pointing to Smithfield—I said it was—he asked me on what day the beast market was, and said he had come out of Lancashire to see his sister, and should like to know what day the market was held, that he might tell the conntrymen when he went back what day to bring their beasts there—he began con<lb/>versing about the price of corn, and asked me to go and take a pint of ale—I had told him I had come from the country myself—we went into the Rose, and in a few minutes another man came in, who said he had come from Gloucestershire on some law business, and he had above £1500 come to him—he showed some papers, like notes in his hand—the prisoner told me to persuade him to keep his money close and not expose it; he said, as he was a near countryman of mine, he would be persuaded by me more than him—I persuaded him not to expose his money in company, and soon after the prisoner said he had some paper, and he had better wrap up his money, and put it in his fob—he pulled some paper out of his pocket, and gave it to the other to wrap up his money—he wrapped it up, and then the prisoner said he would wrap up his own money—then he asked me to put it into his fob-pocket for him—he had got no watch—I pushed it into his fob for him—he then gave me a bit of paper to wrap mine up—I pulled my purse out, and was folding it—just as I had folded over one fold, he snatched it out of my hand, and said, "Let me do it for you"—I had shown my money to him before that—he saw the size of my purse—I had eleven sovereigns in it—I had counted them not half an hour before, and I am sure it had eleven sovereigns in it—after taking it out of my hand he wrapped it up, as I thought, gave me back the paper, and told me to put it into my fob—I said I had not got one, and put it in my side-pocket—I did not know but I had got my purse and money—it was in his pos<lb/>session not a minute, I think—I supposed I had got my purse and sove<lb/>reigns in the paper—the prisoner then said, "We will go now"—(this was within two minutes) and we went out together, and then parted just about where we had met—I was going to Wormwood-street, and turned back and left him at the corner of St. John-street—in about two minutes I pulled the paper out of my pocket, and examined it—I found in it instead of eleven sovereigns nine halfpence, and there was no purse—I had not been in company with any body but them, after they gave me the paper—I went to the public-house to see if the other man was there, but he was gone—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Drury-lane, and am a whole<lb/>sale stationer, in partnership with Thomas Spalding and two others—we are in the habit of supplying Walter McDowall with paper. On the 25th of February, about half-past six in the evening, this request for goods was brought to me, in his name, by Wooddard—I asked him if he was to pay for the paper—I showed the order to my brother—it says, "No. 4, Pem<lb/>berton-row, Gough-square. Gentlemen, please let the bearer have four reams of printing royal, perfect, for Mr. Anderton. Your obedient ser<lb/>vant,—W. McDowall." My brother told Wooddard he must fetch a sample of the paper wanted—he went away—my brother kept the order—he came again in about an hour afterwards, and brought half a sheet of</p>

               <p>paper as a sample—my brother saw him then—I saw him, but did not hear what passed—next morning he brought an order to my brother (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this is it—Wooddard said, "I think there is something wrong, and you seem to think so too, Sir"—this order says, "Mr. Ander<lb/>ton says you refuse sending him the paper ordered yesterday, as he has no account, it is for my use; I hope my name and credit is sufficient for you to furnish the order.—Mr. McDowall."</p>

On the morning of the 5th of February, the prisoner came to my house, the Coach and Horses, in Whitechapel, between five and six o'clock—it was after four o'clock—I do not open till four o'clock—it might be between four and five o'clock—it was very soon after I opened—he came in with three or four more, without shoes or stockings on; but that I did not notice for an hour and a half after—he had a silk handkerchief round his neck, and a coat on—I do not think he had a shirt on—I was informed he had neither shoes nor stockings on—I went and ex<lb/>amined, and found it was so, and turned him out—I had drawn him some gin, and he asked me to change a sovereign—I gave him change—I saw another sovereign in his hand, which he asked me to change afterwards, and I refused—I did not see him afterwards—he came in with Foster, or nearly at the same time—several porters and people were in the room—</p>

               <p>he offered a dirty yellow handkerchief for sale, and I believe Foster gave him one shilling for it—there was a hole in it—I do not think there was any red on it, but it was at a distance from me—I live three hundred yards from Essex-court.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter, and live with him and my mother—my brother did live at home some time ago—he is now in Horsemonger-Jane gaol—I think he is twenty-two years of age—he carried on the cab-business—I recollect his bringing some harness to my father's premises, about the middle of January—he put it down in the room, and asked my mother if he could leave it until such time as he could get a horse to commence the cab-business on his own account—she said, he might—my father was from home at that time—the harness taken away by the constable is what my brother left—my brother came home three weeks or a month ago, and asked me about my father's duplicates; and he gave me a duplicate to put into the book or the drawer, and I put it in the drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Elias Moses, we live in the Minories, and are slop-sellers. I have known the prisoner as a customer—we had dealings with him, and I had no doubt of his respectability till about a month since, when my suspicions were excited by something I had heard—on Monday, the 2nd of March, the prisoner came to our house in a chaise, about six o'clock—it was dark—he went up into the back ware house with me—he came for a waistcoat, which had been ordered on Friday by some person belonging to him—I told him it was ready—he then said, "I want some velveteen coatees"—I waited upon him—there was a boy, named Coleman, in the room, and he handed the coatees to me—the prisoner selected three of them—he then said, "You have some very nice, or very handsome, spring waistcoats, I will look at them, but I shall not be a buyer at the present time"—I showed them to him—he selected some, and they were put with the coatees in a place under the counter—he purchased those waistcoats and the coatees—he then remarked that he would take the goods with him—that was after they had been put into the receiving-place under the counter, and I supposed he had finished—I then placed them on the counter again—he then saw another waistcoat, which he said was a very nice one, and selected that—he then said, "No doubt you have more like them;" and I went to the glass-case at the end of the room to see whether I had—I turned round, and saw the prisoner had left the part where he had been standing, and seemed very much confused—he had his</p>

               <p>hands down about his pockets—I then asked him whether he would walk up stairs to another room—he said, "No"—he went down, and I followed him—the bundle was left on the counter for his man to take down; but he went into another room down stairs to look at some hats—he said, "I want some hats, but I do not expect you have any which will suit me"—I said he had better look at them—from there he went into the front ware-house, and Mr. Fox was desired to fetch down the goods the prisoner had bought—I was agitated by my suspicion—Mr. Fox brought down the goods loose on his shoulder—they were put on the counter, and Fox en<lb/>tered them in the book—Fox then came down from the desk—I took his place to have the goods booked; and I took the opportunity of speaking to my clerk in a way that the prisoner should not hear, though he was just under the pulpit-desk—the prisoner appeared very much agitated as well as myself; and he looked at me very hard from the time of my coming down stairs—he then said, "I shall go to Christopher, and you can give the parcel to my lad in the gig at the door"—he then left—I sent Fox after him, who brought him back; and Fox said, "I have found this on Mr. Butcher," at the same time showing me a waistcoat which I had not shown to the prisoner—he said, "Good God!"—I made some remark, and I went into the counting-house with him and Fox—I then made some re<lb/>mark on the enormity of the case—I cannot express the words I used, and forget the answer he made—I then said, "Have you any more, Sir?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Will you allow me to feel?"—he said, "Certainly"—I then put my hand into his outside pocket, and drew out a dark waistcoat—those he had selected were light ones—I said, "Good God! Butcher, I never should have thought it"—he then, said, "Oh, Moses, pray do not go into the case," or words to that effect—he begged to see me in private—we went into a side passage adjoining the private house—he then told me he would make every restitution if I would forego, and not do any tiling in this case—he said he would deal with me and pay up if I would not do any thing—I sent for the policeman, who came into the counting-house with me—the prisoner was then in the warehouse; and before I could relate the case to the policeman, I saw a confusion, and it appeared that the prisoner had left the warehouse, and Mr. Fox also—the prisoner was pursued and taken.</p>

               <p>me, and giving me his custom—I did not tell the conversation that my traveller had, as I thought it was of no importance, before the Lord Mayor—I mean the report he brought from Brentford—the prisoner begged to see me privately—I do not know that I stated that before the Lord Mayor—I do not know whether these words were read over to me in my deposi<lb/>tion; or that I mentioned that the prisoner said, "Oh Moses, pray do not go into this"—perhaps I did not—I did not think there was any occasion to say that he wished to see me in private, and that we went into the pas<lb/>sage—I believe I did not state that I said, "Good God! Butcher, I should never have thought it"—it is most likely I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say now, you said to him, "Good God!

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say when Fox returned with Mr. Butcher, he produced a waist<lb/>coat, which he said he found on Butcher, and Butcher said, "Good God!" and went into the counting-house—did you say that to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I expect I did—I believe I did—I cannot recollect every word that was read over to me—I expect that was read to me—I think I heard that—the book that these things were entered in is not here, nor are the articles he bought—I was agitated by my suspicion—that would not assist my memory, certainly—I do not know that I told the Magistrate I was agitated by my suspicions—I did not state that I went to the glass case, before the Magistrate—I said I went to the end of the room, which is where the glass case is situated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever told any body that if they would bring you 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the next morning, you would not prosecute? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir—I never have—I never told any woman so—I have never seen any woman upon the subject of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen any woman upon the subject of this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—yes, yes—will you allow me?—it was the following morning after the robbery—money was not the subject of conversation—not a syllable passed my lips about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was not any money mentioned at all—I went into a private room with her, at her request—she is the woman who lives with Mr. Butcher as his wife, though she is not his wife—I retired with her to the same room that Mr. Butcher had been in, on account of her feelings—I have heard since that she is not his wife—nothing passed from me on the subject of money—such a sum as 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not mentioned by me—I am rather surprised you should ask me such a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon the sacred obligation of the oath you have taken, and as you hope for forgiveness hereafter, did you say any thing about money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know what an oath is—I did not—I do not believe I said any thing about hats before the Magistrate—I thought I would relate the particulars here—I believe the prisoner is a man of property—he had dealt about three years with me, but I suppose he had not laid out more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>with me—I gave him credit—there was some money found on him, and some notes, but I was not there—my foreman said it was about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that I asked how much there was—I asked if it was Butcher's money—I saw it on the desk, or on a table, and the inspector was sitting by it, at the station—I did not touch it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be so good as to give us your version about the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the back warehouse—one of my young men came in, and said, "Mr. Moses, there is the young man in the gig that was here last night, and a female"—I said, "You had better deny me," and I was going up stairs, but she came in, following the young man, before I could get out of sight—she saw me, and said, "Where is Mr. Moses?"—I said my name was Moses—she then asked for my father—I said he was not at home, he does not live in London—she said, "It is a person with spectacles"—I said, "Then you must mean Moses and Levy, because that Mr. Moses wears spectacles"—she then said, "Oh, Mr. Moses," or to that effect, and took me into the side-room, as she was ashamed to be seen—she then said, "Good God! I have not slept all night; I have been either in hysterics or fits till five o'clock"—she said, "Dear Mr. Moses, pray do not appear against him," and she laid hold of my shoulder—after using many expres<lb/>sions, which I cannot recollect, she said, "Can I see Mrs. Moses, to work on her feelings?"—I told her she could not, as she was confined—she beg<lb/>ged and prayed in that manner that I could not get away—she said, "Will you not appear? pray do not appear"—she said she would give half she possessed if I would not appear, and she broke a smelling-bottle in her re<lb/>ticule <hi rend="italic">with her words and actions</hi>—she then turned out her reticule, and left the glass on the counter, and begged my pardon for doing so—she still begged and prayed of me not to appear—I told her if it had been his first offence I might have overlooked it, but I certainly should go on—she then said, "Where is Butcher?"—I told her I believed he was at the Compter, but I would inquire, for I did not know—she said, "Oh pray do not, for I am ashamed to be seen"—she then said her man would take her there—she then said, "I am ashamed to go through, is there any one there?"—I opened the door, Mr. Solomon was coming through, and I told him to go back—I then told her there was no one there but a boy, and she went out—that was all that passed, except that I said, I would consider of it—there was never any offer to compromise on either part, but she merely making the remark that she would give half she possessed—nothing was said about £100 a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon the sacred obligation of your oath, did any thing pass at any time—at any place—or from any body—in your hearing, about £100 a year for four years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—this is not the first I have heard of it—Mr. Hobler asked me whether I had offered to compromise it for £400—I denied it, and treated it with contempt, as I do the re<lb/>marks that you are making—there was no offer to compromise on her part or mine—what passed with her was before the examination before the Magistrate—I do not recollect every word that passed with her—I mean nothing unfair against this prisoner—I heard the woman who called on me was not his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Moses. On the 2nd of March Mr. Butcher came there—I saw him come from the back warehouse—my employer desired me to fetch the goods which he had selected, for the purpose of being entered—I did so, and placed them on the counter in the front warehouse—they were there entered, and in the course of their being entered, Mr. Moses indicated by his countenance that there was something wrong relative to Mr. Butcher, and I noticed the prisoner—he said, "Put up these goods, and give them to my young man, who is about the door in the chaise"—he then went out—I was desired by my employer to follow him, which I did—I came up to him, and said, "Have you not, Sir, by some mistake or other, got into your possession some waistcoats that are not yours?"—he said, "Certainly not, it is impossible, I think, but I will try"—upon which he put his hand iuto his great-coat pocket, and drew out a waistcoat, which I immediately recognised as the property of my employer—I said, "Mr. Butcher, this is a serious thing, and a most unaccountable one to me"—he said, "I did not take it with a felo<lb/>nious intent"—I said, "Have you any more, Sir?"—he said, "Certainly not," and felt about his pockets—he said, "To convince you I had no felonious intention, I will go back with you to Mr. Moses"—we then returned together—Mr. Moses opened the warehouse door—the prisoner went in, and said, with considerable agitation, "Sir, I am ashamed to see you"—Mr. Moses was about to make an observation, and he said, "For goodness' sake do not stay here, let us go into the counting-house"—we then went into the counting-house—I presented the waistcoat which the prisoner had given to me when I questioned him—I showed it to Mr. Moses and said, "This waistcoat was produced by Mr. Butcher upon being questioned whether he had not concealed some about him"—Mr. Moses expressed himself very much surprised, and said, "Good God! Butcher, how is this? have you any more, Sir?"—he replied, "Certainly not"—the prosecutor then asked him to allow him to feel, and he felt in his great-coat pocket, and drew out another waistcoat—he said, "This is a serious thing; how in the world, Butcher, could you have done so?" or words to that effect—the prisoner replied, "For God's sake, Mr. Moses, do not take any notice of it, I will make any reparation or restitution you can desire"—several other things were then said, and the prosecutor left the counting-house, to consider what he should do—Mr. Butcher then said to me, "Mr. Fox, interest yourself for me—do all you possibly can—endeavour to prevail with Mr. Moses not to proceed with it, and gratitude will prompt me not to forget you"—I think I said, "How can I, Mr. Butcher, interest myself in a case like this?"—Mr. Moses returned to the counting-house, and the officer was sent for—Mr. Butcher saw him arrive, and he left the warehouse in haste, and ran when he got out—I had to run with all my might, shouting, "Stop thief," and he was taken.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course you could not forget that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it has been out of my mind since—I do not recollect whether I said that before the Lord Mayor—the substance of what I said was taken down—I do not remember Mr. Hobler asking me if I had any thing to add, but I sug<lb/>gested additions which were willingly made—I think most likely there was nothing in my deposition of his saying that gratitude would prompt him never to forget me—it did not occur to my mind to have that added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not sworn to tell the whole truth—all that passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, "Certainly not"—I have no recollection that the Lord Mayor told me to relate in the presence of the prisoner all that passed—It is possi<lb/>ble I may be wrong—I think I did not tett the Lord Mayor that I was left with the prisoner alone—I do not remember stating that the prosecutor said, "This is a serious thing, Mr. Butcher; how in the world could you have done so?"—I think I said in substance that Batcher replied, "For God's sake, Mr. Moses, say nothing about it; I will make any restitution you can desire."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say the prosecutor indicated by his countenance, that there was something wrong with respect to Mr. Butcher—did you tell that to the Lord Mayor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I feel positive of it—I think It was not read over to me—I did not ask to have it added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would two waistcoats make a large bulk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not if they were closely tied up—I recollect Mr. Moses taking out the second waistcoat—I think it was in his great-coat pocket, but I was on his right hand side, and Mr. Moses on his left—I cannot tell exactly which pocket it was—the one he gave me was in his outside pocket—I walked by his side when be came back—I looked sharp after him—I did not ses any waistcoat in his pocket—I should say his pocket was open at the top, but I saw no waistcoat on the side I walked—the one the prisoner gave me was a dark waistcoat, a green ground—the one Moses took from him was a light one—I am sure I did not take the light one, and he the dark one—the light one was of the same kind and pattern which he had bought—he bought ten altogether, I believe—he is a pawnbroker, and has two establishments—he buys these things for sale of us—these two waistcoats were worth about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we should have sold them for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found on the prisoner when he was searched at the station-house—I was present—Mr. Moses came in about fifteen minutes—the money was counted, and I believe given to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Butcher say, "It was quite an accident?"—I think he said, as near as possible, "It must be an accident"—he seemed to be agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said, "He said he did not take it with a felonious in<lb/>tent;" was it at that time he said it must be an accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; should say, that "It must be accident," was said first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live in Regent-street, Kennington-cross. I was eighteen years old last October—on the 2nd of December, 1883, I went to live with the prisoner as porter, to carry out parcels, in Leadenhall-street—I slept in the house afterwards—I remember the prisoner coming to live at the house in Leadenhall-street—he carried on business in Basinghall-street before—some time after that I became pattern-card-maker and shop<lb/>man—he was a woollen-draper—one evening, after the shop was shut, I went to the prisoner's desk—it was about the month of April—he called to me after the shop was shut, and said, "John, as my clerk is out, I must make you clerk to-night," and then wrote across a piece of paper the name of Joyce or Rice, and desired me to copy it across two blank stamps, which I did—he said nothing more about it—about six weeks or two months af<lb/>terwards, after the shop was shut, he called me again, and wrote the name of Joyce or Rice, and desired me to write it—I wrote this "C. Still," across this bill by command of the prisoner, about the month of September, and about eleven o'clock in the day—he took me up into the drawing-room, shut the door, and desired me to sit down till he was ready for me—I be<lb/>lieve he locked the door—I sat down—in about five minutes he produced two blank stamps, one of them a printed one, which is this one—he wrote across a slip of paper "C. Still," and desired me to copy it across the two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020138"/>
               <p>blank stamps, which I did—one of them is the one produced—he said nothing to me after I had done it—this is the one which had printing on it, and I am certain that the other was not printed—there was no writing on it whatever, except "C. Still," which I wrote by his direction—on the Sunday following, I mentioned this at home—I believe the house of Bentley and Co. had not failed at that time—there was a person in the prisoner's employ named Jeremiah Mitchell—in consequence of what I heard of the transaction of Bentley and Co., I mentioned this transaction to Mitchell—up to that time I knew nothing of the nature of accommodation bills—I have frequently seen the prisoner write—the filling up of the body of this bill I firmly believe to be his handwriting.</p>

Maxwell, Esq., Turnham-green, Middlesex—I asked her who Mr. Maxwell was—she said he was a most respectable man, living on Turnham-green, on his property; a man of independent property; that she had done business with him; supplied him with goods, and also his son with goods, and she took that bill in part payment of goods supplied to him—I let her have the linen—the bill was paid over to Williams and Hill—the prisoner at that time lived at No. 3, Jermyn-street, Piccadilly, where the bill was made payable—on the 13th of January it was due, and returned to us as dishonoured.</p>

I have got none but my own"—he then put down four shillings, a sixpence, a bad shilling, and a half-crown—the half-crown and two of the shillings were marked—I then gave him in charge—I went and counted the shillings—I missed two—the sovereign we could not find—we sup<lb/>pose he had it in his mouth—the officer searched him, and a key dropped from him, which fitted my bureau—the prisoner said it was his key.</p>

The prisoner came there, on the 25th of January, with some fowls—I took one of them up to mistress—she said she would have one, and sent a sovereign down by me to pay for it—the prisoner said he had no change—he went with the sovereign for change, and never came back—I am sure he is the man—I saw him again in Newgate-market, and gave charge of him.</p>

I have known the prisoner since May, or the commencement of June, when he came from Birmingham—I have had opportunities of seeing him from that time, and consider him insane, in the most lucid interval that he had—on the 5th or 6th of October I was called in at the request of his brother, and found him in a state of lunacy, delirious—I have observed that more par<lb/>ticularly when he has had any thing to drink—from one to two glasses would have that effect on him—I have observed him when not under the influence of liquor, and have observed incoherency, or want of connexion of ideas, and want of memory—I considered him partially unsound in mind at that period.</p>

               <p>not conceive how any body could get to the shed, because the gates were always locked, and found still locked—after I received this information, I examined the premises—I found three small boards taken down between my shed and the adjoining shed, which is full of wood and bricks—there is a door from that shed into the adjoining yard—I found the staple of that door drawn, by which, I suppose, the prisoner got through the door, then through the partition into the loft, and put the hay out into the yard—he could then bolt the door after him, and return to where the hay was—I should not then know how any body had got in—the prisoner had no right in my shed—the yard is not mine—it belongs to Mr. Reed, at the pub<lb/>lic house—this happened at nearly seven o'clock at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Captain in the Royal Artillery, quartered at Woolwich. On Saturday night, the 21st of February, between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was in a street in Woolwich, which I do not know the name of, returning to my quarters—I was accosted by a man in the undress of the Marine Corps, who instantly knocked my hat off my head—I only observed one man at that moment—I was rolled up in my cloak, and in raising my arms to protect myself, or to save my hat, I fell, and at that time I saw two men, the one who knocked my hat off, and another man close behind—they both ran off—in about a minute, I saw the watchman, who asked if I had been ill-treated—I said I had—he said, if I would remain where I was, he would go in pursuit, and in a short time he returned with the hat, and said, "Do you intend to proceed against the parties?"—I said, "Certainly," and I gave him my address—I could not tell who the men were, but I noticed one was in the dress of a marine, and the other had a red jacket and a foraging cap on—I saw the prisoners, on the Friday following, in the Court at Woolwich, but I could not say whether they were the men I had seen that night, or not—at the time my hat was taken off, the man made some casual remark about the night, but I paid very little attention to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a parish watchman of Woolwich. I was on duty in Coleman-street that night, about a quarter to twelve o'clock—I saw three marines coming down Coleman-street—the prisoners were two of them—Wood had something which he was wrapping up in a black silk handkerchief—I saw it was this hat, and I asked where he got it—Rigby made the reply, "We found it"—I said, "I suppose you have picked it up to-night, in some of the fights between the civilians and the soldiers"—he said, "No," calling God to witness, "we found it"—I took it, and said to them, "If you come to the watch-house to-morrow night, if I do not find the owner, you shall have it"—in a minute or two, I saw the prosecutor with his cloak on, without his hat—I spoke to him, and I and my brother watchman went after the men—I saw Inch coming down the street with Rigby, and I said, "This is the man, where are the other par<lb/>ties?"—Rigby said, "I know nothing about them, I have just come from Deptford"—he was then taken to the watch-house, and the next morning,</p>

               <p>at six o'clock, he was brought out of the cell—he then stated, that two marines came after him in Coleman-street, and said, "We have got a hat," and he said to them, "Where did you get it?"—they said, "From a gen<lb/>tleman's head," and he said to them, "You have acted very wrong"—I then went to the adjutant, and, by his permission, I went on the parade, and saw the marines, but there were many absent—I went again the next day, and those who had been absent on Sunday were paraded before me, and I picked out Wood—I have no doubt whatever of his being the person—this is the hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, of Woolwich. I was with the last witness, and saw the three marines coming down Coleman-street—Wood had this hat, and was tying it up in a black silk handkerchief—Rigby was with him—I ran after him, and took him near the barracks—he said he was very willing to go with me—when we first met them, Rigby said they had found the hat, and there being so many fights at Mr. James's, the King's Arms, we thought they had found it there—when I ran after Rigby, I took him by the corner of the barracks—I asked him if his name was Rigby—he bad told us his name when we first met him—he said, "No—this was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after we first met them—I am quite sure he said his name was not Rigby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Newman. I live in King's Bench-walk, St. George's—we keep cows—on the 20th of December, the two prisoners called at my husband's house—he was not in town—it was between ten and eleven o'clock—they asked me if I had any cows to sell—I said I had three cows to sell, and I did not care which of them I sold—both asked me if they could see them—I said they were in the shed, and they could see them if they liked—I and my son went into the shed with them, and showed them eight cows—they examined two or three, and asked me the price of the first two—I told them 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they were in calf—they said they could feel no calf in them—they left them, and walked to the cow in question—Gorken said, "I can feel a calf in this—a good big calf," and said to Eld ridge, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, go you up and feel her"—I had seen Gorken in the market, for about six months before, but had never spoken to him before—Eldridge said he could feel the calf, and asked me the price—I told him I could not take less than 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—Gorken called me out into the yard, and said, if I sold the cow to Eldridge I should sell her to a good customer, and I should be sure of the money when I delivered her—we walked back into the shed, and Eldridge said, "I will give you 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said I could not take 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her—they went aside, and talked together, then came back again and asked if I would take 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said I would not—we all four walked out of the shed together—I and my son followed them out into the yard—I thought they were going into the street, and wished them good morning—I went in<lb/>doors—my son called me out again, and Eldridge said he would givt me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would take it—Gorken stood under the gate, about ten yards from him—I cannot say whether he could hear what Eldridge said—Eldridge asked if I could let my son take the cow up to his place—my son said, "I do not know where you live"—he asked him if he knew Kennington-lane—my son said he did—he told him to bring her to Ken<lb/>nington-lane, at four o'clock, and he would meet him—he then went away—he told me three or four times that he would pay me—he said, when my son delivered the cow, he would return the money back to me for it at the time—he said that in the shed—he said he would send the money back—Eldridge then left the yard—he came back in about two minutes, knocked at the street door, and said he had altered his mind, and if I would let him bring the cow in the course of half an hour to Kenniogton-lane, he would meet him there—he said, "I will return the money back by your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020175"/>
               <p>son for you"—I sent my son with the cow in about ten minutes, and di<lb/>rected him what to do, and expected him to bring back either the cow or the money—he was not to part with the cow without the money—I gave him those directions in the presence of both the prisoners—my son was absent about two hours, and then returned with the cow—Gorken came again between six and seven o'clock in the evening—it was dark then—Gorken asked if we had been with the cow—my son said he had, and that nobody came to him—Gorken said, "Well, it is all right, I am going to the place now; bring the cow with me, and I will help you to drive her to the place"—before they went away I said to my son, in Gorken's presence, "Do not you leave the cow without the money"—Gorken turned round and said, "When your son delivers the cow he will receive the money, you may be sure"—he said the money was as sure as the Bank of Eng<lb/>land—my son, and Gorken, and the cow all three went away together—when my son returned about nine o'clock, he had neither cow nor money—I have never had either since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's son. The prisoners came on the 25th of December—nothing was said about the cow being for Saps<lb/>worth—the prisoners were both present when the price was mentioned—it was mentioned once or twice—they must both have heard the whole conversation—I went with the cow to Kennington-lane—I was not to leave it till I obtained the money—I got there between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—I inquired at several houses, and waited in the lane with the cow nearly two hours—I was not to take it to any parti<lb/>cular part of the Jane—the lane is about one-eighth of a mile long—a person cannot see from one end to the other, as there is a turning—I saw nobody, and came back with it—I was at home when Gorken came, about six o'clock—it was dark then—Gorken said, "Have you been with the cow?"—I said I had taken her, but could find nobody there, and had brought her back—he said, "If you will come along with me now, I will go with you and show you the place"—my mother said to me, "Mind, do not leave it without the money, either bring back the cow or money"—Gorken turned round and said, "The money is as sure as the Bank of England"—I went to Kennington-lane with him—he took me to Eldridge's house, just through Vauxhall-gate—I saw Eldridge directly we got there—Gorken went on a little before me to the house, and both came back to me together, and Gorken said, "There is the cow;" and said to me, "Help Eldridge to drive her into the yard," and then I could have the money—Eldridge said, "Drive her in," but before that, Gorken said, "I must go, you can drive her into the yard, and then you can have the money"—he then went away, leaving me with Eldridge—we both drove her into the yard—Eldridge and a young lad in the yard tied the cow up—we came out of the yard—there is a public-house nearly opposite his house—he said, "Go into the public-house, and I will come to you in five minutes, and pay you the money"—I waited at the corner of the lane opposite the public-house door, and then I went into the parlour of the public-house—Eldridge came in and called for a pot of ale—we sat there drinking it—he said nothing, and I said nothing—we were there five or ten minutes—then a man named Sapsford (I knew him before, but never spoke above a dozen words with him in my life) came in, and sat down a little while between me and Eldridge, drinking—Sapsford swore and said, "Is your father come home yet?"—I said, "No, he is not,"—he then said, "Eldridge has bought this cow for me; there is a little difference between your father and me, and here is the balance of the money"—I said I did not know any thing at all about it—I had not sold him the cow—I had sold Eldridge the cow, and looked to him for the money—he said, "It is no odds, the cow was bought for me, and here is the difference"—I said I would not leave the cow without the money—I would either have the cow or money—Eldridge was present—I could not take the cow away, for Sapsford said if I touched a bolt or gate belonging to him, he would have me punished—I went to the gate, but I could not get it away—the gates were secured—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Union Hall. I apprehended both the prisoners on a certificate of the indictment—I took one in the Borough and the other at Brixton—I had been looking for them about ten days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eldridge's Defence.</hi> I was engaged by Sapsford to go and buy two cows for him—Gorken came to my house with Sapsford, and asked at what time I would go with him to Newman's to look at the cow—I said, "About ten o'clock in the morning"—I met Gorken, and went to Newman's—I handled several cows—I found this cow suitable for my master, who had eleven or twelve cows in full milk—I agreed to give 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told him to send it to the Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall-gate, that I should be there, and would go with him with the cow; instead of which it never came home till eleven o'clock at night to my master's place—I said to Newman, "I thought you were not going to send it"—he said, "I could not find the place "—it was then tied up—I told him to go to the Elephant and Castle, I would come to him, and to call for a pint of beer—he says he could see the gate from the door; but there is a turning off about fifty yards directly away from the cow-shed—he could not see it fifty yards from the public-house door—when master came to him, he said, "You know there is a little difference between your father and me, and here is the difference out of the account," and tendered him the money—he said he would go and ask his mother—he said nothing to me about taking the cow with him; but</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gorken's Defence.</hi> I sold two cows for Newman a long time ago, and paid the money—she came to me several times, and asked me to send her customers for her cows, for she wanted to sell all her things—I said I un<lb/>derstood she had engaged with a person named Bartram to sell her things, I did not wish to interrupt him in the business—she said she wished me to send her customers at home, she would sooner do it than expose them at market—her son and her afterwards took me to a public-house and treated me with gin, to get me down to look at the cows—a week afterwards she pressed me to sell them—I asked Sapsford if he wanted any cows, not knowing there was any business transaction between them—Sapsford said he was not well enough to go himself, as he had broke three blood-vessels, but would send a man to buy a cow—he sent me to fetch his man—he said to him, "Now, to-morrow morning, (Gorken will go with you,) go and look at Newman's cows, and if you see one worth the money, take it, send it home, and we can settle with them for it"—I took the man as a customer, and told her I had no doubt she would have the money—at last the man agreed with her for the cow—they were to send it home to the Elephant and Castle, Upper Kennington-lane—instead of taking it there, they took it to the Elephant and Castle, Newington, and could not find Eldridge, and brought it home—in the evening, as I was going that way, I went to her door—she said they had taken it to the Elephant and Castle, Newington—I said it was Upper Kennington-lane, and any body knew Mrs. Eldridge and her son, as she was an independent person—she asked me to show them where the place was—I said I would; and said I should be glad of the commission to take home to my family—I went with the son; on going up Kennington-lane, he said to me, "Why, a man named Sapsford lives up this lane"—I said, "Yes; I know him very well"—he said, "Yes; so do I know him; my father owed him for some grains, but he must look very sharp for it, for he will never pay him"—I took him to the shed, and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. Eldridge was my cow-keeper—I have had dealings with Newman's father for grains—I have not seen him for the last five or six months—I met Newman and Eldridge at the Elephant and Castle—I had a bill against Newman's father—I went home and fetched the bills—I tendered him the difference, which was six guineas and fourpence halfpenny—the money was put on the table before him, and also the bills—he said, after he looked round, that he should not look to me for it at all—when he found I did not offer him the full amount, he said he should look to Eldridge—I told him I had been many times to his house after the money, and the last time but one that I went, Mrs. Newman told me her husband was gone away and had taken the money away, and she did not mean to pay his debts—I asked young Newman if that was the case—he said that he did not mean to pay his father's debts—I spoke to him about the balance his father owed me, ten times before this occurrence—he owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cow is in my place now—Eldridge had no property in the cow whatever.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell young Newman, when he came with the cow, if he dared to touch the cow or the place you would make him suffer for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nothing of the kind—I used no violence to him—I told him they had gives me a great deal of trouble after the money—I considered it only a fair bargain—I have had the cow ever since—the gates are open all day—I did not shut them before the boy went away—I went to the public-house when I was sent for—Newman or Eldridge sent for me—I did not desire the boy to go in and drink—I swear the boy did not demand to have the cow back, and I refuse—he said he would have the full amount, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I did not place the full money before him he said he would not deal with me for it—nobody demanded the cow—he did not say he would not go away without the cow or the money—he went away contented—he might have had the cow if he chose—I did not stop it—he might have had the full amount of money—they applied for it afterwards to Mrs. Eldridge, but not to me—if he had come for it, or any body had applied for it, he might have had the cow or the money—I will deliver it to the constable now, if you please—Mrs. Eldridge was applied to for the money, and she referred them to me—if they had come for the cow or money, they might have had either.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stockwell. On the Thursday previous to the 14th of February, I went into the City—I was returning over Lon<lb/>don-bridge, and saw a countryman, as I thought—he said a bad misfortune had happened in the country to his family—that one of his brothers had stolen some money out of his father's box, and he had come to look for him, that his father was gone one way and his brother another—but he found he was gone to America, and had taken the money with him—I was very faint—he said he was going to have a drop of beer—I said, "I am going to have a pint of beer"—we went into a <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop, as they call it, and had two pints of ale—then, in came another man—I had no knowledge of him—I wanted to go, and got up, but was taken very poorly, and was obliged to call at a place for my convenience—they both came out with me, and went into the King's Head, between the Elephant and Castle and the turnpike—I went into the parlour, and the other man said he had dropped into a good thing—I cannot say these are the men, for I had very <hi rend="italic">little look at them</hi> when I was in their company, and I said all I knew about them at Union-Hall—I think it was the biggest one said tome, "I have dropped into a good thing—somebody has come and told me that an estate I worked on was my father's, and it came to my eldest brother, but I find my mother was not married till after he was born"—that he had come to London, and the lawyers had supplied him with plenty of money, and he was sure to have it, though his brother had had it fifteen years—I said, "Let him have half of it"—he said, "No, I will not"—he said, "I have a handful of Bank-notes;" and then he said, "Any body who can show me a sovereign I will let him have half-a-sovereign"—the other pulled out his bag, and I, fool-like, pulled out mine, with fifteen sovereigns and some silver in it—I put it down—he said, "I will put it up for you into your pocket," and he pretended to put it into a paper, as I thought, but he put halfpence into it instead—I was a little fresh—I did not take much notice—we had had two shillings' worth of brandy-and-water, and came out—a policeman came up to me, and said, "Have you lost any thing?"—I found my watch safe, and my sovereigns, as I thought, and said, "I have lost nothing"—I went to the Elephant and Castle to get an omnibus—the policeman said, "You must go to the watch-house with me," and I pulled out the paper of money, and there was only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—two men afterwards came and brought me the money back again—I never saw those two men before, nor since—I cannot swear to the prisoners, for I took so little notice of them—there were not more than two men in my company, and two men brought me the money back—I lost my money at the King's Head—the same men were at the King's Head with me that I saw at the Bridge Tavern beer-shop—I saw no other man that I know of—I have not got quite all my money back—I think I went to the Globe public-house with them—I went into a house in the Borough when I was unwell—I was not drunk—I had nobody with me at all, only the two men—I cannot say whether the prisoners are the men.</p>
