                  </hi>. I live at 80, Addison Gardens, Kensington—I had some means, which I wished to use in business—I answered an advertisement of the prisoner's, and after negotiations with him I entered into an agreement with him, dated April 18th, 1899—I was to be employed by him at a fixed salary of £10 a month, and I was to have a return of the profits, for advancing him £500—it was agreed that this should not make a partnership between us, but I had the right to enter into partnership at the end of five years from April 1st, 1899—my salary was paid down to July, but I have heard nothing of the £500, which I paid to the prisoner by cheque—when I first went there he used to come to the office at 2, Talbot Court, Gracechurch Street—he and I occupied the inner room, and the clerks the outer room—I last saw him at the office on August 25th—I had a good many letters from him after that from District Messenger offices and other places, but no addresses, and generally no date—I could not answer them—I tried to find him a good many times, but failed—I had communications coming to me about dishonoured cheques—the prisoner had a key to the office, and could let himself in when he liked—on September 13th I purchased a japanned deed-box, about 13 in by 9 in.—I kept the key—I put into it two share certificates for 100 East Rand</p>

I live at Lower Clapton, and am errand boy to a stockbroker—on January 22nd a little after 1 o'clock, I was in Warn<lb/>ford Court, on an errand for my employers and met the prisoner at the Throgmorton Street end—he asked if I was in a hurry—I said, "No"—he said, "Do you know the Bank?"—I said "Yes"—he gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and said, that I was to take it to the drawing office of the Bank and get a cheque-book, and not give them the paper unless they asked for it—he said, "Bring the cheque-book to me here"—he did not offer me any money—I went to the private drawing office, of the Bank of England, and presented the slip—the gentleman said, "How many cheques?"—I said, "I don't know"—I did not get a cheque-book—I had some conversation with a gentleman, and went with him to Thread<lb/>needle Street, where Inspector Fagan joined us—I went up Warnford Court, and met the prisoner there—he mumbled something which I could not catch, and I said, "Are you the gentleman who sent me to the Bank?"—he made no reply, and I turned to the inspector and said,</p>

I am a corn merchant, of 66, Mark Lane, and live at Brighton—on Sunday, January 23rd, I wrote a letter to Mr. Fisher, and posted it on the Monday—it was addressed to "Mrs. Fisher, 26, Gloucester Street, Local"—it was a betting transaction, and this was a statement of how the money was made up—I enclosed a cheque payable to her on the London Joint Stock Bank—I intended to post it in Brighton before I started, but on arriving at London Bridge I found it in my pocket, and posted it, forgetting that it was marked "Local"—I went into the post-office in Mark Lane about it, and they told me that it was almost sure to come back, so I did not stop it till the 25th.</p>

His son, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Lee, rents the shop of the old man that runs the cab which I am in," meaning the shop he was in—the Queen Anne is a public-house close to Hare's house—later, at the station, I confronted him with his brother, who made a statement—I told him he would be charged—he said, "Yes, Lee did leave his pony there that night, but there were two ponies there when you came; I had nothing to do with selling them"—there were not two in my sight—the stable had no stalls; it was simply an old shed, and the pony was in the yard—if another had been there I must have seen it—I did not go to the back of the shed because the pony was in the yard—I had seen Richards in the neighbourhood previous to this—on January 6th I was present when Hare was charged at Stratford—he said, "I bad nothing to do with stealing it; Lee asked me to take care of the cart for him."</p>

I live at 6, Hoskin Street, Greenwich—I am an under-waterman—the prisoner is my son—on January 7th, at 6.80 p.m., I was in bed—I had been away all that day—I was called up, and went downstairs—I saw the deceased and his wife, who is my sister—my son was there also—he lives with me—the deceased had his coat off, and my sister was going to <hi rend="italic">slip into him</hi> about pawning the girl's clothes and watch—the deceased said to me, "Hullo, old boy, how are you getting on? we don't want no quarrels; let us come out and have a drink"—we all went to the Golden Anchor public-house, which is in the same street as my house—the deceased put his coat on before we went out—we had two quarters of whisky between three of us—I was sober, because I had been at work all day—Mrs. Walsh was not sober—she had had a drop when we went into the public-house—the deceased was not sober either—my son was sober—as soon as we got the drink the deceased said, "Here you are, my old <hi rend="italic">branch;</hi> success to the Boers; may they beat the British"—I said, "Don't say that; you have got a good pension from the country; what do you want to ran down the country for?"—he said, "To hell with you, and the country too"—my sister said, "Where is <hi rend="italic">Liz?"</hi>—I said, "Round the other side," and she said, "Why don't you call her round?"—when my daughter came round my sister called her names—the deceased told his wife to shut her mouth, or else he would shut it for her—then the deceased called me a b—y b—d, and my son said, "Don't call him that; he is not that"—the deceased said, "You! I would swipe you out," and was going to hit him, but my son bobbed on one side, and gave him a back-handed smack, which caught him a kiss in the mouth, and he tumbled and fell—there is a pavement and a kerb—there is a 4 in. rise from the road to the middle of the path—after he fell I put his coat and a cape under his head for a pillow, and then I and my friend got hold of his arm and took him down home—when the deceased and his wife came into the public-house they were not very drunk—they had only had two drinks—after we had carried the deceased home I went and fetched Dr. Magan.</p>

                  </hi> I am the licensee of the Golden Anchor, Hoskin Street, Greenwich, which is at a corner, the pavement is made of diamond black bricks all round outside—there is no room for traffic in front of the house, and no kerb—there is a side entrance in Hoskin Street, where there is a kerb—the front, which faces the river, has only a pavement—about 7.30 on January 7th the deceased and some other people came into the house—I did not know the deceased before—I knew Alfred Blake and his son, the prisoner—there were four of them, the prisoner and his father, the deceased and his wife—they were all in one compart<lb/>ment—in the next compartment there were two or three of Alfred Blake's daughters and the prisoner's mother—they were all sober when they came in—I served them with two quarters of Irish whisky, two drops of sherry, and two <hi rend="italic">ponys</hi> of bitter ale—the sherry and some of the whisky went into the other compartment, not where the deceased was—the two <hi rend="italic">ponys</hi> of bitter were served to the prisoner—I heard Mrs. Walsh using abusive language to her brother, and I called her to order about it, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190002120034"/>
               <p>the deceased said, "They are brother and sister, and, by God, they can say what they like to one another"—I said, "Well, you cannot do it here"—they went on talking again, and I called Mrs. Walsh to order again, and said, "If it occurs again you will have to go out, I won't have it"—just after that Mrs. Blake and one of her daughters came into that compartment, and Mrs. Walsh and Mrs. Blake began talking and quarrel<lb/>ling, and I thought it time to interfere, and I put them out—the deceased was very excited in the house about the Boers, and had a lot of talk about the warfare—he said he would go and fight for the Boers, and exterminate the English—the party was in my house from about 6.30 to 7.40—I did not hear the accused say or do anything—I saw Mrs. Walsh pushing Mrs. Blake while they were in my house, and she hit Mrs. Blake in the face and called her a <hi rend="italic">special term,</hi> and then she struck Mrs. Blake's daughter and called her a nice name, and I cleared them all out—about seven or eight minutes after they had gone somebody came and asked me for some whisky, but I would not give them any; I said I would give them water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner of la, Marlborough Street, Greenwich—about 10.50 p.m. on January 7th I was called to 6, Hoskin Street, the house of the prisoner's father, where I saw the deceased—he was unconscious—I made a slight examination, and at once came to the conclusion that he was suffering from concussion of the brain, and probably a fractured skull—I suggested his removal to the infirmary—I heard Dr. Forsyth's evidence at the Police-court, de<lb/>scribing the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination which he made—in my examination I noticed some blood about the mouth and an injury to the inner surface of the lips—I also found a bruise behind the right ear, and I came to the conclusion that some force had caused the fracture to the skull—the lip had obviously been cut by the teeth—the bruise behind the ear might have been caused by a blow from the fist, or by a fall on the ground—I think the latter more probable—the injury to the ear could have been caused by a fall on the glazed bricks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the divisional surgeon to this district, and practise at 12, Park Place, Greenwich—I was called at 6.30 a.m., on January 8th, to 6, Hoskin Street—the deceased had not been taken to the infirmary, but was still at the house—he was dead when I arrived—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the 10th—the signs of injury were more distinct when I first saw him than when I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> when death had occurred two days before—at my first examination I found a cut on the inside of the upper lip—it could have been caused by a blow from the fist—I found an effusion of blood under the scalp, a crack in the skull on the right on the outside, extending back<lb/>wards and upwards for about 5 in.; on the left there was no bleeding out<lb/>side the skull, but inside the membranes of the brain there was a large clot of blood and bruised brain tissue—that was caused by the counter stroke on the right—the clot on the left side had pressed upon the brain—in my opinion the blow which fractured the skull was the cause of death—I do not think that blow was caused by a fall—it could have been caused by the fist—it would require considerable force to crack the skull of a man of 60, but not so much force as would be required to crack the skull of a younger man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Spicer Road, Finch Road, Battersea—in December, 1897, I was living with my father and mother at Woolwich—I am single, but on December 17th, 1897, I was confined in a Home at Clapham of a female child—it was named Selina Ellen Jones—the lady in charge of that house recommended a Mrs. Muller to me, and the child was put into her charge till March, 1898, when it was taken from her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190002120038"/>
               <p>and put into the charge of Mrs. Wetherall, of Gee Street, St. Luke's, and I paid her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from March to July, 1898, for the care of the child—I went there and visited it, and, as far as I saw, it had good health and flourished under Mrs. Wetherall—in July the father ceased to contribute, and I then paid only half-a-crown a week for it—I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Woolwich Herald</hi> on August 18th, 1899: "Adop<lb/>tion.—A young married couple would adopt healthy baby; every care and comfort; good references given; very small premium. Write first to Mrs. Hewetson, 4, Bradmore Lane, Hammersmith"—I wrote to the address, saying that I had a child, and asking how much she wanted to adopt it—I got an answer, saying that they wanted it for their own, and wanted £5 down—I answered that, and said that I could pay £3, and sent this photograph (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) of the child—it was sent back to me in a subse<lb/>quent letter—it was taken in 1898, when the child was about nine months old—I asked for an interview, and an appointment was made to meet at Woolwich Station about Thursday, August 24th, a week before the child was handed over—I met the female prisoner at Woolwich, and went with her to my mother's house—mother said we wanted her to take care of it for a certain time, and then have it back again—I made arrangements to see the child once a fortnight, and mother said she would come up and see it presently—the prisoner said that her husband was a clerk in Hammersmith, and I understood her to say that she lived at 4, Bradmore Lane; that was the address in the advertisement—no arrange<lb/>ment was made about the money on that occasion—I said that I should always like to provide it with clothes—I told her I would tell Mrs. Wetherall that I was going to take the child away, and I wrote to the prisoner that she could have it on Tuesday—I made an appointment for the next Thursday after the interview at my mother's, to meet at Charing Cross Station—I then got this letter from the female prisoner; it is the only letter I got—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that they had taken a new house in Hammersmith, and all the neighbours would think the child was their own, and inquiring at what part of Charing Cross Station they were to meet.</hi>)—Some days before August 3lst I bought some child's clothes—I took those clothes to Mrs. Wetherall on Thursday, and she handed me over the child that day, and all the clothes which it had been wearing—I took the child to Charing Cross Station, main line, and the clothes—I saw Mrs. Hewetson, as I knew her, at Charing Cross South-Eastern Station, and went with her to Hammer<lb/>smith by 'bus—we went to the Grove, and stopped at a house there, and she said that that was the house she had taken—it was not occupied, but there were some workmen in it—I then went with her to 2, Southerton Road, Hammersmith—she said that the house belonged to a friend of hers, and told me to say nothing about the child not being hers, but gave me no reason for that—when we got to Southerton Road I was introduced to the friend, Mrs. Woolmer, as her sister-in-law—I had some tea in the house, and paid the prisoner £3, and gave her the bundle of clothes—I had definitely arranged to pay her £5—after tea the child and I and the prisoner came out, and went to Hammersmith Station—I then went home, leaving the child behind with the prisoner—I was to pay the other £2 on the next Sunday—she said that she would write me a letter, and let me know where—she was going to send her husband with the child to meet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190002120039"/>
               <p>me at the station—I got no such letter, and did not know what station to go to—notwithstanding that, I came up to Hammersmith on Sunday, September 3rd, and went to the house in the Grove, and found it was occupied by some other people—I then went to 4, Bradmore Lane, and found it was a newspaper shop—I had a conversation with the proprietor, Mr. Canning, and went to 2, Southerton Road, and saw Mrs. Woolmer—after that I went back to Bradmore Lane, and then went home—next day, September 4th, I went again, and then went to the Police-station and made a complaint, and afterwards to the West London Police-court—the next I heard of my child was a message from the police on the 27th or 28th to go to the mortuary at Battersea—I went there, and saw the dead body of my child—she had curly golden hair—she had been vaccinated on her left arm—she had a peculiar nose and a pro<lb/>truding navel—on September 28th, or later, I was shown a quantity of child's clothing, and recognised this red plaid dress which I gave her when she went to Mrs. Hewetson—it was in the parcel I gave to Mrs. Hawetson; the child was not wearing it—after making it I had this piece over (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which I gave to Detective Gough—this is a coat which my mother bought for the child, and gave to Mrs. Weatherall—I recog<lb/>nise these other clothes as belonging to the child—I gave the first bundle to Mrs. Hewetson on August 31st—this next bundle is a pair of shoes, a pair of brown socks, and a petticoat—I recognise them as part of the child's clothing, but she was not wearing the socks and petti<lb/>coat on August 31st—they were handed to the prisoner—I recognise these things marked O, P, Q and R in this bundle—they are clothes which belonged to the child—they were handed over on August 31st—this bib marked B was part of the child's clothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The child had not lived with me from its birth—it had been with Mrs. Muller, and then with Mrs. Wetherall—I took the child from Mrs. Wetherall because she went to live over a stable, and kept no servant—there was not trouble about money, but the child's father did not keep up his payments—I did not like Mrs. Wetherall's actions with the child—I had a good deal of bother with her—£3 was all I could afford—I paid £2 for the new clothes, but the others were what she had at Mrs. Wether-all's—when I called on the Sunday and did not find either of the two addresses I was very anxious, and went to the police; but I had no idea what had become of my child—I was sent for to see if I could identify a child, but did not know it was my child—I went to Hammersmith, and from there was taken to Battersea—the child was partially decomposed—the mark on the navel was through the neglect of Mrs. Muller, but there was not very much the matter—the child's nose was very turned up, and its hair was yellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not like Mrs. Wetherall's conduct towards the child, and that was the object which induced me to take the child from her—I believed the house in the Grove was the house in which the child was to live—when I talked about returning on Sunday I expected to go to that house, and to find it there—I had seen my child pretty frequently in its life, and I have no doubt that the child I saw at the mortuary was mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Glenthorne Road, Hammersmith—last August I lived at 12, Southerton Road, Hammersmith, and on August 31st I had a notice in my window, "Apartments to let"—I re<lb/>member on that day the two prisoners coming—the woman said she wanted a room for "me and my baby" for the night; that she was moving, but did not want her husband to sleep there—she gave the name of Hewetson—she said the baby was with her sister-in-law then—I let her have the room for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the evening the woman and a person I now know as Miss Jones arrived—they were carrying a baby and a parcel—when I opened the door the prisoner said, "I have brought my sister in-law back with me; you don't mind, do you? Can I have some tea?"—they had some tea, after which they all went out—the prisoner said she was going to see her sister-in-law off by train—when the two prisoners came earlier in the day to secure the room, the male prisoner was stand<lb/>ing on the mat while the arrangements were being made with Mrs. Hewetson—I never saw the man again after that—after Mrs. Hewetson and Miss Jones and the baby went out, Mrs. Hewetson and the baby returned—the prisoner said when she came back, "I do not want to sleep here to-night; my furniture has come, and my husband has got a bed up; will you fetch me down the bundle off the bed, because I do not want to go upstairs again"—I got the parcel for her, and she left the house immediately with the baby and the parcel—I did not see her again till I picked her out from among some other persons—I remember Miss Jones coming to me on the Sunday after the Thursday on which Mrs. Hewetson came.</p>

I live at 2, Grove Villas, Grove Road, Barnes—I am a married woman, and live there with my husband—we went into occupation about August 16th last—at that point of Grove Road there are three houses which stand together in a row called Grove Villas—No. 1 was empty, and remained so after we occupied</p>

               <p>No. 2, and No. 3 was occupied by the two prisoners—when we came I noticed that there was a little boy there, whom I afterwards came to know as Freddy—he was about 10 months old—the prisoner kept no servant—I knew them as Mr. and Mrs. Chard Williams—I only went into No. 3 twice, and Mrs. Williams only came in to me once—she told me her husband was a tutor at a college at Clapham—I saw him about daily—Mrs. Williams said the boys at the college were having their holidays, and that was why he was at home—I remember going in to tea about a week or a fortnight after we went there—I saw the two prisoners and Freddy—he was the only child there in August; but in the first week in September I saw a little girl there, whom I afterwards came to know as Lily—I thought she was about two years old—Mrs. Williams told me the child's name was Lily, and she said it was her sister's child, who lived at Uxbridge, and that her sister was nursing the child's grandmother, who was dangerously ill, and that the child would have to remain with her for certainly a week—on that occasion I saw Mrs. Williams put the child into a corner and give it a smack—the child cried—after that I saw it out in the front garden once or twice—there are gardens at the front and back of the houses—it was playing about, as far as I could see, quite happily—on one occasion, when I was in my garden, the child was crying in No. 3, and I heard Mr. Williams say to Mrs. Williams, "Don't do that," and Mrs. Williams said, "You mind your own damned business, or I will serve you the same"—Mrs. Williams came out into the garden, and told me that Lily had dirtied on the floor, and she had beaten her with a stick for doing so, and left her lying in it, and Mr. Williams had taken the child up to the bath-room, and changed its linen and batced it, and that he had taken the stick from her—I said, "Poor little thing!" and she said, "Serve it right"—a day or two after that I went into No. 3 again, and Mrs. Williams showed me some weals on the child's back—they stood out as thick as my finger—Mrs. Williams said, "Look what I have done"—I said, "What would the mother say if she saw them?" and she said, "I don't care what the mother would say"—the marks were dark-red—she said that she had had Lily's brother under her care two years before, and she wondered they let her have the girl—she never told me what had become of the little girl's brother—I said, "It is a poor little mite," and she said, "She is fretting for the mother"—it was look<lb/>ing miserably thin—I never saw it out in the road or taken out for exercise, or anything of that kind—I only saw it in the garden—I heard it crying continually—I cannot say whether Mr. or Mrs. Williams were in the house on those occasions—on Saturday, September 23rd, I paid a visit to some relations at Greenwich—on that morning before I left home I heard Lily crying, and when I was going away Mrs. Williams came to the gate to see me off—I did not return home till the Monday following, the 25th—I got home about 7 p.m.—I heard nothing from the adjoining house on that night, but on Tuesday morning I saw Mrs. Williams and said, "How unusually quiet lily is!"—she said the mother had come and taken it home on the Sunday, and added, "It is a damned good job it has gone; now I feel in Heaven"—about that time she told me that Lily's mo her had left some of the child's clothes behind, and said I could have them if I liked in exchange for an art flower pot of</p>

               <p>mine which she had seen in my house—it was arranged that she should take the flower pot, and I should take the clothes in exchange—she brought the clothes out into the garden—the clothes consisted of a plaid frock, two flannel petticoats, a pair of pink socks, three vests, three pairs of drawers, and an outdoor coat—all those were retained by me till I handed them over to Inspector Scott—I saw Mrs. Williams several times after that—I cannot say the exact date—I saw her in October—after I ceased to see her I saw Mr. Williams once, and I asked him when Mrs. Williams would return, and he said that the friend she had gone to nurse was dangerously ill, and he could not say when she would return—he said she had taken Freddy with her—I remember some furni<lb/>ture being removed from the house—I cannot say who removed it—it was moved at ten 10 o'clock at night—it was about three weeks after my return from Greenwich—my husband had just come in on that night, and he then left our house with the object of going to the landlord—I did not notice anything peculiar about Lily—I did not notice the size of her feet or hands, or if her nose was broken—I did not notice any scars on its face—this is a picture of the child (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

On the morning of September 27th Stokes called my attention to a brown paper parcel in the Thames—I looked at it, and saw a baby's foot sticking out—I took it from the edge of the water to the mortuary at Battersea, where I took from the outside of it the paper in which the whole thing was wrapped up—then I came upon a kind of pink-coloured flannelette sewed round the body from the shoulders down to the haunches, with double white thread, and between the legs and around the haunches was a white napkin—the head was covered up with a white cotton bag, tied round the neck with a piece of cotton stuff, the same as the bag was—it was a piece of selvedge torn off—on removing the flannelette from the body I found it was tied up with a kind of sash-cord or blind-cord, the heels being drawn up over the chest, on each side of the head, under the ears; the left arm was thrust under the left leg, between it and the body; the right arm was squeezed between the body and the leg in a straight attitude and secured by the cord or line—I sent for Dr. Kempster, who cut and removed the cord—I cut nothing myself except the outside string and the paper—I took the pink flannel<lb/>ette off; but left on the head covering and the string on the body—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the bag which was over the head; this is the napkin which was round the bottom part of the body, and this is the flannelette which was sewn round the body, from the shoulders down to the haunches—this string was outside the brown paper; this sash-line was tied next the flesh round the arms and neck—I am familiar with knots and the making of them—I was in Her Majesty's Navy for just over 12 years, and there we learned to tie all knots which are required in the Navy—in the blind cord there are knots which are well known to those familiar with knots—there are three knots here known as the fisherman's bend, and here is another known as the half-hitch—there are 11 of those in the string round the brown paper; there were six half-hitches in the blind cord—a reef knot is well known to me, it is used for reefing sails—I find one in the cord round the body, and only one of that kind—"overhand" knots are known to me—seven of them were to be found in the cord round the brown paper, and one in the cord which tied up the body—I took parti<lb/>cular notice of the position of the child's limbs at the time it was found, as well as the position of the strings and cords which bound it up—I have prepared a doll about the size of the child, with just the same presentment as I found the child when I took it to the mortuary—(<hi rend="italic">The model was produced</hi>)—this shows exactly the position of the child's limbs and the way in which it was tied after the flannelette had been removed, and also it shows the cord</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I examined the wrappings round the body—there was no name on them—none of the string found in the house corresponds with the string round the body—I did not search the house—this is all the string I have—this sash-line is the ordinary sash-line which goes up the side of a window, but it would be a very big window to take a line of that description—if I went to an ordinary string-drawer I should not find knots like this—the overhand knot is a common knot, but the half<lb/>hitches are more remarkable—there are two kinds of fisherman's knots; one is used for attaching cat-gut to a line, and the other for attaching one end of a line to another.</p>

I am Divisional Surgeon of Police, and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on September 27th I was called to the mortuary at Battersea, where I saw the body of a female child tied up, and the head was wrapped up—there was a cloth still round the buttocks—the model is exactly as I saw the child before I cut the cords—the head was in a bag, and was tied round the neck—I re<lb/>moved it, and cut the cord which tied up the body—from the appearance of the body, it had been dead from three to six days; according to my opinion, it had been in the water for more than one day—its appearance was consistent with its having been placed in the water on the afternoon or night of Saturday, September 23rd—I noticed that the tongue was between the lips, the hands clenched—there was no appearance of any goose skin—the finger nails were blackened—there was no froth exuding from the mouth or nose, and no foreign body in the air passages—there was a large bruise on the left side of the head, extending from the temple to the back of the head, and covering a space, roughly, about the size of the palm of one's hand—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination 1 1/2 hours after I saw the body—I found a quantity of clotted blood between the skin and the skull—there was no fracture of the skull—the bruise was caused before death, and must have been given with considerable violence, and, in my opinion, intentional violence—it could not have been from any accidental fall, in my opinion, unless it had been dropped from a great height—the ordinary effect of such a bruise would have been to stun a child—I came to the conclusion that the child was about 18 months old—it weighed 19 1/2 <hi rend="italic">lb.</hi>, and was 31 in. in length—it was well developed—I noticed signs of constriction all round the child's neck, exactly corresponding to the tape round it—they were marks of strangling—I found that the lungs were congested, the right side of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190002120047"/>
               <p>heart full of dark fluid blood, the left side empty—the bag of the heart had a slight excess of fluid—the other organs were normal—those last indications are consistent with asphyxia, or suffocation—the condition of the heart is proof positive of suffocation—there was no matter under the lungs or in the stomach—by the condition of the different organs I am of opinion that the child was suffocated by strangulation and not by drowning—I did not find any signs which one generally seeks for as an indication that the child was suffocated by drowning, except the heart, and that would be common to both—I had enough to satisfy me that the cause of death was suffocation, and that by the string round the child's neck—I think the child was put into the water when dead—I did not see any signs of the child having struggled after it was tied up, and that is one of the reasons why I think it was stunned at the time, it was tied up—the child had been vaccinated on the left arm—its navel was slightly protruding, owing to some of the changes which take place after birth—I noticed there was a little scar on the left cheek; it had become black from the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The protruding navel was slight—it is a common thing to find a protruding navel—I do not think it has anything to do with the treatment—the scar on the left cheek did not resemble a finger scratch; it was more like a pin scratch—I think it must have been done some time before—in a reasonably healthy child the skin would heal more quickly than with older people—the body would sink when put into the water at first—it would rise when decomposition set in; the gases would inflate the body—I do not think a heavy body would rise more quickly than a thin one—I do not think that a fat person would decompose more quickly; my experience is the other way—I should say that it is correct to say that this child was a plump, well-developed child—the length of time before a body comes to the surface all depends on the condition of the body when placed in the water, the temperature of the water, and the atmospheric condition—in a thunderstorm or on the discharge of a great gun it would come up quicker, and it would come up quicker in summer than in winter—it is the decomposition setting in which causes the body to rise—on land, decomposition may set in very rapidly or very slowly—I have known cases where decomposition has set in in two hours, and other cases in four days—the two hours' case was after gun-shot wounds. In this case decomposition had set in—the skin was peeling off—the head and face were congested—discoloration is a different thing—the face and head being congested are symptoms of suffocation—the child had an excess of blood in the head, owing to the cord round the neck—if the body had not been put into the water, and if the weather had been cold, I should not have expected decomposition to have begun for about three days; having been put into the water, the action of the water itself would have delayed decomposition—it is not a usual experience that if a body be recovered from water after eight or ten days in summer, or a longer period in winter, no signs of decomposition will be seen—I have heard of Dr.Tidy, but my experience tells me it is very difficult to form an opinion—in this easel believe the weather was rather cold, which would retard decomposition—I cannot say if the action of the water would delay decomposition for six days—I cannot remember the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190002120048"/>
               <p>time of year—after a body is taken out of water rapid decomposition may set in, but it did not take place in this case—I did not examine the body for the scars for two or three days after, not till October 2nd, and it was quite easy to observe the child's features then—they would be horrible to an ordinary person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The scar under the eye was very black—in my opinion there was nothing which I could see which would prevent the child having been placed in the water on the Saturday, and having been taken out on the following Wednesday morning—I think it might have been in the water from three to six days—if the body had been kept out of the water for some time it would decompose more quickly than if it had been put in at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. The legs were not dislocated or broken; they were drawn up as children's legs can be drawn up—it would have required a good deal of force, and if the child had been conscious it would have struggled—an ordi<lb/>nary woman could have done it if the child had been unconscious, because then it would have been loose—if the child were conscious I think it would be a very heavy task for anyone—I do not think the blow could have been given by a hand or fist—it was given by a heavy blunt instru<lb/>ment, by banging the child against a wall, or by a blow on the head—I do not think it could have lived scarcely more than a minute or so after being tied up like this—the tape was very tightly tied round the neck, and it would not take" more than from 60 to 90 seconds to suffocate a person that way—suffocation would be more slow if the child was stunned—if it was tied up after the blow it would never be conscious of anything again—it is not usual for scars to afterwards blacken—this was due to mud which had worked in—it had even worked into the slight depression and left a black line—it is assumed that the child was alive on the 23rd, which would be four days—it does not follow that the body was in the water all the time—if it was kept in a warm room or in a cupboard it would decompose very rapidly.</p>

               <p>murdering the little female child found at Battersea on September 27th. The accusation is positively false. The facts of the case are these: I, much against my husband's wish, in August last advertised for a child, thinking to make a little money, the result of which was the adoption of this little child, with whom I received the sum £3. My next act was to advertise for a home for a little girl; I used some shop in Warwick Road, West Kensington, I forget the number, but I used the name of Denton, or Dalton, I am not sure which. I received about 40 replies, from which I chose one, from George Street or George Road, Croydon. The lady from Croydon, Mrs. Smith by name, agreed to take the child for £1 and clothes. I met her at Clapham Junction, the Falcon Hotel, on a Saturday about the middle of September; we were to meet at 7 o'clock. I arrived at time, but Mrs. Smith was 20 minutes late. I handed the child over to her, and she was then quite well. That is the last I saw of her. I have, it is true, been carrying on a sort of baby-farm; that is to say, I have adopted babies, and then advertised and got them re-adopted for about half the amount I had previously received. I have had five in this way; two died while in my care, but I can prove that every attention and kindness was shown them; no money was grudged over their illness. I can prove this by the people with whom we lodged, and also by the doctors who attended them. Two I have had re-adopted; one went to Essex, the other to Bristol, and the last one I parted with as above stated. From the accounts in the papers I am alleged to have carried on this system for six years; now, that, too, is utterly wrong. I am evidently mistaken for someone else, as the first one I ever adopted was in November, 1897. You will say, 'If innocent, why not come forward?' There have been innocent people hanged before now, and I must admit that at the present things look very much against me, but it is not fair to go entirely on circumstantial evidence. I am trying to find the woman to whom I gave up the child, but, unfor<lb/>tunately for me, I destroyed her letters, and if I came forward there would be no possibility of clearing myself unless I could find some clue about her. In conclusion, I must tell you that my husband is not to blame in any way whatever; he has always looked upon the whole matter with the greatest abhorrence, but only gave way to me because he was, through illness, out of employment; he never, however, once touched any of the money I made by these means.—Yours truly, (Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">M. HEWETSON</hi>. P.S.—We left Barnes simply because we were unable to meet the rent, and some time before we heard of this lament<lb/>able affair. The shop in Warwick Road is a newspaper shop, the Hammersmith Road end, and only a few doors down on the right hand side."</p>

I went with Inspector Scott on the evening of December 8th to Gainsborough Road, where I saw the male prisoner and took him into custody—I told him I was going to arrest him for being concerned with Mrs. Williams in the wilful murder of Selina Ellen Jones about September last—he said, "We are guilty of fraud, but innocent of murder"—he was then taken upstairs to where Inspector Scott was.</p>

On December 8th T went to 26, Gainsborough Road, Hackney, with Sergeant Gough, where I saw the male prisoner in the kitchen, and told Gough to arrest him while I went upstairs, where I saw the female prisoner kneeling, apparently packing a trunk—I said, "I am Inspector Scott"—before I could say anything she said, "I know, you have come about the Battersea job; I knew it was you as soon as I heard your step on the stairs"—I said, "Mrs. Williams, I arrest you for the wilful murder of Selina Ellen Jones, and anything yon may say to me will be given in evidence against you"—she said, "Have you got my letter?"—I said, "Yes"—she then said, "That letter is God's truth; but I know I cannot clear myself; my husband was not in the house when I took the child away"—the man was then brought upstairs, and I repeated the charge to both of them; they made no reply—they were taken to the Police-station, and eventually to Battersea I found the little boy named Freddy at the Battersea Police<lb/>station on the following day—I looked through the trunk which Mrs. Williams was packing—I found a large quantity of children's clothing—on September 27th I received information of the finding of the body in the Thames, and on the first Sunday in October I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi> a reference to the finding of the body—on Monday, October 2nd, the first hearing of the inquest was held—there was some mention in the public press of the hearing—the inquest was adjourned till November 27th, when I was present, when it was concluded.</p>
