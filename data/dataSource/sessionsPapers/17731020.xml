               <p>Methusalem Davis. I met the prisoner on the 12th of September in St. James's Park, about nine in the evening; she asked me where I was going; I said home; she asked me if I would go with her; I asked her where she lived; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200004"/> said in Duck-lane, Westminster. I took it for granted she was a woman of the town; I said what must I do with you; she said to be with me all night; I asked her what I must give her.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked the price?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes; she told me some extravagant price. I have forgot what; I said won't less do; at last she consented for 1 s. She prevailed on me to go with her; when we got near the place where she said she lodged, she desired me to stay there while she informed a woman she lodged with of it, and get her to leave the room for that night; after that she came out and conducted me into the room; she was in a great hurry to go to bed; we undressed ourselves and went to bed very soon; she left the fire burning; she enquired very often if the fire was out; I told her I thought it would do no harm. After being about twenty minutes or half an hour in bed, she pretended that she was very thirsty; she got out of bed and said she would get some half-pence to buy some small beer; she got tumbling things about where my clothes lay, which was upon some drawers by the bedside; my coat and waistcoat fell down; I heard the noise of some keys in my waistcoat pocket. She went out of the room; in about five minutes after came five or six people into the room;

My watch and three shillings were taken out of the pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your watch was in your pocket when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Davis. I wound up the watch in the room before I went to bed. Ward shewed me to a public house; he gave his name, Williams. I could not find the prisoner for some time as she quitted that lodging next day. I have never seen my watch since.</p>

I was in the shop when she came home, between eight and nine in the evening, with this man; they went up stairs together; after they had been there about five minutes she called upon the stairs to know if the bed was ready; I went up the stairs and she gave a bag into my hand, and desired me to take care of it; it was a linen bag; I believe there were in it two guineas, two half guineas, and a quarter guinea. A little after that I heard her scream and make a noise, and she was sent to the Round-house; she sent a message to me from the Round-house to make away with the bag; I threw it away.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man that took the bundle?</p>
               <p>Oram. Yes; I saw his face very well. After he had the bundle the other man asked the prisoner where his pistol was; the prisoner then took a pistol from a pocket, I believe inside his coat, and held it to his breast, and said he would shoot him dead if he would not deliver his money; the prisoner put his hand to his pocket, and said, d - n you, you have money; he turned out his pocket and found none; then the prisoner turned to me, and said madam, your money! I gave him two-pence farthing and two keys; the other man said give the lady her keys again; I took one and left the other in his hand. There were three men a-coming over the style which was not many yards from us; they seeing that, the prisoner took up the bundle and run a-cross the field; the three men came up; we told them of it, but they did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200006"/> not pursue them. We were going to Mr. Hunt's garden-house; we met Mr. and Mrs. Hunt; Mr. Hunt got some people to his assistance, and went after them, but could not find them. I was at Mr. Whitefield's chapel on a Sunday a fortnight or three weeks after, and I saw the prisoner in the chapel; he was there when I went in; I knew him as soon as I saw him; he went out before service was over; I told Mr. Hunt of it. Parish came and told his master he had seen the prisoner cutting up a sheep in Oxford-market, which is not a great way from Mr. Hunt's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Mr. Hunt?</p>
               <p>Oram. No; I live in Rathbone Place. Mr. Hunt sent his daughter for me to see if I knew the man; I went, and the moment I saw him I knew him again; he was taken up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>

My master sent for Mrs. Oram; when she saw him she said that was the man; the beadle was fetched and he was taken; I was not by when he was taken; I was before the Justice.</p>

            . I bundled up the things mentioned in the indictment, and bid Parish carry them up to the Garden-house; when I came back I met Parish and Oram, who said they had been robbed. About five weeks after my wife returned from market, and said she thought she had seen the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the particular shop where she had seen him?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No; she only said in the market. I went with the boy to the market; I saw the prisoner skinning a sheep; he said that was the man; I went home and sent my daughter for the girl; as she was coming through the market she said that was the man. I went and fetched one of the beadles who took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the constable say to him?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I was not near to them when they took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Mrs. Hunt, your wife, saw him in the market?</p>

               <p>Q. So after your wife had fixed upon this man, this boy and the girl were sent for to see if they knew him again?</p>
               <p>Hunt. The prisoner was not pointed out neither to the boy nor girl.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man described?</p>

               <p>Q. You have received the reward for an affair of this fort I am told, and are no stranger to a prosecution.</p>
               <p>Hunt. You have been told a very great untruth then.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you with him the day or two before he was murdered?</p>
               <p>James. Yes; I heard him say he was going to town; I do not know any thing of his setting out; I was gone to plough when he set out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to go with a stick?</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you lived with him?</p>
               <p>James. Two years. (A stick produced by Mr. Bond) I am sure this is the stick; I saw my master with it the day before he came to London; he had it in his hand when he came down the field to me as I was at plough; he always chose to ride and walk with it:</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your taking particular notice of that stick?</p>
               <p>James. Because there is a little hole under the knob of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that hole in the stick before your master came to London?</p>
               <p>James. Yes; he had had this stick above a twelve-month.</p>

               <p>Livard. Yes; he came to my house on Wednesday the 15th of September, between eight and nine in the morning; he staid at my house best part of three-quarters of an hour; he asked me to go into the Borough to arrest a man; he went with me; we were at the Windmill in the Borough best part of six hours; after we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200010"/> dined he left me and went to see one Thomas, at the Vine in the Borough; I never saw him after that till I saw him dead; he left me at about four o'clock.

I took very particular notice of this stick; I have seen it at my own house several times; I had it in my hand at the Borough the last time I saw him; here is a mark round the middle of the stick, and the hole at the top that I know it by.

            . I am a surgeon; I live at Hammersmith: I was called up between three and four in the morning of the 16th of September, (they had brought the deceased from the road to the Cock and Magpye) to see farmer Wingfield; I found him dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased?</p>
               <p>Palver. By sight, by seeing him pass and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200011"/> repass. The people stript him; his body and limbs were very fair; there was no bruise upon his body at all; I examined his head; upon the left side of his head I saw a bruise; that was the only bruise I saw about him; I did not make any further examination that morning; I deferred the rest till I was sent for by the Coroner's Jury, on the Friday afternoon; then I laid the skull bare, and precisely under the contusion I found a fracture of the skull and a depressure; the skull was depressed and beat in upon the brains, a round piece, something bigger than a shilling; from thence a fracture extended both ways forwards almost to the eye, and backwards to the hind part of the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that from your opinion the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Palver. No doubt of it; there was no outward wound, the skin was not broke or even grazed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you think it might happen?</p>
               <p>Palver. From some blow I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the skin have been broke if it had been occasioned by a blow?</p>
               <p>Palver. Not if it was done with a round stick; if it had been done by any thing pointed or sharp it must have made some external wound.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hammond. Did you take notice of what money or things were in the deceased's pocket?</p>
               <p>Hammond. His pocket was cut long ways and cross ways, his left side breeches pocket; they were leather breeches; there were three keys hung out of that pocket; there was no money, not a farthing; I found upon him a clasp knife, a penknife, a pair of spectacles and a pencil; there was nothing else found upon him, not a handkerchief or any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. to Livard. You dined with the deceased?</p>
               <p>Livard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Livard. There was no reckoning paid till after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him pull out any money?</p>
               <p>Livard. No; I paid for some oysters and things; he said he would pay me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Livard. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a substantial farmer?</p>
               <p>Livard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Allan. He pulled out ten or twelve shillings at my house when he paid for the pint of beer, as I was told by my ostler; I did not see that; I changed a shilling for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of substance?</p>
               <p>Allan. By all accounts he was: he said when he took the money out to pay me for the poor, this is not the pocket where I keep my gold, I am not afraid of giving gold instead of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which pocket he said was not the pocket where he kept his gold?</p>
               <p>Allan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. What did you observe of the pocket?</p>
               <p>Williams. I observed it cut as Mr. Hammond has said; I saw the key hang out of his breeches pocket.</p>

He was; the prisoner came in with two women: they had a glass of gin a piece and went out; then he came in again with the same two women and had a glass of gin a piece, then they went out again; in a short time after he he came in with a watchman; he gave the watchman a glass of gin; the prisoner staid; he asked me if I would change him a 5 s. 3 d. he said he would give any body a glass of gin that would change it for him; Dominic said he would give him change for it; the prisoner took out a bit of paper that it was wrapped up in, and gave it me; I said, sir, this is not a 5 s. 3 d. but a 4 s. 6 d. he said I always call them five and threepences: I a stop put to the Portugal money I weighed it, it wanted 6 d. Dominic said not change it as it was a 4 s. 6 d. the prisoner asked me what I thought it worth; I said I supposed it was worth 3 s. Dominic gave him 3 s. for it; after he got this 3 s. he called for half a gallon of beer; presently he said to Dominic, will you buy a hat? Dominic said he did not want one; the prisoner said he was in distress; he said Dominic should have it for half a crown; I lent

               <p>Counsel. Look at that hat.</p>
               <p>Dailey. This is like the hat, to the best of my knowledge this is it; he said all sailors hats have a small button and loop; he had another hat, an old hat; he took one of them from under his coat; it seemed very old and pitchy about the crown.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he leave your Regiment?</p>
               <p>Mobben. On the 12th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. He was constantly in his regiment before?</p>
               <p>Mobben. Yes; he deserted then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a sailor?</p>
               <p>Mobben. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for six years he has constantly been with the regiment?</p>
               <p>Mobben. No; he has deserted twice to my knowledge in the time.</p>

               <p>Mobben. Yes; the time before this lost I heard he was, but not this time of deserting. As I was coming from the Barracks through Leicester-fields, I saw the prisoner in Princes-street, standing by a door about six in the morning on Thursday the 16th of September: as soon as he saw me, he turned his face towards the door; as I was going past him, I saw another soldier; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200013"/> held my hand up to him; as soon as the prisoner saw that, he went across the way towards Sidney's-alley; I took him by the collar as a deserter. I took him to the Savoy and delivered him up to Serjeant Thomas, who confined him in the Black Hole as a deserter; he had this stick when I took him; here is a mark of a cross I put upon it; I took it from him when he said he would knock me down; I saw him deliver up two guineas and some silver to Serjeant Thomas; I believe there was also a half guinea, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was I drunk or sober?</p>

I had a 4 s. 6 d. in my pocket, which I had had a good while about me; I had left the same four and six-penny piece in pawn for a glass of gin a month before, at the Suttling-house at the Horse Guards, and Barlow, a soldier, and I had sixpence a piece upon it besides; I went there and released it; the landlord would not change it because it wanted sixpence of weight. I drank at a public house in St. James's-street till I was quite drunk and very stupid. I heard of a robbery being done on the other side of Kensington; a butcher had been robbed of a watch and silver buckles, and a farmer had been robbed of some money, I did not hear how much, and his pocket cut; I did not hear any thing about any death or any thing of that kind. I was persuaded to say I had committed the robbery, as some people told me I should get clear of military punishment; I do not now know what I said at that time; I believed myself several times with foolish things before, when I had been in trouble, to screen myself from military punishment, when things have never been done, but this unluckily has been done: but I am now before God Almighty.</p>

When I put the key in the door, the prisoner threw down the window and attempted to run out; Mr. Fray and I took him immediately; he had got in at the window and shut himself in, and was packing the things up; it was a very fine moon light morning. I missed the three pair of shoes and boots, and found them about five in the morning hid by the Park Gate. When I charged him with breaking the window open, he said he went in there to ease himself.</p>

About four days before I saw my box in a top drawer of a chest of drawers, with my money in it; on missing it I suspected the prisoner and took her up that night; the constable searching her found the box and a half guinea and some silver; (the half guinea produced).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine; I had a half guinea that wanted eight-pence of weight; I made a particular mark on it, by that mark I know it to be the same I lost, and the box is the same the money was in; at first she denied it, at last she said if they would let her go she would give up the money.</p>

            . I am a constable: the fire was on a Saturday; on the Tuesday following I was going along Great Earle-street. I saw, about noon, the prisoner talking to a Jew; the prisoner said the people where they are, are in want of money, I can let you have them a bargain for ready money; hearing this conversation it took my curiosity; I followed the prisoner and the Jew; at last they came to an old iron shop; the prisoner went into that or the next house, and left the Jew into the street; I went into the public house and watched them; at last I saw the prisoner beckon the Jew; then I came out of the public house; the Jew was gone; I went up to this iron shop, and there I saw the prisoner in the back part of the shop packing up some things of this kind; I went to him and asked how he came by those things; he without making any answer flung by me, and ran out of the shop, and almost knocked down Martin Hossman, who I desired to observe what passed, and ran away; we pursued him; he was taken a little while after, and was brought back; he said then, these things had been bought by his wife; before the Justice of Peace he declared where he lodged, but we found nothing of these things at his lodgings; these things now produced I saw this man packing up in the iron shop.</p>

Thomas has been a workman there six years; these hoops, which were the stores of the cooperage in which Thomas was employed, were open to him to take hoops, in order to hoop the casks. On the 21st of December I was before Justice Sherwood; some hoops were produced with marks belonging to the Victualling Office; there were two new ones that had never been used.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Leverett: I worked with him in June to September, down to the 20th; I know Thomas also. Leverett is a smith in East Smithfield; he makes grates: I have known Thomas twice or thrice in a week bring hoops in his pocket; he brought these hoops (describing them) in false leather pockets inside his coat; the hoops had the king's broad arrow upon them. On the 2d of August particularly, he brought four; they were tied up in order to make them portable. On the 3d o f September he brought two; all these hoops had the broad arrow upon them. On the 3d or 4th of September Leverett told me that if I could get any thing above twelve shillings per hundred for the hoops brought by Thomas, I should have all above that for myself, and said he had two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200019"/> three hundred weight of the same kind to dispose of; Leverett cut one of these hoops Thomas brought in my presence, and beat out the broad arrow upon the anvil; then he gave to me a piece of that hoop as a sample of the iron he had to dispose of, and ordered me to go and dispose of it. I have seen Thomas bring iron to Leverett innumerable times. Instead of carrying this piece of iron I had for a sample to dispose of to any person, I went and made a discovery to the Lords of the Admiralty. When Leverett beat out the broad arrow, he said if that was seen upon them, the persons would not purchase it. Leverett gave three-pence halfpenny for each hoop, which weighed about three or four pound, and each hoop was in truth worth seven pence. I know Leverett gave that sum to Thomas, for I have seen him pay the money for the hoops,</p>

            . When Thomas was searched on the 21st of September the day I took him; I took two hoops, one out of each pocket both marked with the broad R.</p>
               <p>Q. to Young. Whether Thomas had been that day at the Victualing Office?</p>
               <p>Young. Yes; and was gone when I took these hoops upon him; I had seen him there twice that morning, at nine and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>- Child. I bought some hoops of Leverett with the broad arrow upon them; I took them for a debt Leverett owed me; he sent me home to my house a parcel of hoops with the broad arrow upon them.</p>
               <p>Thomas's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am totally innocent of the charge; I never sold any hoops to Leverett.</p>
               <p>Leverett's Defence.</p>
               <p>As to the old iron which Child speaks of, which was a transaction in January, there was one Nash who keeps an old iron shop, and makes nails; I buy my iron of that Nash; I bought those hoops of him which I sent to Child. As to the other charge of the iron spoken of by Hayward, and the other witnesses, I am innocent of that. As to Hayward he is a bad man, and has an anger against me; either of these witnesses would have said nothing at all, or spoke in my favour, if I had given them a guinea a piece.</p>

            . I have known Leverett six or seven years; he is a very worthy man. As to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200020"/> Hayward, last Monday I went with a woman, one Mrs. Hawkes, to a public house; she sent for Hayward; Hayward at last came into the house, and Mrs. Hawkes asked him if ever he saw Leverett buy or sell iron hoops; Hayward said I will not tell till I am in Court, and said that Leverett then used him ill, and beat him, and that he owed him money, and if he would not pay him he would transport him: this Mrs. Hawkes is a servant that lives with Leverett: He not only said if he would not pay him he would transport him, but likewise said if he would pay him he would favour him.</p>
               <p>- Brown. I have known Leverett ten years; he has an honest character.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Green. I have lodged in his house three months; I never saw Thomas bring any iron to the house; I never saw any iron of this kind in the house. I never saw any iron in the house but old iron, and no iron that had the broad arrow upon it.</p>

             I was neighbour to Mr. Holliday; I remember the day he was robbed; on the Wednesday after I went to Cuthbert's house to take a room there; he lives in Play-house-yard, White-cross-street; he keeps an old iron shop; when I was in his shop, Cuthbert applied to me; he said he had some butter to sell, and desired me to look at it; accordingly he carried me into the room I was to hire of him; there he shewed me two firkins of butter; I asked him how he came by it; he said a man who kept a chandler's shop being in distress had sent it him to sell; he offered me a bit of each of the firkins to taste; knowing of Mr. Holliday's being robbed, it came into my head this might be the butter; I refused to taste the butter, nay avoided taking any notice of the marks upon the tubs; I refused to buy any butter, and at the same time told him it belonged to a neighbour of mine; I told him his name and where he lived; upon that Cuthbert said if that was the case he would get it out of the way as soon as he could, for otherwise he might be ruined by this matter; when I came again in the afternoon of that day the butter was gone. The prisoner desired I would not discover it, therefore I did not tell Holliday I had seen this butter at Cuthbert's till after Barnsby was taken.</p>

            . Bradley, Croft and myself went that Saturday morning between four and five to this cellar door of Mr. Holliday's; we unlocked the padlock but found still the door did not open; that there was an inside lock to it, therefore I forced open the door. When I had got open Crofts went into the cellar, and took out three firkins; we first took one of these firkins a piece and carried it down to one Kemp's in Peter-street, Saffron-hill, and left them there, then we all three came back to the cellar; I only went down into the cellar the second time, and brought up two more firkins, and Crofts and

             each took one of them, when I came up without any thing in my hand; these two firkins were carried to Mr. Kemp's; after we had carried them to Kemp's, I went to Cuthbert's, and he asked who it was; upon my answering it is I, without telling my name, he got up, and let me into a passage in his shirt; as soon as he opened the door, I told him I had some butter, and asked him if he had bags; he went and fetched two sacks, and gave them to me; I took them and went to Kemp's; then all three came together with these sacks; Bradley brought two in one sack; I brought two in another, and Croft brought one firkin in another sack; we brought them to Cuthbert's, and by his direction laid them in a one-pair-of-stairs back room.</p>
               <p>Smith. That is the room I took.</p>
               <p>Barnsby. Then we went to one Wallace, who lives in Chick-lane, and told him we had some butter; he said he would not buy it unless it was very good; we agreed at last for a groat a pound, but Wallace, when we brought the butter to him, tasted it, and would not give so much for it. The same afternoon we took from Cuthbert's another firkin and part of a third firkin, and carried that to Green. Kemp bought part and Keeling had part. This day three weeks I went again to Cuthbert's; Cuthbert then told me he had sold some for kitchen stuff; he gave me 5 s. 3 d. in part, and said he would account for the rest when the whole was sold, and that he had not disposed of the other. Cuthbert knew this butter was stolen; he had dealt with me before for stolen goods. I was taken up about an affair after, and no more conversation with Cuthbert about the butter.</p>

               <p>The butter was left at my house by Bradley and Croft, about seven in the morning; Bradley came to me and desired to borrow two sacks, because his goods were seized. Bradley kept a chandler's shop and wanted to remove some butter; I lent him two sacks; Bradley went away with the sacks; some time after Crofts and he brought the sacks, containing five firkins of butter; I told them they might put them in that room up stairs, which they did; the next day they took two of them, and I insisted upon it they should take the other three, but in the interim Smith came to take a room; I shewed him the room where the butter was; I told him it was there to be sold; I told him it was a chandler in distress wanted to sell it; these people never came back for the butter. Smith told me a friend had lost some butter, but he did not mention the name of that friend. Being resolved to get rid of the butter I went to Croft and he fetched it away.</p>

            . On the 27th of August last my master and the family were in Yorkshire; I was left alone in the house; I went to bed about ten at night; all the doors and windows were fast; I arose about half after six o'clock in the morning; the first thing I observed was the dining room was open; the windows were fast; the door of the dining room I fastened last as I went to bed; I found a chest belonging to Mrs. Barton, who is now in France, and has been there nine months, in the room broke open; it was in a closet kept within the dining room; it was put in there, locked, a fortnight before, when the family went into the country; I had not seen it out of this closet till the morning when I found it broke open, and the closet door was open. I went down stairs and saw the office door and all the drawers except one open, and the back door to the garden was broke open, which door I am sure was fast when I went to bed; the bottom of the door was broke away; two pieces were taken out, one over the other, by which means the person could get into the house. As to any of the plate, and things mentioned in the indictment that have been lost, I can give no account of them, excepting two silver tea spoons marked E. P. they were

            . I am a watchmaker at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. On the 6th of September, about half after seven in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and enquired if I had good second hand watches to sell; I shewed him one; he liked it and asked the price; I said 55 s he said he was not a good judge of watches himself, but he had an acquaintance that lived in the town, and would bring him in half an hour; he asked me if I took plate in exchange; I said yes, if it was sterling and good. The prisoner returned in about half an hour with another man, whom I did not know then; his name is Simpson; he looked at the watch and liked it, and desired I would mention the lowest price; I said fifty shillings; then I desired the prisoner to shew me his plate; upon which he produced a silver waiter, two silver salts, a silver gilt cann and a silver flat-bottom candlestick; I looked at them several times; I suspected him and sent my apprentice for

I went home, and in an hour after was sent for to the Town-hall. The plate was delivered to one Finley, a serjeant at mace. (The silver waiter, gilt cann, salts and candlestick produced). they are the same the prisoner produced to me; I saw them put in the trunk to the other things at the Town-hall; the trunk was locked, and the key was delivered to the serjeant at mace.</p>

Between twelve and one I went, in company with Mr. Harrison, to one of the Aldermen, and carried the plate; returning to Mr. Harrison's, we met with Simpson. Between two and three we found the prisoner by the Key-side, at a shoemaker's house; I called him to the door and told him I was come for him that he might let the magistrate know how he came by the plate; he said he was very willing to do so, because he could give a clear account how he came by it, and accordingly went quietly into the Town-hall; I went for Mr. Harrison, and he came with me to the Court; the prisoner in the Town-hall delivered me these spoons out of his pocket; two that have been now produced I am sure are two of them.</p>

On the 6th of September, between two and three in the afternoon, I first saw the prisoner, in the Town Court, before Alderman Moseley; two spoons were taken out of his pocket. (The spoons shown him); they are the same. By Mr. Moseley's orders I went to one Mitchel's house, in High Bridge; there I found a trunk; it was locked; I brought it to the Court while the prisoner was there; Mr. Moseley asked him if he had the key of the trunk; he took the key out of his pocket, and Mr. Harrison opened the trunk or chest with the key; I saw a great quantity of plate, and all the things were locked up again in my presence, and the key delivered to me; I have kept the key ever since; the chest has been opened two or three times, but always in my presence; there was nothing taken out. When I went to Mrs. Mitchel's she gave me three small silver spoons, and another that was gilt; I brought them to the Town Court, and shewed them to the prisoner; he acknowledged them to be his, and said he had given them to the woman of the house; there was also a gold girdle (producing it); the prisoner acknowledged that girdle to be his.</p>

I went to Payne's, the pawnbroker, and asked for the watch; I had a warrant, but before I shewed the warrant I asked for the watch; when I shewed the man the warrant he seemed ill, and said he could not go out; he said if I would I might take the watch away; then I bid him put a mark upon it that he might know it again and he did.</p>

About two months ago I saw him go in and out of a house in the tent or ground near Long-alley; I saw him do that three or four times in the winter; the prisoner actually lived in that house; he had his workmen and his looms there; but they were brought from thence to Angel-alley, all but two looms, which were left still in the house at the Tenter Ground; he had carried on his trade four or five years in Angel-alley; he has not had this Tenter Ground house above nine months; he lived in that house with his wife and family last Christmas; at that time when he lived in the Tenter Ground his house in Angel-alley was shut up; he came back to Angel-alley last Lady-day, and then his family came with him; having observed this, and having heard some suspicious circumstances of the prisoner, I went to Wood-street Compter, and told what I suspected of the prisoner, and of his being in and out of this house, to one Mr. Berry, and Mr. Berry I suppose gave information to my Lord Mayor, and therefore I had notice to attend the City Marshal on the 10th of September last; accordingly I met Mr. Gates, the City Marshal, at the door of this house in the Tenter Ground, on the 10th of September, about two in the afternoon; Mr. Gates went in to search the house; there was nobody in the house. Mr. Wright has not only that house but two or three in the Tenter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200031"/> Ground. He was at work three or four months ago at Angel-alley.</p>

            ; when we came there, which was about one or two o'clock at noon, I looked in at the hole in the cellar window, and there I observed a bench, some sand and some water, which looked suspicious, as it appeared as if it had been used for scowering or cleaning copper; this satisfied me my information was right; then I broke open the door; I went into the fore parlour; there I found a book with receipts; in the back parlour I found a cutting engine, for cutting blanks out of copper in order to coin halfpence; sheets or strips of copper are laid in the engine, then with one blow the engine will strike through the sheet or bit of copper, and cut out a round piece like a halfpenny; it had not any cutting materials in it, but it was fitted to receive such cutting materials. From the back parlour I went into the cellar, and there I found the stamping engine with two dyes in it; these dyes had the impression of each side of a halfpenny; the upper dye one impression, the under dye another impression; there was in the engine a halfpenny between the two dyes; that halfpenny has been mislaid. I found this half-penny (producing it) lying in a grove of this engine, and which is exactly the same piece of coin; I presume that halfpenny was left between the dyes left the two dyes should rub and hurt one another; at that time the dyes themselves were not cold, so that they had been very lately used. There were lying there besides, some of these round blanks of copper, and likewise cecel, which are remains of these strips of copper after the round dyes have been punched out of it; there was likewise at the same time a fire in the room, in a stove grate, and the engine appeared to have been very lately oiled, for the sake of going easier; there was likewise in a sack in the same room at least a peck of blanks hanging up in a sack like a hammock; they polish them by that-means, putting sand and emery among these blanks into the sack, and shaking them very well together; they will rub against one another, and by that means they gain a considerable degree of polish. Then I went up into the garret of the same house, and there I saw another cutting engine; the cutting instruments were still in that engine; it appeared to me that somebody had been lately at work at that engine in the garret because there was lying by a large quantity of this cicel very bright; there were besides in the cellar a number more dyes that were worn out with use. I found in the garret a large pair of shears, which were very proper to slip sheets of copper into such strips as they use when they punch the blanks out of them. The whole time we were in the house was about two hours. The engines were taken away and carried to the Mansion-house. After that I went in search of the prisoner to his house in Angel-alley; I could not find him there; the next day we found him in Southwark. On the next day in Wood-street Compter I searched him, and found these papers upon him (producing them). When he was carried before my Lord Mayor, he said he had let the house to some people, and could not be answerable for what other people might have done in that house.</p>

               <p>Flowers. Yes; if he had an engine to do it, but he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure they are not his work?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Yes; he said he was wickedly drawn into it by Hayward. When we took Hayward he said he had employed this man three years, that he gave him shelis to work, and money to buy shells; he said he gave him sometimes a shilling, sometimes eighteen-pence to buy them; it is impossible to buy mother o'pearl of this quality for eighteen-pence; he said before Sir John that was the most he ever gave him. On his cross examination, he said, a frame before it was worked up was worth two-pence; that he could not describe how he knew them to be his, nor could any one that had not served seven years apprenticeship to it, but that he knew his own work.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Flowers. On the 28th of September as I was at work near the prisoner. I saw him take some mother o'pearl frames out of a paper that lay by him, and put them in his waistcoat pocket; I was turning frames and he was making drops; the frames were laid there for the man at the next bench to him to pick a pair out of them; he was going to dinner; I did not say any thing to him; I was going to tell my master but was prevented. On the Thursday night I saw him polish some drops and put them in his pocket; I told my master of it that night; I went with my master and the constable to search Hayward's house, and the frames fitted to pins in his house. I have been apprentice to Flowers six years; I am used to turn and drill these frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the frames whose work are they?</p>
               <p>Loton. William Blakesley's; I know the work of every man in the shop because they all come through my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How does Blakesley work?</p>
               <p>Loton. I cannot describe it; they lie in a different form rather to another man's work. When we went into Mr. Hayward's house my master told him he had a warrant for him, and on what account; he denied knowing any thing of it; he said he had employed Morris, and had a man at work up stairs; we searched his house and found the frames and some drops; we went up stairs; there was no man at work, and the lairs proper for this work had not been used a great while; they were very dirty and rusty. On his cross examination he said the frames were quite plain when they came out of Blakesley's hands; that since that holes had been drilled in them, which makes them feel not quite so smooth.</p>

            . I am a pearl-stringer; I finish them; I have bought frames of Flowers after they have been drilled and worked them up for Hayward; it is customary to go and buy these kind of things when we have not time to work them up ourselves. It is impossible to know one man's work from another.</p>

               <p>- Carter. I keep a public house in Leadenhall-street: the prisoner was in my house the 22d of September, drinking a pint of beer; Mr. Plomer sent for me, and told me he was under an apprehension that the prisoner had been robbing him of some soap, and asked me if I ever knew of any being brought to my house; Mr. Plomer went with me and stood at the door; I went in and told him somebody wanted him at the door; he saw Mr. Plomer, and did not go directly, but staid to drink his beer, and then went to make water; Mr. Plomer came in and took him away; I looked under the place where he had his beer, and found the soap; I do not know who left it there; I had not looked in that place I suppose a twelve-month before. On his cross examination, he said the prisoner denied taking the soap at first, and then he said he took it for his own use; that he told him if he confessed, he believed Mr. Alderman Plomer would pardon him for so trifling an offence if he confessed it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not tell him you had any authority from Mr. Plomer to promise him that?</p>
               <p>Carter. No, but that it was my opinion.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. It was the means that induced him to confess?</p>
               <p>Carter. I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Thomas Street. I am the constable that took him; when he was before the Aldermen he said it was the first offence, and begged the Alderman to pardon him.</p>

               <p>The offence I am charged with I am innocent of; no man living can say I took the soap.</p>

            . The prisoner had lived with Mrs. Pleydell near a month; Mrs. Pleydell sent for me, and desired me to go up stairs and tax her with it; I said Melia, Melia, what have you done? there is a child somewhere; she cried and trembled very much; she said she had occasion to go to the vault, and was delivered upon the vault. I saw the child about an hour after, when it was taken out of the vault; it was a male child.</p>

            . I am a midwife: the beadle fetched me on the 29th of August to Mrs. Pleydell's; I went up stairs; I found the prisoner sitting up in a bed in the garret; I saw from circumstances something was the matter; I asked her what was the matter; she said nothing; I told her I suspected she had been delivered of a child; she said she had not had a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Holmes there then?</p>
               <p>Bowman. I believe she was; directly upon that, the daughter of the woman of the house said, the prisoner had owned it was down the necessary; I told them the necessary must be opened; it was opened and the child was taken up; I saw it about a quarter of an hour after it was taken up; it was a fine child; there were no marks of violence upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search it narrowly?</p>
               <p>Bowman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it's neck?</p>
               <p>Bowman. I did observe every part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is a possible thing that a woman might be surprised and delivered at a necessary?</p>
               <p>Bowman. She said the child came from her at the necessary, and it was possible to be so; I knew an instance of a married lady, in great credit, very near like it; she desired to go to the necessary; I objected to it; she did not suppose herself so near delivery; she went there; she was taken very bad, and the child dropt before I got her to the bed.</p>

We asked Mrs. Brookhouse as we came down stairs, what she had done with the other; she said her husband had taken a parcel away, and sold it in Brook-street, Grosvenor-square; we searched after this house; it proved to be Gibson's, the other prisoner; we went to his house; he was not at home then; we found him at home at one o'clock; on being questioned about any thing he had had of Brookhouse, he readily produced some moreen, and said he had nothing else; at last he owned he had two rolls of carpeting above stairs which he fetched down out of a cupboard in the garret. (They were produced and deposed to by the prosecutor). Brook-house was the man that brought them to him, and was to call again for them, but that he had not bought them of Brookhouse; here are eleven yards of Wilton, and eight yards of Scorch carpet, charged in this indictment.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Williams; after my master was gone out of town, on the 6th of October, about seven in the evening, I met the prisoner with a piece of carpeting; I stopped him and said, where are you going with that? he said, for God's sake, do not inform Mr. Williams, I shall be ruined! At his entreaty I let him go; I followed him in order to find out where he carried it, but missed him in Rose-street; I could not exactly see the house he went into; the next day he came and opened the shop as usual, but I did not see him there all the rest of the day; the same evening when I saw the carpeting upon his arm, after I missed the house he went into, that evening about eight o'clock, he sent for me to the Black Horse, and then repeated it that I would not let Mr. Williams know, for it would ruin him; I promised I would not; on Friday morning he came while I was there; we went first to a public house; then we took a walk together; as we were walking together he said he had been a foolish fellow in what he had done, for Mr. Williams had been a very good master to him; he said he could not get that piece of carpeting again, for he had sold it outright to Brookhouse for four shillings; but said he, you had better tell Mr. Williams, or I will tell him myself: for I am very uneasy he should be so wronged; Brookhouse has advised me to take every thing I could lay my hands on; I was present when the first things were taken at Brookhouse's shop.</p>
               <p>Blanchville Clarke. I am a constable: I was at Gibson's house; I asked him first if he knew Brookhouse; he acknowledged readily that he did; I asked him first where were the moreens and things brought to him the other night by Brook-house; he readily said they were up stairs, he would bring them down, and went and brought them down; then I asked about some lace; that he acknowledged in the same manner; he opened his bureau and shewed it us; then I asked him about the carpeting; he at first said he had no more things from Brookhouse; on threatening to search the house, he said he would go up and fetch the carpeting; he went up, opened the cupboard and took out the two pieces, sworn to by the prosecutor, and delivered them up; he said he had not bought them; that he had lent Brookhouse 3 l. upon some of the other things; but as for the carpets, he had not bought them; Brookhouse had left them there, but he was to call for them.</p>

            . I live in Rose-street, Long-acre; about a fortnight ago, Wison<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200044"/> brought me a piece of Wilton carpet as a remnant which he had to dispose of; he asked half a guinea for it; which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. What is that worth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. About 40 s.</p>
               <p>Brookhouse. In a day or two after, he brought the piece of Scotch carpet; I gave him 7 s. for that; he said he had this to dispose of for a person in the Compter that wanted money; a week after this, I carried them to Gibson; I said I had bought these two pieces of carpet, and had a mind to dispose of them again; Gibson asked if they were honestly come by; he did not put the question to me till after the money was paid; for he offered at once 9 s. for the Scotch carpet, and 2 s. a-yard, which was 22 s. for the Wilton: and therefore it struck into my mind, when Gibson gave me so much more than the man had sold them to me for, that these things might be stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I sold Brookhouse these things; he was the man that induced me to rob my master.</p>
               <p>Gibson. I leave my defence to my counsel; Brookhouse brought them to me; they were left with me; I did not buy them; Brookhouse said they were the goods of a person in distress who wanted to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>He called four upholdsterers and cabinet makers of reputation, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Can you give any reason why Gibson was prosecuted rather than Brook-house? Brookhouse certainly deserves punishment?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I wanted to prosecute Brookhouse; but Sir John made a witness of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the reason why?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>

            . The prisoner acknowledged as to the bed curtains that he stole them, and said he had sold a number of things to Hoffien, who kept the shop before Brookhouse came there; besides these bed curtains I lost a looking glass. On hearing this account from the prisoner, on the 8th of October I enquired of Brookhouse where Hoffien lived; he directed me to Lime-house; I found him in Three Colt-street; I searched his house; at first I found nothing belonging to me; at last, in one of the rooms I saw this looking glass hang; it struck me; it was a looking glass I had lost; I lifted it up; I found my mark upon the back of it; I can be sure it was my property; I wondered to see it there, for it was packed up before Christmas last in a case with many other things in order to go to America, but the case had not been sent away; I went home to look at it, and found the top of the case had been opened, and six looking glasses taken out of the parcel, and six left behind; by the mark on the looking glass I am sure this is one I had so packed up; I asked Hoffien where he had it; he said he could not tell. As to the curtains, I found them at Brookhouse's shop; he said he bought them of Hoffien; one of them lay upon Brookhouse's bed; the other hung up at the window; I found the rest in some drawers at Brookhouse's; I am sure the curtains are mine; they are my work; I had not seen them for a twelve-month before.</p>

            . I know nothing of the looking glass; we took this house of Hoffien, about the middle of the quarter after last Midsummer; Hoffien was to continue a month in the house, in order to shew us this business; it was during this month that Wilson brought in the curtains; Hoffien was there in the house when Wilson brought them; Wilson shewed the curtains to Hoffien; I did not stay to make any bargain; I left Hoffien and Wilson in the shop, whilst I went out to change a guinea; I was absent about ten minutes; when I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200045"/> Wilson was in the shop with Hoffien; Hoffien took hold of my hand, and counted my fingers to the number eight; I did not know the meaning of that; the reason of doing that was because there were other people at that time in the shop; but as soon as these people were gone out of the shop, then he explained it, and bid me give eight shillings for the curtains, accordingly I did do it. The manner in which Wilson brought the curtains was, he laid them down in the shop, and then Hoffien took them up and measured them; Hoffien told me, after Wilson was gone, that he had bought a good bargain for me, and delivered me the curtains. The next day Hoffien carried my mother up to look at these curtains, which were carried up stairs, and Hoffien shewed the curtains to my mother, and said he had bought a good bargain for Mrs. Brookhouse; these are the curtains.</p>

               <p>I stole both the looking glass and curtains. As to the curtains, I sold them to Mrs. Brook-house; as to the looking glass that I did sell to Hoffien, but he was in bed at the time I sold it to his wife.</p>

At nine at night I sent my wife from the market to get supper; she was absent twenty minutes: then she came back and said my house had been robbed; I saw all these things there when I went out at five in the afternoon; there were forty guineas in a cupboard locked up in the same room; I saw that money there on Saturday morning; when I went out in the afternoon I left nobody at home; on my wife's giving me this information I hurried home. My wife had locked the street door; it had been opened and locked again by my wife.</p>

            . My husband sent me home, but when I came to unlock the door I found it bolted on the inside that I could not open it; somebody within unbolted it whilst I was at the door. I found the back door standing wide open, and when I went up stairs I missed the plate and the money. Upon opening the house, the back door I had left latched (for I took particular notice it was latched when I pulled it to) that I found open; it is a latch that might be opened on the outside of the house. When I went up stairs this cupboard door where the plate was kept was open; the room was in disorder, and all the plate gone, and the money gone out of the closet in the room, and a great deal of wearing apparel taken away; I alarmed my neighbours; there was a girl gave some information; upon which I went to Sir

            . Bradley, Crofts, and I, were at the Sun in Green Arbour-court one afternoon drinking; Carter came in, and called Bradley out; he staid with him about ten minutes and then came in again; then Bradley called me out and said now is the time to go and rob Keep's house, they are both out at market. Accordingly I, Crofts, Bradley and Carter went out together; Carter went first; at last Bradley stopped and said this is the place; accordingly I got over the wall and Crofts followed me over; Bradley and Carter staid on the outside of the wall; I went and opened the latch of the back door; it being dark I went back to the wall after I had opened the door; there I found Bradley and Carter; I told them I wanted a light; Carter wanted to go away; presently he fetched me a tinder box and candle, which I gave him; he took the tinder box and candle and went back into the house with Crofts; there he struck a light; presently after this Bradley came over the wall and came to me; we all three went into the house together; we went up stairs and plundered the drawers; then we went to the corner cupboard; we took away the plate; I do not know the particulars; there were table spoons and salts among them. After that we went to the closet in the same room; Crofts broke it open; I saw money lying in two boxes when they broke them open; there was gold in one box and silver in the other; Bradley and Crofts took the money while I was searching and packing up the linen I found there; Bradley ran down stairs, I and Crofts went after him; Carter had the handkerchief that had the linen; we went over the wall; Carter was gone; he was there when I came back for the light, but was gone after we had robbed the house; Bradley then went, as I believe, to Carter, to the Sun ale-house, and Crofts helped me up with the linen, and then Crofts and I went to one Muling's, in Blue-court, Saffron-hill; I left the linen there all night; Crofts and I then went to the Sun, and found Bradley and Carter together; we paid the reckoning there; then we all four came out of the Sun together; as we went along Carter wanted some money, and Crofts gave him a guinea. Carter had refused at first to go and be concerned in breaking open the house; he said he would be satisfied with a guinea, and would desire nothing more of us; then Carter left us. Then Crofts, Bradley, and I, went to Saffron Hill; there we shared the money; my share of the money came to twelve pounds. Though Carter at first said he would be contented with a guinea, and would not accept of any other share in the money, yet a day or two after I met him, and he insisted he should have a share of the money, and if we did not give him a share of it, he would give information against Bradley. On Monday afternoon we sold the plate for six guineas and a half; that was shared with myself, Crofts, and Bradley. I had no share of the linen, Crofts and Bradley made a hand of that.</p>

I know Mr. Chilton; I have employed him in other business; I went to Mr. Chilton with it, and asked him to settle a little note for me; I spoke of it to him; I said it would be attended with expence, but I could not put myself to expence; Chilton said if I would deliver it into his hands it should cost me nothing. At the same time gave him the bill; I do not know that I ever gave him any authority; I always understood that Mr. Howell was the person beneficially interested in the note, though I knew Chilton was carrying on the suit; I always thought it was carrying on for me; I enquired about it; Chilton asked me for money, and Chilton got two shirts from me in discharge of this bill. After there had been some conversation between us, I offered to pay Chilton two guineas, and advised him against putting the note in suit against Mr. Howell; I told him Mr. Howell would prosecute him if he did it; I said it was wrong to think of Howell as paymaster, and then made a proposal that the note and judgment should be delivered up, and then the indictment should be set aside; that if he could have an effectual remedy upon Hill, then I undertook that the indictment should be suspended.</p>
               <p>There was a paper shewn the witness, written by the defendant, and signed by the witness, containing an authority from him to the defendant to put the note in suit. The witness acknowledged the signing to be his hand writing, but denied a knowledge of the contents; he said the defendant desired him to sign it, as something necessary by way of form, but that he never read it, and was totally ignorant of the contents.</p>
