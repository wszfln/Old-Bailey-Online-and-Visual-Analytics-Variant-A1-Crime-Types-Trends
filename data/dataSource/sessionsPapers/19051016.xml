I am a wardress in the infirmary at Holloway prison—the prisoners have been there for about a fortnight—mostly I made them understand by signs—I can speak very little French—as a rule they understood very well—the doctor thought they would be happier in the hospital; they were very miserable in prison—I tried to communicate with them in English, but I could not make them under<lb/>stand—they made various attempts at speaking to me in French—occas<lb/>sionally I tried to make them speak in English, but never succeeded in getting them to understand.</p>

I am a clerk in the Crown Office, and pro<lb/>duce an affidavit sworn on August 24th on the hearing of an application for bail on behalf of Patrach and Ferrai—it is a joint affidavit of Joseph Ferrai and Antoinne Patrach—one paragraph sets out where the prisoner Ferrai was in May, and reads: "The 25th, 26th, and 27th May my wife was with me at Boulevard Croisy, Rouen. She has never previously been in England since we were married"—on the face of the affidavit there is, "Sworn at Broad Court Chambers, Bow Street, in the County of London, on the 24th August, 1905, through the interpretation of Jules Renancalf, of 15, Store Street, Tottenham Court Road, in the County of London. The said Jules Renancalf, having first been sworn, said that he would faith<lb/>fully and truly translate the contents of this affidavit to the deponents, Joseph Ferrai and Antoinne Ferrai, and that he would faithfully and truly interpret the oath about to be administered to them."</p>

I was watching all your movements last night. I saw you go in the grocer's shop, then along of some man to post a letter in the pillar box. I walked the side of you last night down Riversdale Road, and you did not know me, so it will be easy for me to do what I want to do if you don't send me some money to-night. G. S. Bring some money outside Surrey Theatre, Blackfriars Road, to-night"—the envelope is addressed, "Mrs. Stokes, 65, Riversdale Road, Highbury"—I also received this letter, dated September 6th: "Mrs. Stokes, you have not sent me any money, so look out. Revenge is sweet, and my knife is sharp"—I think all the letters came by post, but the first one was not paid for, and we had to pay 2d.—we sent two letters to the police station, the third we had sent to the prisoner's sister at St. Albans—it was the one dated September 5th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Wagner &amp; Brandon, manufacturers and agents, of Aldermanburv Building, E.C.—Young had been in our service as porter for four years, carrying goods from one place to another—he had nothing to do with buying or selling—at the annual stocktaking on June 20th we missed about 100 hair nets—at the end of July we missed about six gross in one number, And when we took the stock at the beginning of October we missed thirty odd gross—in consequence of that on October 2nd I had a con<lb/>versation with Young, and he made a confession to me—I sent for the police and gave him into custody—I afterwards went with the police to Freedman's small draper's shop in Crystal Palace Road, East Dulwich where I saw in the window some fringe nets—I spoke to a little girl who was passing, and after giving her some money she went into the shop—she brought out two hair nets in an envelope (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), one of them wrapped in this piece of tissue paper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they are of the kind missed by me—she handed them to me—with detectives Marriott and Board I went into the shop—Marriot told Freedman that they were police officers; that they had the lad Young in custody, who had made a voluntary statement that he had taken a lot of nets belonging to Messrs. Wagner &amp; Brandon; that Young had also made a confession that he had sold the goods to him (Freedman)—Freedman denied having had any hair nets from Young, but said that he had met a lad about ten months ago, he thought it was in Milton Street, and had had some con<lb/>versation with him, but he had had no dealings with him since—the detectives said they would search his shop and see if he had any goods—we went through several boxes and in one of them I picked out eighteen hair nets which I identified as mine, principally by the packing and the length, which is a little longer than is usually made in this number; they are made abroad specially for me—according to my direction the mesh is a little larger than usual, and that is what makes it longer—also one of the nets is darker than is usual—I also found some tissue paper which is similar to the tissue paper in which one of the nets obtained by the little girl was wrapped—it was tissue paper that came over with the hair nets which I ordered from abroad—it has little squares in it which I have never seen in any other tissue paper—I had not used any of it, and no goods of mine which left my premises properly were wrapped up in it—he also produced these three stocking suspenders (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which I identified as mine, as the attachment to the corset is my patent—when suspenders are properly sold from my premises they are wrapped up like this—when found in Freedman's shop they were loose—there is nothing to stop the purchaser unwrapping them—we had only sold three dozen of that particular number of suspender from March to June in London, and there was one house who put them on their pattern card last July; they sold a few dozen, but I feel sure they went to the country,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160015"/>
               <p>because only country travellers came—we sell our hair nets at about 32s. to 35s. a gross wholesale, getting about 10 per cent, profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have a very large business in these nets and we sell large quantities of them—I would not like to say we are the only makers of the particular length of those nets the little girl purchased—one of these nets is 63 to 64 centimetres and 40 to 42 meshes; you can get various quantities of meshes into 64 centimetres—40 to 42 meshes is not the universal length—I am not sure that that other net is ours—I do not identify them by the colour—I am not at all doubtful about the ones found in Freedman's shop; I only took those which I thought I could absolutely identify as my property—we sell about 200 or 300 gross in six months; we are wholesale and sell them to retailers in London, and they undoubtedly sell them to men in Freedman's position—we sell stocking suspenders to Rotheran's—I know there is an auction room in Milton street and it is possible that men in Freedman's position would buy job lots of haberdashery there—our customers employ Button's, the carriers, to fetch goods; they pay carriage—I know that a quantity of goods was lost by Sutton which was afterwards sold by Fryer &amp; Cooper, but they were not nets—we employ a good many men and women workers in the factory and warehouse—I do not know of any other loss in hair nets but through Young; I can put my finger on no one else and we have dealt with it in every way possible—we suspect no one else—we had full faith in Young and he had the keys of the warehouse—when we went to Freedman's shop he had some of the nets in the window, "which we asked him to produce—he said he had bought the goods at an auctioneer's; I think he mentioned the name of Fryer &amp; Cooper, and he gave a catalogue to the detective—I have the particulars of what we lost through Sutton, and I have every reason to believe Young when he said he lost them—he lost them in Button's yard—we communicated with Sutton and they tried to trace them—it may have been that Young stole them—amongst them were twenty "Trixy" suspenders—I do not know whether the goods were sold; we have not recovered them—we might have sold 150 to 200 dozen of these suspenders in the country; they run from 4s. 6d. a dozen upwards—they are not articles that can be purchased on a barrow from a hawker; it may be possible, but I should say it is most exceptional—I cannot get hair nets at 14s. to 18s. a gross; you are thinking of the silk nets—I know Jacobs &amp; Wolf, of Hounsditch, and I think they are in a large way of business—I should say the price of these nets which you say have been bought at their place (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is from 24s. to 27s. a gross—ours are larger and of much better quality than these.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nineteen years of age—I have pleaded guilty to this indictment and am ready to tell the truth about the matter—I was a porter in the service of Wagner &amp; Brandon and I took out par<lb/>cels and goods for them—about fifteen months ago I was going along Milton Street from Featherstone Street with a parcel that had printed on it "Ladies' fringe nets" and the name and address of certain cus<lb/>tomers, when I met Freedman in company with two gentlemen outside</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160016"/>
               <p>the auction rooms—he left them and stopped me as I was going along—he said, "Does your master sell job lines?" and I said, "No, we sell to all the big firms in the City," and pointing to "Tubbs &amp; Hiscock's" I said, "We sell to that firm"—he said, "Can you get any?"—I asked him what he meant, and he said, "You know"—I said, "All right; I will try"—he gave me his card, which had on it, "Mr. Freedman, 112, Crystal Palace Road"; I am not quite sure whether it said what he was—I afterwards showed it to Mr. Hodson, and then tore it up—the prisoner promised me 10s. for one gross—the parcel I was carrying hat not the name of the firm on it—he asked me where I was employed and I told him "Wagner &amp; Brandon's, I, Aldermanbury Buildings"—he said, "I will be here next Tuesday. Do not forget to meet me"—between that and the next Tuesday I got a gross of hair nets from the governor's drawer, of which I had the keys—I had stolen nothing before then—I met Freedman on the Tuesday at the same place and we both went to Basinghall Street, where I handed him the goods—he gave me 4s., and I said, "Is this all?"—he said, "I will give you the rest next time, as I am very short of cash. Do not forget to meet me next Tuesday, if you can"—the next Tuesday I met him at the same place with one more gross—we both went to Paper Street and he gave me 7s. for it—after that I took him some every other week—some weeks he gave me 5s. and some weeks 4s. 6d. and 4s.—on one occasion I got him two gross, when he gave me 10s.—the highest I have got for a gross is 7s.—I spent the money in getting good dinners and backing horses—I lost except once or twice—on the Tuesday before I was caught he said, "I have got a special order for three gross, one light colour, one mid colour and one dark colour," and I told him I could not get him too many—the gross that I gave him that day was the last he had—I was caught on the next Monday, October 2nd—he never had the three gross—about three months ago he asked me once if we sold anything else and I said stocking suspenders, and he told me to fetch him a sample—I met him at Fryer &amp; Cooper's and gave him eight, for which he gave me 3d. and Is. for myself—they are sold by my master at 4s. 6d. a dozen—at his request I went to his shop in Crystal Palace Road with nets about four times—Arthur Wadsworth, a friend of mine, came with me two or three times—I asked him to lend me 6d. for riding money, which he did, and when I got the money from Freedman I paid him Is., 6d. his expenses and 6d. I had borrowed—I asked him to come as a favour—he is eighteen years old and helps in a glass beveller's shop; I believe he is out of work now, but he was at Newton's then—we went by a train from Ludgate Hill—when I borrowed the sixpence it was eight or nine months ago—he has been with me since—we used to go on Thursdays, and the last time he came with me was about six weeks before August Bank Holiday—on Monday, October 2nd, I made a full confession to Mr. Brandon and since then I have been in prison—Wadsworth came to see me once in prison—I had 15s. wages—I sold Freedman about sixty gross altogether—six or seven weeks ago I sold about seven gross of nets to another man who had nothing to do with Freedman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew the difference between right and wrong when I met Freedman first; I had been three and a half years in Wagner &amp; Brandon's employ—I believe that morning I had called at Tubbs &amp; His<lb/>cock's to see if they had any orders—the man whom I sold the other nets to was called Strutt—I made the statement before the Magistrate that I had sold Strutt seven gross, but that was not accepted and he was discharged—sometimes Strutt gave me 2s. 6d. and sometimes 3s. a gross, but they were only small nets—I am certain I sold to nobody else but him and Freedman—I lost two parcels at Button's—I do not know what they contained; I do not think it was suspenders, but haberdashery of some kind; I know there were some steels that go into ladies' stays—I do not know that they were afterwards sold at Fryer &amp; Cooper's—as far as I know, there were no other goods lost through any other employes—I do not know that a great many other goods were lost and can be traced besides those that I was dealing with—I first told Wadsworth all about this two months ago, and he said he would not do it if he <hi rend="italic">was me</hi>—I told no one in my master's employ till I told Mr. Brandon—I did not mention anything about Wadsworth in my statement, because I never thought of him until I saw him in the Police Court—I was not present when Freed<lb/>man told Mr. Brandon and the detective that he had had no dealings with me; he once said to me, "You have made a nice <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> of it"—they did not say that if I made a statement I would not

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, City</hi>). On October 2nd Young made a statement to me which I wrote down and he signed—in consequence of what he said on that day, I went to Freedman's place in Crystal Palace Road with Mr. Brandon and another officer—outside Mr. Brandon sent in a little girl, who brought out two nets in a little parcel—we went in and saw Freedman—I told him we were police officers and that we had got a lad in custody in the City who had made a statement in which he said that he had been in the habit of supplying him (Freedman) with a quantity of fringe nets—I then gave him an outline of the statement, in reply to which he said, "I did speak to a boy in Milton Street. I noticed he had a large envelope with 'Fringe nets' on it. I asked him where he worked and he told me some name, but I forget. I then asked him if his master had any job lots"—I told him we were going to search his shop and he assisted us by fetching down some boxes—Mr. Brandon picked out eighteen hair nets and three stocking suspenders from various boxes—I asked Freedman how he accounted for the possession of the fringe nets, and he said, "I bought them under the hammer either in Milton Street or Hounsditch a few months ago"—he said that he had bought the suspenders in a job lot at Fryer &amp; Cooper's sale on July 11th this year, and at the same time he handed me this catalogue, dated July 11th (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there is no mention of suspenders in it and I have been right through it—Mr. Brandon said, "These are my goods, and I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160018"/>
               <p>going to give you into custody"—I asked Freedman if he had got any invoices for the fringe nets, and he looked through his papers—he showed me lots of papers, but nothing relating to fringe nets or suspenders—I took him to Moor Lane police station, where he was confronted with Young, whose statement was read to him, to which he said nothing (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I live at 25, Ashford Place, Walthamstow. About eighteen months ago I was in Milton Street with a parcel of fringe net envelopes. A man I know now by the name of Freedman and living at 152, Crystal Palace Road, stopped me and asked me if my governor sold any job lines. I said, 'No.' He then said, 'Can you get any?' I said, 'I will try.' He said, 'I will give you 10s. for a gross.' He then gave me his card with his name and address on. In a few days I got a gross, met him in Milton Street, and gave them to him. He gave me 4s. for them and promised me double the amount next time. The following week I got another gross, met him by arrangement at the same place, gave them to him, and he gave me 7s. I have given him a gross every other week since, the last time being last Tuesday. About seven weeks ago I took eight suspenders, for which he gave me 3d. On three occasions I have taken them (the nets) to his shop in Crystal Palace Road. I should think he has had about sixty gross altogether and has paid me at the rate of about 5s. per gross. About three weeks ago I was in conversation with Harry Strutt, who lives in the third house on the right in Hartley Crescent, Walthamstow. I told him I was working in the fringe net trade. He said, 'I know where to sell some if you get any.' I have got about seven gross at different times. He has paid me 3s. or 4s. a gross for them. <hi rend="smallCaps">F. YOUNG</hi>."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not warn Freedman before I asked him any<lb/>thing—I went with Young's statement, which is in my handwriting, in my pocket—I wrote it down from what he told me at the station—I made out a rough draft and then wrote it out fresh—I warned Young before he made it; I had had no conversation with Mr. Brandon then—I did not warn Freedman, because he was not in custody; I simply went to make inquiries—some hair nets were in the window—there were a very few nets indeed in the shop—there were eighteen identified and perhaps another eighteen which were not—there were only three suspended there—I did not hear him say in the presence of Brandon that he had had no dealings with Young—if I had heard him say it, it would have been in the note which I made at the time—it might have been said to Mr. Brandon at the other end of the shop; I put down everything I heard—I have made inquiries about Freedman and find that he has been carrying on an honest business; I cannot say for what length of time; we found nothing against him—my inquiries go back for three or four years—he took the catalogue from his jacket pocket, in which he had a number of other catalogues—I did not ask him for any accounts—I saw a number of slips like this (<hi rend="italic">Auctioneer's account slip, produced</hi>)—I believe he has purchased goods from Fryer &amp; Cooper; in fact he purchased two lots out of the catalogue of July 11th—I only made inquiries about the sale on July 11th.</p>

I lent him—this was on Thursday evening after I had done work—I left off at 7 p.m., and I met him about 7.20, getting to Crystal Palace Road at 8.15—each of the other two times I went with him he had a parcel which he gave to Freedman—it was only the first time that he borrowed money from me—the other two times were on a Thursday evening, and Freedman always paid him at the door; his shop was open.</p>

               <p>wife had said—he said he was carrying on business as a dressmaker at South Molton Street, that it was his business, although his wife carried it on in her name, that they wanted to take in lodgers and wanted £36 to buy furniture with, and that they only wanted it till his wife's mother had got the proceeds of the stocks and shares which she had given orders to sell in Germany—he showed me certain furniture there—I said there was not enough to lend money on a bill of sale—he then said, "Oh, there is a lot more now on its way from Germany, particularly two large wardrobes similar to the one you see now, and my wife's mother is coming over and she will bring over a large amount of linen, china, glass and cutlery, and that can be included"—I said I would wait to see what came over—the furniture that I saw there included two mirrors, a large wardrobe, some engravings, two superior lounge chairs and settee, a large Brussels carpet and other things that I cannot now recollect—on April 10th I again went to Frithville Gardens—I saw the prisoner there—Krause went with me—I was shown a considerable amount of china, glass and cutlery, also two large wicker baskets containing linen and in particular two absolutely new bedsteads—I said to the prisoner, referring to the bedsteads, "I suppose these are not on hire?"—he said they had come over from Germany—his wife's mother was there then—I did not speak to her, as she was supposed not to be able to speak English—I took measure<lb/>ments of the furniture which Krause gave me and made an inventory of it—as a result I had a bill of sale drawn up and a statutory declaration—Krause translated both of them to the prisoner in my presence, and the prisoner's wife, who speaks perfect English, also read it over and told him the purport of it and the declaration—I thought as he was a foreigner it would be advisable, although not necessary, to get the bill of sale taken before a solicitor, so I took the prisoner and his wife over to Mr. Mills, whom I did not know, but who was a Commissioner a short distance away—Mr. Milk explained the effect of the bill of sale to him in English—the prisoner said, "Yes, yes, I understand"—it was then executed by the prisoner in Mr. Mill's presence and he attested it, and the prisoner and his wife also made the declaration before Mr. Mills—I then handed over to the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Mills £30 in bank notes—I took this receipt—the first instalment of the repayment and interest was due on May 11th and the others monthly—I called on the prisoner and asked him about the pay<lb/>ments—he said he was expecting money from his brother in Germany, who was worth £35,000, and as soon as he got it he would pay me—I did not receive the June instalment—I called on him at Frithville Gardens in June, but found the house empty—I made enquiries and went to Lur<lb/>line Gardens, Battersea—whilst trying to find the prisoner I met Krause—from what he told me I returned—next morning I received a letter from the prisoner's wife, and as a result I instructed a bailiff to seize the prisoner's furniture—it was put up to auction and realised £7 10s. gross And £5 10s. nett—I did not get the whole of the furniture seized, as prisoner's wife claimed all the linen, china, glass and cutlery, and Mr. Symons, of the Uxbridge Road, claimed the two bedsteads which were included in the bill of sale—if I had known the bedsteads were hired</p>

Your uncle picked the head out of the lavatory pan"—she did not answer and I said, "What have you done with the body?"—she said, "It is in the wash-house"—she told me that at once—I went there and found the trunk of a child behind a box on which I kept my washing tub—it is an egg box about 2 1/2 feet high—it was just a little way from the wall—there was just room for the body of the child, but none to spare—I just looked round and I could bee it—I moved the box a bit, when I saw it, to get at it—when I went into the room I looked round because I did not know where she had put it—I had to look behind the box before I could see the body—it was a small wash-house and has in it a wringer, a few boards, a pail and a washing tub—it is not a place where we sat; there are no chairs or tables—I do the washing and mangling every day if it is necessary, and some<lb/>times on Sundays—there may be times when I do not go into the wash-house all day—we have water in the kitchen as well—if I do not go into the wash-house perhaps my daughter does—the wash-house opens into the yard—there is no way into it except by the yard—the w.c. adjoins it,</p>

I am a tailoress and live with Mr. and Mrs. Abrahams at 65, Wellesley Street—on the morning of August 4th I was asleep in the same room as the prisoner—I first got up about daybreak—I saw the prisoner go out; she had on an overall and a pinafore—after she went out of the room I heard her unbolt the yard door—I got out of bed to close the window and then went back to bed again and went to sleep—I did not hear anything afterwards—I next woke up about 7—I then saw the prisoner in bed—I do not think she was asleep, but I am not quite sure—I did not notice anything suspicious about her condition or any dis<lb/>turbance in the room or any signs of blood.</p>

               <p>I did not see her get up or go to bed—she was put to sleep with me at first and I objected—we could not speak together, as I only speak English—she never made a confidante of me—on this morning, from what I could see and hear, I thought she was going to the water closet—she had been down on other nights—I see her a couple of times in the yard—I only see her get up once that night—when I woke up in the morning I do not know if she had a skirt on, because she was covered up with the bedclothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bachelor of Medicine, and practice at 24, Ben Johnson Road, E.—on Friday, August 4th, about 11.15 a.m., I was called to see the prisoner—I found her sitting on the bed with, I think, a skirt on—I saw the trunk and head of a newly-born male child—on ex<lb/>amining the prisoner I found that she had been confined within a few hours—there was dried blood on the underclothing which she had on—I examined the child and inferred that it was a full-timed child, but I cannot say definitely—I found there was about 19 inches of the umbilical cord attached to the child's body; the end of the cord was ruptured—the average length of the cord would be about 2 1/2 or 3 feet—there was some wet paper attached to the child's headland some water in the ears and mouth—I held a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> on the following day—I found that there was a fracture of the skull—there was a bruise on the skin corresponding with the seat of the fracture—the skin was not broken—I removed the skin of the scalp, and examined the fracture—I found an extensive fracture of the right frontal bone about 3 inches long, and there were two separate de<lb/>tached pieces of bone—I opened the skull and found that there was a considerable effusion of blood in the fissures and on the surface of the brain, particularly on the right side—the injuries were inflicted before death—that was shown by the existence of hemorrhage on the surface of the brain and in the fissures which showed the blood was in circulation at the time of the injury, in which case the child must have been alive, but it need not have been separated from the mother; it might not have been born—I formed the opinion that the injuries could not possibly have been caused during birth or by accident on account of their serious nature, and they would require great and severe violence to cause them—such, great and severe violence could not be used while the child was being born—if the child's head had been hammered with a blunt instrument while it was being born that would be consistent, but it could not have been done by the person who was having the child, or by anyone during birth—when I said the injuries could not have been caused by accident I meant accident in the natural course of labour or by the child falling from the mother while she was in any position—the most extreme position would be a standing one and the most extreme violence would be caused to the child if the mother was delivered while standing, but in my opinion even that would not have caused the injuries I found even if the child fell on the stone floor—I formed the opinion that the severing of the head had been done with a knife—assuming that the head had been jammed in the pan of the w.c., pulling the body would not have severed the head in the way that I saw it—I have a clear opinion upon that—that is after an examination of the trunk and head—I found signs of cutting on both the head and trunk—I formed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160032"/>
               <p>the opinion that the head had been severed from the body after death, and I can give reasons for that opinion if required—I formed the opinion that it had been born alive, but there was no evidence that the child had had a separate existence; that opinion I formed upon the examination of the body alone—I formed that opinion because the lungs partly sank—taking the head and the body together, I formed the opinion that the child had had a separate existence—on the trunk alone 1 could not form the opinion—I tested the lungs to see if they would stand the water or hydrostatic test—first of all I put both of the lungs and the heart into water; they floated as a whole—I then cut off the left lung and found that it floated—the heart and the right lung together sank—the left lung supported the rest—I cut the left lung into twelve pieces—I did not proceed with my test of the right lung—I found that seven pieces of the left lung floated and five sank; that is, 7/24 the of the two lungs floated, but I do not think that that is any criterion, because a child can live for twenty-four hours without the lungs floating at all—I cannot explain that, except that the heart will continue beating, and it gets enough air to keep it alive, without sufficient to make the lungs float after death, so I cannot say for certain one way or the other from the state of the lungs and the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> whether the child had a separate existence or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite certain that the cause of death was the fracture of the skull—there are higher degrees in medicine than mine, but mine are very good ones—I do not remember attending the Abrahams before—on August 4th I was called about 11.15 and went almost immedi<lb/>ately—I could not understand what the prisoner said—I inferred that she had been delivered from two to ten or twelve hours; that is the limit—the placenta was still in her body—I removed it—about 8 inches of the cord was attached to it—both ends of the cord had been ruptured—if Professor Dixon Man says that the cord may be from 6 inches to 70 inches long I would accept it—I did not examine the two ends of the cord—if the cord had been broken by the child falling from the mother's body I think it would have broken nearer to the child—in those cases which I have read of, where the cord broke through the child falling from the mother there were only 2 or 3 inches attached to the child—the ends of the cord were torn, not cut—if the head had been cut off with an instrument, that instrument had not been employed to cut the cord—there were no signs of the cord having been twisted round the child's neck, but if the head had been severed the signs would not be very clear—I cannot say if the prisoner had been in great pain, but she was when I saw her—it may have been a difficult delivery—I did not find the uterus ruptured—I have heard that the perineum was stitched up at the hospital—it is very often ruptured—I do not think there was more blood on the under<lb/>clothing than I should expect to find in a difficult delivery where the perineum had been ruptured—I was not told that this was the prisoners first child, and I cannot tell if it was her first—the opinion may be formed as to whether a child is a woman's first or not—a difficult delivery where the perineum was ruptured would be more likely to make the woman not unconscious; it would be more likely to prevent her being unconscious;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160033"/>
               <p>the more difficult the delivery the more pain—it might possibly make her delirious—she would not be likely to swoon on account of the sudden birth or on account of the pain caused by it; she might swoon on account of the haemorrhage—I cannot say how much haemorrhage there was here—for all I know she may have become unconscious during the delivery—Dr. Grant was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>; I principally conducted it—the child's body was white, but not particularly livid—I weighed it and came to the conclusion that it was a nine months' child—possibly it was only eight and a half—I examined the femur and found ossification present in the epiphysis—the bone consists of a shaft and at each end at birth there is grissel, but after birth new bone is formed in those ends which ultimately become joined to the shaft—I told the Magistrate that I formed the opinion that the child was probably born alive—I fully appreciate the difference of the sense of the biological and legal phrases of being born alive—in a medical sense "born alive" means the child has breathed, but in the legal sense it means it has breathed after it was wholly separated from the body of the mother—before the Magistrate I said, "I formed the opinion that the child was probably born alive," and I do not go further than that now—in my opinion the child may have been born dead in the legal sense—if there were any breathing after the child had left the mother's body the respiration was very partial and momentary—there may be partial and momentary breathing in a child before it becomes perfectly Separated from the mother and possibly even when still in the uterus—I cannot say for how long this child lived—the circumstances are con<lb/>sistent with its only having lived a very short time—I did not apply any other test besides the hydrostatic test as far as the body was con<lb/>cerned—I do not know the bowel test—I did not apply the middle air test—the test for the lunge is not a conclusive one—the colour of the right lung was dark red, like liver—part of the left lung was light red and part mottled with a purple mottling-there is undoubtedly circulation in the head of a child before it is born—the fractures on the head were far neater than were necessary to cause death—if a child has been killed by a fracture of the head and other fractures are afterwards inflicted in the same place, it is impossible to tell by which particular fracture the child was killed—in this case there may have been a number of blows—the fractures which I saw might have been caused by this poker—if the head was severed from the body and then put into the water closet, and blows given with a poker, none of them could have caused the extra<lb/>vasation of blood, but they might have caused the additional fractures; there might have been additional blows after death—there was haemor<lb/>rhage in the brain which might have been caused by a comparatively light blow—it could not have been caused before birth by the pressure of the pelvis, and I do not think it could have been caused by the body falling from the woman standing—a severe blow is necessary to cause hemorrhage on the surface of the brain—there were no signs of asphyxia—there was water in the child's mouth and ears—assuming that the child had been born when the mother was standing or sitting on the water closet and had fallen down and not been taken from the closet for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160034"/>
               <p>some time, if it had been alive it must have perished from drowning or asphyxia, that is assuming there was water in the closet—if there had been no water it would certainly have died eventually, but how soon would depend on circumstances—if the mouth were resting against anything preventing respiration it would be soon—if the skull had a severe blow it would probably have had a mark—if the prisoner was standing over the opening and the child had fallen from her in delivery it might have made some mark on the head—in a case of precipitated birth there might be greater violence to the child falling in that way—I do not think there would be more likelihood of precipitated birth if the prisoner had been more costive beforehand, but on the contrary—it is often the case in precipitated birth that a woman feels costive, whereas it is not really that, but the child coming, which occasions that feeling—the elusion of blood on the brain could not have been increased by the suction of the water closet when the plug was pulled—I do not think a fall into the pan could have produced the effusion of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the child had been delivered into the pan and there were water in it it would have died from drowning, if it had been alive at the time—I found no signs of drowning—those signs are well marked and we can always discover them in a body—one end of this poker is pointed—I think the flat end of it could have caused the fracture of the child's skull without breaking the skin—I should say the pointed end would in all probability have torn the skin—I do not think this stick could have caused the wounds under any circumstances—if the de<lb/>capitated, head were in the pan neck upwards the violence described by Abrahams might have been given without showing any signs—if the head had been the other way up the stick might have been used without leaving signs but it all depends on the degree of violence used—it either of these instruments had been used to cause the fracture of the skull I think it must have been the flat end of the poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon to the H division of police—with Br. Harman I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> upon the head and trunk of this new-born child—I formed the opinion that the child had had an independent existence—the cord may have been intact as far as I know, but the child may have had an independent existence which is consistent with a non-severance of the cord—I base my opinion principally upon the presence of the large quantity of haemorrhage upon the surface and in the interstices of the brain, which had above it a splintered fracture of the skull which corresponded with a bruise upon the scalp—in my opinion that bruise was inflicted during legal life according to the definition given in our medical text books—I arrive at that conclusion by experience—a little blood effusion on the brain is not of moment, but a lot of blood is—if the child were being born alive and received a blow with a blunt instrument, one would find, I think, a considerable quantity of haemorrhage—if the child were protruding there would be circulation, but not so much as after it is born—we are taught to gauge the circulation by our ex<lb/>perience by the quantity of haemorrhage and the severity of the injury—if the prisoner were able to give the child a blow on the head directly it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160035"/>
               <p>presented itself the results might be the same, but I cannot say positively—my opinion is that the blow was given during legal life—the hemorrhage extended over a considerable part of the surface of the brain—I have seen one case very close upon this, although not quite, but I am going largely by the books—this child's lungs were partially inflated, which is consistent with the child having had, or not having had a separate existence—there was no evidence in the body that the child had a separate existence—I do not credit that the child's head was severed from the body by pulling it—I have myself pulled a head off a body in the course of my business, and by the time the neck gave way it was 9 inches long—then was no extension of the neck in this case—the incision was absolutely circular and symmetrical and was obviously done with a sharp instru<lb/>ment—the body of the bone of the spinal column was cut through and not between the joints—in my opinion it is not possible that the head could have been severed from the body in any way except by cutting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner and directed her removal to the infirmary—I did not examine her—I agree with Dr. Harman that the cause of death was fracture of the skull, and not decapitation—I have no suggestion to make as to what instrument it was done with—it may have been done with a knife or scissors or any cutting instrument, although I do not think you could cut through the bone with scissors—I saw no instrument—the bone would be much softer than in a grown-up person—if it had been cut with a knife, there would not have been a large flow of blood, but there would have been some—it could not have been cut off and leave no sign—I do not think the sharp edge of the pan would cut through the bone—I hold the degree of Licentiate of Medicine, Edinburgh—there are higher degrees; I am quite ashamed of mine—I have had twenty years' experience in my business, and have been in the police force about ten—I do not come here as an expert—I get £1 1s. a day, and an expert gets £10 10s.—if a child is killed inside the womb I think there may be traces of haemorrhage—if the prisoner had sat down heavily on the seat while in the course of labour, I do not think that would have caused the splintered fracture, and I doubt if that would have caused a fracture sufficient to cause death—I think there was a blow sufficient to produce hemorrhage after death, but in that case we should not have found so much haemorrhage as we did—if there was some initial haemorrhage caused by a blow, a passive haemorrhage would have gone on after death, but not a violent haemorrhage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the injury had been inflicted to the head while the child was partially born I think it could have lived long enough after<lb/>wards to account for the blood on the brain—the injury might have, been caused before complete separation, resulting in death after complete separation.</p>

I am very costive.

I am the late medical officer of the Mile End Infirmary and attended to the prisoner when she was admitted on August 4th—she had recently had a child and was suffering from what we call incomplete rupture of the perineum—a rupture is inevitable, but it is generally slight with the first child—this was more than usual.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The laceration was from the orifice of the vagina to the external part of the rectum—I had to put in two stitches—she was sus<lb/>ceptible to pain during the operation, and after it she became restless and apathetic and subsequently showed signs of emotional disturbance, crying for hours at times and becoming stupid and stubborn—I could only understand her through an interpreter—she remained in the same position for a length of time, not wishing to be moved or spoken to—I was told on one occasion of her being inclined to be violent—such pain as she had had might make her temporarily insane and uncon<lb/>scious—I do not say irresponsible, but unconscious—it is quite possible that she became delirious through pain, because she was melancholic—I do not think the pain would make her unconscious, but it might make her delirious—severe haemorrhage would produce unconsciousness—if in a case of precipitative birth a child had its head fractured on a hard surface, death would be produced by it, and in those cases there would be signs of haemorrhage in the brain—they do not die immediately from the fracture of the skull.</p>

I can get some paper addressed similar to the Wales address," it had no reference to Lady Pearce's address in Wales, but was in answer to a letter from Edward Willing, asking her to get some such paper for a lady named "Minnie"; that the letter found in which she wrote to Willing that a messenger boy was to be sent to the Mal Bureau to get a parcel was with reference to a scheme by which Edward Willing should free himself of an entanglement with a "Miss Sutton," and was in answer to a letter written by him to her (Hughes) (Produced and read), which she thought she had destroyed; and that at no time had she been charged with forgery in Colonel Gascoigne's case.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George France, an undertaker, of 28, Union Street, Marylebone, where we let the top part of the house—the prisoner and a woman, who passed as Mrs. Butler, occupied two rooms on the second floor—up to September they had been there nearly four years—the prisoner was a working shoemaker—they both worked at the business at home; she worked the boot sewing machine—there was a young man named George Melhuish living with them—he was Mrs. Butler's son—he left about the beginning of August to get married and then the prisoner and Mrs. Butler occupied the front room only—they paid their rent regularly every week—occasionally friends came to see them, but not very often, when there may have been beer sent out for, which always meant a little trouble, as they were not in the habit of drinking during the week—they seemed hard-working people—I never saw them the worse for drink when they were by themselves—if they had beer, they used to get bad<lb/>tempered and quarrel together—except when they had beer they seemed to be happy, and to get on nicely together—I know the prisoner's son, George Butler—he came to the premises sometimes, but not very often—the prisoner and Melhuish seemed very comfortable together until about two months ago, when there was an extra quarrel, and the prisoner and Mrs. Butler seemed to be more bitter, and Melhuish was called in from the back by his mother—he had a separate room, which, I believe, he paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160048"/>
               <p>for—I let the two rooms to his mother, and her son occupied the back room as a sleeping room—the quarrelling took place in the second floor front room—as far as I know, Melhuish went in there—I did not go in—I did not see Melhuish go in, but I heard him answering his mother—there seemed to be as though there was a scuffle up above—I thought the thing had gone on long enough and I went up with my husband to ask them to be quiet—I saw Melhuish and the prisoner on the landing outside the prisoner's room, quarrelling—they were speaking to each other, but I cannot say the words—I saw no blows or damage done—when Mrs. Butler called her son she said that the prisoner was cutting up her boots and had got the knife in his hand—they were not the ones she was wearing—I spoke to them, and they went into their room and were quiet—that was after the public-houses were closed and the streets were quiet—I should think it was after midnight—the next night, about public-house closing time, the prisoner knocked at the door—my husband and I had just come home, and we opened it to him—he was intoxicated—it was a Sunday or Monday, I cannot say for certain—he went up to the second floor—we were in a room below—he knocked at the second floor front door, but I do not think ho could get in—he kicked at the door and splintered the panel—the next I heard was a scuffle in Melhuish's room, which was above ours—the sounds were as if two people might be fighting—my husband and I went up and asked them to stop, and told them that there were other people in the house who had to be studied besides them—they went into the front room—they had been on the landing—my husband said to Melhuish, "Go into your own room and lock the door, and no trouble can come of it"—the prisoner went into his room all right and quiet, and Melhuish into his—the prisoner did not say anything about having an injury then—I did not hear him say anything to my husband—the next thing I heard was about 3 a.m., when we were awakened by Mrs. Butler knocking very hard at the door to bail her son George out—my husband went to the police station and bailed Melhuish out—between the scuffling in the back room and the prisoner and Melhuish going into their rooms I heard nobody go out or come into the house—I next saw the prisoner at the foot of the stairs in the passage about middle day—his face and mouth were very much swollen and he had a black eye—I said, "Whatever is the matter?"—he said, "Look what he has done to my face"—he could not speak pro<lb/>perly—I knew he meant Melhuish had done it—he did not say Melhuish, because we only knew him as George, but he said, "George has done it"——he could not open his mouth at all—I have only heard him refer to it once—that night he went to the hospital and was there about ten days—when he returned he showed me a piece of thick wire which had been put into his jaw at the hospital—he said that Melhuish had broken his jaw, and he would do for him yet, and get his own back—the prisoner remained at home after his return from the hospital, and tried his best to work up to September 23rd—on that day Mrs. Butler brought down the rent about mid-day—from the time the prisoner came back from the hospital up to Saturday, the 23rd, he and Melhuish seemed to be getting on all right together—I heard no quarrelling—on the Sunday, about 3 or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160049"/>
               <p>4 a.m., we were waked up by some noise—I do not know what it was—the first words I heard were, "Mrs. France! Mrs. France! Come up for God's sake; he is killing me this time"—it was Mrs. Butler's voice—I got up to her as quickly as I could—I found her sitting on a chair inside her own room—she seemed to be in her night attire—I think she had a night<lb/>gown on—I pushed the door open and said, "Good God! Butler, what is the matter?"—the prisoner was in the room—Mrs. Butler said, "Oh! Mrs. France, he has done me in this time"—I made a step forward into the room, and put my foot into something very sticky and wet, I looked, and it was a big pool of blood—I looked down the opening of something which Mrs. Butler had on and saw the blood was teeming all down the front of her body—the prisoner was on the other side of the bed—I went across to him and said, "What did you do it for?"—he said, "I do not know"—he was standing up—I cannot exactly say how he was dressed—he had his trousers on, and I suppose he had his shirt on—the bed had been slept in; the sheets were thrown back—I wrapped a sheet round Mrs. Butler and called for help—one of the other lodgers came in, and I left her winding the sheet round Mrs. Butler—I went to the window and whistled for the police—two officers were just opposite and they came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> During the tune the prisoner has lived with me he did not quarrel with the deceased except on Saturday nights—it was not an every week occurrence—on the nights they got drunk they usually finished up with a quarrel—they very seldom went put, but beer was brought in; as much as a pint and a half at a time—they would get the jug filled two or three times—I never interfere with my lodgers—I never know their conversations or anything else unless I am called to them—I cannot say that the prisoner and Mrs. Butler had a lot of friends—a very little extra beer meant trouble and quarrelling—the deceased did not always complain—she used to put up with it sometimes—I do not know if she was the beginning of the quarrelling—she had a black eye about twice—when they quarrelled they were never quiet until I went up, and then they were drunk, but not too much to know what they were doing—this was generally a Saturday night occurrence, after the work was finished—when Mrs. Butler called out, "He has cut my boots up, he has got the knife in his hand," she said it as if she was frightened—Melhuish went to quiet them—I think it was the following night that the prisoner came in drunk when his jaw was broken—when the deceased complained of his having the knife in his hand it was before the prisoner's jaw was broken—on the Sunday or Monday night I let the prisoner in because he could not find the key<lb/>hole—I had had to let him in before when he was intoxicated once or twice—if he had not much work I believe he went out for a stroll and met friends and had a glass or two more than he usually did—after he came back from the hospital he seemed quite friendly with the deceased—he did not seem to resent as regards her when he was sober, the fact of his jaw being broken.</p>

               <p>evening, September 17th, I was in my room, which was next to Mrs. Butler's Melhuish having left them—Mrs. Butler came to my door and knocked, and in consequence of what she said I handed her some smelling salts—she smelt them and went back to her own room—that was about 10.15 p.m.—later she left the house, and after she had gone I spoke to the prisoner, who was in his own room—I was at his door when the deceased went to get a glass of beer—the prisoner said, referring to her, "She is not my wife; <hi rend="italic">her</hi> and her son <hi rend="italic">has</hi> broken my jaw and I will do for the two of them "—I did not see any difference in the prisoner then, but I had not seen much of him—I did not notice that he was the worse for liquor—on Sunday, the 24th, between 3 and 4 a.m., I was in bed and asleep and was awakened by a noise in the next room—I heard the deceased call out, "Mrs. France!

I live at 83, Clipston Residences, Cleveland Street, and am a bootmaker—the deceased was my mother—she was first married to Mr. Melhuish, who was my father—he died and she married Mr. Allen—I believe he is still alive, but I do not know—he has not been with my mother for quite ten years—for about four years the prisoner has been living with her and I lived with them at 28, Union Street, for nearly three years up to about August, when I left to get married—I occupied a back room and the prisoner and my mother the front room—the back room had a separate doorway—the prisoner's room was used for taking our meals in, and he used it to do his work in—he and my mother lived on very friendly terms, <hi rend="italic">bar</hi> when they had a little drop too much to drink, when they used to quarrel, which generally happened on Saturdays when they finished work—the rest of the week they worked together and got on well—friends came to see them now and again, but not very often, occasionally on Sunday nights—sometimes a little extra drink was then, I believe, consumed—my mother used sometimes to call me into their room when there was a quarrel, and it was generally stopped, but I was not indoors much; I was out at night time for a walk—when my mother called me I went in and stopped the quarrelling by speaking to them, when they would go to bed and would be all right next, morning—sometimes Mrs. France came up to quiet them—I never saw any violence by the prisoner to my mother—I remember on one occasion, the day before I had this fight with the prisoner, when he and my mother were shouting at one another and mother holloaed—I went in and as soon as I got in, he closed up suddenly and got me on the floor—I had to give in and went back to bed and they seemed quiet after that—when I went into their room he was on the other side of the room not doing anything; they were jawing at one another—I did not notice anything in the prisoner's hand—late the next night he came in worse for drink—I heard him stumbling upstairs—he went to the front room door, and kicked or knocked and splintered it—then he went into the front room and sat there for a few minutes and then came into my room with a rush and said something about "Now I can have all I wanted"—I cannot remember exactly what he said—I had just got my trousers on as he was coming in and then, of course, I hit him and there was a scrum<lb/>mage—I hit him with my fist, I believe, in the face several times—he did not strike me—I stood a decent distance away from him and at the finish I think we both went down—he got up and went into the other room—when he came into my room he was going for me—Mr. France came up and told me to go to bed and lock my door, or perhaps he might give me an unlucky blow—I locked my door and went to bed—I noticed that the prisoner's mouth was bleeding as he went away—soon after I had gone to bed I fell off in a kind of sleep—I do not know how long it was, but some<lb/>body knocked at the door and I found it was two constables and the prisoner, and they took me to the station—I was bailed by Mr. France about fifteen minutes afterwards—I appeared at Marlborough Street the same morning, but the prisoner did not appear and I was discharged—I</p>

He has got a home of his own to go to; let him go"—he was well drunk then—that was about 11.55—I did not help to get him well drunk—I had got the beer, and, if he wanted it, let him have it—nobody came down to see me out—the deceased was in the room and heard what I said to my father, which was, "Don't get quarrelling to-night, Dad. If you do you will put your jaw out and it will never set"—he said, "No, no, that is all right, cock. God forbid I shall not touch her"—as far as I could see he understood what I said to him—there were no words, shortly before I left, between him and the deceased—I gave evidence before the Coroner—I did not say anything about something happening before I said that I advised them not to quarrel—I advised them because he was drunk—the only slight row that night was about the beer, when the deceased told the prisoner not to drink it—I left at 12.5 and told the prisoner I should come up to dinner next day—when I left he was well drunk and the deceased was half drunk—this is my signature (<hi rend="italic">Coroner's depositions produced</hi>): "Mrs. Allen was more than half on and my father was worse"—that was read over to me before the Coroner, but I did not hear that part—Melhuish left about 10 p.m.—when I left, the prisoner and the deceased were alone.</p>

I said, "Yes, so you are.' S. and M. every<lb/>thing is all right as usual." "How do you feel this morning? Do you feel very fit, sonny, I must say you feel with your hand as usual, I should very much like to come out with you this morning, but I know jolly well I shall not be able to." "F. came in the other day. I showed him your postcard and he inquired so kindly about you. Does he know anything about us, boy?

Such lots of love and kisses from your loving Kitty." "My dear darling, I do not think it would be advisable to go there to-night. First of all for your sake, and then it would hardly be the right thing to have a young thing like me in your virtuous bug walk." "June 10th, 1905. Dear old boy, How are you to-day, dear?

Oh, my darling, I must not think too much about those days because. Yi Yi, Retey." "Do be good, my pet; don't go with the girls. Perhaps I ought not to ask or expect you to keep away from them; but Retey, my boy, I do love you so much. I never realised how much you were to me until you were away. Now, my Darling, I must bid you Good-night, I will try and write you again to-morrow. Much love and hundreds of kisses. Always your own loving Kitty." "I do so hope you are good, dear; so often I think about you, darling, and wonder if you are true. I trust you, of course, but you are only a man, and when men are tempted they cannot always resist, they are not so strong as women." "Mrs. Kennedy has taken a baby to adopt, rather much, is it not. You ask me what I do in the evenings. Well, I will tell you (I just pulled the letter out of the machine. I thought it was John coming). Sometimes I go home, or go to mother's, or to John.

Good-bye for the present, my pet. Much love and lots of kisses, always your own loving Kitty." "Don't think I flirt or ever see anyone else. I have only seen Vetch once and White twice at the office. No one else, So buck up boy, be sensible, and write to me soon." "I am afraid to write letters in the office now; John is always in and out.

Good-bye, my darling boy. <hi rend="italic">Be good</hi>, and you know I am true to you. Lots of love and kisses." (<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner</hi>): "I must tell you that lately I have very often thoughts of jealousy, and the idea plagues and haunts me that you may forsake me for some other chap, and I can't find a bit of consolation in your maxim that 'Women are stronger than men.' Women may become just as well victims to temptation, as men. So, my dear, do love me, for without you and your love my existence would not be worth a rap. I fully realise the obstacles which stand between our definite union, and I shall wait for you ever so long, my darling, but some kind word of encouragement would help me such</p>

Do write me, darling, a nice, long letter as soon as you get this. With fondest love and many many kisses, from your ever loving R." "The wildest and silliest thoughts are crossing my mind. Perhaps you are ill, perhaps John found you out and prevents you from writing, perhaps you got tired of me, or, again, somebody has been telling you something and you condemn me with<lb/>out hearing a word from me. Oh! Kitty, Kitty, I am a boy no more, and should not like to appear ridiculous, but for goodness' sake, what is the reason of your mysterious silence? Do you want to get rid of me, and am I tiring you? Was it only pity you had for me or even fear which made you say that you love me? Forgive me, dear, if I am hurting you, but it is eight long days since I have heard of you and I am at a loss to explain your delay in replying. I know you were all right on Sunday at Kennedy's, so why don't take the trouble and send me a little message? I can assure you I had no rest for two days, neglected everything. My dearest own girl, you know well what you are to me; you know how I love you; you know a word of you is enough to make me happy, so why do you torture me and don't write to me more often? Will you be a darling good girl and write to me a nice long letter, and go every second day to 57? My dear, sweet little Queen, how miserable I am without you; how much more miserable I am from even not receiving a line from your dear hand or has your silence a meaning, a significance? I Excuse a poor miserable fellow, and, believe me, I shall never cease to leave you. Yours for ever, Wm. R." "As regards your remark concerning No. 1, I guess you mean myself by it, but you know, dearest, that No. 1 to me is my darling little grass widow, which I should so much like to embrace and give her a good hugging and a nice long kiss (none of those seven for 1s. sort, you know). I hope I shall not have to leave you for a long long time. How did you manage not to flirt a little at K.'s christening, or rather Jewing party? Was it against your nature or was it J.'s lynx eyes? Why, Kitty, a little flirt (but only a little) does not hurt anybody, and a young, little girl, like you must have a little amusement, even if it takes the shape of fooling." "It will hardly be a fortnight and I shall hold you in my arms once again now will you believe me, darling, that I have been as virtuous as any saint you will choose of the Calendar, but you shall soon see yourself, my little Queen. Now I must bid you good-bye, darling, and hoping to hear soon of you, I remain with millions of kisses and heaps of love, Ever truly yours, W.

On September 6th I was house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and saw Mrs. Franks when she was admitted, suffering from a bullet wound in her neck—in my judg<lb/>ment the bullet had entered on the right side and gone out on the left—the hole of exit was slightly higher than the hole of ingress—I observed the skin round the wounds—there were no marks of powder round either of the wounds—I did not notice whether she was wearing a blouse—I have seen these sheets of paper at which shots have been fired at various dis<lb/>tances (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—looking at them, I should think that if the pistol had been fired at Mrs. Franks within a radius of 3 or 4 feet there would have been powder marks on the skin—she made a steady recovery—besides the wound on the neck, there was one on the right hand, just above the little finger, on the inside of the palm—it was a very shallow graze and was not blackened at all—I cannot say how it was produced—it might have been produced by the graze of a bullet—if it was the same bullet which had entered the neck, her hand must have been held more or less on the same level at the time, but it may have been caused in a variety of ways such as a fall on a jagged surface or something with a jagged end passing through the hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant at 19, Coleman Street—the prosecutor and the prisoner both attended before me with the prosecutor's books upon, I think, four occasions—the prisoner pointed out to me accounts which have been paid, and which he had not accounted for—the total sum which he admitted had been paid and not accounted for by him was £111 16s.—he admitted that wages had been drawn by him to the amount of £24 6s. 3d. in respect to what have been described as bogus orders—I went into the question of the bogus orders and the prosecutor and the prisoner agreed that £97 11s. was the amount of the fictitious orders—upon that state of the account it would show that the prosecutor had lost £38 11s. 3d.—there was a claim made by the prisoner that there was a further sum of £53 11s. 6d. of bogus orders, which claim the prosecutor refused to admit—if that had been admitted it would have shown he had paid money out of his own pocket to the employer—upon the state of accounts set up by the prisoner he has over<lb/>paid the prosecutor £15 0s. 3d.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, trading as Johnston &amp; Laird at 37, Fenchurch Street—the prisoner has been about four years in my service at various branches—in September, 1904, I appointed him manager of the 37, Fenchurch Street, branch—it was his duty to keep the Cash Book and to enter in it the amounts received from customers, and to send me a daily sheet containing various matters, and amongst them orders received from customers—on looking at the Cash Book I find on June 23rd, 1905, that there is no entry of £1 7s. 6d. paid by Mr. Lidstone—the prisoner has never accounted to me for that money—on July 7th there is no entry of £7 3s. paid by Mr. Sawyer—the prisoner has never accounted for that—on July 4th there is no entry of £4 2s. 6d. paid by Mr. Cook—the prisoner has never accounted for that—I have searched the Cash Book and do not find anywhere the name of Alfred Bates—the prisoner has never ac<lb/>counted to me for £2 5s. paid by Mr. Bates in June—I find an entry of 5s. received on June 3rd from Mr. Bennett, but no entry of the balance of £1 7s. 6d. received—the prisoner has never accounted to me for that money—on looking at the daily sheet for June 23rd, which is in the prisoner's writing I find no entry of £1 7s. 6d. paid by Mr. Lidstone—I find no entry in the sheet of July 6th of £4 2s. 6d. paid by Mr. Cook, no entry in the sheet of July 7th of £7 3s. 6d. paid by Mr. Sawyer—it was the prisoner's duty to enter all payment upon these sheets—there is no entry in the daily sheets of £1 7s. 6d. paid by Mr. Bennett on June 24th—there is no entry in the sheets of the name of Bates nor of the moneys paid by Bennett—in sending in the sheets it was the prisoner's duty to send in the cash as well, also to send in a statement of the amount re<lb/>quired for tailors' wages required from time to time—on looking at the sheet for April 10th, 1905, there is an order on it, No. 3056, and against that is 11s. 6d. wages required—on June 17th there is a statement upon the sheet of wages required to pay on order, 3718, of 9s. 6d.—in those cases and in other cases where tailors' wages were called for, I sent the money to pay them—I had stock taken on the last day of July, and a few days afterwards found a state of things which called for inquiry—I found, for instance, a number of persons to whom credit had been given, who had no addresses in the book, and that there was a good deal of money out<lb/>standing apparently due from customers—I asked the prisoner to explain—on August 12th he showed me a book called the Outstanding Debt Book—my business is a cash one and there should be on the premises goods representing the orders which have not been paid for and not delivered—</p>

               <p>I took the Outstanding Debt Book and went through it item by item with him—I asked him to account for so many outstanding debts, and he said he had put through false orders—to prove that, I went to the Tailors' Wages Book, expecting to find them not paid for, but I found they were paid—he said, "I drew the tailors' money only to help to pay these false orders"—I asked him to give me a list of what he said were false orders, which he did—he also gave me a list of the customers' pay<lb/>ments—it shows a total of £98 2s. 6d.—underneath is written, "To the best of my knowledge the above is an accurate record of the customers that have paid me for goods supplied by Johnston &amp; Laird"—I do not know what the object was of sending bogus orders—he could only receive the tailors' wages on them—it would make the business appear bigger than it actually was—Bennett's order was claimed by the prisoner as a bogus one—Gurney was another—Vernon is another—they are both here as witnesses—Redgrove is another—he is in Court; also Turner—the goods have gone out in respect of £53—I have suffered a loss in con<lb/>sequence of the prisoner's conduct.</p>

               <p>I did not receive any of those cheques from the prisoner—on looking at the ledger, folio 196, I see Porro's cheques £62 8s. and £3 9s. 4d., and the American Dental's cheques, £9 10s., being the cheque for £9 18s. 11 1/2 d., less discount, and £13 are entered by me as having bee a received by the prisoner—that was done by Mr. Frederick Bengue's instructions in July, after the prisoner had gone—the prisoner did all the paying in and only did the entering when I was away, but when I was there I was the proper person to enter the receipt of the cheques—on my return from my holidays in July, 1903, I found in Porro's account in the receipts book, an entry, in the prisoner's writing, of a receipt from Porro of £27 6s. 3d.—I could scarcely mike the figures out because they had been altered again and again—I was never handed a cheque to correspond with that amount—I crossed the entry out—I had no conversation with the prisoner about it—I once found an account in the prisoner's writing to the American Dental Company for one month when I had already made out one and given it to him, which proved that mine had been torn up—I thought from that that the account had been paid by the American Dental Company—I was in the habit of sending out accounts, and made out accounts to the American Dental Company and Porro, but the prisoner would not let me post them, but always delivered them himself—this paying-in slip (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is in his writing and shows a payment in of £12 10s. 11d.—there is no entry of any cheque for £12 13s. 11d. being received from the American Dental Company on May 8th, 1903—I produce other paying-in slips to show some amounts had been paid into the Societe Generate without corresponding entries in the receipts book—on returning from lunch one day in July, 1903, I found a slip of paper on my desk in the prisoner's hand-writing saying that the American Dental Company had settled their account up to the end of June—I saw no cheque of any sort, nor did he mention the matter further.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The account I made out to the American Dental Company included the items prior to July, and I found an account in the prisoner's writing excluding those items—I ignored the slip of paper left on my desk and sent in an account for the full sum to July; I did not feel justified in entering a cheque unless I had seen it—I did not ask the prisoner for an explanation; I did not like to; I rather thought things were not going right in the office—I did not ask the prisoner any<lb/>thing about this entry that I had crossed out in the receipt book; I thought he would question me—the books were always open there for him to see—I am confident I never saw the American Dental cheques—I never had the bank book and I never saw the paying-in slips—the cheques received were actually handed to me on every occasion—I have known postal orders sent by customers to be cashed and used in the business in 1900 and 1901—it was not necessary to do so in 1902 because we usually had enough cash—when we did not have enough cash we had to make use of postal orders—I can find no entries of postal orders having been cashed—the prisoner cashed customers, cheques to use in the proceeds of the business, but not at the time we are speaking of—I can find no trace of a cheque or postal order having been so cashed in 1902—the money handed</p>

George, you had the knife in your hand you were eating your supper with"—he turned almost like a stone and said, "Good</p>

               <p>God! Flo, I don't know how I came with the knife in my hand"—I rushed out in the passage with my husband after me—he was going to get a doctor—a policeman was outside on duty—he came up to me and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "I don't know; I think it is my hand"—he called the person next door and asked her to come into the kitchen and see what was the matter with me—the wound I received was under the left breast—I was then taken to the station and the wound was dressed by the doctor there.</p>

I do not know the contents of that letter, but I want it produced in evidence at my trial. The letter I put two halfpenny stamps on and posted it to the address mentioned on the letter.

               <p>I therefore took him into the corridor of the cells, provided him with a chair and engaged myself in conversation for a considerable time—I noticed first that he had been drinking for a considerable time—he had been drinking that day, but not to such an extent as to upset his steady self-control—he knew what he was saying; he could understand; he could walk—he had all the physical signs of chronic alcoholism, such as offensive breath, furred tongue and general appearance of neglect, but his pulse was not hastened and he was by no means excited—he was very deaf with his left ear and his right was not perfect—I tried to find out if he had been sleeping well—he had nothing to complain of on that score, but said he had taken no food for some days—he was generally bloated with drink—I could not tell if he had had no food for many days, but a man does not generally eat if he is drinking deeply—he then began to narrate his experiences and past life and told me much of his troubles in America and so on, but throughout he referred to his wife only in terms of affection—he said he had lived with her for twenty-one years without a cross word—I gradually led him back to the reason of his being in the position in which he found himself, but could get no reason for his conduct beyond this letter, to which reference has been made—I asked him why he did not meet his wife—he replied that he had intended doing so, but had spent the latter part of the day riding about on tram cars—he was dominated all through the conversation with this peculiar idea about this certain letter, the contents of which he said he did not know.</p>

I am the wife of John Mackintosh, and we live in a flat at 44, Honeybrook Road, Balham—the prisoner and his wife occupied a flat below us from about November last year to February this year—I did not see much of them during that time, and less on account of having an illness in January—I did not leave my own flat much—I never heard them quarrelling, but of course I knew there was drink in the question—I spoke to them as neighbours—I never wrote to either of them or visited them—on Thursday, August 24th, I employed Mrs. Morris for about an hour—that was the first time I had ever employed her—there is not the slightest reason for the prisoner saying, "Mrs. Mackintosh, you are my murderer."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Morris asked me for an envelope, and I am not certain whether she addressed it to Mrs. Stephens—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is one of the envelopes I gave her—it has my address upon it, and it came to me next morning with these stamps upon it—it was closed—I did not open it—it was taken straight to the Cavendish Road police station—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner or his wife—we had lived in the same house—neither myself nor Mr. Mackintosh had been in their part of the house, except, I think, on the first day when the deceased asked me to put some nails in, or something like that—the prisoner was not there then—lifter they moved across the road I did not go into their flat—during my illness the deceased came over to inquire—I am quite certain there is no possibility of the prisoner having any grudge against me.</p>

I am single, and live at Warner Road, Walthamstow, and am the prisoner's niece—in September last I was living with her and her husband at 72, High Street, Mortlake—they had formerly been at Steins, where they had a small confectioner's business which had not been successful—they moved to Mortlake on a Monday in June—at Mort-lake the business was not a success; it was very bad indeed—about the middle of September they said they were in difficulties about money—I think the rent was £36 a year and they were in difficulties about the September rent—Saturday was their best day—I cannot say for certain what their takings were on Saturdays, but I think about two or three shillings—they were worrying very much about that and spoke to me about it—Mr. Seddon was seventy-eight years old and his health was very bad—during the daytime he used to lie on the couch, but was just able to go out for a short walk in the evening—the prisoner used to get about the house—hex health was better than her husband's, but it was not good—on September 11th Mrs. Barrett came to 72, High Street—the prisoner asked me to write to her and ask her to help them with the furniture—they were going away because they were in difficulty about the rent, and they wanted to get away before quarter day—I do not know whether the furniture was going—Mrs. Barrett was the deceased's sister-in-law—on the night of September 11th Mrs. Barrett and I slept in the same room on the first floor—we went to bed about 11—the prisoner and her husband slept on the same floor in the back room—there was no one else in the house—about 8 o'clock next morning the prisoner came in—Mrs. Barrett was awake and was sitting up in bed—the prisoner said something about 30s.—she was in her nightdress and looked rather unsteady—as she went out of the room she staggered when she got to the door—I got up and went downstairs and made some tea and took it up to the prisoner—when I got to the room I opened the door, but I did not go in because the prisoner waived me away and said "No"—Mrs. Barrett followed me up—after that I went and fetched Dr. Mackintosh—it was about twenty minutes from the time the prisoner woke me until I went for the doctor—he came about fifteen or twenty minutes after I went for him—I had seen this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in the room about a month before—when I went in with the doctor I noticed the bottle some time after, and while he was there he</p>

I have 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is all I have.

               <p>have only to say that my husband has been in a miserable depressed condition for a long time; for the last two years our circumstances have been getting desperate, and we decided that as there was no means of earning a living, we had better leave the world together. On this morning in particular I had been laying awake and worrying; then I jumped out of bed and I said, 'I can stand this wear and tear no longer; I'll end it.' I took the bottle and the glass and poured out the biggest part of the poison. I said, 'I am going to take this; it will end it at once and for ever.' He just said, 'You won't.' I said, 'I will,' and I drank it off. Then I said, 'I have left enough for you; will You have it? I said, 'It means this or the workhouse.' He said, 'Yes, give it me.' I poured it out and he snatched it out of my hand. I put the bottle and glass back and got into "bed and stopped there for about an hour; then I got up and wakened my sister-in-law and said, 'Wake up, Lizzie; I want you to listen to what I am saying.' I said, 'Listen, because I shan't have long to speak; we have taken poison.' She said, 'Oh! you haven't,' and I said, 'We have, both of us.' Then I told her to bury us quietly and cheaply and make as little fuss as possible. She kept crying and did not pay much attention. Then my niece woke up and began to cry. I said, 'Take this girl home with you and look after her.' I said, "I am sorry to give you so much trouble, but I cannot help it,' and then a pain came in my chest and I got giddy. I went back into my room. My husband was lying just where I had left him, on the edge of the bedstead. He opened his eyes and looked, so I just said, 'I have just been and wakened Lizzie and told her what we have done.' He said, 'Come and get in bed, then.' They were the last words he spoke. I remember nothing more, except the door opening and my niece saying, 'I will go and fetch the doctor.' That is all. I took the biggest portion, as I thought it would take more to kill me.

I am a medical practitioner practicing at the Bungalow, Mort lake—I was called in to see the prisoner and her husband on September 12th, about 8.45 a.m.—I found them in bed together—he was in a comatose state, suffering from collapse, and I diagnosed that he was suffering from belladonna poisoning—the prisoner was suffer<lb/>ing from the same poisoning and was in a similar condition—I attended to them for about two hours, administering antidotes and using the stomach pump and every remedy that I possessed—at the end of the two hours the prisoner had improved, but the deceased was weaker—I advised that they should be sent to the hospital and I communicated with the police—I saw this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on the table on the left-hand side of the bed, empty—it was quite dry inside—I also saw a tumbler there, which was dry—they both smelt of belladonna liniment—I estimated that the poison had been taken about two hours before I went there—I judged that the husband had taken the larger dose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and in September I was the house surgeon at the Royal Hospital, Rich<lb/>mond—the deceased and the prisoner were brought there on September 12th between 4 and 5 p.m.—I saw them—the deceased was in a deeply comatose state, his face pale, and his breathing was very shallow—he was unconscious and remained so for some house, when he became delirious and started vomiting—those are symptoms of belladonna poisoning—he remained in that state until 6.30 p.m. next day, when he died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> on the 15th or 16th, and what I discovered, confirmed my diagnosis—on the morning of the 14th the prisoner was still in the hospital and gradually recovering—that morning I saw her on my rounds with the nurse and said to her, "This is a sad affair; how did it come about?"—sitting up in bed she said, "About half-past 6 on Tuesday morning I got out of bed and, going to a cupboard or a drawer"—I cannot remember which she said—"I took out a bottle of liniment. I divided it into two unequal parts and drank the larger part myself. I then said to my husband, Are you going to take your share?' He snatched the bottle from my hand and drank off the contents. I then went to an adjoining room and woke my sister-in-law and asked her to settle our affairs for us. Returning to the bedroom, my husband told me I had better get into bed. I do not remember whether I did so or not. The last thing I remember is my niece coming into the room and saying, 'I will run and fetch a doctor'"—at the same time she said her husband had chanced very much within the last few years owing, she thought, to financial difficulties—she did not say that he had changed to her, but said he had become very quarrelsome and irritable lately while normally he was very good and docile and easy</p>

I will do you in at 12 o'clock to-night"—I said, "All right, go away and come back at 12, then"—he kept coming at intervals and said, "I have some<lb/>thing in my pocket; you won't last two minutes at 12"—he went out, but I do not know the time, and came back about 8.30—he was away for an hour, I should think—I saw him carrying his four-year old child upstairs; she was crying and I took her away from him and into the workroom—I went back into the passage and saw the prisoner talking to my sister—I asked her what he wanted and he said, "I want a little private conversation with my wife upstairs"—I said, "You told me you were going to settle me at 12 o'clock; why don't you go away and come back at 12? Let me get on with my work I am doing here"—he went out into the street—I went to the side door and spoke to my two friends and then the story goes on as I told you before—I did not hear my sister say to the prisoner, "Don't be so silly."</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent at the Camber well Infirmary—on the night of July 15th the prosecutrix was brought in a cab and I assisted to carry her in—we took her to the operating theatre because her clothes were saturated with blood; there was a blood clot in her lap and I was told her throat had been cut—she was in a dying condition from loss of blood—upon taking her to the theatre and removing a muffler Which had been tied round her neck. I found a wound principally on the left side of her neck, although it extended to the middle line—it ran parallel with the lower jaw under<lb/>neath the chin, about the leveling of the thyroid cartilage—it was a deep wound, extending down to the sheath of the carotid artery, severing practically the two jugular veins, the external and internal on that side and many small vessels—she was semi-conscious—I performed what is called transfusion at once; that is, injecting into the system a fluid to take the place of the blood which has been lost—sometimes it is other people's blood, but it was not in this case; it was a saline similar to normal blood, except that it has no blood cells—she was in danger of losing her life by the margin of a minute or two—if we had not been ready to take her to the theatre she would have been dead—she was in danger for many days—she remained until October 6th, when she discharged herself against my advice—I have not seen her professionally since—on October 6th I did not consider she was ready for discharge, And the effects of the loss of blood will affect her almost to her last days—the wounds could have been caused by this razor and they could have been caused easily with such a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would require a firm right-handed cut to cause them, but not great force—there was an immense quantity of blood lost, several pints—from wounds such as this the blood would commence to flow almost as soon as the woman was cut, although sometimes in the case of the large Veins of the neck the least little inclination of the head downwards may temporarily close them—the probability would be that the blood would spurt out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer's fitter, living at present in lodgings near Westminster Bridge—on September 21st last I was living at Anderton's Hotel, Fleet Street—I had arrived from abroad about a fortnight before—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160110"/>
               <p>I had in my possession bank notes, a gold nugget and some jewellery—on "September 21st I met three men called Murphy O'Reilly and Gillman—I entrusted my property to one of them—I did not see him again till he was in custody—on the evening of that day I saw that the men were arrested—I attended the next day at the Police Court and gave evidence in the hearing of the three men—the case was adjourned until September 28th—I was the only witness to speak as to how the property passed—a day or two afterwards a Mrs. Murphy called on me at the Trafalgar Hotel, York Road—I arranged to see her again next day—she called again and I went for a walk with her, as she said she wished to introduce me to a gentleman—she introduced me to Boyd—he said, "You have got into a bit of trouble"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I am very sorry to hear it, because Murphy is a very old friend of mine and we worked together in Australia for several years"—we then went to my hotel, where we had a drink—he said to me, "Now I am appealing to you on behalf of Murphy and this woman and child. It is very hard for a man to get a living in London, let alone a woman and her child"—I agreed with him that it was—I said, "They served me a very nasty trick and they do not deserve any consideration"—he said, "No doubt they have done you a very dirty trick. I am not pleading for these other two, it is only on account of Murphy and his wife and child"—he asked me if I would make it lenient for them"—I said I did not think I could, as things had gone too far; I could not make it lenient for him without doing it for the others, and I would not do that on any consideration—he said, "I have a friend from Australia, from a place called Gawler, who has some money, and I think we can get sufficient money to pay you for all your losses and what expenses you have incurred since you have been here and a pound or two besides; that is if you will get out of the country and not prosecute those men"—I said to him, "Well, I don't think I can do that very well, because I might be fetched back"—he said, "Well, you need not be frightened of that at all, because I can take you down to my lawyer and you can take advice on that, and you can catch the same boat that you missed on the 22nd at Marseilles, or you can go from Liverpool"—I said I could give him no decided answer—in referring to the three men Murphy, O'Reilly and Gillman, he had said to me, "As a man of the world, what good can it do you to leave those men here behind doing from five to seven years?"—I said, "Well, there is one thing I shall have the satisfaction of knowing; that is, that I have done some good to someone else if I have not done it for myself"—he said nothing to that—I told him I had an appointment at 11o'clock—he said, "I don't want to detain you; on any consideration you won't mention anything to the police or the officers"—I said, "No"—when I met the police I told them all about the interview—I had an appointment to meet Boyd the same night outside the hotel, which I kept—he came up to me and invited me inside to have a drink—I went—he said, "what about those men? I have this friend from Australia. I would like to introduce him to you; he is a gentleman he is stopping at a cafe; it won't take us half an hour to go over there"—I said I had no wish at all to meet the third man, and the appointment was to be here—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190510160111"/>
               <p>previous to that, when we were in the hotel he asked me if I had anyone with me, to which I said no, I was on my own, and I said, "I suppose you are the same?"—he said yes, he was—we went out of the hotel and he said, "Come and have a few words with him, "referring to his friend; "he is a thorough gentleman"—I said, "No, I do not want to go at all"—he caught me by the arm and tried to pull me to a cab—he did it several times—I said, "I won't go if you put a thousand pounds down on the spot"—he said to me, "If you won't go, will you wait here half an hour and I will go and fetch the gentleman?"—I said yes, I would—he said, "On condition you speak to no one while I am away"—I said, "All right; if you are back at 11.20 I will wait till then, but no longer"—he drove away in the cab—he came back in about half an hour with (Carney)—I had not seen him before—he introduced him in the ordinary way—I cannot say by what name, but as the friend from Gawler—Carney suggested going into the hotel and having a drink—he said, "I believe you have got into a bit of trouble"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have come to see what I can do for those men as I know them"—we had the drink and there was some conversation about friends in Gawler—he then said, "Let us go out of this, as we cannot talk here"—we went to another part of the hotel, where it was darker—we talked about Gawler and just as we were going to start talking about the men, he having said, "Now what about those men, "I the officers came up and arrested them—previous to that Boyd had said, "Come over and see me. I am sure you can get £200 and a few pounds besides, not in notes but in gold; but mind you, I don't think you can get it all to-night, but I guarantee you to get it first thing in the morn<lb/>ing if you clear out of the country"—that was in the public-house—as I did not listen to their suggestions, I stayed in this country.</p>

I think I first saw Mrs. Murphy at the Trafalgar Hotel on the 25th—she came to plead for leniency for her husband—Boyd only suggested Murphy throughout—he said he was not pleading for the others—I had no intention of making it lenient for any of them—it was suggested that the matter should be dealt with at the Police Court, but I would not fall in with it—no money was, in fact, Offered to me—Boyd told me that he knew Mrs. Murphy in Australia, and that he had not seen her for about four years till she casually met him—he said he had come for the sake of her and her child and Murphy, who was an old friend of his, and it was no more than one pal would do for another.</p>

When O'Reilly, Murphy and Gillman were arrested I recovered all my property except two £5 notes and a watch—when they were before the Magistrate I think some solicitor did ask the Magistrate to deal with it summarily, but he said he must send the case for trial—I should think Carney was in conversion with me for about an hour—I have no doubt he knew Gawler and people there—barney did not speak about Murphy only, but, "What will you do for these men, as I know them?"—I could not possibly be mistaken—I do not think I said before the Magistrate that he wanted to see what he could do for Murphy, as he knew him—if it is on the depositions it is a mistake.</p>

We must have the money"—Boyd went back to the hotel with Ryan—later on I saw Boyd, Carney and the prosecutor go into the hotel together—Carney paid for drinks and cigars—I pushed against him—I heard him say, "I know this men; I have come to see what I can do for them, but we cannot talk here—five minutes after they went out—I followed—I saw Carney, Boyd and the prosecutor conversing outside—I went up to them with another officer—I caught hold of Boyd and said, "I am a police officer and shall arrest you for inciting this gentleman, Mr. Smith, to compound a felony and for trying to dissuade him from giving evidence in a case of larceny against Murphy and O'Reilly, in custody for the confidence trick—Boyd said, "I have only just come from Paris"—I then took them to the station, five of them altogether, and they were charged—on Boyd was found 1s. 6d. silver and 6 1/2 d. bronze, a watch and chain, a solicitor's card and a Bank of Engraving note or a note similar to it.</p>
