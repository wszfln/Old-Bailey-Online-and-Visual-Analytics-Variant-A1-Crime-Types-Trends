               <p>Did you find either of the prisoners there? - No, I went back again to Lime-house corner, between fifty and sixty yards where the affair happened, and went into a public house, and I looked round the taproom and there was the prisoner Peter, but I not knowing him, he passed me as I was drinking a glass at the bar, and he went into the street, and the prosecutor was leaning over the post at the corner of the street, facing the public house, and he called out constable! constable! there is Peter, there he runs; I run after him directly, and he run through a narrow passage out of Fore-street, into Ropemaker's-field; he kept running on, but I lost sight of him, then he went into a little alley, but I took him about ten yards from his lodgings, where I had been to search for him; the prosecutor, and the man who called me to his assistance were leaning on the nossil of a pump, the prosecutor was bleeding: I brought the prisoner Peter to him, and said is this the man you want? he said this is Peter, and that is the man that took me by the throat; and I took him away immediately and put him in the cage, and then ordered the man to make a fire, and let the prosecutor sit by the fire, and the other man that came to my assistance told me where to find this man, the prisoner Will: I sent to the constable of the parish for two more men, and went away directly to the lodgings of this Will, and they would not give us admittance for a great while, till at last I said I would break the door open, after sometime we got admittance, and the prisoner Will that stands here, was in bed, and another man with a woman in the middle of them; and we took him and put him in Shadwell watch-house, I took the prisoner that I had at Limehouse up to Shadwell and they were all three put into the room, and the other little man that was in bed with him; and the prosecutor the next day at the Justices pointed out these two men, he said, he knew the other man, but he was not with them.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Iverson is a lodger of mine, he has lodged in our house for three quarters of a year and better; I never knew any think at all amiss of him of any kind, he has been a very good man so long as I have known him, he goes to sea in general, but he is at home at present, and he was cutting up wood to send to the chandlers shop; we never heard any thing of the robbery, till they came to take him out of his bed, at half past eleven at night; they took another man along with him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Did they lay together? - I do not know for that, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a woman that was along with them? - Yes, there was a woman along with him, the prisoner's wife.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing whether they were all three in bed together? - I do not know, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the prisoner Iverson had been? - He was at home all the afternoon, he was at home from six in the evening till eight.</p>
               <p>Mind what you say, you say that he was at home at your house from six to eight that evening? - Yes, Sir, he was not out from six to eight.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I am pretty sure of that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You say you was in liquor at the time? - I was not sober, nor yet very much in liquor; I was not rightly sober.</p>
               <p>What dollars they were talking off, you did not know, nor the ship? - I certainly knew the ship, because I was on board of her, when she failed out of the port of London.</p>

               <p>I am husband to the last witness, I remember Church and May Cook coming to our house, it was on a Thursday to the best of my knowledge, I believe it was in September; they came there with two bags and left them, and came in presently after and put them backwards, and left them there for a day or two, then Miles and Church came and took them out; I think they said they were dollars, there seemed to me to be two thousand or upwards, they put them backwards at my house, I believe they put them in my garden, I do not know whether they put them under ground or above ground; Church and Miles came back for them the next night, and went backwards into my garden for them, they brought two bags with them and took them on their shoulders and went out of doors.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Church and Miles about them since? - No never from that time to this, but about a fortnight ago I saw Church at Tothil-fields, and he told me he put them in a field behind the inn-yard where I used to work, I think the field belongs to Mr. Hudson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. How long were they in your house? - Not a great while.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230014"/>Had they got out of your sight? - Yes, they were but just out of sight, we made the best of our way; we came to the first watchman on this side the water-works, we called and asked him, if he had seen five men whom I described, he said, they were just gone on before; then we came to Buckingham gate and asked the guard, and he said, they had just turned up Petty France; we pursued them till they came near the Broadway, there were two or three more watchmen then, and we came in sight of them in the Broadway; I was apprehensive if we pursued them they would take up different streets, I desired the watchman to spring his rattle that they might be surrounded; when I went close to them I gave the charge, there were other people that were there, and four of them were taken, the other made his escape.</p>
               <p>Did you so observe the persons of any of them, to know them again? - Yes, I knew them then, and pointed them out to the watchmen.</p>
               <p>Do you know them now? - Yes, there are three of them stands there, and this little man, Russell, is the man that fastened round me, he is dressed different; I know both the others, they all assisted, I am perfectly clear in that man that is ill, his name is Thomas Wiggan; I am quite sure of the person of this man, I am equally clear of all.</p>
               <p>Can you in a transaction that took up two minutes, and in the hurry and confusion you was in, undertake to swear to the persons of four men whom you never saw before? - I am very clear in it, I have no doubt at all.</p>

             was taken by himself.</p>
               <p>Which was taken first, the three or the one? - The three were taken first, but they were all partly together.</p>
               <p>When you first got sight of them, were they all together? - They were at some distance, we sprung the rattle on purpose to see if it was them, we could not be so clear.</p>
               <p>How far was you from them when the rattles were sprung? - Forty or fifty yards, I suppose.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by springing the rattle to try if it was them? - In order to come closer to them, as that would prevent them from separating; and when I came to them, I thought I should see if it was them.</p>
               <p>Were they altogether when you first sprung the rattles? - I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Recollect as well as you can? - They were at such a distance I could not perceive whether they were altogether or not.</p>
               <p>Were there other people in the street? - Not just at that time, I did not see any in the street at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you observe and take four men that were together, or take the first four men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230015"/> that you could lay hold of after you had sprung the rattles? - They were together, I saw them four together, I am clear in that; one of them attempted to run away, that was James, the rest did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. Pray Mr. Bowden, the persons who robbed you got out of sight, while you was looking for a watchman? - I was not long looking for a watchman.</p>
               <p>I wish you would not look so much to consequences, but give direct a answer? - I saw a watchman directly, they were out of sight before the watchman and I came together.</p>
               <p>How long might it be, before the watchman and you set out upon your pursuit? - I suppose about four minutes.</p>
               <p>You never got sight of any four or five persons till you came to the Broadway, Westminster? - No, we did not, we heard they were just before.</p>
               <p>At Buckingham-gate you were told, that in such a direction, there were such a number of persons? - I was.</p>
               <p>The moment you got sight of three, four, or five men, you desired the watchmen to spring their rattles? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>You did it in order to try by certain symptoms, whether they were the men that robbed you? - No, Sir, no symptoms, but that I might discover whether they were the men or not.</p>
               <p>Did not you spring the rattle to try if they were the men? - I was pretty certain.</p>
               <p>Then you was not before satisfied that they were the men? - No man could tell.</p>
               <p>No man could tell! Sir, I will have an answer to every question I put to you; you were not satisfied before, that they were the men? - I was satisfied by appearance but I could not see their features; I was better satisfied when I saw them.</p>
               <p>I ask you before you sprung the rattle? - I was not satisfied then.</p>
               <p>What was the fifth man doing at the same the others were robbing you? - There were three of them employed about me, the other two were holding me and standing by.</p>
               <p>What were they dressed in? - They were dressed in brownish coats, different colours.</p>
               <p>Some lightish, some brownish, and some darkish, I suppose most of them had lightish colours; had they round hats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Something roundish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they all stand in front of you? - They were all in the front at first.</p>
               <p>It is a plain question? - They were all in front at times, they did not stand still all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them before? - I do not know that I ever saw them before.</p>
               <p>You are equally positive as to them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This transaction took up about two minutes? - A little more.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, knowing that these mens lives are concerned, that in two minutes under the alarm of being robbed by five men, that these are the men that robbed you? I took particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear it? - I do.</p>
               <p>You do; it is not common for Council to press it so; was you always of the same opinion? - I was always of the same opinion, never had any doubt.</p>
               <p>They never were committed on suspicion? - They were twice examined.</p>
               <p>They never were committed on suspicion, you gave a positive charge, and they were positively committed? - Yes, they remained for another examination, in expectation of other charges, I gave a positive charge.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at the second examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>If you had given a positive charge at the first, what was the purpose of your attending on the second? - I did not see the first commitment.</p>
               <p>Then I see it now, here in the calendar,</p>
               <p>"detained on suspicion of robbing you; was there any other charge the second time? - I was examined the second time, then they were fully committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230016"/>I observed a singular sort of a smile about you as a prosecutor, when you told us that four were taken, and that you knew nothing about a fifth; now attend a little, have you never said, that you knew who the fifth man was that robbed you? - I never saw him since.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you knew him, Sir? - I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, that you have seen him? - No, I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you knew him, I will repeat it till midnight, till I get an answer?</p>
               <p>Court. The question is this, have you ever said to any body that you knew the fifth man that is not taken? - I do not know where he is.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer, have you ever said to any body, that you knew the fifth man? - I believe I have said so.</p>
               <p>Who did you say so to? - I do not know particularly.</p>
               <p>Have you said so to many people? - It is a subject I have not talked much upon.</p>
               <p>Then to whom have you said it? - I do not remember talking about it.</p>
               <p>Why you told me just now, you believed you had said so? - I do not know where or when.</p>
               <p>Do you know who the fifth man is? - If I was to see him.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, have you any reason to believe that you ever saw the fifth man before or since you was robbed? - I have no reason to think that I have, I do not recollect any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am a little more in this secret than my Lord is, and therefore he will pardon my going on, do you recollect saying who he was? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never said who he was? - Yes, I could not say who he was.</p>

               <p>Court. It will be better for you to answer, if the gentleman asks you any improper questions which you ought not to answer it is my duty to stop him, and I will do it, but if he asks you questions that appear at present to be not nothing to the purpose, you cannot judge of that, nor can I, till it appears that they are not; you must answer them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long was it after you heard the rattle rung, before Mr. Bowden asked you whether you had seen four or five men? - I came up to him in about two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>When was the bill of indictment preferred? - On Monday.</p>
               <p>Think again. - On Tuesday.</p>
               <p>On Monday, I believe, Mr. Bowden could not come. - I cannot tell why it was not preferred.</p>
               <p>What did Bowden say to you about this being a good fetch? - I never had any such conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Had you, when together, any such conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>At the Justice's office? - No, Sir, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>No such conversation at all? - I never heard any thing like it, any more than what is common, that every body thinks to have something if they are cast.</p>
               <p>Ave, something if they are cast: now in consequence of that what passed in whispers at the Justice's office? - There was not a word about it, as I know of, no more conversation than what is usual.</p>
               <p>Where had you that conversation? - We had not a word.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never had any conversation with Bowden, in the company of the other watchmen, about the reward of these men upon their conversation? - Upon my oath I never had.</p>

               <p>How happened that? - Them strong gloves I wear for cold weather; this knife I know it is mine. (The knife handed up to the Court.) I had no particular mark on it.</p>

               <p>Have you any remembrance that there was any marks upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why did you say that you believed you wrote it at the Justices? - I put no mark but at the Justices.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any thing is written upon it or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you remember the Justice desiring you to put a mark upon it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to tell me now that you did not know whether it was marked or not? - I know the stock perfectly well; I have been long used to the buckle, I have often had it in my hands.</p>
               <p>Have you observed any thing remarkable in it? - No.</p>
               <p>Now I have observed something remarkable in it, by which I think I should know it? - I had my buckle for a year and a half, the buttons of it are flat.</p>

               <p>When did you see him last? - The last time I saw him I believe was on Tuesday last; he told me on Tuesday to the best of my recollection, that he was going to Clerkenwell to find a bill against some people that had robbed him; I was mentioning the matter to a person in our neighbourhood, one Ashley.</p>
               <p>When did you communicate to Bowden what passed between you and Ashley? - On Monday morning I spoke to Bowden, and told him the circumstance, that there were people that were very willing to pay any expences, or words to that effect; Bowden consented to that, provided he could be secured from the laws of his country taking hold of him, and his expences paid, he was very willing not to take away the lives of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>What was he to have? - Two hundred and fifty pounds, he did not ask it, but the gentleman who came along with him, told him in my hearing, that it would cost him one hundred and seventy or one hundred and eighty pounds, as he was bound over; that Mrs. Bowden was likewise bound over in forty pounds, to give evidence against them on account of the stock, which made it five: Mr. Bowden said it was so, and after this Mr. Ashley who was the person who first mentioned it to me, took me to the gentleman in Bridges-street, and Bowden was very agreeable according to the advice of his friend, to take it and keep out of the way: I asked Mr. Bowden if he would agree to be out of the way on the receipt of two hundred and fifty pounds, and when I mentioned the matter Mr. Bowden said it was so, and he must have something for his expences, and he would go to Bath or Bristol during the sessions.</p>
               <p>What was it Bowden said about the two hundred and fifty pounds? - He did not say two hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>He assented however upon terms that were talked of, to be out of the way? - He agreed to go to Bath or Bristol.</p>
               <p>Was that the reason that he did not prefer his bill on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. If it was, what then?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If it were true, it would go a great way against the credit of the prosecutor, who had first accepted it, and now has denied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230024"/>Was there any conversation about attending a suit in chancery? - Yes, Mr. Bowden sent a person off in my hearing to the Sessions-house at Hicks's Hall, to acquaint the people that he could not attend, having a cause in the Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>Did Bowden say at all what he was to have, or what he was to do? - He said, he would go off that evening for Bath or Bristol, provided I brought him the money, and more over than that, the money I was to give him, I was to put it in a room; and he was to take it.</p>
               <p>What money was you to bring to Bowden? - The money I was to receive from Andrews.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any authority from any of the prisoners to make this proposition? - I had not, that I am clear in, I had seen none of them, nor none of their friends.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this you went to somebody or other, for the purpose of getting the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you get the money? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Bowden afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - The same day, and the next? I told him that Mr. Andrews had sent to the gentleman on Poultney-hill, I believe his name is Kidney, and Mr. Ashley brought me for answer, that Kidney would see Andrews, and appointed four o'clock; then when I had told him that, he sent to the Sessions-house, to tell the people he could not meet them that day, for he had a cause in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Did you get the money? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Bowden after that? - The next day he called at my house in the forenoon; I told him I had heard nothing of Mr. Andrews, or the parties, and I should not give myself any trouble about it.</p>

               <p>What did Bowden say to that, when you said, you should trouble yourself no more about it? - He said, he was going to Hicks's Hall, that was on the Tuesday; I have not seen Bowden since.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowden. You have heard now, the evidence that Mr. Powis has given? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to deny it? - I have an evidence, Mr. Allen that was with me at the time; I think it is very proper he should be heard.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Is this, that Powis has said, true? - No.</p>
               <p>What part of it is false? - I called on Mr. Powis about some business, and he asked me to step down stairs with him; and he asked me as he was acquainted with some of the friends of the prisoners, if he could get me indemnified against all expences, whether I would appear against them; there was nothing about Bath or Bristol proposed; but if this gentleman, Mr. Allen, was present, he would be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowden. If this evidence of Powis's is false, and Mr. Allen is not present; you know what to do.</p>

               <p>Court. You had intrusted him before? - Many times; and he took away a hat, which I had lent to another of my servants, and a waistcoat, and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by banking? - I do business for gentlemen in the country, charging them an half per cent.</p>

               <p>What banker's? - I do not recollect, I do business with almost every banker in Lombard-street; it was the 19th of October, after four o'clock, I went to the farm which I have in the country the same afternoon; and the next morning very early, a messenger came to the farm, to inform me the prisoner was not returned, and the Notary public had called with the bill; I came to town, and went to Bow-street, and got some hand-bills printed, I then took my phaeton, and went down to Chatham, and distributed hose bills, and about ten days after the prisoner was taken upon suspicion; and being informed by a runner from East Smithfield office, that he answered my advertisement, I went there and found him at a public house; he had the waistcoat on, but I did not know it then, I know it was because I saw it before the Magistrate, on the Monday and Thursday.</p>
               <p>Did you know into be your's? - I never wore the waistcoat, but it was my property, my wife told me it was mine, but my wife had promised him a waistcoat; I am sure the stockings are mine, I saw them in a handkerchief; the hat was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know your wife did not give him the stockings? - She has since told me, that if he had behaved well, she would give him this waistcoat, she declared she did not give him the stockings; he had only eight shillings left when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Where were these stockings taken from, do you know? - From a bureau drawer in one of the bars, I saw them about two or three days before, but I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. So you keep a banking? - Yes, I keep the Bull and Gate Inn.</p>
               <p>I believe it is or house of civil protection for the goddenes that patrol Holborn, and preside over the fate of drunken men? - I should be glad you would explain yourself, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is it not a house of protection for women of the town? - I neither keep nor procure any such.</p>
               <p>Your's is an inn, is not it? - Yes, it is, three hundred guineas a year.</p>
               <p>But such women may come in? - I have no business to ask them whether they are married or not, it is open for every body, provided they pay their way.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time say, you should not have commenced this prosecution, but at the instance of your wife? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time say, that you had prosecuted for things that were not your property? - As to the waistcoat, after I came to know that.</p>
               <p>Did not you say your wife made you bring the prosecution? - My wife does not rule me, I rule my wife.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time say, your wife induced you to do this, or to do wrong? - Only touching the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>- SADLER sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of October, I was sent to take the prisoner on a charge of robbing the prosecutor of two ten pounds bank-notes, and ten pounds in ash. I took him to prison, the next day he had his examination before the Magistrate and the Magistrate did not think it was a felony, he was discharged of that then Mr. Blick laid a charge of felony for robbing him of a waistcoat and hat he had the waistcoat on his back, I took it off him, and Mr. Blick swore it was his property; have is the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about stockings? - Not to my knowledge, I know nothing of the hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. All that you found upon him was the waistcoat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor did not charge him with these stockings and waistcoat till he understood from the magistrate, that going off with the notes and money was no felony? - He charged him at first only with the notes and money.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor say any thing before the Magistrate, in the hearing of the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230027"/> as to the reason of this prosecution? - I heard no other than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have no further to say, than I came from sea two years ago; I used this house and spent a great deal of money, I lent the prosecutor twenty or thirty pounds, and I was induced to be his waiter, the waistcoat was given me, and the hat likewise; as to the stockings I know nothing about, they are in that bundle that I came away with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Prosecutor. In what capacity was this boy in your house? - As a waiter, I do not pay them any wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We have only what we get.</p>

               <p>Did you receive him on account of his friends? - I will tell you the real truth, as soon as his money was gone, I desired him to get into a ship, for I had so much loss by officers.</p>
               <p>Was he a customer to your house before he became your servant? - He was very ill when he came, he spent seven pounds in all; I suffered him to remain in the house, his place was worth a hundred pounds a year, he was a customer about four months.</p>
               <p>Is it customary when men have laid out their little property, to make them servants? - There was another that I arrested him by his own consent, and he was of a good family; this young man's bill was at that time about eight pounds; he came and put forty pounds into my hands, and he drew it out in less than two months.</p>
               <p>Did you let him remain in your house as a customer, or under the idea of servitude? - As a servant, the very same as all servants I ever had, I gave him that place that he might get his money up again, he assented to it and waited on all company that ever came.</p>

               <p>Court to Sadler. What is become of the stockings? - These are the stockings, there were no other.</p>

               <p>Were they new stockings? - No.</p>
               <p>Were they old? - They were in the middling way, they might be darned in the heels.</p>
               <p>Did they lay about the kitchen? - In the tap room there is a bureau where a great number of my stockings are, and sometimes they are thrown in there.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - They are about five shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>But what were they worth? - I suppose they might be worth a couple of shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How long was it from the time you suspected the stockings were stole, before you saw them? - I said before I am not clear, I have two dozen pair of stockings, I do not know when I saw them last, till I saw them in his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. You say nothing with respect to the bank-notes and money.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Long-acre on the 23d of October, about ten in the evening, and just by the end of Chapel Alley in Long-acre, I heard a little boy cry out stop thief! and the prisoner at the bar ran out of the passage, I pursued him, and called out stop thief! I never lost sight of him, he was stopped by another man; I came up directly, the prisoner was stopped and searched, and the gown was not found upon him then, a person brought the gown up, it was found just by my side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Did you see the gown in the street as you pursued the prisoner? - No, I did not, it was rather a darkish evening.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shelton. No my Lord.</p>

               <p>Did the Justice say any thing more to the prisoner? - He asked him if he stole my sheep, and he answered yes; and he told him where and when.</p>

               <p>Can you say with certainty that these are the same goods you carried a few days before? - Yes. As I was coming down Well-street I met the prisoner, I never saw him before to my knowledge, he appeared to be very much in liquor, he asked me the way to Thames-street; I asked him what part of Thames-street? he said, pretty near Black-friars; I told him to return again with me, for he was going quite the reverse way; he then asked me to let him carry my load, which I refused, he then asked me to go into a public house and drink a glass of gin, which I refused; he said he was going to Great St. Thomas Apostle's; I told him I was going part of the way, and I would shew him as far as I went; he came along Fenchurch-street, along Lombard-street, and along the Poultry, as far as the top of Queen-street, Cheapside; there I directed him and left him, but when I got down <placeName id="t17850223-11-crimeloc57">King-street</placeName>

               <p>How long had he it? - But a very little time.</p>
               <p>Had he it compleatly from you? - I had hold of it with one hand, I never let it go compleatly, but he had it in his arms.</p>
               <p>Was it ever out of your possession at all? - No, I cannot say it was; as soon as I felt it go, I immediately snatched it with my hand.</p>
               <p>When you snatched it with your hand, it was clear from your head, was it not? - Yes, quite gone. I ran home with it as fast as I could, and he ran after me to my own door, and took it away again, he had it then compleatly; I let it go, and secured him; when I secured him he had the bundle.</p>
               <p>Did he snatch it the second time? - He laid hold of it, I made no resistance, but caught hold of him and rung the bell instantly; the door was open, he let go the bundle, it went to the ground, and I pulled him into the house; I never lost sight of him, the prisoner is the man; he was with me altogether about a quarter of an hour, and when I got him into the warehouse he fell down and appeared to be drunk, then he got up and fell down again, and appeared to be very drunk.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you from the whole of his conduct to you that he really was drunk, or that he shammed drunk? - He appeared to be very drunk when I first met him, but when I met him in King-street, he appeared to be very sober.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You have enquired, I believe, where this man lived since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You find he lives in Saint Thomas Apostle's as he said? - Yes, his dwelling house is there, he told me so that night, I have heard he is a housekeeper there, and has a pension from government, and is a shoemaker, and is disordered in his head at times.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear he was discharged the army for it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he say it was his leather? - No, never.</p>

               <p>Was it a heavy bundle? - No not very heavy.</p>
               <p>There were a great many people about at eight at night? - No there were not.</p>
               <p>Did not you really see and perceive that he was very drunk in the warehouse? - He seemed so then, but not in the street.</p>
               <p>It was not very easy for a man to snatch that from a stout young man like you? - He did not snatch it quite from me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any body with him? - I did not, I heard a voice.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he had lost some leather that evening? - No, he told another person.</p>

            , between eight and nine, about half after eight; the prisoner when he came into the warehouse, at first seemed to be exceedingly in liquor, and I being at some distance went to the prisoner, he was reeling against a pack of sheeting, I went up to him and told him it was exceedingly hard that our man could not go about the streets like other porters without being stopped by him, to which he said at first, he did not stop him; I then told him I was sure he would not have been brought there if he had not; he said the reason he stopped him because he had lost a large quantity of leather; I told him that was a very wrong way of looking for his leather, that he should apply to the public office, and not stop porters; to which he said he had applied to the public office in Bow-street, and saw Sir Sampson Wright; I said then his name was upon their books; to which he said his name was not down; he then told me he was a very good kind of man, and said he rented two houses, the one he let out, and the other he occupied himself, one he said was in Saint Thomas Apostle's, and the other in a court near there, but I have forgot the place; I am sure he said one was in Saint Thomas Apostle's.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he lived? - I think he said in some court in that neighbourhood. I told him I was afraid he was not looking for leather at that time of night; and he said he should not give me any answer, for I intended to take an advantage of him, I told him that was far from our intention.</p>
               <p>Did he really appear to you to be drunk or not? - When he went away he did not.</p>
               <p>Is that Mr. Martin's chintz? - I cannot positively swear to it, we had some of them in the house some few days before, some of the pattern was given to the porter to send to Mr. Craydon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Had you good nature enough if the man was in liquor, before you sent for an officer, to send to see if he lived there, and was a man in credit? - We did not.</p>
               <p>How came you not? - I do not know it was my business, if I had left the warehouse it would not have been proper.</p>
               <p>You know you said you did not want to take any advantage of the man? - I have heard since that he does live there, and has the lease of a house.</p>
               <p>Did you search him there? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he searched in your presence? - He was not, he was searched at the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>What was found upon him? - I cannot tell, because I was not there.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard? - I would not go by hearsay, I heard he had a new pair of shoes in his pocket, and a size-stick to take measure by.</p>

               <p>Should you have taken him by his running for a drunken or a sober man? - Most certainly for a sober man.</p>
               <p>Then at this time there was nothing appeared to you that should make you think that the man was in liquor? - There was not, Mr. Martin's porter caught hold of his master's bell at the door, and pulled it sharply, by that time the prisoner overtook him, and there was a great struggle between them at the door, the door was opened, and Mr. Martin's porter pulled him into the house, and the door was shut, I saw a parcel which the porter had when he was running, but I did not see what was done to it by any body; the door was shut after he had dragged him into the house, and the parcel shut out of doors; I pulled the bell and somebody came and pulled the parcel in doors.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner do any thing to the parcel? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was you so situated that you might have seen it? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did they pass very quick? - Very quick.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Where not these ten skins by some mistake sold to a man in Westminster, who was a quaker? - There were seven, and they were returned to the prisoner, and he would not accept of them, there were some done, but they lay and rotted, therefore I thought it was better to sell them.</p>
               <p>Did not you declare that he had acted like a madman in this affair? - He did not behave in a proper manner.</p>
               <p>Did he appear like a man that was a little touched in his head? - I cannot say he behaved in a proper manner the two or three last times I saw him, he appeared like a madman more than any thing else; I thought he was very much out of the way when I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230038"/>Court. How long have you known this man? - About twelve months back.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he lived during that time? - He told me he lived at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. I believe he removed from Knightsbridge? - My man brought me word that he was sailed for debt, and run away from there.</p>
               <p>What skins were these? - Seal skins.</p>
               <p>Are they used by shoemakers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many of these seal skins did you return to him? - Ten, and he said there were but eight, the other seven were sold to the Quaker's in the Broad-way, and the other three were not dry.</p>
               <p>What became of the other three? - I sent the ten to him and he refused taking them, he was then laying in bed, and would not so much as see the man, nor suffer the skins to be taken into the house.</p>

               <p>I live in Bedford-street, Covent Garden, I have known the prisoner near three years, I belong to the same society, I am a shoemaker, and he is a shoemaker; I never heard any thing amiss of him in my life, he always was a very just upright man, he has received some wounds about his body and head as I have been told, and when he gets a little in liquor he is more like a man that is fit for Bedlam which I have seen.</p>
               <p>Can you call him a reasonable man? - I have seen him distracted when in liquor, and acted like a mad man; with the value of three or four pints or beer he was not fit for the company of any reasonable man; liquor did not take the same effect with other men, he has appeared to me to be sober when he came there, and in a very short time he was like a raving mad man.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you yourself ever drank in company with him? - Yes, many times drank a small quantity of beer.</p>
               <p>What state has he been in then? - Not fit to keep reasonable men company; I believe, and am almost sure he was a soldier, because I have seen him with some of the same regiment.</p>

            ? - Yes, I was in company with him on the 31st of January, on Finchley-common, at Mr. Farling's, Brown's Wells; I took the prisoner within a hundred yards of Brown's Wells, I am servant to Madam Lucy, on Finchley-common, I had been at London, and was returning back at the time; I did not stop at this public house, but I met with the prosecutor on the road, at the side of the Common, about two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Did you enter into conversation with the prosecutor? - None while I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How came you and the prosecutor to meet that evening? - We met just as the accident happened, at the Swan and Two Necks; I made my home there that night, my mistress was in town, we had been with my mistress's goods that night to town; the prosecutor came in, and said, I am robbed of nine shillings, says I, I will go back with you, if you will go with me; I have known the prosecutor these good many years, I took the poker out of the fire, and went back with him, and within about two or three hundred yards of Brown's Wells, there were two persons standing, and I said halloo! and they made no answer, and I said, halloo! again, and they made no answer; and I made up to them, and the one run one way and the one the other, I pursued one and Birch the other, and the one I pursued turned round and fired his pistol at me, that was the prisoner, that I am sure of; the pistol flashed in the pan, but went no further, I tripped up his heels and threw him down, and took the pistol from him; here is the pistol, he run it into my side when I kicked his heels up; we took him into Brown's Wells, and went to seek for a constable; and then two others fired at me, we kept him in custody, and he was afterwards carried before a Magistrate, and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was before the Justice, he swore I fired at him three times! - I never said such a word, I said, he fired at me with his pistol, and the other two fired at me as I went along; I had two more pistols attempted to be fired at me, the one made a report, and the other did not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going down to Barnet to my uncle, and the other side of Brown's Wells, two men came up to me, and said, halloo! and I made no answer; and they immediately followed me, and said, life for life, and I immediately run off, and they followed me.</p>
               <p>How do you get your living? - I have been a gentleman's servant lately.</p>
               <p>Was you in service at this time? - I was out of service, I was going to my uncle who lives at Barnet, I have witnesses to my character.</p>

               <p>I am subpoened to this man's character; I have known him personally about three years, I am a clergyman, I live in Berkshire now, but at the time I knew him, he lived with me at South Mims, near Barnet; he was footman to me, for I believe more than a year and half, he was a very sober servant, and I believe, very well thought of by every body in the neighbourhood, as well as in our family; he has left my service about a year and four months, as near as I can recollect; I visited at the gentleman's house that he went to live with, which is this gentleman, Mr. Casamajor.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner about fourteen months, he lived as a servant with me about eight months; he quitted my service about the middle of last July, he had an exceeding good character while he lived with me, and was a very good servant; he gave me warning, he understood nothing of horses; I never heard of him till about a fortnight or three weeks ago, his uncle applied to me.</p>
               <p>Then from July you are a total stranger to the manner in which he conducted himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What way of life is his uncle in? - He is a barber, a very respectable honest man.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. I will examine any more witnesses you may think proper to call, but after two such respectable witnesses as these, it does not seem to me that you want any more witnesses to character.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>On the evening of Monday the 7th of February, I passed through Covent Garden, meaning to turn down Bridges-street, but the carriages were so thick I did not go down; I went down Little Russel-street, which leads into Drury-lane: I was quite alone; I had at that time, a gold watch, a ribbon with a medallion with hair set in gold, three stone seals set in gold, and one base metal watch key gilt with gold, one guinea in gold, and twenty shillings in silver; when I was in Russel-street, I took my watch-chain and buttoned it in my breeches pocket, I had not seen my money since I left Manchester-square, but I know I had it that afternoon; I buttoned my coat to the bottom, and put my hands in my coat pockets, and covered my breeches pockets with my coat pockets; I intended to go these men, I saw eight or ten men pushing about at the month of a court, which is directly opposite to the stage door of <placeName id="t17850223-13-crimeloc69">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Was the prisoner one of these two or three people? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Did you keep your hands in your pockets, Sir, all the time, or how long? - I kept my hands in my pockets some time, I cannot speak with any certainty as to the time, but I took them out to secure myself, as I was pushed about for the space of two minutes; I am quite sure the prisoner was one who pushed me, when I was amongst these people, I knew him again the next morning; I was raised off my legs, I was apprehensive I should lose my balance and fall under the horses feet; they got under my arm and raised me up.</p>
               <p>In what manner was you lifted up, with a degree of violence? - Very much so, I suspected what the case was, and I was determined to keep my hands on my pockets as long as I could; on putting my hands down again, which I did instantly, I found my left hand pocket turned inside out; I put my right hand down, and in putting it down, I caught a man's wrist, I almost instantly put down my left hand, but not my right quite so soon; my money was in breeches pocket, and putting down my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230044"/> right hand I caught a man's wrist, I cannot say whether in my pocket or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts did you catch that hand? - I cannot say with any certainty I put my hand down to secure my pocket, and I caught hold of his wrist that was the hand of the prisoner; I kept hold of his hand four or five minutes before I secured him, the moment I got hold of him, one or two pressed upon me, I reached my left hand over them, and caught him by the collar, I held him there for some time, the rest attempting to get him out of my hand by all the means they possibly could.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass at this time between the prisoner, whose hand you caught, and the other man? - Oh, frequently, the words,</p>
               <p>"pull him up the court," or</p>
               <p>"pull me up the court," were frequently repeated; the prisoner was talking to them the whole time: I have no recollection of what the prisoner said, they repeatedly spoke to one another, the prisoner seemed very anxious to escape, he turned his head the other way; I tore his coat entirely off his back, and his shirt too before I got him secured; I called out repeatedly for assistance, but I believe the Horse Guards dare not dismount, as the King and Queen were expected out; the prisoner's coat, and part of his shirt, and part of his neckcloth came off in my hand; the moment I got him out, I had him in my left hand, and he got from me a little way, about a yard or two I suppose; I immediately sprung after him, and caught hold of him by the hair of his head, and pulled him backwards as well as I could, and I believe at that moment one of the guards dismounted, and I dragged him between the horses; I am sure this is the man, I never lost him for an instant, except that moment that he was out of my hand, and I caught him again; when I dragged him between the horses, two of his companions followed me between there.</p>
               <p>Were these two of the men you saw pushing? - I cannot say, though I have very little doubt of it in fact; one man struck me twice on my breast very hard, so hard that if he had had room for a blow he must have knocked me down, that was evidently with intent, to rescue him; one man I should know again where I saw him, I went him to the

               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Council. I think this transaction happened at the most critical time, when the street is most crowded? - Yes, there was a large concourse of people got together.</p>

               <p>You say you was very much confused? - Certainly.</p>

            , and there I searched him, I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - He forced his discourse to me, and said Townsend I never was near the gentleman at all, I am not guilty; his cloaths were torn very much.</p>
               <p>Had you come up to the crowd by that time? - Yes, I suppose not above a minute<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230045"/> or before; I was at the crossing where the robberies generally are done, and there was such a mob, and so many coaches, I could not get up at any rate, till I came almost to the corner of Bow-street; when I received a blow from the prosecutor, I was close to the corner of Bow-street, the prisoner was then in custody of Blandy, I did not see the prisoner and the prosecutor at any time, till I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure as to the person of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. How long have you bee n an officer at the office? - Two years.</p>
               <p>You know there is a reward? - I dare say you would not wish me to say I do not.</p>
               <p>So the prosecutor mistook you for one of the gang, and hit you a blow on the breast? - He did hit me.</p>
               <p>There was a vast croud of people? - A great number, as there always is.</p>
               <p>When the King and Queen are there, the crowd is greater than ordinary? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Then how many people do you imagine there may be generally about the stage door, when the King and Queen are coming out? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Several hundreds? - I do not say that.</p>
               <p>Are there a hundred? - I cannot say on my oath.</p>
               <p>Are there fifty? - There may, fifty is a great many.</p>
               <p>You found nothing on this man? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Pray whereabouts was that crowd that you mentioned? - Opposite where the King comes out.</p>
               <p>Where were you struck? - Just by the corner of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>CORPORAL ELLIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a corporal in the Life Guards, I was on guard at the Play-house, nearly opposite the door where the King comes out, my face was towards the Play-house door.</p>
               <p>Did you see any croud in the street at that time, before you or behind you? - I did not see much, I heard a bustling several times there, I turned my head round, and saw a gentleman, the prosecutor who stands there, in distress; I called to him once or twice, and made an interval to get him between our horses; the prosecutor was a little to the right of me, but he was so engaged he could not pay attention to me.</p>
               <p>What was he about? - I saw that they were going to do him an injury, I drew my sword, and cut at several of them with the broad part of my sword, they appeared to me to be shoving him about; as I was using my sword and hitting them over the arms and shoulders, the prosecutor called to me, and said, soldier, I have got hold of the man that robbed me, I beg you will assist me to take him; I returned my sword into the sheath, and seized the prisoner at the bar behind the neck, I am sure of the prisoner; the captain called to me and asked what we were doing, upon that I let my hold go, and says to my comrade, get off your horse and assist the gentleman to take him, he got off and secured him; the prisoner was brought into the line and carried across the street; two men followed him, but I said to them, if you do not go back, I will cut you down.</p>
               <p>Did these two men appear to you to come to assist the gentleman? - It did not appear so to me, it was not very easy to pass backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Did the people you saw behind you appear to be passing onwards or backwards? - It was impossible for any body to pass by at that minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. There generally is at that time a number of people to see their Majesties come out? - Yes, it is very usual when they are just expected.</p>
               <p>Then a person might be very honestly pushing and shoving to get that sight, without any bad intention whatever, that is a thing that frequently happens? - I saw no great pushing, they were looking with their faces that way, I saw no shoving but by this party, but I have seen people crowd; I had my eye on this transaction about half a minute, before I was called to make the observation I did; my attention is directed to the King and Queen when they are coming out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding, of Council for the Prosecution, opened the Case as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, when I get up after my young friend, Mr. Garrow, it must necessarily surprise you to see two of us to support this prosecution, and two of my learned friends appearing as Council for the prisoner; but Gentlemen, as you have already collected that the parties here are both foreigners, you will expect from us a particular regard to our duty, you will expect from us a regulated conduct, that we on the part of the prosecution should be careful not even to attempt to enflame your passions, nor to aggravate the conduct of the prisoner at the bar: you will expect likewise from my learned friends on the other side, a regulated decorum in the cross examination of the witnesses: in this country Justice is always administered to the admiration of the world, in such a way as to extort approbation even from the prisoners themselves; the prosecutor is a man of public character, he is a man of great literary same, and well known in France; the prisoner was his secretary. Gentlemen, in consequence of feeling that I am engaged in a particular duty out of the common track, it is that I assure myself I shall not be chastised by his Lordship in going a little out of this case, in order to account for the conduct of the prosecutor, and the manner in which this prosecution has arisen. The Compte, when he came over to this country, in August last, had packed up a number of very valuable effects; and when I tell you that he had lost a manuscript, which he valued infinitely more than the most precious jewel he ever possessed, and which was no less than the correspondence between Voltaire and a gentleman of great literary same, a Monsieur D'Alembert; and attributing this loss to the carelessness or neglect of the man at the bar, he became a little angry with him; there was a woman in the family of the name of Champante, she was dismissed, and then several things were missing that were brought to England, and amongst the rest the subject of the present inquiry; there were some shirts, these were afterwards found in the box of the prisoner at the bars, therefore, Gentlemen, it is on this circumstance alone, that you are to bestow your consideration; you will hear from the witness, from a Lady who saw these shirts in England, who knew them to be the Compte's property, she will tell you the manner in which they were found, and where they were found; and it will be clearly established in proof to you, that these being the Compte's property were found the possession of the prisoner; and it will then become him, to give a clear account he came by them. I should not have stated the other circumstances, but I thought it necessary to assign to you the sole motive for this prosecution: the lady shall stand forth here, and tell her story; you will from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230049"/> there is sufficient proof of the felony, and of the guilt of the sure you will do by him, all that he can with, if he is clearly proved to be guilty, you will pronounce him so; but if on your not satisfied of that guilt; you will more cherfully discharge the other past of your duty, which upon you acquit him.</p>

               <p>Was you there at any time, which any question was asked the prisoner, relative to house and handkerchiefs? - Yes, was, I think he said of the shirts, it must be a mistake of the washerwoman's the handkerchiefs, he said they were his own, that the Compte never had any such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Did not you understand either from the Compte, or this lady, that they had left Paris in a great hurry and confusion? - I have heard from the Compte an history of his own life, I have been acquainted with him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what way did the lady communicate this information to you? - No particular way, I cannot understand her, only I went up along with her, she shewed me by some action, it was hers.</p>

               <p>Were the Compte's things and the secretary's carried out together? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Did they come home together? - I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Compte de MIRABEAU sworn.</p>
               <p>The oath translated into French to him by the Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Ask the Compte, if the prisoner lived with him as his secretary, and when? - Yes, about fifteen months, but I cannot ascertain the day upon oath.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when your female servant, Champante, was dismissed? - About six weeks ago: there are several witnesses here that can prove the days, I do not recollect the days.</p>
               <p>How soon after she was dismissed was it, that you, in company with the lady, went up to search the box of the secretary in his room? - The next day.</p>
               <p>What led to that examination? - The circumstance of Mr. Hardy going to the Bell Inn, in Holborn, to let this Champante know that she was suspected, and that I meant to search her things, which circumstance induced me to suppose Hardy to be an accomplice, and was the reason why I went up stairs in order to search.</p>
               <p>What passed when you went up stairs in company with the lady, and examined the box? - Almost upon opening the box, at top, under a very thin covering of linen that were there, two shirts were discovered, that were mine, these are the shirts that were taken out of the box.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing else taken out of the box? - I was not present at the time when the handkerchiefs were found.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after this? - The moment after and the moment before; for I had found him at the Bell, in Holborn, where I had forbid him to go.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner after this discovery? - I told him of the circumstance of his going to give notice to Mrs. Champante being suspected, after the positive orders that I had given him, and the circumstance of finding afterwards the effects in the box persuaded me he was an accomplice in this theft, of which Mrs. Champante was suspected, and therefore I ordered him to go out of the house directly.</p>
               <p>What answer did the prisoner make? - The prisoner said, with respect to the notice which I have given to Mrs. Champante, appearances are against me, but Monsieur Le Compte, if you was to see any body likely to be hanged, you would tell them to make their escape; with respect to the shirts that have been found in my possession, you know very well the neglect of Madam Champante, and her disorder, it might have happened from neglect of hers, or a mistake of the washerwoman's.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was it that you applied to the Magistrate on this business? - At that time I did not intend to prosecute the prisoner, and so far was I from such an intention, that I told him to come to my house, when certain boxes, which we expected to arrive from France, were come, in order that he, the prisoner, might ascertain what effects there were that belonged to himself, and what effects Mrs. Champante claimed, and what were belonging to me, if they could be found; accordingly Mr. Hardy came several times to me after that, in order to enquire whether the boxes were arrived, and at each time I asked him where he lived, and his answer at each time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230055"/> I asked the question, was, that he did not know the name of the street; it was only from the time that this box arrived, that the prisoner ceased coming to my house; the box came on Saturday, and the Sunday morning after I saw the prisoner at Mr. Spilsbury's; there I told the prisoner to come to me on the Monday following, because I had a letter to give him; he asked me what that letter was, and if the box was arrived, to which I answered in the affirmative; he promised to come to me the next morning at nine, but never made his appearance, and it was only through the prisoner's not coming to his appointment, that I was convinced of his bad intentions towards me: I went to Bow-street, on the Monday.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was that Monday? - I do not remember, but it may be known by the warrant itself.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was searched, when he was apprehended on the warrant? - I was not present when he was taken, I was then in the House of Commons, but I was present when he was examined.</p>
               <p>Did you see any property of your's of any sort taken from him? - Upon examination, the prisoner produced two pacquets of a singular nature, which persuaded me, there was some manoeuvre going on against me at Paris; and this paper together with a small book that belonged to me, was found in the prisoner's pockets, and were delivered to the Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>What was that book? - A number of the Journal of Monsieur - the King of France's brother, of which I have other copies by me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. A number of a book called Journale de Monsieur? - The Justice ordered the pacquet to be sealed, and delivered to the constable who had the prisoner in care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Was not Madam Champante dismissed the night before you spoke to the prisoner about the shirts? - Madam Champante was sent away before ever I spoke to Mr. Hardy about these shirts.</p>
               <p>Had not Madam Champante the sole charge of your linen, and Madam

             doubted not, nor do we now doubt, Madam Champante had robbed us.</p>
               <p>Did you then express your suspicions to the prisoner of that? - Often times, and so much the more particularly, as at that time I did not suspect the prisoner, I spoke to him rather in con fidence than suspicion.</p>
               <p>What was your motive for suffering Champante to go away, when you suspected she had robbed you? - What do you mean, by permitting her to go.</p>
               <p>Discharging her? - She was dismissed merely because she was thought a thief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are not quite correct in that answer; he says, in France it is the principal to turn away a thief.</p>
               <p>Court. If you was at that time convinced that Champante had robbed you, as you now say you was, why did not you prosecute her? - At the time I had no intention to prosecute her, nor had I any intention to prosecute the prisoner, or any body for such triffling things as shirts; the business of this prosecution is of much more importance, and if not of such importance, the prisoner would not be supported in his cause.</p>
               <p>The next morning after Champante was discharged, what did you say to the prisoner? - It was not discovered till the next morning, that the shirts were missing, when I told the prisoner of it; that these shirts were there, and that there were several other shirts and effects to a great amount missing; I was so far from suspecting the prisoner's probity then, that I told him that Champante had committed the theft, and that if she concealed these things any where, or if she had pledged them any where, he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230056"/> take them out; the question had preceeded the discovery, and therefore the prisoner said at once, she lives at the Bell; as soon as the prisoner was acquainted with the discovery of the shirts, then he said, he did not believe she was at the Bell, and that she was gone away that day; I then proposed to Hardy, to go to see whether she was at the Bell, and then I several times after forbid him to go, and it was then that the prisoner went out, and was traced to the Bell, from which circumstance my suspicions of the prisoner were founded.</p>
               <p>Before Hardy proposed going to the Bell to Champante, did not you propose to him, to go to the Bell to ask where these shirts were? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came to the Bell, you found the prisoner there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask Champante about your shirts, and what did you say to her? - The first thing I said, upon coming into the room, and seeing Hardy there, was, what are you doing here, Sir? the prisoner answered, I came here to see whether your shirts were here, I told him I had forbid him; when I came to speak to Champante, I told her I missed a great many shirts, and asked what was become of them.</p>
               <p>How many did you say? - I think seven and twenty, but I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Did not Champante in your presence, and in the presence of the prisoner, say that you had but sixteen in England? - No, so far from saying that I had no more than sixteen shirts in England, she excused herself, by saying, at the house where you lodged every thing was open, what would you have me say to the matter, look and examine my things.</p>
               <p>Did she then offer to open all her trunks for you to see whether any thing was there? She did say look into my boxes, because she had none, she had parcels: but I am not arrived to this time of life, without knowing that when any body says, look into my parcels or boxes, I am to understand that nothing is to be found there.</p>
               <p>Tell him he is only to answer to facts, without making his own deductions? - If I am called to speak the truth, I must say the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner return with you to your lodgings? - He followed me, but I do not know whether he came into the house the same time with me.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come to your lodgings after you? - I cannot say upon my oath, whether he came in at the instant, I believe I saw him a little time after.</p>
               <p>After the prisoner returned to the lodgings, did not he of his own accord, produce his box before you and Madam

            ? - He did not offer his box to be examined by me, the things had been examined before, and his effects were then upon the stairs.</p>

               <p>But he did produce his box? - No.</p>
               <p>That day you discharged him? - That day, and that instant.</p>
               <p>Did you pay him his wages? - I paid him nothing, because I owed him nothing, he was indebted to me.</p>
               <p>How many months had he served you? - I cannot ascertain upon oath the precise time, but I arrived in England in the month of August, and he was from thence.</p>
               <p>What had you paid him? - I do not think I am bound to answer that question, neither can I do it, unless I look over my books of my stated expences.</p>
               <p>Had you given him money? - Yes, before witnesses.</p>
               <p>How much? - I do not think myself bound to answer that, neither can I do it upon oath, at this present moment.</p>
               <p>Did you give it him for wages? - Yes, that will be seen by the civil action, that is to be tried.</p>
               <p>When was that civil action commenced by the prisoner? - By way of recrimination, three or four days after he knew that the warrant was issued out against him, as appears by the writ.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Desire him not to make a speech, but to say the dates? - The writ will certify much better than my memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230057"/>When was you served with that writ, when was the prisoner taken up? - More than a week after.</p>
               <p>After the writ was served upon you? - Yes, but was obtained three days before.</p>
               <p>Court. For what sum was you arrested? - He claimed thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Did you say what wages you give him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We are trying the right of the man to recover on the assumpsit of the civil action.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It is very unfortunate that this gentleman the Compte, makes a speech on every question that we ask him, by which means our questions lose their effect.</p>
               <p>Did the Compte before he took out a warrant against the prisoner, ever see him at the house of Mr. Spilsbury his printer? - Yes, I saw him on the Sunday morning, I only got the warrant on Monday.</p>
               <p>You said nothing at that time, as to the dishonesty of the prisoner to Mr. Spilsbury? I told Mr. Spilsbury before that, that I had strong suspicions against him, and as Mr. Spilsbury was printing my work at that time, and the proofs came through the prisoner's hands, I cautioned Mr. Spilsbury's son, not to trust the prisoner with the proofs any more, because the prisoner was turned out of my service.</p>
               <p>You said nothing to Mr. Spilsbury's son about the prisoner having robbed you? - I did not know at that time Mr. Hardy had robbed me.</p>
               <p>But it was after the prisoner had left your service? - I never thought of prosecuting the prisoner, on account of this trifling master of shirts, I never thought of denouncing the prisoner as a thief on that account, but when the box came, which certified to me that I had effects of much greater consequence, then it was I determined to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I refer my defence to my council.</p>

               <p>What orders had the servants when he was gone? - The Compte had no domestick but myself, the other domestick he had, he had sent off at twenty leagues distance, that he might not know he was leaving Paris.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect what linen was packed up? - I cannot tell the quantity of linen, but Madam Nara took an account of it.</p>
               <p>Do you know the quantity of linen the Compte had in London? - I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Who gave it to wash? - The lady herself.</p>
               <p>Who gave out Hardy's linen to wash? - He used to give it to me, and I used to give it the washer-woman.</p>
               <p>Did you give the Compte's, and Madam Nara's linen to the same washer-woman? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230058"/> Yes, the same washer-woman, and made out a bill for Mr. Hardy's linen, and the Compte's.</p>
               <p>The Court and prosecutor's council conferred some short time, then the Court said.</p>
               <p>Sir Gilbert, the prosecutor has consented to drop this prosecution, but only on condition of the reason of this perseverance being made public; he thinks that necessary? - I am able to give that information, because this prosecution was begun and persevered in by my advice; the Compte dined at my house at the time he received the first information, that his boxes returned from France empty; he asked me what he had best do, I advised him immediately to arrest Hardy, as the best chance; he took that advice from me, and immediately took out a warrant; some days after, he was arrested at the suit of Hardy, which certainly appeared to me and to him a recrimination: now this public explanation is necessary, because it has been insinuated, that this is a malicious prosecution: but the reason for my advising the prosecutor at first, was to recover the property, and the reason for persisting in it, was this, that at the public examination of the prisoner in Bow-street, some of the prisoner's friends were present at the time, and he was advised to reserve his defence, but he asked whether he might not make his defence then, because he said he would shew the Justice, that the Compte was not a person, that was to be believed on his oath; when I heard that, I advised the prosecutor to persevere in this prosecution, as I had then known him a great many years, and had been his school fellow, and had as full a conviction of his honour, as I have of my brother.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir Gilbert, you will take the trouble, to tell the Compte from the Court, there is nothing has dropt, that throws the smallest imputation on him, he has acted very wisely, and his honour is not in the least degree impeached, by any thing that has occurred in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I must tell you one thing, that two persons whom you do not know, applied for the money before the arrest.</p>
               <p>Court. The attempt to throw a stain on the Compte's honour, was very improper, because it is not the same thing for a Frenchman to run away, as it is in England; but Sir

               <p>What is the value of it? put the lowest value on it. - Two shillings, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Have you had it any time? - I have had it these thirty years, but it was whole and good; and I then said, Good God! watchman, this is my bundle; why, says he, if so, you are robbed; so I dropped the bundle down, and ran home, and alarmed my family, and I ran up three pair of stairs, where I knew this gown was, and there I missed what are contained in the indictment; they were all in the two pair of stairs and in the garret, that I am quite sure of, I saw them that day in their proper places, not tied up in a bundle; when I missed these things, I went down stairs, and the watchman brought in the bundle, and it contained the things mentioned in the indictment, except the looking glass in a mahogany frame, which was taken away intirely; there were in the bundle, including the blanket that tied up the bundle, three woollen blankets, value twelve shillings, I have had them some time, I do not know the blankets by any marks, only missing them from the bed; two pair of linen sheets, value 10 s. I do not know that they had any mark, I only suppose them to be mine by missing them from the bed; there was one woollen surtout coat, value 14 s. this is it which I have on; it was not finished, and had not the buttons then, I can swear to it, it was my own making, there was a pair of velvet breeches, that were in my room; the value of them is about seven shillings, they were not finished, they were my son's work, the stuff cost me seven and sixpence, they were in the garret, there was a cloth coat belonging to one of my lodgers, which I had to repair; that was in the room, I know the coat extremely well, it was a blue one, it had my work in it, I value that at three shillings; I kept the things, but I have not brought them with me.</p>
               <p>In what situation was your family at that time? - There were some in the fore room, and some in the kitchen, the garret windows were entirely broke; one of the casements entirely broken wide enough to let in the body of a man, I was in the garret about four.</p>
               <p>It was light then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is your house adjoining this empty house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any possible communication from this empty house to this garret window? - They got in at the back door of this empty house and got up stairs and out of the garret window, and went along the leads to our house.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any disturbance in the garret at any time? - No, but I have no doubt, but they came in that way, they broke one casement all to pieces; that was the casement that was fixed, not the one that opens, I imagine they put their hands through to undo the other casement, because the other was open but not broke.</p>
               <p>Can you speak whether the other window was open when you last saw it? - I am sure it was not, there is a bed in the room, and I pasted paper all round the casement, and I am sure it was all safe when I saw it; the watchman afterwards brought this chap.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Your family were not gone to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>You had not shut up your house fast all over? - No.</p>
               <p>It was as it is in the day time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not as it is when you go to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these old second-hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230060"/> things, would not seven or eight and twenty shillings be the value of them? - No, nor two pounds nine neither.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman in this neighbourhood, my box is opposite the empty house, I came out between eight and nine, and I examined the back door of this empty house, and it was seemingly fast.</p>
               <p>I what way did you examine it? - I shoved my stick against it in the usual way, and it appeared to be fast, I examined about the court, at that minute I heard the bolt of a door, or something like it put back; I turned about, and saw a man with a bundle, and another man underneath that rushed out, and two others.</p>
               <p>Who had the bundle? - I do not know; the prisoner at the bar and another man rushed out, immediately after this I looked about, and then I called out stop thief! and sprung my rattle and ran, but the three were soon out of sight.</p>
               <p>Was there any lamp near the door? - It was quite light, the lamp was not quite four yards from this door I am sure, besides my lanthorn gave a very good light; I ran after them, and when I came to the prosecutor's door, I came up to the man that had the bundle, and made a blow at him, and came within a blow of him, and he dropped the bundle; I do not know him, I saw only his back.</p>
               <p>Did the two men come out at the same instant? - Yes, the two first and the two last.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner at the bar was one of them? - I am sure he was one of the two last that came out, he with the bundle came out first, and another man along with him.</p>
               <p>Did they all four run? - Yes, but the other three run faster than the man with the bundle, one of the two last had something under his arm, which appeared to be a glass; I saw something of the frame, something of wood, but I did not see the glass.</p>
               <p>Can you say, whether the prisoner was one of the two last or the two first? - One of the two last, but there was very little difference between them.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner or the other that had the wood underneath his arm? - I am not sure which of the two had it, but still I am of opinion that it was the other, the man dropped it, and I stumbled against it, and it tumbled me over and over, that hindered me from having them; he who had the bundle was last then, I then sprung my rattle, and the prosecutor came out.</p>
               <p>When did you take the prisoner? - This was the 8th of January, and the 15th I was was walking through Whitecomb-court, and I saw the prisoner and two girls of the town together, and I knew him again and took him.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with certainty, that the prisoner at the bar was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him? - He only looked about he went off as quick as thought, he went along as quick as he could I dare say, for he knew me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Do you know his person? - I do.</p>
               <p>Ho w long have you known him? - I have seen him several times since May last.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation between you and the prisoner at the time of the robbery? - Not a single word, I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Had you conversed with him before? - No, never, but I have seen him in company.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by name? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when you took him? - I do not remember any particulars, it was in an entry in a public house, I went in, there were liquors, he paid for his liquor, and asked me to drink, I said no.</p>

               <p>What is the name of that public-house? - One Sargent keeps it; I then followed him, and told him he should come with me, he asked where, I said he should know by and by; he seemed agreeable to come, and I thought to have made him fast, and when he came to the door he sprung away, and said, you buggerer you have not got me yet.</p>
               <p>Did he get clear away from you? - Yes, he got into Sydney's-alley, and two gentlemen stopped him.</p>
               <p>How long did you lose sight of him? - About a minute, and then I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But hark ye! my master watchman, you knew this man from having seen him in company several times? - I never was in his company, but I have seen him drink a glass.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue these people that came out of the house? - Yes, or I would not have got the fall I did.</p>
               <p>You did not take any of them? - No.</p>
               <p>From the 8th to the 14th, did you lodge any information against the prisoner, before any Magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>As you knew the man, how happens you did not? - Because I thought I could soon meet with him, and I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Do you remember asking him to give you a glass of gin that night, when you took him? - I remember I did not, I searched him.</p>
               <p>Did you search his lodgings? - Never.</p>
               <p>You have never found any of the property of this man, except what was taken from the first man that came out? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>It was a sort of a by place? - It was Whitcomb-street.</p>
               <p>This man past you as quick as thought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you think yourself warrantable upon that, to come here and swear positively to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Well, you may get twenty pounds by it, perhaps? - I do not want a farthing.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was coming from Market-lane, I had been to one Mr. Innes, an acquaintance of my father's; I went into a house the corner of Coventry-street, and two young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230063"/> women said, it was a very cold night; the watchman came in, and asked me to give him a glass of something, I denied him because I did not know him; he went out at the door, and turned round, and asked me who I was, I said, I was a cabinet-maker; says he, you must come with me, I went, and when he came to the door, I said, I had done nothing, and I will not go with you; when he took me to the watch-house, he said, he had several suspicions of me, for foot-pads, and burglaries; he said, he knew nothing of me himself, but he said, he could bring some body to swear to me, I do not know at this time where the gentleman lives, nor the street; I had been moving that day, which was the 8th of January, all the day, from Lambeth to Covent-Garden, and my wife and father was putting up the things in the room, and I returned home about seven or eight at night; the woman that lives in the one pair of stairs let me in, and she said, I believe your father or wife are gone out, will you come in; I went to my sister's and returned, and the gentlewoman can prove I went up stairs soon after, and was not out afterwards; the watchman said, in my presence, that he never saw any body come out of the empty house.</p>

               <p>Court. The prisoner has said, that you have declared, you never saw any body come out of the empty house, in his presence; is that true, did you make any such declaration? - No.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 13th of December last, about ten minutes before nine, I was robbed by six or seven persons of which the prisoners were two; I know the prisoners, I was at <placeName id="t17850223-17-crimeloc91">St. George's in the East</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said, he did not know who the persons were that robbed him, he wished he did.</p>
               <p>Now was you always in the same story? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it not dark night? - It was, but there was a woman sitting with a candle very near the place, so that it was as light as it is now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor had not money to carry on this prosecution, and Whiteway offered him money to carry this prosecution on, says he, keep up your spirits, never mind it, I will gammon for you.</p>

               <p>What time was this that he told you so? - About a fortnight before Christmas, I know nothing of the prisoners, but by sight, I know one by sight, because his mother deals in Rosemary-lane, the same as I do.</p>

               Dean-street, St. Andrew's Parish
            </rs>, my house was broke open on the 13th of January, in the evening between seven and eight, I cannot tell exactly; they came in at the street-door, but I cannot say, whether the street door was upon the latoh or not, somebody came in unknown to me, and went up stairs to the first floor, and opened the dining room door, with a false key, my daughter about half an hour before, brought down the key into the kitchen, where I and my wife were, and laid it in it's place.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing broke? - Nothing; I lost a jacket and petticoat, and a surtout coat, and a cloth coat, the fellow to this waistcoat, I value the great coat at two pounds eight shillings, and the jacket and petticoat at twenty shillings, a cloth coat, value fifteen shillings, it was not much worn, and a pair of black velveret breeches, lined with leather, they are quite new, I never wore them, they cost me twenty-seven shillings, I value them at twenty shillings, there was another coat, what they call a Bath coat, with a green cape; I know my things were in the room that day about ten or eleven o'clock; I heard nobody in the house; I was below in the kitchen cleaning my tools, I am a milwright by trade, and I says to my wife, I have some tools lay in the chest up stairs, I will fetch them down; I took the key which my daughter brought down, and when I went up stairs, the door stood wide open, I was coming down in a passion, and I looked to see whether the bolt was slipped, and I found the bolt was back, that was before eight, it might be twenty minutes after my daughter was up there, or more; I called to my wife, and my daughter ran up stairs, and she declared that she locked it, and it had been opened, I had given a strict charge about it; I directly went and said to my son in law, run down to some of the pawnbrokers, and I will go to the others, so he went one way, and I went the other; and a young man from Mr. Dobree's came to my house, and brought me some of the things, and I found some at Mr. Lane's, the corner of the coal-yard, there I found a cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. What time did you find that at Lane's? - The next day, and I found the coat that is the fellow to this waistcoat, and a petticoat of my wife's, that had been pledged at Mr. Weston's.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was locked? - Yes, I always try it, and I tried it then, there are two people in the house besides us, and they might leave the street door open; there was a coverlid taken off the bed, and a blue stuff petticoat, and a green silk petticoat of mine.</p>
               <p>Were they up stairs when you locked the door? - Yes; I cannot say where my father's great coat and breeches were; there was a jacket and petticoat and handkerchief of mine hung over a chair by the bedside, and a white cloak of mine hung behind the door, there was one shirt and apron, but I cannot tell whether they were in the room when I locked the door.</p>

I applied to Justice Hyde, and some of the officers came with me, and went out upon the parapet through the window, and some of my things were dropped in the gutter; after that I went into the publick house, and got up upon the top of the houses, and at a house in Lisle-street, I found a trap door; these houses were searched, and nothing found. On Thursday, the 17th, I went to the house of Mr. Moffat, a salesman, in Leicester street, to buy a coat, and there I saw my own coat that had been stolen, I was sure it was my own coat, but the buttons of it had been taken off, and others put on, I told Moffat it was my coat, and he said he bought it: the next morning I got a search warrant, and then Mr. Moffat produced a pair of velvet breeches, which were mine, and which, he said, he bought at the same time with the coat; I said nothing to the people, only saying it was my coat.</p>

               <p>Then you did not ask any further questions? - No.</p>
               <p>What I mean is this, was there any unwillingness in Moffat, or the people in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230069"/> house, to shew the things, or to give you information? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Was the alteration in the buttons, better or worse buttons? - Worse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>What sort of buttons had been on it before? - It was a gilt button, with a border to the edge of it.</p>
               <p>How do you know the coat to be yours? - At the sight of the coat, I knew it immediately for the colour, and examining the sleeve corresponded exactly with the directions I gave the taylor, being particular in having two buttons on the sleeve, to make it button close to the wrist, and the collar is what they term a stand up collar.</p>
               <p>Was it so by any particular directions? - It was the taylor's own doing, they are generally made so.</p>
               <p>Are they not frequently made with two buttons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there seems to me to be nothing by which you can identify this coat, except the circumstance of its fitting? - The part where the buttons had been sewed on the facing, had been unripped, and new sewed again.</p>
               <p>Court. The other side is not the same, is the taylor here who made the coat? - He is.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole you have no doubt but it is your coat? - I am confident of it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I described every mark before I saw them at Mr. Moffat's, I ordered horn buttons put to the waistband, and the flap, and the pockets, and death-head buttons to be put to the knees, and the garter to be the same as the breeches, and I found them answer every description.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor, I work for Mr. Taylor, in Duke-street, St. James's, I made this coat for Mr. Morgan, I cut it for him, I did not sew it, I know it to be the same for several reasons; I know it by having taken it in at the top of the sleeve, and the side, it was rather too big; it is visible to me, being my own work, it would not be visible to any body else.</p>
               <p>Can you judge as a workman, whether one side of it appears to be unripped? - Yes, it is plain, it is to put on these buttons.</p>
               <p>Is there any other mark, except the circumstance of this being unripped, that could enable you to judge, that the buttons on that coat had been changed, if you had never seen the coat before, could you have told that it had been unripped? - I cannot justly say that, I should have believed it to be so, but I would not wish to swear it.</p>
               <p>Take a penknife and unrip a part of the facing, on the side next the buttons? - The buttons were never put on by a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Could you as a workman have judged of it, if you had never seen the coat before? - Now I have unripped it, I see as a workman, that these buttons were never put on by a workman.</p>
               <p>What buttons were on the coat when it was made at first? - I cannot exactly remember, but it was a gilt button, with a small border, plain in the middle; I believe it was a double border, but I cannot be exact, but it was plain in the middle.</p>
               <p>Which of the buttons were best, these that are on now, or those that were on before? - Those that were on before were the best a great deal.</p>
               <p>Would it sell for more with these buttons, than it would before? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does it appear to you, as a workman, that the coat would be made more marketable,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230070"/> by changing the buttons? - They certainly were better before.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor lodged in my house; on Saturday the 5th of February, I was below in the parlour at work, about a quarter after eight in the evening, and I heard a window thrown up, I apprehended it to be at the top of the house; a young man who lodges in the second floor was in the house with me, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Was he above stairs or below? - Above; I took the candle and run up stairs, and went into his room, and desired he would step up stairs with me into the garret, for I thought somebody was in the house; I went up with him, and the room door was locked, which was the prosecutor's; about half an hour before, I went up to see if the windows were all safe, and to turn down the beds; I am sure the windows were all shut then, and I had left the door open, not shut: finding the door locked, I was very much surprised, I ran down for assistance, the young man staid above at the door, I went up stairs, and by that time I got up stairs, the door was burst open; nobody was in the room, the window was wide open.</p>
               <p>Was the house door shut or open? - Shut.</p>
               <p>Was it upon the latch, so that any body could get in, without knocking? - No, it was locked.</p>
               <p>So that any person could not come in at the street door, and have got up to the room? - Impossible.</p>
               <p>(The Constable called again.)</p>
               <p>Court to Crosby. In what manner did Moffat behave? - He behaved exceedingly well, he rather thought it was hard to have his house searched being a man of great property.</p>
               <p>Did you or Morgan inform Moffat, that the coat that had been shewn to Morgan the night before, was a part of his property that was stolen? - Yes, and he said then he had a pair of breeches, that he bought of the same person.</p>
               <p>Did you inform him before you searched, that that coat was a part of the property that was stolen? - Yes, before we searched.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was told by one of you, before you searched at all? - I remember it, because I said, Sir, the man has been robbed of all his wearing apparel, and he is but a poor servant.</p>
               <p>Now after you had told him that the coat, that had been seen by Morgan, was a part of the things stolen, what did he say? - He produced the breeches, after I had been up stairs, and searched two or three rooms.</p>
               <p>After you had told him that that coat was a part of the things stolen? - Yes, he rather seemed to be a little rusty of the matter, and talked that he was a man of property, and should not be used in that manner, and he further told me he should take notice of it; I told him I must execute my office.</p>
               <p>When you went there, you told him what you came to search for? - Yes, and that it was for wearing apparel, that was stolen from a house in Princes-street, and the coat that Morgan had seen the night before, was a part of the property; I searched the sale-shop, and two of the wordrobes.</p>
               <p>Where were the breeches produced from? - One of Mr. Moffat's acquaintance came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230071"/> up, and said here is a pair of breeches, which we bought with the coat, and I came down stairs and found the breeches on the compter, but where they were taken from I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who came up to tell the prosecutor? - A gentleman's servant.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Moffat produced the breeches, from some other black breeches, while we were above stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Crosby. How long might it be before you were called down, and the breeches were produced? - I suppose it might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you ask Moffat at all, why he had not told you of the breeches, when he first came in? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he give any reasons why he had not? No, when he produced the breeches, I asked him upon his word, says I, Mr. Moffat have you any more property of the prosecutor's, I said I believe I can take your word, he said upon his honour he had not; we went to the parties where he had them, we never found any more property, we then went to the lad that he bought them of, that was

               <p>Do you remember buying any thing of Wolf? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - This day three weeks, on a Monday.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the things were? Yes, I recollect some of them, but not all rightly.</p>
               <p>What do you recollect? - This coat and breeches, and a drab coat, a great coat, and another mixed coat, I bought them from Wolf.</p>
               <p>How long were they in your possession afterwards? - Not above five minutes, I went with some of the things to Rag-fair, and sold them there, and this coat and breeches, I sold to a taylor in Houndsditch, who deals in old clothes; and I sold the other things to different people, but this coat and breeches, and another coat, I sold the same day, a few minutes after I bought them.</p>
               <p>What is that taylor's name? - Joseph.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know that was that coat and breeches? - I know them if I see them; this is the very same coat I bought of Wolf.</p>
               <p>Had it the same buttons on then that it has now? - No, my Lord, it had not, there was a very handsome fashionable gilt button, a very large one on it then.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the very same things? - Yes, my Lord, I am very positive of it; I took them afterwards of Joseph again, he told me I sold them too dear, so he desired me to take them, and sell them for the most advantage I could.</p>
               <p>What did you sell them to Joseph for? - I sold them to Joseph with another coat, for two pounds four shillings.</p>
               <p>When did you take them back from Joseph? - Last Thursday week.</p>
               <p>Are you sure yourself, independent of any information you received from Joseph, that the things you took back from him, were the same that you sold him? - I am quite sure they are the same clothes I sold to him.</p>
               <p>Were the same buttons on when you took them again? - He told me he took off the buttons, which was a very handsome button, and put them on a new coat, which he had made for himself.</p>
               <p>Who did you sell them to, after you had them from Joseph? - I sold them to Mr. Moffatt, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>What did Moffatt give you for them? - For this coat and breeches, he gave me one pound fourteen shillings; I did not receive the other coat from Joseph again, he sold them himself.</p>

               <p>Did they lodge any time lately, in Lisle-street, or Princes-street, or any where near Leicester-fields? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was the house that you speak of, in Lisle-street, on which there is a trap door, that goes out upon the top of the houses; is that a public house, or a private house? - The house that we went out of, was a public house, which was open, but the other was private.</p>
               <p>Court to Crosby. Which way did you go? - Up to the top of the houses, through the public house, there was a trap door to the publick house, the trap door was fastened, I could hardly get it open, I broke my stick in wrenching it open.</p>
               <p>What other trap door did you find that communicated with the leads? - I found none till I came to the second d oor, there I found a trap door that went into a small garret that was wide open, and that was the door of an empty house; I went down into the empty house, and searched every room and closet, but nobody was there, nor anything; when I came to the door of the empty house, it was a spring lock, with a large knob to open it, and a very easy lock, and would easily shut too after any body that went out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230074"/>How far was you affected with the liquor? - Why, I cannot say I was affected very much.</p>
               <p>Did you know what you was about? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you been at a public house in the neighbourhood there? - The last house I was at, was the sign of the White Horse; I did not stay above seven minutes, I had been at another public house about an hour; after they threw me across the logs, I was partly strangled with the blow, and one thing or another; a woman came along and saw me lay, and these four men were all standing together, the woman had a candle and lanthorn, she looked round, and hearing me groan, she squalled.</p>
               <p>Then you at this time was almost insensible? - Not insensible, but I could not speak.</p>
               <p>What deprived you of your speech? - Why some how or other, they gave me a push with a hand, or hit me a slap on the face, and my cough took me.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether they did any thing to you after you was down? - I cannot tell what they did, nor for above a minute, the woman came and hallooed out, for God's sake, there is a man that is very much in liquor; then I put my hand into my pocket, and I missed my watch, and I said, I have been robbed, I then saw two of the men walking off.</p>
               <p>What became of the other two? - They stood by me, for the woman said, for God's sake, friend, help the man up, he is very much in liquor, and see him home.</p>


               <p>Did you get your watch again? - I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>When was the last time you had your watch in your hand? - At the White Horse, I put it in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Did the chain hang out? - No, it did not hang out, for I was attacked at the door of the White Horse by two men who took hold of my chain there, that made me go in.</p>
               <p>What two men were those? - The men that went away, I went in there for safety.</p>
               <p>Did you feel who took your watch? - I did not feel it go at all.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoners or either of them? - These two men were in the gardens along with the other two, but which of the four took my watch I cannot tell; there was a woman there too which I did not see.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that these two men are two of the four? - Yes, these two men staid and helped me up, I believe it was almost dark.</p>
               <p>Then what have you to say against these two men? - I cannot say they took my watch.</p>
               <p>Do not you think it is more likely, that if your watch was taken, it should be taken by the men that run away? - Possibly it might, I do not know which took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. The woman said, you was very drunk, do you mean to take upon yourself to say, that you never saw these young men before? - Never before that time.</p>
               <p>How did you describe one of these as dressed, before the Magistrate? - In a light coloured coat, not one of these, but one of the four.</p>

               <p>In what state was the room? - Dirty with people having been in, nothing was taken out of that room, but out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>- MANN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the Speaker's train bearer, one of the footmen came to my house on Saturday morning about seven, and desired I would come immediately to the Speaker's; accordingly I went to the library, there the Speaker was; I saw the bars broke open, and in a very different state to what it was in the evening, when I went away, and his clothes thrown about, some taken away, and some remaining; I put the gold gown the day before into the box, the bag was thrown down at the bottom of the stairs, and the gown taken out; I found the Speaker had lost several articles, a brown coat and waistcoat, a scarlet waistcoat, velvet breeches, black silk breeches, six pair of silk stockings, a servant's great coat, and two hats, the property of the Speaker; and a great coat, and a shirt that belonged to one of the servants; I went to a public house at Lambeth, on Monday about one, and there I found the things, I found a brown coat and waistcoat, a pair of velvet breeches, black silk stocking breeches, a pair of doc skin breeches, and three shirts, all the Speaker's; a livery hat, six pair of stockings, two hats, a servant's great coat, a scarlet waistcoat, all together in one bag; the Speaker's gown was never found; I then went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and from Sir Sampson's I went to the prisoner's house, on Monday after church, which was the 31st of January; the 30th of January<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230076"/> was kept; we searched the prisoner's house and found nothing but a pair of boots which they brought away with them.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on these boots? - Those boots were taken to the Speaker's house, I saw them, and I saw they tallied exactly with the marks in the Speaker's garden, I further observed to the Speaker, that I thought that one of the persons that broke in, had nails in his shoes, I compared the foot with the boots, and they exactly tallied; I compared the pegs on the right foot.</p>
               <p>(A piece of the heel piece being off, the pegs stood up, handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Had you observed before you saw the boots, which foot it was that had these marks, whether the right or the left? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Had you observed before what number of holes were made by the pegs? - No, but afterwards, when I had the boot, I saw the boot put upon the ground, and it exactly tallied.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the boot being compared with them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You have seen something, that looked like the impression of nails? - The boot appeared as if the person that wore them, had trod a good deal in mud.</p>
               <p>Whether it was town or country mud, you do not swear, I am sure? - No.</p>
               <p>What weather was it Saturday, Sunday, and Monday? - Very dirty weather, the Sunday and Monday was very dirty.</p>
               <p>You did not cover the impression after you first observed it? - No.</p>
               <p>The appearance to you, was like that of a man with nails regularly put into his shoes? - Not very regular, but I did not count them.</p>
               <p>- HAMMOND sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a public house at Lambeth, it is I suppose about two hundred yards from my door to that Gentleman's house, he has lived there about six months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where were these things found? - Down in an old cellar, which my landlord keeps for the use of buildings.</p>
               <p>How near is that cellar to the prisoner's house? - I suppose it is about twenty yards, not further.</p>
               <p>When did you find these things? - Last Sunday was three weeks, I was repairing my tap room, and I asked my landlord to let me have a little lime and hair: he told me the door was nailed up, and I might force it open, and the next day me and one Nicholls went to the cellar, and Nicholls saw a great coat, then I saw two hats, then we proceeded to the dark corner, and I kicked my foot against something, I thought it had been a man; these were the same things Mr. Mann had from me.</p>

               <p>Court. How far is the window of the cellar from the prisoner's house? - As far as from me to your Lordship, not a great way, there is some paling that parts it from his house, and there is a little bit of a wicket-gate, that comes out of his house.</p>
               <p>Did the other man make any observation? - No, he was only with me, and one of the Justices was with me.</p>

               <p>Court. Then the holes were in the earth before the boot was put on the earth? - Yes, there were some places that appeared three, and some four; there were marks upon them all.</p>

               <p>Did it tally in length and breadth? - Yes, as nigh as any thing could do in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is to say, that in all the impressions there were marks of something: be so good to look at these pegs, and tell me upon your oath, whether you think that boot has been worn since the heel tap as it is called came off? - I do not know whether it has or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The pegs appear to be perfectly fresh; with permission of the Court, I will take off the heel of this other boot.</p>
               <p>(Takes it off, and the pegs appeared just the same as the other.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Macmanus. How far was the house from the water-side? - It leads round, it was on the soft ground where they trod.</p>
               <p>Court to Goodwin. Had any of the candles been made use of? - No.</p>
               <p>Had any been lighted? - No, Sir, there was a whole candle dropped in the garden, that had not been lighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing at all to say, I am innocent of all I am accused of.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called five witnesses to his character.</p>

            . there having been at that time in the country, and I am affraid the practice still remains, of numbers of persons associating themselves together, and assembling for the direct and avowed purpose of carrying their illicit trade into execution; and great bodies of men sometimes disguised, and sometimes armed and not disguised, have assembled together, and in short, almost threatened the destruction of the revenue: that act enacts, that if any persons to the number of three or four, armed with fire arms, or other offensive weapons, shall be assembled, aiding and assisting, in the running, landing, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230079"/> carrying away prohibited or uncustomed goods, or goods liable to pay any duties, or in case any persons to the number of three or more, being so armed, and that with fire-arms, and other offensive weapons, shall be assisting, or shall forcibly hinder, obstruct, and every such person shall be guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy; so that you see the offence, with which this person is charged, is that he, with two other persons, in the first place was assembled, with intent to do some of the things mentioned in the act of parliament, in the next place, that he actually did assist in carrying away prohibited goods, after they had been seized, and likewise that he, being so assembled, and so armed, did oppose the officers in their duty; and under my lord's direction, who will state the law to you, I shall submit, if this case is fully proved, that the prisoner will appear to be guilty. Gentlemen, the indictment charges this man, and two other persons with this offence, and it will be necessary to prove in order to bring the prisoner within this law, that there were three men of them, and therefore though the other two are not apprehended, and whether we shall be able to apprehend them, I cannot say; yet it will be necessary for you to take into consideration, the case of the other two; but if the facts come out as they are stated to me, there will be no doubt of their guilt, any more than of the prisoner's: the prisoner, and those two other persons, are belonging to a place called Corsham, in Cornwall; a place noted for persons of the description of the prisoner; they had been seen loitering about Ringmore, which was not the place of their abode: on the first of August, one

Woodhouse ran to fetch the other officer, and before they returned, these three men, the prisoner, and May and Randell, ran off with the liquors which the officers had seized; they returned again, and swore they would have the remainder; upon which Toy took up a bag of tea, and these three men followed him; they forced open the parlour door and took the tea from him, and carried it into the yard where Woodhouse was, who endeavoured to get it away from them, upon which Randell struck him a violent blow with his bludgeon on the temple, which brought him to the ground, and rendered him totally insensible; upon this Toy came up, and he began to be very active, and he with a bludgeon with several claws sticking out of it, by which I suppose is meant, they are the roots of the stick, not any iron fixed into it, as I suppose, but the wood so pointed as to make excresences, and sharp ones; he made a blow at him with this, and that took off the brim of his hat; Toy came and rescued him: the three smugglers then became more violent; they swore they would have all the things; the officers told them they should not; and the officers finding they were determined to preserve the things went away: it is upon this act you are to determine whether the prisoner is guilty. Gentlemen, it is not for me to make any observations, but such as naturally arise out of the direct case; I do not wish to inflame your minds; the question is a question of fact; what the law is, his Lordship will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230080"/> explain; and upon applying that law to the facts, as they appear to you, will depend the verdict you are to give: all I can say is, that if the prisoner is guilty, he is undoubtedly a very proper object of justice; and unless these prosecutions are carried on with effect, wheresoever there is a fair and proper example, it will be impossible the revenue of this country should much longer escape destruction.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing else in that field of barley? - Some little time afterwards, Valentine found a half hundred bag of tea, and soon after we found this last bag of tea; we heard a noise of some person calling, we soon understood it to be the supervisor, Mr. Woodhouse.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>What distance was you at this time from the yard where Woodhouse was left? - I believe it was a quarter of a mile, we returned to Woodhouse; we met the supervisor at the field gate adjoining the yard in a very great hurry, we all three went back to the yard again.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was in the yard when you came back? - I think there was the supervisor and a neighbouring man, there were no strangers there; I think there was a man standing at a little distance.</p>
               <p>What, was the labouring man to assist Woodhouse? - I do not know what Woodhouse had said to him, he was not called there by Woodhouse, he came himself first of all, from hearing a seizure was made, his name is Hall.</p>
               <p>When you all three came back to the yard, what did you do? - We meant then to remove these goods from the yard into the farm-house.</p>
               <p>Did you proceed to do so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed on that? - I carried in the last bag of tea myself, and as I was entering the door with this tea, I saw three men at a distance coming to the farm house.</p>

            , as I understood their names to be since, I have seen them all before, but had no great acquaintance with them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see them? - Directly opposite the farm-house door, they came over a stile and run directly after me.</p>
               <p>Did you see them coming over the stile? - I cannot say I saw them coming over the stile, they were just by the stile, they might be over, there was no other way for them to come but over the stile, that was about a hundred yards from the house, they pursued me into the house; I carried a bag of tea into the parlour on the left hand, and shut the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you shut the door of the house? - No, I shut the door of the parlour, there was no bolt to the best of my remembrance, I put my knee against it, and kept it as long as I could.</p>
               <p>What did these three persons do? - They forced the door open upon me, and I asked them when they came in, whether they meant to murder me, for by their threats before they broke in, I expected they would; they made use of a deal of ill language that I cannot repeat, open the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230083"/> door you b - g - r, and all the names that they could.</p>
               <p>What did they say they would do? - Murder, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>What sort of language was it? - Threatening language, I was terrified or else I could have kept the door longer, my strength was gone through fear, but I did not open the door myself, they forced it open, then the prisoner said I should not be hurt, provided I would deliver up all the goods, for the goods were theirs, and they would have them.</p>
               <p>What became of the bag of tea and the goods? - The bag of tea was taken out by one of them, it was laying on the floor in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Had these men any thing in their hands? - They had bludgeons in their hands, large sticks.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what you mean by these sticks? - The stick that the prisoner had in his hand, was a stick with a large head to it, about three feet long.</p>
               <p>How thick was this stick? - A pretty large stick, with a big head.</p>
               <p>What sort of a head? - It was a big head, out of which there seemed to be several claws.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there or were there not claws, do not tell us of seeming? - There were something that projected out about an inch long, they seemed to be sharp to the best of my remembrance; the others had sticks and bludgeons, one of them had a stick and bludgeon, and one had a long stick and a short one.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of one was the short one? - They call it a bludgeon, I believe the other was a walking stick.</p>
               <p>Are they usually called bludgeons? - Yes, Randell had the walking stick, and the short stick, May had a stick in his hand, I cannot remember what sort of a one it was.</p>
               <p>What sort of stick was it? - It was a large stick.</p>
               <p>How large? - About the size of a common walking stick.</p>

               <p>Was it as large as this? - Larger than that.</p>
               <p>How long was what you call a bludgeon? - About half the length of this, and I believe three times as thick as this.</p>
               <p>How much thicker than that stick, was the stick that May had? - It was thicker than that, but I cannot tell how thick.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe the stick that May had in his hand, so as to be sure in giving us an account of the size of it? - I remember him to have a stick in his hand, but I cannot tell the size of it, I cannot say whether it was thicker than that or not, I was very much hurried at the time; after some little time, I followed them into the yard, and Woodhouse was in the yard; I observed Rundell and Woodhouse have the bag of tea between them, Rundell would have it, and Woodhouse said he would lose his life sooner than he should have it, I then told Woodhouse I would stand by him.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were all three present at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed upon this? - Soon after I saw Mr. Woodhouse knocked down by Rundell.</p>
               <p>What did he knock him down with? - With a long stick, I believe it was one or other of the sticks, but I believe it to be the long stick.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did he strike him? - Upon the temple, he was insensible for some time, and as soon as he came to himself he shewed the mark; after Woodhouse was knocked down, there seemed to be a general scuffing, and the prisoner made a blow at me with his bludgeon, that was the bludgeon with the claws, he missed my head, and cut down the brim of my hat, (The hat produced,) the hat has been sewed and worn since, but it has not been torn further; it is just the same as it was, it hung down on my shoulders, as soon as the blow was struck.</p>
               <p>What passed after this? - I attempted to catch the prisoner's stick, and I did get hold of the best end of it, some little time, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230084"/> May jumped to his assistance; I had hold of the big end of it, and in the scuffle I fell, I had a tuck in my hand, and they attempted to take the tuck from me, but Valentine came to my assistance, and they could not get it from me, they quitted me, and then I got up; I then went towards the prisoner with my tuck, I told him I would make the best use of the weapon I had, if he attempted to strike again.</p>
               <p>What became of the liquors and tea? - The remainder of the liquors and the tea we stowed after some time, the bag of tea was then there in the cart by us, and some of the geneva.</p>
               <p>What became of the liquors? - We got horses after some time, and carried them off.</p>
               <p>Did you carry the whole? - We carried off eight casks out of the eleven, I do not know what became of the other three, I did not see them carried away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Mr. Toy, you had each of you a tuck I believe? - Not all of us.</p>
               <p>How many of you had tucks? - I had one, and Woodhouse had one.</p>
               <p>What arms had you before you got the supervisor's tuck? - I had it to search with.</p>
               <p>So all this contest was about the tea? - The contest was first about the liquor.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you made the seizure of the geneva before Woodhouse and Valentine came to you? - I cannot tell, it was some time.</p>
               <p>Then you and Valentine went into the field, and there you made a seizure of some more geneva? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left your seizure in the care of Woodhouse, while you went into the field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you have said the prisoner made a blow at you, what sort of a stick was it with? - A common Devonshire walking stick.</p>
               <p>This was a very uncommon one? - It was a very dangerous weapon, I would not be struck with it for five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>No, nor I with a common walking stick, you have told us that Rundell had a stick and bludgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A bludgeon is infinitely shorter and much thicker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now did you ever, in the course of your life, see a bludgeon three feet long? - I do not know, I look upon the stick that the prisoner had, to be a more dangerous weapon than a bludgeon.</p>
               <p>May be so, so was your tuck stick you know; how much milk punch did you drink after this business was over? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Why who drank the milk punch, the three officers, and the three smugglers? - I did not sit down to drink, I drank none in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you drink it in the yard? come, come, it does not make much difference, however you did drink a good quantity? - I do not know what quantity, they offered me several times, and at last I did drink some.</p>
               <p>You do not know what became of the other three casks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after the information was the prisoner taken up? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>I will help you, was he taken up till January? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you apply to any Magistrate for a warrant against this man? - We acquainted the board with it, and waited the board's directions.</p>
               <p>In what month was the indictment preferred? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not it in the September sessions? was you present at the time he was apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you dine together? - No.</p>
               <p>Woodhouse did? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Yes you can, where was he taken? - At Kingsbridge.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he and Woodhouse had been dining together that day? - I do not know, I have heard it from Woodhouse, that the prisoner and he had been dining together the day before.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell me how long it was after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230085"/> the seizure, that Woodhouse came to you? I cannot say, it might be half an hour or rather more.</p>
               <p>I think you say, you run your tuck against his breast? - I put the tuck against his breast, but then I only told him that in case he struck me again, I should make use of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Serjeant Walker.</p>
               <p>I am a supervisor of excise, I was last August at Kingsbridge, in Devonshire; Valentine and Toy came to me in the evening of the 1st of August, to acquaint me, that they had received information of some smuggled or run goods having been landed at Ringmore, and they desired me to go with them, I told them it was not convenient, but I would meet them the next morning, and I met them the next morning about ten o'clock; it is about six, seven, or eight miles from Kingsbridge, I cannot be positive to a mile; when I met them there in the morning, we agreed to separate, and did separate to search the brakes, and hedges, and fields, and in any place where we thought any thing might be concealed.</p>
               <p>Court. The other witness said lakes? - I found nothing.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner? - I saw him at

            's house, there I saw the prisoner, and a person that was called May, and a person that was called Rundell or Randell.</p>
               <p>Do you know the Christian name of that man that was called Rundell? - I did not know his Christian name, nor I did not know Inch's Christian name.</p>
               <p>But was that the prisoner at the bar? - I should know him again if I was to see him; I have no doubt but it is the same person, I am sure it is the same person; I returned back to Ringmore town, and received a message from Mr. Valentine, as I think by a little girl, to request us to come to him at the parsonage house, where one Creswell lived; I saw May and Rundell again in a mead ow, where they were making hay; Valentine and me went in consequence of this message, and when we got there Toy was taking some casks out of a barn into the yard, and after I came, I saw three or four taken out, they were all put together in the yard, a small distance from the door that goes into the hay loft, or barn; there were ten, I supposed them to be gin, I did not taste them, they had slings about them, they had the appearance of smuggled casks; I am sure most of them had slings about them, and I believe they all had.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the purpose of the slings? - It is to tie them together, to hang them on a horse.</p>
               <p>Is that the usual method of carrying geneva and spirits? - Yes, Sir, it is very customary so to do; they travel sometimes twenty, thirty, or forty horses together.</p>
               <p>Do fair dealers carry them so? - They call themselves fair dealers, we call them smugglers</p>
               <p>No, but how do the fair dealers generally convey their liquors? - They generally convey them on horses, there are very few waggons in the county.</p>
               <p>What did you do after this? - It was agreed that I should stay by these casks that were saved, and that Mr. Valentine and Toy should go into a field adjoining and search for more, they went and I staid in the yard about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; Valentine found a cask before the prisoner came, and a little time after came three men, which were the prisoner, May, and Rundell, into the yard to me, they had sticks with them.</p>
               <p>Describe the stick the prisoner had. - The prisoner had one with a very large head, larger than the sticks that the others had.</p>
               <p>How long might it be? - It might be as long as this (a common walking stick.)</p>
               <p>Describe the thickness of it? - The thickness, it might be thicker than this, there might be three or four prongs, it was the natural growth of the stick, and so cut off, I do not think those prongs were put in, he had no more than one stick, Rundell had two, a short one, a kind of bludgeon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230086"/> and a long one besides, one of them was the some sort of stick as the prisoner's, Rundell's walking stick was with a round head, the other was much shorter, and I apprehend it had no head, I believe not; May had only one stick, it was a kind of a walking stick with a great head to it, the other had a kind of a round head, it was different to this gentleman's stick, it was a common walking stick with a round head.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you look upon that as an improper stick for yourself or any other person to walk with? - Any person might use it as a walking stick, such as a country farmer might walk with.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Attorney General. What do you say to this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. I do apprehend, that this act of parliament certainly does require not only the act to be done, but that the persons doing it should be assembled to the number of three, and that they should be armed with offensive weapons: the question is whether the offensive weapons must be of such a nature as cannot be applicable to any other use but that of offence? now if that is not the construction, there is no weapon but what may be used as an offensive weapon; or whether the legislature meant by this that the weapon which they carried out must be upon the face of it, an offensive weapon: but I should apprehend it might be left to the Jury, whether these men did carry these sticks offensively: to be sure if they had not attempted to have made use of them offensively, it might be too much to say, they were armed with offensive weapons; and though in a case of life, I wish a mild interpretation, yet a stick thicker than this, is a weapon that in my opinion may be made use of to great offence: I contend the construction of this act of parliament is, that they must be so armed, with fire arms or any other offensive weapons, which being used offensively would endanger the life of the man.</p>

               <p>Court. Hand up the act of the 19th of

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it cannot be necessary for me to trouble the Court at all on this point; because I am perfectly convinced, that on reading the act of parliament, the Court will hardly hold what never entered into the brain of any mortal man, which is, that a common walking stick, far inferior to that which the countrymen of Devon walk with, far inferior to the sticks which the macaronies of this town used constantly to walk and to ride with, should be deemed an offensive weapon.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. When we look at the preamble of this act of parliament, it makes it perfectly clear, and recites, that whereas divers resolute persons have appeared in great gangs, in different parts of this kingdom, carrying fire arms, or other offensive weapons; then it says, in the conclusion, to the great terror of his Majesty's peaceable subjects, in defiance of the law; now I do not conceive myself, it can come within the common idea, that persons with common walking sticks can infuse all that terror into his Majesty's peaceable subjects, it should be such as the law calls dangerous weapons, for you have that epithet annexed; besides all the people must be active, and armed according to the true intent and meaning of this statute; therefore I think the indictment is not supported as to the two first counts, and with respect to the third count the law is not in force, for the act on which that count is founded, is verbally repealed, and it is made a misdemeanor; therefore myself and my brothers think the prisoner ought to be acquitted.</p>

            , I hope it will make an impression on you, that you have been tried with the utmost care and impartiality, though you have been removed from the county where the offence was committed, and brought to trial in a different county, yet you have been treated with the utmost lenity: I am in great hopes this will make an impression on you, and that you will yourself, and impart it to those unfortunate persons, May and Rundel, that assisted you, to leave off those pernicious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230087"/> practices: you was very near being met with upon this indictment; and as it is not possible for any man to act with more honor than Mr. Woodhouse has done, and though it is said, that you have thrown out threats and menaces of doing him an injury, I hope you are now sensible how extremely well that gentleman has behaved here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never did threaten him, nor never will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He would be a very ungrateful wretch if he did. Are you, Mr. Woodhouse, under any serious apprehensions?</p>
               <p>Woodhouse. I hope he will not behave improperly, the prosecution was directed against him by the commissioners of excise, it is not an act of my doing; I have no objection to his being discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Will you promise never to molest him? - Yes, Sir, I never will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. If ever you do, you shall certainly be prosecuted with the utmost rigour for any thing of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Walker. Or May, or Rundell, or the rest of them.</p>
               <p>Court. I will take the opportunity of saying to this prisoner, that leaving this and all acts of parliament out of the case, when the crown is entitled to a revenue, and a particular mode of collecting it is established, though there was no act of parliament that provided a particular penalty for the obstruction of it, yet (and I am in the hearing of two very learned Judges, who will instruct me, or set me right, if I am mistaken) there cannot be a possible doubt, but any obstruction of officers doing their duty is punishable, and a very great misdemeanor: therefore remember, Inch, to what you have been exposed now for what you have done, and what you still remain exposed to, and let it be an additional reason for the regulation of your future conduct. - Let him be discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, I humbly thank you.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. How long had this young man been with you? - About six or seven months.</p>
               <p>What was his character? - If you think proper, I will give you an account of all I know about his character, I would not have kept him in my service so long, if I had not thought him honest, but I lost upwards of five hundred weight.</p>
               <p>You cannot ascertain how long that might have been going? - He might have been stealing that paper for twelve months to come, and I never miss it; I suppose there is five or six thousand pounds worth there, it is impossible to ascertain how much I lost out of so great a quantity, some of it was printed two or three years ago, some of it is a new Bible that is just finished about a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>When was that part finished that is produced? - About three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>When was that part of Rapin's History finished that is in that bundle? - It is a hundred sheets of one sort of history, there is a hundred of another, and they are all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230091"/> different parts, a latter part, a first part, and all.</p>
               <p>How long ago was the latter part of that history printed by you? - A part of the Bible, and that part of the History of England, I believe not above six months ago; all the new Bible has been printed in the course of two years, it was finished about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Did much of it remain unfinished within two months past? - I can safely say, the History of England, and the Bible were not finished six months ago, this bundle consists intirely of the old Bible.</p>
               <p>Look at the other parcels? - This is chiefly the new Bible.</p>
               <p>When was the latest of that Bible printed? - About thirty weeks ago.</p>
               <p>When were these sheets printed? - This is page 158, we are now printing about four hundred, I believe this was done about three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where were these works printed? - At my own Printing-office in town.</p>
               <p>You always print a certain number over for waste? - There is what they call over paper for proofs, only this is not proofs.</p>
               <p>But after you had printed a certain number of sheets for use, you print some over paper after? - I can say this in answer to that, that I never sold a sheet since I began business, and that there is no waste paper mong the men, till I leave of printing.</p>
               <p>Is not it your custom to print over paper to supply defective sheets? - We do print what they call over copies.</p>

            , to take charge of Medley, for stealing a watch out of his bar, in consequence of an information, I went to the prisoner's house in Chick-lane, a chandler's shop, and pawnbroker's: I took Warren with me, Medley was asked who he had sold the watch to, and he shewed us the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner present? - He was.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - He said, he had got the watch, and he went up stairs to fetch it, and Warren followed, and I saw the prisoner take the watch out of a bureau facing; I did not go into the room, but it was facing the door, I could see him; he then turned round and came down stairs, and I followed him, then the prisoner came down stairs, and said, it was pledged with him, and Warren, me, and Greentree, wrenched it out of his hands, he refused to deliver it without the money that was paid for it, but they got it away from him; after Medley was tried, the watch was delivered up to Greentree.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. The prisoner was in a back-room? - Yes, there was a partition, but the door was open.</p>

               <p>On the 21st, it was a Sunday evening, I went with Jones to the prisoner's house, I took the boy (Medley) before me, I told him to shew me the person that bought this watch, and he pointed to the prisoner; I told the prisoner I came about a watch that was stolen, and must have it, he seemed a little confused: he said to his wife, give me the keys, I followed him, he said, you need not, I said, I will, and he opened a bureau, and took out the watch; the boy declared in his presence, that he gave him half a guinea for it, and he told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230097"/> he would make it up another time; the boy asked him a guinea and an half.</p>
               <p>What answer did this prisoner make to what the boy said? - He said, he lent him half a guinea on it, but the boy persisted that he gave him the half-guinea for it; he would not deliver the watch without the half guinea, I laid hold of the watch, and took him to the Compter with the boy.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass in your presence afterwards? - We preferred the bill of indictment against him after Medley was tried, and says the prisoner to Greentree, who was over the way, I am surprized you should go and prefer a bill of indictment, when I have paid forty pounds into the hands of your attorney, and you have signed a paper.</p>
               <p>Did he say for what purpose he had paid it? - Not to prosecute him, and that the other had signed an agreement for it; and I said to the prosecutor, I thought there was some villainy work in this, says he, I know I have done wrong by signing the paper I did sign; this was said in the presence of

             the constable, and in the room where he was, he must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the watch that was produced upon the trial of Medley, the same watch that you found at this man's house? - Yes, I produced it, it was the same I found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Will you take upon you to say that you heard the word prosecute, when this conversation passed? - Yes, upon my oath I will; they came to me very often and wanted me to be concerned in this business, but I did not chuse it.</p>
               <p>Who was the prisoner's attorney in this business? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. If I knew who he was, I should direct him to be prosecuted for a misdemeanor, in compounding felony.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does Greentree live? - He keeps the tap at the King's-head eating house, in Ivey-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The prisoner keeps a pawnbroker's shop? - Yes; there was no duplicate upon this watch.</p>

               <p>Court to this witness. Be careful what you say, because if you are caught tripping, I shall certainly direct a prosecution against you; therefore take care to say nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Fishpool. On the 21st of November there was a lad come into the shop, with a silver watch, and asked Mr. Goldsmith to lend him the sum of a guinea upon it; he refused to take it in several times, but upon pleading very hard, that it was his father's, and that he should take it very kind if he would let him have that money, as he was distressed; with a great deal of persuasion, he told him he would lend him the sum of half a guinea upon it; he said he should be very thankful if he did, and that he should certainly redeem it the next day, for his father was much distressed: upon this Mr. Goldsmith ordered me to enter it in the book, which I have done; I made the entry myself at the time the lad was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the book.</p>
               <p>(The book handed up.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Has your master a licence to keep a pawnbroker's shop? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Warren. He acknowledged he had not to me.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears from this book, Gentlemen, that this article is plainly made in the usual course of business, at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Fishpool. How long have you lived with this man? - Above two years, he is a painter by trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. So you work with the prisoner sometimes? - Yes, but I am constantly in the house.</p>
               <p>What character does the prisoner bear? - A very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230098"/>Court to Jury. It appears that this watch was pledged by Medley to the prisoner, but whether pledged or bought, the receiving it knowing it to have been stolen, is the offence charged in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Where had you been that evening? - To an acquaintance in London, I went about seven.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - A little porter, I was in three or four different companies.</p>
               <p>Did you drink in them all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her to go with you, or did she ask you to go with her? - That I cannot resolve you.</p>
               <p>Where did you go with her? - In the course of evening I went home to her lodgings as high as I can recollect between eleven and twelve; I first met her about six, I went into a house in Portpool Lane, I did not stay with her three minutes, I gave her a glass at the bar, but I drank nothing; I then went to a friend's on Air-street-hill, and left her there; I never saw her before then, I came home with her to her lodgings between eleven and twelve.</p>

               <p>Did you make any enquiry whose house it was? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other people in the house? - No, the door was open, and we went up one pair of stairs, we went to bed together; between one and two I awoke, and missed the property that is in the indictment; I saw my watch before I went to bed, and wound it up, I have seen the watch and garters since; it is a very particular watch, it has a hare and hounds upon the face of it; I know the chain, I have had it two years, the seal was a blue seal, I bought on London-bridge, it cost me threepence, I do not know the impression of it, the key was quite a common key; I know the garters, I always put them in my pocket of a night; I put my watch into my fob, there was no other woman in the room with me; at two o'clock I missed my things, and the girl was gone, I got the watchman and searched for the things about the bed; I was going to enquire for her the next morning, and I met her in Fleet-market, and charged her with the robbery, she said I rob you! you fool, what do you mean by that? I took her to the public house, and sent for a constable, and while I sent for the constable, she produced my watch out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Had you then told her it would be better for her? - I had, she said she had none of it; the constable said to the girl, let me look at your legs, and she took off one of my garters, which I will swear to.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Capps, on Saturday, the 15th of January, the prisoner came into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230103"/> our shop in the afternoon, I think it was between four and five, she asked to look at some handkerchiefs, I believe I have seen her two or three times before; the witness Symonds shewed her some handkerchiefs, and I believe sold her two or three, he had some suspicion of her, and intimated it to me, for he was engaged with two or three more customers, at the same time he kept therefore some handkerchiefs, and desired me to take notice; she stood by the side of the counter, and I thought the handkerchiefs were all safe.</p>
               <p>Were any handkerchiefs on that side the counter? - None that I know of, I did not see her take them up, only by her confused manner of going from the counter, I thought she must have something; she took her change in a hurry; as she was going out of the shop, he mentioned to me, that he supposed she had got something more than her own, I jumped over the counter, and followed her to the outside of the door; I put my hand round her waist, and told her, I supposed she had something more than was her own, she said no, she believed she had not; I told her she must go back along with me, and I kept my hands on something under her cloak, that appeared like these handkerchiefs; I kept her by me, and in crowding her up to the door, in shoving her up the step, my hands was from her, and these handkerchiefs sell from her; this one was that which I saw fall from her, and these were two parcels that fell from her, but I did not see them, these two parcels lay on the step.</p>
               <p>Were they done up in one paper, or were they separate pieces of handkerchiefs? - There were three separate quantities, I know this in my right hand, and by the mark C. M. I cannot speak positively to that mark; that one that dropt from her, was the one I had in my hand; the value of it is 5 s. 10 d. the value of the other that is not marked, is 5 s. 6 d. I took her up stairs, and asked her if she had any thing more, but she had not.</p>
               <p>There is nothing particular in these handkerchiefs, are not they sold in other shops in London? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether that man sold her any such? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That piece of handkerchiefs is not the piece, that he shewed to the Justice, that he told the Justice he took from me.</p>
               <p>Witness. I put a private mark upon it at Sir Sampson's, I did not keep it separate, because there was only that one mark, and I knew the mark.</p>

I lost sight of him for five minutes, till he was brought back; he was about a minute in the shop at first.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the person that was in the shop? - I did not see his face, but I saw part of his back and his arm, I saw his clothes were dark blue, he took the things with him out of the house; when he was brought back, I saw the things taken from under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time before this happened, had any customers been in the shop? - I really cannot tell, there had been several that afternoon, it might be more than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you or the prosecutor's sister serve in the shop? - The prosecutor's sister in general serves, but I cannot tell which served then.</p>

             to me; I had some doubt about paying the money to Mr. Scam, and I desired him to go and tell his master I would be glad to speak to him; Mr. Withey came himself a short time after, but I did not see the prisoner till he was examined before the Justice, and the question that was put to him, how Black came to make his mark to the will; and he said the will was executed at Portsmouth, I think at the New Dublin; and he said Black had been in a quarrel some few days before and cut his thumb; and therefore he had made his mark; I had not seen, as I know of, the prisoner before that time; he said that he lodged at that time at the sign of the Princess Royal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did Johnson say any thing to you at the time about hurting his thumb? - He said, that a few days before the executing that will, he cut his thumb.</p>
               <p>I presume you always put your initials in the same manner? - It has not been in my possession ever since, but I have not the least doubt of it; it was in my possession till I parted with it to Mr. Chetham.</p>

               <p>(The power of attorney read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I would not encroach upon the time of the Court; but I think it my duty, in a case of life, to submit every objection that may occur in favour of the prisoner. My Lord, I doubt whether the entry in that book can be received in evidence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230113"/> as an authentic record of the court: it may be a copy, but in all events the register ought to be here. He is the proper officer to prove his own act; and might have been here with as little inconvenience as the gentleman who produces it. Will your Lordship permit the register's hand writing to be proved, when he himself might have been here? as to the will nothing can be more clear than this; it ought to be produced by the proper officer, whose province it is to take charge of such instruments; and to exhibit them when legally called for. Your Lordship knows, that in all cases of this kind, the best testimony should be given which the nature of the thing is capable of. The proper officer might have been here as well as the parties that are. I submit it is not the best evidence that might be given to this Court; and therefore it ought to be rejected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I submit it is written upon the will itself; it would be very inconvenient if the officers themselves were to be obliged to attend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My objection are these? the officer in whose custody the will was, might have been here with as much ease as the gentleman who produces it, and the decree ought certainly to be proved by the register.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the book, there is not a colour of objection to it, because that is a record of the Court, and is proved as the original record of the Court, it is the best evidence; with respect to the other objection, if there was no evidence to authenticate that to be the precise instrument which Johnson brought, it would give weight to your objection.</p>

               <p>Court. Did Summers say any thing? - I do not know that he spoke much; I bought the ribbons of them, they contained sixty dozen and some odd yards, at I believe much about two shillings and three-pence a dozen.</p>
               <p>Court. Who agreed with you? - Sometimes one, sometimes the other; Summers asked two shillings a dozen, and I agreed to give two shillings a dozen, the other two cried out they would not take two shillings, they would have three shillings, I said I would give them no more than two and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230117"/> three-pence, and they agreed to take it, and I paid them six pounds seventeen shillings, or six pounds nineteen shillings, I do not know which: then they opened the laces, and asked me one hundred and fifty guineas for them, I would not bid them any price for them, I said I would give them a shilling a yard for them: at last they asked me to buy them in the lump, and then came down to fourscore guineas, and then I bid them forty guineas, and they agreed to take the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where do you live? - In Bedford-street, Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a dealer in tobacco, lace, and all things, nothing comes amiss to me.</p>
               <p>I suppose not; and it is my opinion, that you will deal in manufactured hemp, sometime or other; when did you tell this to any body; - About a fortnight ago, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>When did you tell it to the Magistrate? - About three weeks after I had made the purchase.</p>
               <p>How came you to go there? - I was advertised.</p>
               <p>Did you leave Petticoat Lane upon it? - I did not abscond, but I went into the country, I very often do.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of these sixty dozen, and odd yards? - Two shillings and three-pence a dozen, was the full value and a shilling a yard was more than the value of the lace, that I will swear.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the things? - I sold them to a man I owed some money to, a Mr. Wilson, who lives near Baldock, he keeps markets and fairs, I sold him thirty guineas worth of it, I lost money by them.</p>

               <p>Can you say whether that was the same bag that you saw before? - No, I cannot; on Saturday morning between one and two, I sent the prisoner to the Bull, in Leadenhall-street, with one parcel, and likewise to the Swan, Whitechapel, with another parcel of garden seeds; these two parcels were delivered very faithfully, and as he was going out of the shop, I observed his coat and hat very dusty, which made me suspect he had been down at the dirt bin, and taken some of these things out.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he any business at the dustbin, as a porter? - Yes, he was a weekly servant, and did every thing in the house.</p>
               <p>Did he ever serve in the shop as servant? No, he used to fist the seeds, and clear them or any thing of the kind, he went out of the door, and I observed his pockets were filled, I sent a servant after him, who came back with him, and I saw the onion seed in his pocket, which I assisted in taking out, and there were several things brought to me, in the presence of the prisoner, which were ten bags, the prisoner brought them himself; there was some onion seeds, and some French beans, and some flower seeds.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>What happened on the 12th of this month? - A bell rung between seven and eight, I went up, there was nobody in the house but myself, I asked who was there, and somebody said Mr. Berckley was very bad, and my young master and old master must go to him directly, for he wanted to speak to them, they went directly; in about two or three minutes after, somebody else rang at the door, I went up to the door, and a young man asked me for a letter that lay upon my master's desk in the parlour; I went to look for the letter and was returning out of the parlour, and the prisoner met me with a pistol, and says, not a word; they took me and put me into chair, and put a hat over my face, but it did not cover my face, and I saw the prisoner open my master's desk, and he strewed the papers about the floor, and him and another went up stairs and came down again; they came and asked me for the money; I told them I did not know there was a farthing in the house; then says the one that held me, come and hold her, and I will go and find the money; then the prisoner came and held me.</p>
               <p>You do not know the other person that held you? - No, and presently the bell rang again, and then they came down stairs, and they all went out and locked me in the parlour; the bell rung again; I believe it was three times, and I opened the shutters of the parlour window and got out; then I went to open the street door and found it bolted top and bottom.</p>
               <p>Which way had the persons that left you got out? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Are there more ways than one out of your house? - Yes, they might have gone backwards or forwards.</p>
               <p>Where does the back way go to? - It goes down into the water; there was no other way for them to go out; I was going to wash myself, and my cap was off; I have no doubt of the prisoner, I am sure it was him, I have seen him frequently go backward and forward to work with Mr. Dowding, which was but a little way off; I told my master directly, and the porter who it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What fastenings are there to the back door? - A padlock on the inside.</p>
               <p>Was you much frightened? - No, I said, do not hurt me, and they said they would not.</p>
               <p>Was you or was you not? - I was frightened.</p>
               <p>You happened by good luck to be going to wash yourself, and had your cap turned up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Or else you would not have been so able to see them? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you your apron on? - No, it was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Had these people any disguise? - Yes, the prisoner had a handkerchief over his lips, which covered his mouth, he had a round hat, not pulled down over his face.</p>
               <p>Remarkabley cocked up perhaps? - I did not take notice, it was as he wore it usually; he had a sort of a red cross bar handkerchief.</p>
               <p>When did they go to fasten the front door? - I did not hear them.</p>
               <p>How far is the parlour from the front door? - Not very far, only through the shop.</p>

               <p>Who told his name after the robbery was committed? - I described him, and then they said that the person that I described was Bull; I did not know his name till they told me; he had thick lips and a small face, and his dress I described, a brown wide coat on, a great coat, and dirty leather breeches, very much like a working dress.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. As you have seen the prisoner come backwards and forwards, did you when you described him, say it was Dowding's boy? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you hear of an alarm of robbery at Mr. Sampson's? - Yes, Sir, I did, and he was in my house at that time.</p>
               <p>How far do you live off? - Six houses; he was in the house writing when the alarm was made, he was writing that bill for which he bought the paper; I have known him about eight years, he is a very honest, sober, hard-working lad, as far as I know, that has been his general character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The house was very thronged? - Yes, what time he came in, and went out, I cannot say; I saw Sampson, and his maid, they came to the tap-room, and opened the door, and asked if any of Mr. Dowding's men were there, I said yes; they said some of Mr. Dowding's men had robbed Mr. Sampson?

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What makes you so clear as to the time? - Because I was in and out of the tap-room; I cannot say how much it was before eight; I did not drink tea with him, he drank tea, because he said he could not drink beer; I heard him ask for a sheet of paper; I remember Mr. Sampson's coming to the door, he had not quite finished the bill when the people came in.</p>
               <p>What makes you so particular to the hour? - I was affraid my master would not have had cash enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Wherever there is a public-house that labourers are constantly paid at, I have recommended it to the magistrates to take away that licence, for it is a temptation to the people to spend half their money, they cannot resist it, and then they have not enough to live upon.</p>

               <p>I am a cooper by trade, I am apprentice to Mr. Groom, I remember the night in which Mr. Sampson's house was reported to be robbed perfectly well; I saw the prisoner that night in my mistress's kitchen, I came in about half an hour after seven, and found the prisoner drinking tea; I heard Shadwell clock strike seven before I went in, and I conclude it was about half an hour after, he continued there about half an hour; I was called out by a man whom I worked with, the prisoner followed me immediately into the tap-room, and afterwards went out to fetch a half-pennyworth of paper, he came in afterwards, and sat beside me, and wrote the bill, he might be a quarter of an hour in writing the bill; I am sure he had never been out of the house; I am sure five minutes was the outside he was out for the paper.</p>
               <p>What enables you to recollect? - I came in again as the alarm was given, I asked him for a dish of tea; he said he could not spare any.</p>

               <p>If he had gone, should you have observed it? - I think I should, I sat opposite to him; I have known him about seven years, I never heard a dishonest character of him, his character was that of an honest young fellow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What was you about all that time? - There was about twelve of us sat in the box; sometimes I took a drink of beer; there were three men in the box, Arnold and another man, I believe Arnold went out first, afterwards a man named

               <p>Were they fixed? - Yes, they were all fixed, but the Bath stoves were not fixed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230127"/>Are you clear in that? - I am clear in that, that they were never fixed.</p>
               <p>- HARCOURT, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>This was an empty house, that my Lord Townsend had gone out of, at the corner next to George-street, and the prisoner had the key to shew it to any body; that occasioned the opportunity of disposing of these things; and these things were gone.</p>
               <p>Were these things there? - They certainly were.</p>
               <p>Were the Bath stoves fixed or not fixed?</p>
               <p>They were slipped in nicely, but without any work, I believe they fitted so nicely they were put in; the kitchen ranges must have taken a great while to have got down, for I suppose they weigh one of them fifteen hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Were these things yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had this man lived with you? - About three years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will take the liberty of asking you, Sir, whether this is your freehold house or not? - It is not.</p>
               <p>You have a leasehold interest in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were these fixtures originally in the house, or did you put them in? - I bought the Bath stoves of the gentleman, when he went out of it, as fixtures.</p>
               <p>It is usual in these Bath stoves, which are fitted to the chimnies, to make them flush with the chimney by plaster, so that the ashes and coals should not get under the grate? - I apprehend the masons work, what they call the free stone, was fitted so nicely to it, as to prevent the necessity of it, but Skinner can tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Skinner. Was that back fastened to the chimney? - Not fastened at all.</p>
               <p>Is not it fitted up with plaster? - I am sure it is not.</p>
               <p>Was it a chimney in which there was free-stone on the si des? - The back of the chimney was free-stone.</p>
               <p>What were the sides? - Stone blacked.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there not upon the back of the grate, a finish up with brick and plaster? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can account for that, for the lady who had the house, and had these grates put up, was particularly nice in that respect to have the backs made with freestone, and the backs exactly to fit.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should presume that the grate was first fixed before the free-stone.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was an uncommon large back made against the free-stone, so as to make it as neat as possible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you do me the honour to attend to me one minute; in the case of the particular stone that you speak of, as having a large back; do not you apprehend that the stove was first put in? - Upon my word I do apprehend, that the stove was so contrived, as to fit as nice as possible, and pushed in after the masons work was all set.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Skinner. In taking out these stoves, did you make any dirt or rubbish? - No farther than the foot that fell down the chimney.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It sometimes happens, that they fix the free-stone upon the hob, as it is called, which I apprehend was not the case here, because they must have broke off the free-stone to take it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. I take the liberty of asking you, what was this young man's character before? - For about three years before this, I thought him honest.</p>
               <p>You thought him always honest, till this unfortunate temptation and your smith concurred to make him otherwise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>How do you know the street door was on a single lock? - When I was frightened with the noise, I was particular in turning the lock back, to let myself out.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know any thing of the situation of the house at all, till you heard a noise? - One of my lodgers went out last between five and six.</p>
               <p>Did you go to see the state of the door after that? - I heard it shut, I am sure it was shut; after I heard the noise in the kitchen, I came up to the passage, and I smelt fire or like tinder burning, or linen; then I opened the street door, and looked up at my windows, I saw no light, and all my windows were shut; I had not stood a minute, before I heard my two pair of stairs door breaking open, it is my bed room; my sister was in the two pair of stairs room last, she is not here, she locked it; I then went out and looked up at my windows, and I saw a light in the room where I sleep; and I begged of my sister to stand at the door, and I would go and get Mr. Mulcaster, and he went up and took the prisoner; first saw the prisoner in the parlour, with the things mentioned in the indictment; one window of the dining room was fastened down, and the other was shut; Mr. Mulcaster had in his hands, eighteen pieces of black silk, and five handkerchiefs, and an apron, the apron is marked with my own name, A. D. the handkerchiefs I have had for some years, they were not marked; the things were all taken out of my bed room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Dixon, how many lodgers have you? - Five, all men, creditable tradesmen that go to their work.</p>
               <p>Have they all keys to the street door? - No.</p>
               <p>Who lodges in the first floor? - I had nobody then.</p>
               <p>What time do you usually shut up your house at night? - As soon as it is dark, I had shut up my house for good, all but shutting up one window shutter, sometimes I shut both windows of the first floor; but I had been washing, and hung some clothes there; I always fasten the sash, I think it was fast then.</p>
               <p>You did not find all the fastenings of the house broke? - No.</p>
               <p>How was the window of that two pair of stairs room, which is your bed room? - It was a casement, it was shut, and none of the glass broke; there is a little sort of a slanting ledge, the house is a corner house.</p>
               <p>So that with a good deal of help, and something to hold by, a man might by chance walk along as a cat does? - Yes, they must hold by the other ledges, or by the wall, or else they could not.</p>
               <p>This is in a public street? - No.</p>
               <p>You have neighbours on each side of you, and some in front; therefore if a man chose to play the cat there, he would be observed; he could not walk along without being seen, if he were to walk along there to throw up the window? - It was a very dark night.</p>

               <p>Between eight and nine the 3d of February the prosecutrix came to our shop door, and called as loud as she could, for God's sake Mr. Mulcaster come to our house for there are thieves in the house; it was quite dark; she said the thieves were up stairs, I took a light immediately from the parlour and run up stairs; while I was on the stairs I heard a person running up before me without shoes seemingly; when I came up to the one pair of stairs; I just slightly looked there, and I turned my eyes and saw all the things that are mentioned in the indictment, on the second pair of stairs; some upon one stair and some upon another; they were separate; I heard a bustle above stairs, and apprehending there might be more than one, I called to my son who came running after me, to go and call Mr. White, a gentleman who was in my house; my son stood on the outside of the door; I went up stairs into the two pair of stairs, and there found both the doors open, it has originally been only one room, but there is a deal partition put up to make it two; the one is a very small room, the first room is not the bed room.</p>
               <p>Was that door open of the first room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing broke about it? - The lock was broke, and the two front screws were forced out, the door opened outwards towards the stairs, and by its being wrenched towards the stairs to open it, the screws were forced up, so that it hung by the back screw.</p>
               <p>Did you see into that room? - I just looked into it; I saw men's wearing apparel looked up altogether, that was all I saw in that room; Mr. White came up, and I begged of him to listen on the stairs, and let me know if any body came down, and I looked into the bed room, I looked slightly under the bed, I came out immediately finding nobody there, I went up the third pair of stairs, and I met the prisoner coming down with his shoes in his hand; the lock of the bed room was broke, and a piece of the iron was forced off, I found this on the ground; the drawers in the second floor were cut in the upper part to let the lock out.</p>
               <p>Were they cut in more places than one? - Only in one place, there were several articles of the prosecutrix's wearing apparel laying in the room; I examined the door the next day, and both the doors were forced open seemingly with this plaisterers hammer which was found there; as I met the prisoner coming down with his shoes in his hand, I laid hold of him and asked him if there were any more, he said no; I begged Mr. White to take care of him while I searched the garret, but I found nobody in the garret, one garret window was open, but there were bars before it, so that nobody could get in or out; I took the prisoner down stairs in the parlour, and I searched him; upon him I found these two knives, this centre bit, and these matches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This centre bit in its present state is utterly unfit for any use. - Undoubtedly it is; it is of no use without a stock.</p>
               <p>If it had the best stock in the world, it would not be of any use; it is all notched; you do not find that the centre bit had been used? - No, when we came into the one pair of stairs, the sash was a little open, about half a pane or a little more.</p>
               <p>Not room enough for a man to come in? - Not in that state.</p>
               <p>And for any thing you know the sister might have come in after the alarm and put put up the window? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Coming down St. Martin's le Grand, a coachman asked me to go and call one Penny Feather up three pair of stairs, and I went up, and coming down this gentleman came and took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. After the alarm of the noise, you say your sister was with you, do you know whether your sister left you? - I knew nothing after I went out.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell then what became of her? - No.</p>

               <p>How happened it that you coming from the country should count these cards of lace? - I have lost so much goods lately out of my shop, that I always desired my wife and shop-woman to count them; I returned about six.</p>
               <p>Had you any customers or any body that gave you occasion to count the lace? - No, but I am sure I counted it; I saw the prisoner's silk handkerchief in the window, and her hand was upon it, the prisoner stood against the window, and the lace was on the counter; then the prisoner wished me a good night and went away; then the handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>Did that handkerchief cover any thing? - I cannot tell whether it lay over any lace or not; the prisoner went out of the shop, and I immediately missed this card of lace, the card is marked with my shop mark at one corner, U. N. fourteen yard and a half; I sold ten yards and a half off that very piece and laid it in the window; I immediately followed her out, and clapped my hands on her, and she had it in her pocket, lapped up in this silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Was that the same handkerchief you saw in the window? - It was the same handkerchief, it was plain, it had no marks at all upon it; that was the same handkerchief I saw in the shop, as far as I can judge; I immediately laid hold of the lace and the handkerchief, and she said she did not know that she had it, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Was the lace rough or smooth? - It was in this form putting it in her pocket, and she had a large cloak on; it was upon the card that it is now, I have measured it since, it is the same piece.</p>
               <p>What is the value of it? - It is valued at a great deal less than I gave for it; I have put it at six shillings and three-pence less than it cost me; the constable came and took her away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Council. How long had you been in the country before you came home? - I went on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>When did this happen? - On the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Did you take an accurate account of all your stock when you went out of town on the Wednesday? - The lace and ribbands I did, because I lose so much.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in town before this accident happened? - I had not been at home half an hour.</p>
               <p>Is your stock pretty extensive? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>You were of course very suspicious? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any partners? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230131"/>No person interested in the business but yourself? - None but my wife and myself.</p>
               <p>Has your wife any part of the profits of that business settled on her by deed? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this lace of any particular pattern? - I never had the pattern before.</p>
               <p>It is not uncommon, I suppose? - Other people may have it.</p>
               <p>Did you count it instantly as you came in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did she stand? - Close by the window.</p>
               <p>What length of time was she in the shop? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Then of course she, as any other person might, perfectly inoffensively, lean against your counter? - Not inoffensively, a person could not inoffensively take away a card of lace.</p>
               <p>Whether in the course of her wiping her face with her handkerchief, the handkerchief might not drop from her hand to that lace? - No.</p>
               <p>When you saw it there, where you say it could not be without design, why did not you immediately communicate your suspicions to her? - I did immediately after I lost the lace; the handkerchief might be the length of this book from the lace.</p>
               <p>Was it in such a position that it might naturally fall from the hand of that woman? - I cannot answer that question.</p>
               <p>Was that handkerchief in such a position as it might without design fall from the hand of that woman? - She must, by having that card of lace afterwards, do it with a design to take it away.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, whether as it appeared in that position, why you did not immediately lay hold of her, and prevent her carrying it out of the shop? - I had no suspicion of her taking the lace away, I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Was this lace so doubled up in the handkerchief as indicated any design in her to take it; were there any folds in the handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>Had she not time enough to sold it up afterwards? - I followed her out immediately; I marked it myself.</p>

               <p>I attend the Rotation office in Litchfield-street, on the 5th of February, between seven and eight, I do not speak with certainty to the time, it was on Saturday, I was going through Lombard-street, Seven Dials, when I came to the corner of the street, I observed a great crowd, I came up directly and saw the prosecutor have hold of the prisoner, I am sure it was her; I asked what was the matter? I pushed through the crowd, and laid hold of the prosecutor and the prisoner; and the prosecutor told me in the presence of the prisoner, that she had robbed his shop; I desired him to let her go; which he did, and I took charge of her; the property was taken from her before I came up; the prosecutor had a card of lace in his hand when I came up.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else in the hand where he had the card of lace? - Not that I observed, I suppose there were fifty people at least; the prisoner offered me ten guineas to let her go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Whose office do you attend? - The office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Have you not been discharged from that office? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes, I will, I lost the use of my limbs, and since that I have been at my own house in the country.</p>
               <p>What charge did the prosecutor give you of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>She was very obstropulous, he charged her with robbing him.</p>
               <p>Did he say he had seen her rob him? - He said he did not see her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I never touched it to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>

               <p>The Case opened by Mr. Peatt, Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>NEWBERT ABBOTT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Clarke, of Shadwell, butcher; I had a conversation with the prisoner at the White Swan, where I lodge, in New Gravel-lane, I have lodged there near two years, sometimes I kill beasts or sheep, and sometimes I fetch sheep home from market; the prisoner and another man desired me to go and ask my master, whether he could kill a heifer for him at his slaughter-house, I asked my master, and he said I might; I informed the prisoner of my master's assent, and the prisoner said he would go and fetch the heifer as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>What time did the conversation between you and the prisoner happen? - About one on the 3d of February.</p>
               <p>What time did he return? - He returned between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What did he bring with him? - Two bullocks.</p>
               <p>Dead or alive? - Alive, on Wednesday between six and seven in the evening, I think it was the 3d of February, I put them into my master's pound.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Clarke within? - I do not think he was; the prisoner and another man, whom I do not know, had been with me, to put the beasts into the pound; the prisoner was one of the persons that put the bullocks into the pound; I have known him for years at different times.</p>
               <p>What kind of bullocks were these, that were in the pound? - They were brownish, they had no mark upon them to my knowledge, but a little was cut off the end of the tail of both of them.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular in their horns? - Nothing, the man that came with the prisoner, came to help me to kill it the next day; I began about nine o'clock; they might weigh about three-score stone apiece.</p>
               <p>Did you kill one or both of them? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Was the beast you killed on that morning, one of these bullocks that was put into the pound, the preceding evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any other beast in the pound? - Only them two, the door of the pound is only bolted, the prisoner came to Mr. Clarke's about two in the afternoon, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at any conversation between you and Clarke? - Yes; the other man came to kill the bullock, the bullock was hung up, and left in the slaughter-house, I had no order to carry it any where; the offal was left in the slaughter-house till a discovery was made whose bullock it was, and that it was stolen.</p>

               <p>Did your man Abbott ever come to you and ask you to give permission to kill a heifer in your slaughter-house? - Yes, for two persons, he said, it was to kill a heifer.</p>

               <p>What day of the month or week was it? - On Wednesday about twelve, the 2d day in February, in lieu of that they brought something the over night about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner one of the persons that came with the bulloks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230134"/>Did you ever know the prisoner before? - I saw him once before.</p>
               <p>What did he bring to you? - I did not see it till Thursday morning, then I went up to the market, to buy some meat at Leadenhall, and Whitechapel, and in consequence of my permission, one of them was killed, the weight was about sixty stone apiece; when I went down and saw what they were, I did not expect to see anything of that kind, for I thought it was a thing of no extraordinary value; I says to the man, ask the prisoner who these bullocks belong to, and the prisoner replied, they belong to us both; I said, I should be glad to know where you bought them, and he did not give me any answer at all to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. What answer did he give? - He said, he had fetched them a great way, and for that reason he desired, I would let him take his property away; I said, I shall not unless you give me a particular account how you came by them, from some sufficient house-keeper, in the parish of Whitechapel, or Mile End; he would not give me any answer about them; after this I gave information to the Magistrates, and then he desired to take the hide away.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any marks anywhere on any part of these bullocks? - There was no marks, nor no scissars had been upon them, as though they had been bought or sold; that made me suspicious, I thought the property was rather too good to be their own; I had no other reason as there was no mark on their hips; the prisoner returned afterwards, and desired to take away the hide, I went to Justice Green's office, and two of his men came down to us, and when they saw the men, they made their escape.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it paid for? - No; I do not suppose there was such another pig to be found in the market; I do not know how many pigs Mrs. King had in her shop; I observed it as soon as the man who bought it asked the price of it; it was what they call a beat out pig, it was brown and very thin; the bones were slit very even; I suspected the prisoner, having seen him walk by the shop that morning, and when I lost the pig, I said, I remember that red-headed man went by; I went to the prisoner's house, I afterwards saw the pig at Clerkenwell; I was sure it was the same by the cleaving of the bones and the skin; the prisoner seemed very much agitated, and begged of me to let him go, and he would never do so again; I told him we had lost several; he said, he would not mind paying for all the pigs we had lost; and before the Justice, he owned the fact; he said it was the first thing that ever he did; he was taken up on the Friday; but at a further examination on the Monday, he did not own it; but said he bought it of a countryman.</p>

               <p>Court. What words did he use the first time? - He said, please your worship, I did take this pig, but I never did any thing before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told them the pig they took from me, was a casualty pig; I did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230140"/> they took me for thieving; I thought they took me for a casualty.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you very sure he said he took the pig? - I am very sure.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the pig? - It was sold for fifteen shillings and two-pence, that is the worth of it.</p>

               <p>The morning this pig was stolen, I took it out of a cloth, and hung it up at the door; it was a remarkable brown skin pig, dark in flesh; it was not cleaved down as it should be, and the bones of it were yellow; it was a very remarkable pig, I never saw one like it, though I have seen many thousands; I went out and left nobody in the shop; and while I was gone the pig was gone; I went with Prevost to the prisoner's house, in Pear-tree Court, Clerkenwell, and he was cutting up the pig; I looked through the window, and saw him cutting up the pig, and I made an expression that was not fit to be heard, and I said this is the pig; and he said, Lord have mercy upon me, what have I done! he then offered me a guinea to let him off; he would give me any thing; I told him it was not in my power; I left my fellow servant with him, and went home; I examined the pig, I am sure it is the same, though one side was cut, the other side was quartered, and I took a quarter of it from behind the bedstead; I was present when he went before the Justice, and he there owned he took the pig from the shop of the widow King, and begged for mercy; on the Monday, he said he bought the pig for nine shillings.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher, my fellow servant and I went out with a side of beef, we first put the pig into the shop, and laid it on a hamper, this was about half past eight in the morning; while we were gone, the pig was gone, and we looked for it; it was a pig very dark in the flesh, and rough skinned, and poor; I could distinguish it: I went after it was lost, with my fellow servant to the prisoner's house, and found him cutting it up, he had the chopper in his hand; he was left in my custody, and before the Justice, on the Friday he owned to it, and on the Monday he said he bought it of a man at the Bell Inn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that witness my character? - He worked with me two or three winters in the Victualling Office, and behaved very well.</p>

               <p>I live in Aldersgate-street, I am a bricklayer by trade.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you keep a house? - No, I only keep a room.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with now? - I did work for Mr. Gray last, in Wilderness-row: on Friday last was a month, the 28th of January, I believe it was; I was at Cheapside looking for a job, coming back from there, in Newgate-street, between seven and eight, I saw the prisoner talking to a bricklayer's labourer; I asked him after his brother, who worked with me, I told him I was going to Warwick Lane, he said he was going to Newgate-market; I went along with him, we went into the Bell, and had a pint of purl, coming out of the Bell he and I together, and I was going away, we saw a country-man with some pork, and a basket; he says to me, says he, that is casualty pork, which I never knew what casualty pork was before.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by casualty pork? - I do not know, it was very poor pork, and the rind on the outside of it was quite red, it seemed as if it died; he asked the man if he had bought it, the man made answer no, he had brought it to town for sale; he asked him what he would have for it, and he would buy it, accordingly he asked him sixteen shillings for it, he offered him fourteen shillings; after some words, he bought the pig for fourteen shillings and six-pence, and paid the money, half a guinea, and the remainder in silver; the pork he and the man took out of the basket, and put on his shoulder, it was in four quarters, and he took it away; I saw no more of him till his brother found me out.</p>
               <p>Describe the pork that he bought particularly? - The rind of it, the outside skin of it, was red as blood.</p>
               <p>Was it rather a sattish pig? - No, a very poor pig, it was in four quarters.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he lives? - I do now, I did not then; I did not see it weighed.</p>
               <p>Court to Simons. When you saw the pork at this man's house, describe in what condition it was? - There was one side in two quarters, and he was cutting up the other in different joints.</p>
               <p>Court to Haywood. In what condition did you find this pig? - One side was cut up more like mutton, the other side was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230143"/> quarters, and one quarter I took from behind the bed.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver, No. 15, Addle-street; on Saturday the 19th of February, about a quarter past ten at night, I was coming down Houndsditch, and the corner of the street leading to Duke's-Place, I saw three men, two of them are at the bar now, Bushell and Jacknell; Jacknell had a sack on his shoulder, with a saddle and bridle; they both made a stop, as if they were not determined which way to go; they spoke together, but I was not high enough to hear; the sack was not changed from one to the other while I saw them; Bushnell, I believe, went to Duke's-Place, I saw no more of him; I went and told the watchman; and we went and took Jacknell and the sack to the watch-house; the other was twenty yards before, when I first saw them; but whether it was Bushnell or no, I cannot say; Jacknell said at the watch-house, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230145"/> the things from Mr. Clarke, at Shoreditch Church; I told him it would be very hard he should be detained till Monday; I would give a man a shilling to go to Mr. Clarke's, and if they were his, he should be discharged; he said, no, I should not, he would stay there; about ten minutes after Bushnell came in, and said, he was come to release him; he took a key out of his pocket, and said it was the key of the stable; and he was detained.</p>

               <p>I had been at Mr. Clarke's, but not with that bridle and saddle; and I was going home, and I met Bushnell, he said he was going to the Turk's-Head in Whitechapel, with some things; he asked me to go home with him, and we would go home together; we live facing one another, in Rupert-street; and I turned round, and walked with him, and he asked me to carry them a little for him, so I took them on my back, and I stopped to make water in Butcher-row, and he walked on before me about twenty yards, and the watchman came and stopped me, I called to him; I said, if they chose to send to Rupert-street, they might find where we lived.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Did he say any thing about Rupert-street, do you remember? - He mentioned something about Rupert-street in the watch-house, but I did not stop to hear it; I am sure he said he came from one Mr. Clarke's at Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Levy. He told me he came from Shoreditch, from one Mr. Clarke's; I asked him where he was going; he said to Rupert-street; I told him, it was a very comical way to go.</p>

               <p>Did you see the piece under her arm before she got out of the shop? - No; as she was going out of the shop, I got over with intent to stop her; I am perfectly sure she took the piece of cloth at that time; I am not perfectly sure how many pieces there were, but there were either four or five; I measured the cloth, it measured seventeen yards and an half; the value is fifteen shillings; it is the property of Mr. Capps.</p>

               <p>How happened it that in two hours time she was not served? - We were so busy we could not serve her; she stood near that counter where the things were missing; I shewed her some cloth, she made a great many words before she bought; and I shewed her five or six different pieces of Irish cloth; at last she bought seven yards at fourteen-pence a yard, it came to eight shillings and two-pence, I remember perfectly well; she paid for it in my sight, to my master; I put all off the counter, except two pieces, the one she had the cloth off and another; I went to speak to another customer, and then she was gone out, and the other piece was missing: I know I left two pieces when I went to serve the other customers; I came back in a minute, and one piece was missing; I could not tell the mark then, I knew it afterwards; I told my fellow servant, and some ladies who stood at the counter moved to see if it was dropped down, but we could not find it; then my fellow servant jumped over the counter and went after the prisoner; and I ran out, and saw a piece of cloth taken from under her cloak; it was marked C. E. I can swear to the mark; I had shewn her that piece, with that mark before in the shop, and the piece I cut for her is marked C. M. it makes just two-pence a yard difference; we did not examine her any farther.</p>
               <p>What became of the cloth she bought and paid for? - She took it out with her, and when she was brought back, I saw her lay it on the counter in a paper; I cannot tell the measure of the piece she took, it has been cut; I do not know the value of it.</p>

               <p>Was the cloth loose under her arm? - Yes; I enquired about her neighbourhood, and they gave her an exceeding good character.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a sawyer, a journeyman, I am a house-keeper in the Horse-ferry, Westminster; I was coming home after I left work about seven in the evening, there I saw the prisoner looking in at the window of a hosier and hatter's; and my mate said, look at Gray, he is looking in there, what is he doing? he staid there about a minute and an half, or two minutes, and there came a man right facing me, it was the same side of the way facing me, but at a distance from me; I was of the same side of the way with the prisoner, a man pushed the prisoner in, he was very high the door, and said, you villain or something to that purpose, you was going to take the woman's bundle; but I never saw him offer to take or touch anything at all.</p>
               <p>Was you in such a situation that you could see him touch any thing or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you see him when he was in the house? - I could.</p>
               <p>Was he stooping at all? - No, he never stooped at all, not to my sight.</p>
               <p>Was the whole door open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are both sides of the shop alike? - I believe they are, I did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230149"/>Whereabouts did you stand? - Rather on one side, and the man that beckoned to me was on the other side.</p>
               <p>How far is the door from the window? - It joins in the middle; I saw him through the door way.</p>
               <p>Do you swear he took nothing? - Upon my oath, when he was pushed in, I saw nothing about him.</p>
               <p>After he was pushed in did you? - No, I did not, I must have seen it if there had been any such thing.</p>
               <p>Who brought you here? - The prisoner's sister; she happened to come into the house where I lodged last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Who do you work for? - For Mr. Luward at Pimlico, a cooper.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people about the door, but this gentleman that pushed him in? - Not just at that time, but directly after.</p>
               <p>How happens it you did not stop then? - My curiosity never leads me into such affairs as those; his sister came to the public house accidentally, the sign of the White Hart in the Horse-Ferry, and she was talking to the landlord about her brother being detained for a supposed robbery; and he said there were two men that lodged in his house that saw it; and she desired we would come down.</p>
               <p>What brought her to the public house? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court to Askew. Did you see this man there? - I did, but not till more than four minutes after I had the prisoner in the shop; I only observed two girls and the prisoner about; but after this man, and several more stood at the door, and the people declared they would rescue this man from the shop; I do not recollect his saying any thing; the prisoner was not quite without the shop, but he had the bundle in his arms, and I forced him into the shop, and held him there: at the time he was before the Justice, he asked me why I did not permit him to come out of the shop with the property, that that must have done him, and he should not then have returned from whence he came, for he would rather be hanged than return from whence he came.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. How long have you known the prisoner? - Only seen him come into a public house, no acquaintance at all.</p>

               <p>How came you to think he was drunk? - Because he looked as if he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you see him first? - In Tothill-street; and he stopped and looked, and there was a young man that stood and beckoned with his hand, we were at the next door almost, and he stood close to the door; we stood a little while, and a man rushed in upon him, and pushed him into the house.</p>
               <p>You stood on the other side of the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you could not see what was done in the house? - No, the prisoner was not in the house, I saw him stand at the door, and a man shoved him in, and said, you rascal, are you going to steal the woman's bundle.</p>

               <p>Did Paris say any thing about the corn? - Neither then nor any time since. (The sacks produced.) These are the sacks that we found at the Boar's Head, there were oats in them: the same night I went to Wild's lodgings, I found a sack of oats up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>How is it marked? - E. Burnell.</p>
               <p>Court to Farey. What do you say to that mark? - We cannot say any thing to it.</p>
               <p>Look at the other sacks, and tell us whether these are your master's? - The other two are, and that with the L, which is marked for Lofton; we had sacks for the carmen, and those were for Lofton, but it is a good while ago, and most of the sacks are lost.</p>
               <p>Was there that one remaining on the 29th of January? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was the corn emptied out of those sacks? - When first I saw the sacks, the corn was in them, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>As near as you are able to identify, was it the same corn? - Yes.</p>

            , I can swear to three of these sacks, that with the diamond and the L is one of them, the reason of its being marked with an L, is that we formerly lost so many sacks, that we made our carmen masters of the sacks, and therefore we had them marked with the initial of each carman's name, I believe we had a great many more L's, I dare say we have a good many more on the premises; I saw the corn in the sack, at the Cock, up one pair of stairs; I afterwards compared it with a sample: I saw three sacks full of oats at the Cock, which I knew to be the same oats that we had sent the preceding night, to the second troop, and to Squire Fellows's; to the best of my knowledge they are Essex oats, and had a sprinkling of wheat amongst them; I afterwards took a sample out of the bag and compared them, and they were exactly the same, if it was possible to swear to grain I would swear to them: Groves formerly lived a carman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230153"/> with us, he was discharged six or seven years ago: Paris and Wild I never saw till this circumstance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. These were Essex oats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many oats grow in Essex? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These were not bought at the Corn-market? - Yes, I believe I buy four fifths from Essex.</p>
               <p>The others are bought by other persons? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>The same farmer may send them to market, and some may come to my hands? - That may be the case.</p>
               <p>You have a great many of these sacks not only at home, but about this great town? - Most clearly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My learned friend has asked you a good deal about Essex oats, because he is an Essex farmer; if they sell him oats from Essex, they do not send them in your sacks? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. My Lord, I am Council for Welch only, and I submit there is no evidence of his being present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I beg leave to take an objection before the accomplice is admitted to give his evidence: In all felonies two propositions must be clearly established; first, whether the felony is compleatly made out, and secondly, if so made out, whether such felony was committed by the prisoner; now I submit the first of these propositions is incomplete, because they have not called the persons to whom this corn was to have been delivered, in order to prove that it was not actually delivered, for what evidence have the Jury to say, that the whole of this corn put into the cart, was not delivered at the Horse Guards, and to Mr. Fellows; and if it was all delivered, there could be no felony of the corn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, Mr. Silvester is now arguing upon the effect of the evidence, but I beg leave to say, that at present there is sufficient ground to let in the evidence of the accomplice to go to a Jury: on the evening of the 29th of January, a certain quantity of a specific quality of corn, was put into the carts of the prosecutors, that specific corn in those very sacks, is afterwards found in a place, to which it was not sent by the owners, and to which it could not be carried but wrongfully; I say that would be evidence to go to a Jury, and I submit I am entitled to call the accomplice; the Jury will consider by and by, the weight of all this; but you will see that I could not in the nature of things, call witnesses to prove this delivery, for those whose duty it was to see it delivered, do not know that it was not delivered; for they were imposed on by the tale the sacks corresponding, and believed that the whole quantity was actually delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I do not conceive that Mr. Silvester is irregular in observing on the evidence now; if there is a felony committed, there is evidence to let in the accomplice; but it would be extremely material to shew, that instead of the whole being delivered, only so many sacks were delivered: ought not a Jury who are trying people for felony, attended with prodigious consequences, to say that you shall furnish us with such evidence, that they are sure when they come to pronounce their verdict, that nothing shall remain on their consciences?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Without judging of the effect of the evidence, which is the peculiar province of the Jury; I submit there is a probable ground for the Jury to say, a felony has been committed by some of the prisoners at the bar; if that is so, that is enough to let in the weight of the accomplice, and there are Judges your Lordship knows, that would call in the accomplice first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I always understood that there must be positive evidence of the felony committed, before the accomplice's evidence can be received, and then the Jury will judge of the circumstances; but there must be a felony proved, for how can the Jury first presume a felony, and then presume a man guilty of that felony.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230154"/>Mr. Justice Gould. My notion of the law concerning an accomplice is, that a man who is not indicted, although a partaker in the guilt, may be a competent witness; but it is not fit for the Jury to convict upon such testimony, therefore to be sure the strictness of the law is to bring proof of the felony being committed; to be sure as he is a competent witness, you may set out with him, but then what will a Judge say to the Jury? therefore it is my constant course of practice, and I know many other Judges that do the same, not to call the accomplice first; it is a vain thing: and therefore, before you call the accomplice, you are to lay a foundation. In this case, the ground of your charge is this, that out of the specific quantity of oats, sent on Saturday night to the second troop of Horse Guards, and to Mr. Fellows, three or four sacks were stolen; then does it not present itself to every man's mind, that the best evidence to inform the Court and the Jury upon that occasion, is to call some of those people from the Horse Guards, and from Mr. Fellows's, to shew that there was not in reality the whole of that quantity delivered, but only a certain part of it, and some empty sacks thrown in to make out a tale of sacks, for so it was opened, and I take it for granted, it should be proved; but that is left behind, he does not chuse to call a witness that he has upon that subject, because he does not conceive it will answer his purpose; therefore I say, you have not laid that evidence before the Court and Jury, which would have proved a felony to have been committed, for as it now stands, these men might have had these three bushels, and sacks of oats by others means: Mr. Rose is of the same opinion with me, therefore, I think for want of that evidence which is necessary to make the felony complete, the accomplice cannot be received, and the prisoners must be acquitted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit there is no ground to set the prisoner on his defence; for I take the liberty to say, that there is no charge against this man; the witness said, it was the account made out by the prisoner; and as against the prisoner, that is certainly very good evidence; but on the cross examination, that witness could not swear that account was made out by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. There is clearly ground enough to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall not trouble the Court with witnesses in such a case as this.</p>

               <p>Court. That is a fixture? - The prisoner confessed at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>Mr. James, Prisoner's Council. Was there any promise given to the prisoner, that in case he confessed it should be better for him? - Not that I know of; I never asked him to confess, nor said any thing to him, nor I never heard any.</p>
               <p>Must you have heard it, if there were such words used? - I was there all the time he was examined, but I never heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>Was he threatened at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then tell us what he said? - At the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street, the Gentlemen asked him what time he entered the house? he said that he and one May entered the house about eight at night.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you speak with a certain recollection, that he mentioned the time? - Yes; and the Gentlemen asked him whether he carried the goods? and he said it was May that carried the goods away, but where he could not tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Was this the first question the Justice asked? - I did not hear any before.</p>
               <p>You say it was rather late when you went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not it appear to you that there had been great force and violence used? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in possession of the key of this house? - From last Midsummer, I received it from one Mr. Brooks.</p>
               <p>Where is Mr. Brooks gone? - Mr. Brooks intended to return.</p>
               <p>Was this house furnished? - No, only some fixtures.</p>
               <p>In short, what fixtures there were, and some other furniture in different parts of the house which you did not occupy, belonged to Mr. Brooks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he intended to return to the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brooks, when you had the key, was about coming to live in the house? - Yes, me and my wife had the liberty of living in this house for Mr. Brooks, whose house it was; we used one room up stairs, we had the liberty of going all over the house, but two rooms.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you paid any thing for keeping this house? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. You paid no rent for this house yourself? - I do not know; I do not rent the house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. POWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you been paid any thing for keeping this house? - No.</p>

               <p>Was there any furniture of Brooks's in it, or only fixtures? - Nothing but fixtures.</p>
               <p>Did you take this house? - No, my Lord, we have not taken the house; we had warning about six weeks before Midsummer to quit the house; it was full of lodgers, it was let in tenements.</p>
               <p>Was you a lodger formerly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you was a lodger you paid rent? - Yes, seven pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Have you paid any thing for the time you have been in it since? - I had liberty to stay in the house from Mr. Brooks; he said he wanted the apartment that I had, to bring his own furniture in; I asked him to let me go up into the garret; and he said, if I would not damage it I might: a pewter spoon was found on the prisoner in the watch-house, but nothing else; all the things that were described by my husband, were missing, and more; I attended at the Rotation-office the next day, and the prisoner was examined at the Rotation, and the Justice asked him what time he came into the house; and he said about eight, and one

               <p>I am a watchman; I saw the two prisoners and another in Brick-street, on the 26th of January, a little after two in the morning; it was a very moon-light morning; these men were putting this window-guard into a cellar, and ran away, and a woman said, you are catched, you are catched; they said, no, it was only the watchman; they should make it up with the watchman: it was a little distance from the prosecutor's house; they ran away from the iron, seeing me, and they came back again; they were all together, near this woman's house; I did not see them put the iron down; I saw an iron window-guard after they ran away; I think there were half a dozen bars in it; I took it up, and put it against the side of a house; and they all three came back, and asked me what I was going to do with it; and the two prisoners took it from the side of the house, whilst I had one part in my hand, and they threw it on the dunghill, and said it was theirs; they then asked me to have some beer; and he that is not present, laid hold of my hand, and told me, if I made any noise, they should fall out with me; and Lichfield gave 6 d. to that person to give to me, and I would not have it; Penny followed me, and I laid hold of him; and he swore he would run his knife into my guts; I then saw Lichfield coming towards him, and I let him go, and took the iron and ran on, and they followed me; I sprang my rattle, and they ran away; I knew the prisoners before.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you wish to call that man? - No, I do not want to call him, I do not know any of their names; I had been as the public house several times before, it it the sign of the Star, in Wells-street, Rosemary Lane; I did not take him for three weeks afterwards, he made out of the way, I live at the bottom of that street myself; when I took the prisoner, I went to the public-house, and there were five or six persons sitting round the fire, and I knew him; I did not see the young man there the next morning, which I saw the night before, and the prisoner fell a laughing, and said you do not know what you are talking of, you was drunk.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you went in? - About nine, I was there about two hours, I had two pints; I believe I had a dram in the morning, which we generally have when we go to market, I was very sober indeed, I borrowed this money of my mother.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Council. Have you never been in that place where that man is now? - I never was inside this place in my life, nor never in the yard.</p>
               <p>Was you never tried for any offence? - No, never, neither here nor any where else.</p>
               <p>You say you were quite sober when you came into this house? - Yes, my husband went out directly.</p>
               <p>Then you thought proper to stay two hours after your husband went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray, how many quarterns of gin had you at this alehouse? - I had none, no other liquors than the two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>You had better speak the truth: was not Davis in the house during all the time you was in the house? - I do not know such a name.</p>
               <p>Was not there a man besides the prisoner in the house during all the time you was there? - There was nobody in the tap-room but me and him when he robbed me, nobody went out with me, I went to another public house, I thought my husband was there, I came in again.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you would make it up? - I said, give me five or six shillings, and I will not hurt you; but I never saw him in prison, nor never sent to him.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with another man from that place to Salt-petre Bank, and there ask for a lodging to sleep with that man that night? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you remember one Mr. Patrick being there? - No.</p>
               <p>How much money had you when you went into the house? - Eleven shillings and six-pence.</p>

               <p>I work on the river, I am a lodger, I am a lumper; I remember coming in when the prosecutrix was at the Star, about seven in the middle of December; I cannot tell the day; it was a matter of five weeks after that he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutrix's husband there? - They had had some words; she was very much intoxicated with liquor, during my time she had two pots of beer and three quarterns of gin; when I came in she called me the father of her children, and took me by the neck; the husband had not come in at that time.</p>
               <p>Did this woman ask you to go with her? - She did several and several times, and moreover than that, she gave me five shillings and six-pence to procure her a bed, and I went out and could not get one at any house on Salt-petre Bank, but at the house of one Brunk; I came back and met her at the door, and she said she was robbed; she calls me Bob.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Where did she take this money from? - From a little white purse out of her bosom.</p>
               <p>Was Riley in the house the time you was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Riley. The prosecutrix was rather the worse for liquor when she came in; she drank till she fell off the seat; she was along with Mr. Patrick, and she offered him a shilling to go to bed with her, and he refused it, and said he had a wife of his own.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230163"/>Court. Did you go away before her? - No, Sir, I did not go out of the house till the house was shut up; I slept there that night; I never heard her mention that she was robbed in the house.</p>
               <p>Must you have seen it if she had been robbed in the house? - Undoubtedly, Sir, it could not be otherwise, because I attended the tap-room all the time, the prisoner never took any liberties with her; she paid for what she had to me; I took the money from her and delivered it at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did she never pay any thing to the prisoner? - No, she gave me one shilling one time, and I gave her four-pence.</p>

               <p>I keep the Star in Well's-street; the prisoner lodges with me; the prosecutrix applied to me several times to make the matter up, she said she would forgive him for half a crown; and I told her I would have the man punished, the man said, he would not give her six-pence, and would undergo any prosecution sooner than give her a farthing; I never heard any thing but what was just by him; I found him a very honest sober man while he was with me; the prosecutrix came to my house the day following, and brought a constable, and was going to give charge of another man; I believe he was not taken from my house; he was at my house continually until he was taken up, which was above three weeks after; I do not know whether she was drunk or not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>These are the things which lay on the bed where this man lay; I saw them found; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I stopped there till about four in the afternoon, after Mr. Curtis went away, and Penny and I went to the public-house to have some beer, he left me and went away, I went home after to go to bed; Penny was in bed, and had locked himself in; Bunce wanted to awake him, and he could not; I went into the shop to work, at last Bunce broke the door open, but he could not make him sensible; when I went to work again, I found half a gallon of wine in the shop, and Bunce thought he heard some foot in the room, which was me coming along the passage; Bunce said, what is the matter? I said nothing is the matter, come with me, and I will shew you what is the matter; I took him into the shop and shewed him where Penny had been vomiting all round, and I shewed him the half gallon of wine; Bunce was in a great passion, and told me to pack up my tools and go away out of the house that night, for he was afraid Penny and I should have words, accordingly I packed up my things and went and came back in the morning, and I was secured.</p>

               <p>Court to Bunce. Is this true? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did Penny say to it at the time? - He did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Then at first, that night Williams said Penny had been in Curtis's room, and went and shewed you the room? - He shewed me where he had been vomiting, and were the wine was, that was just by the chamber door.</p>
               <p>Where had you heard the foot before? - It was in the chamber, I thought I heard the foot.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the chamber that night? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then it was in the shop room he took you to? - Yes, Penny said nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Which of them was most in liquor? - I do not know, Penny was in bed, and Williams was very much in liquor; I do not know when Williams went to bed, he said he should go to work, I did not see him go to work.</p>
               <p>Did you bid him take his tools and go to prevent their quarrelling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I pulled off my coat and waistcoat and shoes, I thought I would lay in the same manner Penny did, he had not all his clothes off.</p>
               <p>Court to Curtis. How did this man behave before? I never heard any thing amiss about him, Penny had worked with me a few months.</p>
               <p>What was the circumstance that induced you to charge Williams rather than Penny? - Because Penny swore to him, and Williams owned it all before the Justice; the Justice asked him how he came to do this thing, and he said he was drunk; I had six quarts of elder wine, and they had drawn that out and got drunk with it.</p>

            , and I went down and found the lock was off; I opened the door, and stood in the passage about ten minutes, and I heard somebody down below; I stepped out and got assistance, and the prisoner and another man came up; the prisoner catched me by the collar, and asked me if I did not see a man, I told him no, and I immediately caught at him; they came out of the kitchen: the other pushed me out in the street, and the prisoner slipped out, and I followed him, and caught him the corner of St. Martin's Court, the other escaped; I found the lead sink below was all turned up, but not taken out of the room; the lock was found within the shop door, removed from the street door altogether, with the screws in it; the lead was not taken out of the frame.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Shelton. Is there any count for ripping and cutting? - No, only the count for stealing.</p>
               <p>Do you know what situation the house was left in before? - I was down there before, and it was locked; the lock appeared to be taken off with a screw driver, he dropped a screw driver out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Did the lock appear to be forced off, for the purpose of getting into the house, or did it appear to be taken off afterwards? - It appeared to me, to have been taken off withinside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether it was an iron lock, or a wooden lock? - It was what we call a stock lock, iron work in a wooden frame.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you understand then, from the description of an iron lock, should you understand it was a lock of this kind, or a lock in an iron box? - No, I should not, it is called a stock lock, an iron lock, or a brass lock, according to the case of it.</p>

               <p>What sort of lock was it? - A stock lock, a lock in an iron frame, I do not conceive it to be called an iron lock.</p>

               <p>I was at St. James's-market, to carry some lead, I stopped and had a pennyworth of beer, and came along Leicester-fields, and up Castle-street, meaning to go home to my lodgings; I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran, I suppose there were twenty people, or more, and the gentleman took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, here is no taking away to constitute a complete stealing, any the least removal is sufficient, but here there was none; and though the same act of parliament, which makes it felony to steal, makes it felony to rip with intent to steal, yet there is no such charge in the indictment: and then in the count for the lock, they have called it an iron lock, which it certainly is not, therefore in point of law, the prisoner is entitled to his acquittal.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of January, about two minutes after six. I was going to take the relief out, and I had got about half way to the place, to relieve the first sentry in Scotland Yard, and I met the prisoner with the trunk; two men passed me in a great hurry, and the prisoner was behind them with the trunk; I stopped the prisoner, he never got from me, I took him to the Guard-room, and down to the Savoy Barracks, to the serjeant who belonged to the regiment, to know how we should act with him; and I took him to Sir Sampson's, with the same trunk; this is the trunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It was six in the evening you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many went by before you saw the prisoner? - I saw two pass me in a very great hurry, the prisoner had it in his hand, I took it out of his hand, he had got it upon the ground on the end; he said he met some men, and he asked them what they were going to do with that trunk, and he said some of them knocked him down directly, he did not make any resistance, he did not say that he hoped to have any of the reward, if the rogues were taken.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him to leave the trunk in your hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your fellow soldiers, in your hearing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he say, that he recovered it from the persons that were running on before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect if he did not say he hoped for some of the reward? - I never did hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Court to Dixon. Did you desire the prisoner to go away and leave the trunk in your hands, and he refused? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to the Corporal. In what posture was the prisoner when you first saw him? - The trunk was an end, and he had the handle in his hand, and I took it from him, he just stood still; I met him at the corner of a narrow passage.</p>
               <p>Then at the time you first saw him, he was standing still? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, under the circumstances in which this man is described, and immediately saying he had stopped somebody with the trunk; a man of bad character could hardly be convicted on that evidence: but where a man appears<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230167"/> to have a good character, there can be no doubt.</p>

               <p>What was she? - She used to go to work at gentlemen's houses, I was hired to live with her at a shilling a week, we never had any quarrel before she took the pigs.</p>

            , I lodged at that time in the house, I looked round the shop, and found it had been robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment, they were all my property; when I went to bed I double locked the door, I am quite sure they were all safe when I went to bed; I went the same morning to Justice Blackborough's, and informed him, and he granted me a warrant; and Dinmore and me went and took a man that we suspected, who lodged in the same house, we found him in Gold-lane, and he was committed to prison; afterwards, when the prisoner was taken up, which was in his own room, I saw my shirt upon his back.</p>
               <p>Did he make any opposition to your looking at the shirt? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the shirt? - Yes, when it was taken off my wife swore to it; I saw it taken off him, and there was a woman whom he said was his wife, and we desired her to pull off her shirt, and we retired while she stripped, for decency, but she pulled it off, and opened the door, and gave the shift into my hand; when we got to the Justices, the prisoner before me owned the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him favour? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him? - No, he said, before the Justice, that he robbed me, and that it was through a woman that lodges in the house that he robbed me; he said, he had sold the rest of the things to a Jew, and the woman said you have not sold them all, for you have a pair of shoes on belonging to the man; and his shoes were then taken off, and I swore to them, having been at work on them the night before for a customer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say you would make it up for two guineas? - I never spoke to him in my life, only the time he was taken.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make any offer to him? - Nothing in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses that he offered to make it up.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you say to him to induce him to acknowledge that, did you give him any promise, or hint that it would be better for him to confess, or anything of that kind? - No, my Lord; I told him, that as we were sensible from the state of our account which we kept of our gold, that we lost some of it in an unfair manner, that it was exceedingly necessary that he should give us an unequivocal account how he came by it; he hesitated for some time giving any answer, I told him upon that, that he had better give a direct answer, that that would be more likely to satisfy us, that nothing short of that would satisfy us.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot hear anything that he said after that, after you told him that he should not be prosecuted? - I did not tell him any such thing.</p>
               <p>But you told him the same thing in substance, you conveyed that idea to him, do you know any thing independent of what he himself said, after this? - Some things were found upon him, before he acknowledged them, they were two brilliant diamonds, they were in a paper in the lining of his breeches, not in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had them about him? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you distinguish them to be your's? - No, it is impossible to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Had you lost such? - I cannot say we had, we are constantly losing one, which drops on the floor, and it is impossible sometimes to find it, though sometimes we do; the rose diamonds were found at his lodgings, I can say nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Court. It is only by his confession that you know they are your property? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury Gentlemen of the Jury, as this case stands, it will be impossible to reach the prisoner: with respect to the ingot of gold, the whole of that rests upon the admission of the prisoner, after the prosecutor told him it would be better for him to speak the truth, and nothing short of that would satisfy him. It is the law of this country, and a very proper one too in my opinion, that no evidence of confession can be received, that is procured on promise of indemnity.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I beg to observe on the part of the prisoner, that it is plain from this woman's evidence, let the way to the cellar be where it will, or from whence it will, that the prisoner had compleat controul over the house; she had the key, she took the house for the avowed purpose of letting lodgings; and the possession of that cellar cannot any way be considered as the possession of the landlord of that house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Ridley's Council. Do not tell us what he seemed? - I will venture to swear that he seemed surprized, I will venture to say he was frightened when I came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit to the Court, whether such evidence ever was given or endured in a Court of Justice, the witness comes here and attempts to describe the operations of a man's mind; it is perfectly competent for him to give an account of what the prisoner did, as for instance, if the prisoner said you shall not look into such a place.</p>
               <p>Wright. I said to Ridley, no hesitating, come along wi th me, I will shew you where the mutton is; when I asked him for the mutton he made no answer at all, I then took the constable along with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he follow you, or attempt to run away? - He followed me, he did not attempt to run away.</p>
               <p>Did he make any opposition to your going into the room? - No, he did not, I went into a little room which is the middle part of the house next the parlour, he followed me into the parlour, there was not any body in the little room but the constable and myself, there I found a shoulder of mutton, the constable took it to his own house.</p>
               <p>Had that shoulder of mutton any thing remarkable about it? - Yes, Sir, in a shoulder of mutton we have always one particular score.</p>
               <p>What do you mean your sheep? - Yes, Sir, the man always marks them all.</p>
               <p>Are they all marked with one score? - There may be one score more or less, when the sheep is hot they take and score them three or four, more or less.</p>
               <p>Are not all the shoulders of mutton that you have in your shop, scored much in the same way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not mutton in other shops scored much in the same way? - Never, they differ, most people differ in the score.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear from the marks of this mutton, that this was scored by your people? - Yes, I believe I can venture to swear that it was scored by the man that stole it.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that you know this to be the score of your shop? - Yes, Sir, I can bring you three or four or half a dozen now that are the same, they are Dorsetshire sheep, and they are most remarkable from any other sheep.</p>
               <p>Had you any other sheep but Dorsetshire sheep in your shop? - No, none except a few Wiltshire.</p>
               <p>Did this appear to you, to be a shoulder of a Dorset? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would you venture to swear that? - I will swear it, Sir; I took my man the prisoner Simpson, to Sir Sampson Wright's, and the constable brought Ridley; the constable is here that took him up, and here is a confession of

            ; Simpson went with me to the Justice's the day following; I did not say a word to him, I told him I wanted him to go with me a little way, Simpson was my servant, he has lived with me thrice, and this last time, about six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Did not you give him a hint, which way you were going? - None at all, we went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did he make any objection to going there? - None.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask you any questions, all the way going to the office? - Not a word passed the whole way.</p>
               <p>Who was the Magistrate? - Mr. Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Was that confession taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see it signed by the Magistrate, and the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it read over to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner Simpson's Council. When you was at the office, Sir, was there nothing passed between your man and you? No, Sir, I cannot recollect that there was.</p>
               <p>It is impossible but something must be aid to him? - All I said to him is this, I asked him how much gin and beer he had for a shoulder of mutton, and he said he could not tell me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230175"/>Did not you say to him, that if he would make a confession, it would be better for him? - No.</p>
               <p>I suppose Ridley was the man you levelled at, not Simpson? - No, Sir, not one more than the other.</p>
               <p>This man had some wages in your hand at the time? - How much do you think?</p>
               <p>May be eight or ten pounds? - No, Sir, I believe there may be five pounds, or more.</p>

               <p>"beer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship knows that confession does not at all affect Ridley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. This prisoner, Mr. Ridley, has kept a publick house in your neighbourhood about four or five years? - Yes, this and another before.</p>
               <p>Upon your going in and asking Ridley, whether he had not a shoulder of mutton, upon the oath you have taken, did not he immediately say, I have a shoulder of mutton: was not the constable by? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Be a little attentive, whether in the hearing of the constable, he did not immediately say, I have a shoulder of mutton and I will shew it you? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then I am to take it, he did not shew you nor tell you so; you will swear that positively? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Now as to the mark of this mutton, had you ever seen that shoulder of mutton, before you saw it at his house? - Yes, as sure as your name is Garrow.</p>
               <p>What were the marks? - Upon my word I cannot exactly tell you how many marks there were, there might be four or five.</p>
               <p>Then there is no particular number of strokes universally used through your shop? - No, not that I know of, just as it pleases the man who dresses them.</p>
               <p>You are a killing butcher? - We kill our own meat; the man has always one method of marking, he hardly ever alters it.</p>
               <p>Court. When this examination was taken it was read to the prisoner, was Ridley present? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Explain to us, who are not fortunate enough to know, the reason of your marks? - No, you know the taste better.</p>
               <p>Explain to us the reason of those marks? It is only for ornament.</p>
               <p>Just so? - They never hardly vary.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Wright, pray how many shoulders of mutton do you think there were in Newport-market that day, that could not be distinguished from that by the scoring? - I suppose there might be five hundred for what I know.</p>
               <p>So I thought, therefore I need not travel into all the markets in town? - It was Dorsetshire mutton.</p>
               <p>And there were so many shoulders of Dorsetshire mutton, that no man can guess? No, I suppose not.</p>
               <p>Some hundred shoulders? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then for any thing we have been able to learn yet, these scores might be made on them too? - No! no! no! you mistake yourself, I know my own mutton as well as you know your brief.</p>
               <p>Do you so, now we will try that a little, I know that by my see, and by the name of the party, and of the attorney, now have you any such reason for knowing your mutton? - I know my own mutton when I see it.</p>
               <p>Why, how? - I have swore it.</p>
               <p>That will not do? - I hope the Jury will be satisfied.</p>
               <p>How do you know your mutton from any other Dorsetshire mutton? - I know it was my shoulder of mutton.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230176"/>But you must give us some reason? - Because I am sure of it, the shoulder of mutton is in being, and we will send for it, I will swear to it, because I know it.</p>
               <p>You must answer me Mr. Wright? - I shall give you may be such an answer, that you shall not like.</p>
               <p>I shall take care not to deserve any such answer; but I must have a plain answer from you; by what is it that you are able to swear that is your shoulder of mutton? - I know it to be my shoulder of mutton, by having it in my shop, and in my house several days before.</p>
               <p>By what marks? - By the common score that is used in my yard, when the man is killing, and by the very sort of mutton.</p>
               <p>Why you have said there was mutton of that score, and that mark, to the amount of five hundred? - No, not as I know.</p>
               <p>Yes, but you have? - Then you have extorted the question from me, the shoulder of mutton is here, and I will send for it.</p>
               <p>That is no answer? - First I know it by the score and by the cut of it.</p>
               <p>That score is common to other mutton? - It may for what I know.</p>
               <p>PRICE ROUNDS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable of St. James's, on the 23d of February, about twenty minutes before twelve, Mr. Wright came to me, and told me he wanted me to go a little way along with him; I went with him to the house of Mr. Ridley, of the Red Lion, in Jermyn-street; upon my entrance at the door, he gave me a warrant; I followed Mr. Wright into the kitchen, and when we went into the kitchen, Mr. Wright looked into the scullery, where the girl washes her dishes, then he looked into the cupboard; I did not know what he was looking for, but he said, where is Mr. Ridley; there were three men in the kitchen by the fire, and one of the men said, I hear him coughing in the tap room; I turned my head in this manner, and I saw him through the bar, I called Ridley, and he came immediately; upon his entrance, Mr. Wright said, Mr. Ridley, I understand you have a shoulder of mutton of mine here; Mr. Ridley and Mr.

             both went, Mr. Ridley took hold of a brass nob, that there is to open the door of the kitchen, I cannot say which turned it, but they both had it in their hands together; Mr. Ridley said, there is a shoulder of mutton has been left here these two days, I do not know who it belongs to, and he said he had no charge of it, nor did not know how it came there, but it had been gnawed by the cats, by being laid about; I saw it, and it was gnawed: Mr. Wright took it in his hand, and turned it about, and said Mr. Rounds, this is my property, I deliver it into your custody, and he gave it to me, as constable; I took it into my own house, Mr. Wright desired me to take care of it, and he would meet me at one o'clock, I saw him about one, and he said I will go and get Bob and the boy to the office, and do you bring Ridley and the mutton; by Bob and the boy I understood that this man's name was Robert.</p>
               <p>How soon after was it that you took Ridley, to carry him to Bow-street? - About an hour and half.</p>
               <p>When you came to take Ridley, did you find him at home? - Yes, I went in and said, Mr. Ridley can you boil me this bone of mutton, it is two raw for me, his wife said there is some veal and bacon and pease for dinner, if you will wait you are welcome; I did not tell him then, I told him after he must go along with me, about the shoulder of mutton, and he said he would, he went very agreeably.</p>
               <p>Was you before the Magistrate? - Yes, all the time all the evidences were examined; the shoulder of mutton was openly exposed, it lay on the top of a bureau bedstead, without any paper, or cloth, or anything.</p>
               <p>What room do you call it? - As that may be the tap room, and this the kitchen, it is a middle room, there is a window that looks into the tap-room and the kitchen, there is a bureau bedstead in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe Ridley remained in his house doing his business, sometime before he went with the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230177"/>I suppose this is the boy's bed room, is not it? - Yes, I live the very next door to Mr. Ridley, he has kept the house about four years.</p>
               <p>Is it an orderly well governed house? - I do not know one so well governed in the neighbourhood, I believe I am the only person that has a complaint against him, and on Saturday night he has a pay-table, and the men stay till eleven at night, and the men come and piss against my-door, which is a private house; he bears a very good character, he had a very comfortable dinner to set down to that day.</p>
               <p>He is not a sort of man that usually puts his own mutton, and things that he has to eat on the boy's bed? - No.</p>

             the butcher, in St. James's Market; in consequence of a slight suspicion, on the 21st of this month, and a positive information, I examined the shoulders of mutton in my father's shop, on Monday morning about nine, and there were nine in number; the first thing that particularly struck me, was that one of the shoulders of mutton was very near tumbling down, which shoulder was the first that I examined, on the back of which was six scores; it had been pretty much strained in the cutting up, and on the upper part, which is called the point of the shoulder, the piece of marked fat was not cut off by me, as usual; this shoulder of mutton was the largest in the shop, it was cut on the Saturday before, and owing to the sharpness of the weather, was very dry; I examined the other shoulders of mutton particularly, and there was not a shoulder of mutton in the shop, with so many scores upon it, as this one which I am now mentioning to you; there was one which was particularly small, that I did not take much notice of, it was a Welch one, about three pound, I did not examine the remaining six so much as I had done them two, and this was the reason why I did not examine the others, because I expected one to be taken that night, and then I should have had the fellow to it, these were my general observations that night, upon which I shut the shop door, and locked it, and took the key home, and laid it on a shelf in the kitchen; Simpson sleeps in our house, I spoke to him that night, just before I took the keys, the next morning when I got up, one of the shoulders of mutton was missing, that was the one I looked at the night before.</p>
               <p>Is it usual in the trade, for people to leave half a foot? - It is, or it is not, the mark in the foot was done accidentally, not by way of distinction, I am positive it is the same mutton, I undertake to swear to it; I beg leave to observe in behalf of the prisoner,

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. There were times when you and your father were absent from the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not he a liberty of selling? - Yes, to sell and send to the customers, if we were not in the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, I humbly apprehend, that notwithstanding the manner in which this paper is obtained, it will not at all affect the prisoner Simpson; it is proved by Mr. Wright himself, that he had a liberty of selling the meat, and your Lordship remembers, in the case of Smith, he having a liberty to dispose of the corn of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230178"/> his master, the Court determined that he could commit no felony upon it; the manner of drawing up these confessions at the office we all know, and I apprehend that in this case, he having a liberty to sell the meat of his master, could not commit a felony upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, on the part of Ridley, also argued on the same side.</p>
               <p>The Court over-ruled the objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, though I do not call any witnesses to Ridley's character on this transaction, yet for the sake of his character in future, and to shew the nature of this prosecution, I will trouble the Court with a few witnesses, out of a great many.</p>

               <p>Court. Were they snatched out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any body else near you? - The two witnesses that are here were close behind me; the man then ran across the road, and I cried out, I have lost my buckles.</p>
               <p>Was the person pursued? - No, not then, I was so frightened I knew not what I did; I went home first, I live just by there, and one of the witnesses lives just by me; I described the person and clothes of the prisoner, and I went with my husband and the constable in pursuit of him, but he was not taken till Sunday the 16th, between three and four; I went with the constable to the watch-house, to see if I should know him, and I went with the witness to the watch-house to see the person; and I believe he was laid down, and they made him get up; and I think, to the best of my knowledge, that he certainly is the lad that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear to him? - I cannot say I saw his face, but by his statue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230179"/> and all appearances he certainly is the person.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was he before he was out of your sight? - It is a very broad crossing where he crossed, and he did not run very fast; I did not see his face; my property was not found.</p>

               <p>Did you know Mrs. Hatton before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How could you see this? - There were two link-boys standing on each side of the basket, and there was the light of a candle that was about a yard off in the passage, I saw the prisoner pat her on the shoulder, and force them out of her hand; I followed the boy immediately, he walked across the way when he snatched them out of her hand, there was another boy on the other side of the way; he was not taken till Sunday, between three and four; he got away, he said he would break her arm if she did not loose him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the boy dressed whom she had by the arm. - He had a blue jacket, and a round hat.</p>
               <p>Was it Smith that tapped her on the shoulder, and took the bundle? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the other boy dressed? - I did not see the other boy, he was the farther side of the road; I could not tell what clothes he had on.</p>

               <p>Did you see Smith's face at the time he tapped this woman on the shoulder? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now did you see Smith's face at the time that Mrs. Hatton laid hold of him? - Yes, it was the same night.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hatton followed him immediately? - She went to her husband first, and came back again.</p>
               <p>How long after was it that you saw Mrs. Hatton in St. Giles's? - About half an hour, she took hold of him as he came out of the door where the two thieves went into.</p>
               <p>In what street was this door? - It is a new street just as you get into St. Giles's; she said, I want my buckles.</p>
               <p>That person that you saw her have hold of his arm, coming out of the door, was that Smith the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have seen his face now and you saw it then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As you followed the prisoner Smith, you can tell us into which street he took? - I cannot tell the name of the street, it is about a hundred yards to the passage.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. If I understand you right, after the boy had robbed you, he went across the street, you did not pursue him, but went home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you never saw the boy till Sunday? - No.</p>
               <p>What do you say to this part of the case, that this boy says, that you saw him at a door, and took hold of him by the arm? - I went in pursuit of him with my husband, I went down into a street by the Flying-Horse, and the boy laid hold of my arm as I held it across the door, and he swore he would break it.</p>
               <p>How was that boy dressed? - I absolutely cannot tell, for there was a very little light in the passage, it was between the passage and the door.</p>
               <p>Now you told me just now that that was not the prisoner at the bar? - I said, I cannot swear that that was the prisoner, that said, he would break my arm, because it was not very light.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell us upon your first examination that you never saw any thing of the boy till Sunday? - I did not know it was material, or else I would have mentioned it before.</p>
               <p>That boy that you saw in this street, do do you believe it was the same boy? - I cannot tell, for there was hardly any light, it was between the dark passage and the door.</p>

               <p>Did you ever entertain a notion, that it was the same boy? - I rather imagined that it was, because I heard a paper rattle in the passage, which I imagined had the buckles in it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. It was dark in this passage? - One of the link boys came along with the woman, and she said she would give him three halfpence if he would shew her a light, and he shewed her a light.</p>
               <p>The link boy did not come, till after they had made the escape? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the link boy with her? - Yes, Sir, he followed her away from where the sprats were, the boy went down the passage, and she took the link out of his hand, and held it at the door; I went into this street with Mrs. Hatton and the link boy, and Jones was there, the link was always alight, and he kept poking it to make it give a good light, she run up to the door with the link in her hand, and stood across it, and there were two boys hid up the stairs, I saw them by the light of the stairs, and they said, let us go down, and see what is the matter, for I will not stay here; and they came down, and Mrs. Hatton held her arm across the door, and she said they should not come out, and she insisted on their stopping there, and they said if she did not let them pass they would break her arm.</p>
               <p>Did either of them lay hold of her arm? - They took hold of her arm in this manner, and pushed it.</p>
               <p>Which was that? - The one in the blue jacket.</p>
               <p>Was Smith either of these boys? - I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Had they both blue jackets? - No, one had a light coloured coat, and one of them run up against me, as I stood right opposite the door, and pushed me down, one walked away, and the other run, and then they both walked together, till they both got out of sight.</p>

               <p>Court. I should be glad if you will fix with as much precision as you can, the time that you was robbed? - When I came out of the play-house.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to look at your watch at that time? - In the play-house to the best of my recollection I did.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty, upon your oath, that you did look at your watch while you was in the play-house? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>What were the play and the entertainment? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>I wish to ascertain the time by that, did you come out at the time when other people came out? - The play was over, and I came away with the rest of the company, I was crouded and jostled by a number of people, I came away to the end of the Piazza, which goes to <placeName id="t17850223-122-crimeloc570">Russel-street</placeName>

               <p>Describe in what manner a croud came round you, you know pretty well coming out of the house, there are a vast number of all sorts of people, girls of the town, and all sorts, what sort of a croud was this? - Such as generally are assembled at the coming out of the house; I can say no more than that I lost my watch and pocket handkerchief; I felt the watch taken out of my pocket, I caught hold of an arm, but the croud forced my hand from that arm.</p>
               <p>At the time that you felt your watch go, and caught hold of an arm, you did not perceive any thing more done to you, and the person slipped away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch afterwards? - It has been produced to me.</p>
               <p>Who produced it to you? - One Mr. Jones, a pawnbroker, in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Describe the watch you lost at that time? - It was a metal watch, with a moco tortoiseshell outside case, and inside case made of base metal.</p>
               <p>In that croud you can swear with certainty, that you felt your watch fall from you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Can you tell when last you had your watch in your hand that day? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had you had it about you that day? - That I am confident of.</p>
               <p>When did you last see your handkerchief? - Occasionally at the play-house.</p>
               <p>When you saw your watch again, did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230184"/> you see it with the key and trinkets mentioned in the indictment? - No, my Lord, the seal and hook are gone, and the key was there then.</p>
               <p>Can you identify the watch? - Only by the wearing it now and then, when I went to dangerous places, I kept it for that purpose just to see the hour.</p>
               <p>How long might you have had it? - I fancy about a year, or a year and a half, or two years, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Was there any paper on the inside, that you can swear to? - I can swear to the watch by sight.</p>
               <p>I understand you did not distinguish any person at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the face of the person whose arm you took hold of? - No, if I did, I cannot recollect who he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Had you your glasses on, Sir, at that time? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>I think I observe by the make of your glasses, that your sight is very short? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was in the usual croud that comes out of the play-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You felt your watch go, and immediately seized an arm, which you concluded was the arm that took your watch? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>You have no reason to believe that you saw the prisoner at the bar at all in that crowd? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the watch itself, my Lord has asked you, whether either by the maker's name, or the number, or any lady's work, or any thing else, you can identify it? - No; I have the name and the number.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you describe the hair string? - There is a swivel and top made of gold, I know the string, I can swear to the string.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are many hundred such strings as these in London? - Possibly there may.</p>
               <p>You have, I have no doubt, a very firm persuasion that that is your watch? - I have.</p>
               <p>But there are no particular marks by which you can distinguish that from another tortoiseshell watch, and that string from another hair string? - No, there are not.</p>
               <p>Do you think it was nearer ten than eleven, or eleven than ten? - I should rather guess it was nearer eleven.</p>
               <p>What house was it at? - Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>You cannot recollect the performance? - No.</p>
               <p>There was no personal violence addressed to you, only the shoving of the crowd, as I understand it? - No.</p>
               <p>You felt your watch go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Have you any notion of the person at all? - I did not take any notice, the witness Walker took the watch out of his hand that brought it, and asked him how much he wanted upon it; the answer was a guinea and a half; the other witness first looked at the watch, and then put it into my hand, to know if a guinea and a half would be lent upon it; I examined it, and thinking the mounting of the string to be gold, I went and asked the person whether the mounting was gold; his answer was yes; then I ordered the witness to lend the person a guinea and an half; the money was given, and the person went away.</p>
               <p>Court. What may the value of this watch be? - The first cost might be about three guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On Monday the 10th of January, in the afternoon, the hour I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230185"/>Can you at all say what time in the afternoon? - I looked at it by the light of a candle, it was rather a dark day, the candle might have been lighted since three o'clock, but as far as I can say, it was from three to six.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch, will you swear that was the watch? - Yes, this is the watch.</p>
               <p>When it was brought to you, was it in the condition it is now? - It was, excepting the glass, which is broke by accident, waiting here on Monday last.</p>
               <p>There is a hair string to it? - Yes, there is a common metal watch key upon the string.</p>
               <p>Is it one of those keys that hang down loose, or is it a strait stiff key? - It is a stiff key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where is your shop? - The corner of Wine-office-court, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Have you no windows but the windows in Fleet-street? - No.</p>
               <p>That is not a large window? - Not very large.</p>
               <p>And pretty full of goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you ascertain the time this happened? - From three to six.</p>
               <p>That is taking a large scope? - It was between dinner time and that time, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Is your shop divided into little boxes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The purpose of which is, that persons who are distressed may not be exposed, but may come into rather a darker place than ordinary; in the box it is dark, so that a person standing in the box is not very conspicuous; my observation is that the object who is in the dark, is not so visible to persons in the shop, as the person in the shop is to them in the boxes? - He was well dressed, I had not the least suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this? - I do not know that ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>The person that did bring it took a duplicate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now is not it the constant course of the trade, for persons pledging things to take duplicates? - No, it is the common rule, he was asked if he would have a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Why they commonly ask them, whether they chuse to have a duplicate? - Some people do not wish to have the care of a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Those who decline having a duplicate, come under very suspicious circumstances, for they do not chuse to have a duplicate found upon them? - I do not see that, because a person might take a duplicate, and tear it at the door going out, some that know the shop never do take duplicates, but strangers usually do.</p>
               <p>Was you one of th e persons that went to the prisoner's lodgings? - I was not.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see the person of the prisoner before? - I cannot say, I may have seen him.</p>
               <p>Then he was a stranger to you at that time? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon what did you lend him a guinea and an half? - Upon that watch with the gold hair string; he told me the string was gold; I carried the watch to my partner

            , and asked him if that would do for a guinea and an half, I told him the string was gold mounted; my partner took the watch, and examined it, and took it opposite to the box where the prisoner was, and he asked him if the string was gold mounted; and he told him yes; and my partner bid me give him a guinea and an half; which I did, and he bid me give him a duplicate; I gave him one, and I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230186"/> him where he lived; he told me No. 20; Jewin-street.</p>
               <p>What part of the town is that in? - I really do not know, I gave him the duplicate, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Court. How many boxes may there be in your shop? - Three.</p>
               <p>Can a person at any part of the shop, see into all the three boxes at one time? - No, not without they go nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>How many candles had you in the shop? - I do not know, I believe there was but one, night was not come on, candles had not been lighted.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me from your recollection, whether that candle was near the box where the man stood, or the other part of the shop? - It was near the box.</p>
               <p>Was it opposite the box? - It was not exactly opposite, it was opposite the next box to it.</p>
               <p>How long might the man be in the shop altogether? - Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you any suspicion of that man? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Then you made I suppose the common observations upon him, just as usual? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now will you venture to swear from the sight you had of him, that the prisoner at the bar was the man? - I have sworn it, he was the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there a counter between you and him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How broad? - About a yard broad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And what is the depth of the stall, from the edge of the counter to the door where they come in? - About the same width, or a little more, it is sufficient just to take one person, it has a slide to come over one of the counters, but that is drawn up when we please.</p>
               <p>Was that slide drawn up? - But very little.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch? - This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the man dressed? - In a lightish coloured coat and a red waistcoat, with a round hat.</p>
               <p>Was his hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Walker, now raise your voice, and attend to me, is yours a shop of considerable business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Watches are as common pledges as anything? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many watches do you think you might have taken in pledge, in the course of the ten days preceding the day you have been speaking of? - I cannot tell how many, sometimes one or two in a day, sometimes seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the name of the man, that pledged a watch at six the day before? - I do not recollect that I took in one.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the one the day after? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>If you took in one, do you recollect the person of that man? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of the person that brought in the last pledge before this watch? - I cannot recollect any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>But you know upon this, there is something depends, for a highway robbery there is a reward? - I did not know that at the time.</p>
               <p>No! Mr. Walker? - As to that, I did not go to swear for that.</p>
               <p>Oh! God forbid that I should suspect you of that! you had no suspicion of the man that brought you this? - No, but we look at every person that pledges any thing for a high sum.</p>
               <p>Yes, and you look at them so well, that you forget every one but this man, and this is a high sum? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>You had one candle, you had not lighted up the decoys at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>The slide was pulled over upon the counter? - Yes, but I went opposite to him.</p>
               <p>Had the man a round hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That did not assist you to recollect him much? - No.</p>
               <p>Cannot you swear that he had a bald head? - No.</p>
               <p>(N. B. The Prisoner had a bald head.)</p>
               <p>I thought you might have seen that through his hat; cannot you recollect now<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230187"/> what time a little more particularly? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>I believe you was the young gentleman that went to the prisoner's lodgings? - Yes, Sir, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of Mr. Arrhenius's seals there? - I was not searching, I staid in the passage.</p>
               <p>Did not you go in before the search warrant was executed, and hold some conversation with the prisoner? - Jealous went in.</p>
               <p>How long were you and Jealous consulting in the passage? - We were not consulting.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that after Jealous and you had been into this room, that you did not go out together before you came in, and ask for the keys of the box. Do you mean to swear that you immediately knew this man, and that you told Jealous so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you want to change his clothes? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that in your presence he was not ordered to put on his other clothes? - He was not, nor I did not see him change his clothes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Jealous that that man was not in the clothes, that the man was in that pawned the watch? - He was in the same dress when I went in, he had a light coloured coat, and a red waistcoat on; that I did not tell Jealous that was not the man nor the dress.</p>
               <p>For what purpose was he to change his clothes? - I did not know he did change his clothes.</p>
               <p>Did Jealous carry you to the prisoner's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who directed you to the house? - Jealous, by the description that me and my partner gave at Bow-street, he said he had suspicion who the person was, and I should go with him.</p>
               <p>The first person that you saw you plumped upon? - There was nobody in the room but himself.</p>
               <p>That will not do, did he shew you any body else, before he shewed you the prisoner? - He did not.</p>
               <p>And the moment he shewed him to you, you plumped upon him? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Where is his house? - No. 4, in New-street, Gough Square.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you take in a pledge you register it? - Certainly, the name and place of abode.</p>
               <p>Court. About what time did you see him there at his house? - About ten in the morning, the Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who first discovered this watch at your shop? - My partner and I looked over the hand bill that came in on the Wednesday, and in particular we observed this watch.</p>
               <p>Have not you a hue and cry every Monday? - Yes, but it did not come on the Monday, it came on the Wednesday, we have a paper from Bow-street every week.</p>
               <p>That paper ought to come on Monday? - Yes, but it did not come till Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does it usually come regularly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear that that paper did not come in till the Wednesday? - I will.</p>
               <p>Do you ever recollect this paper, which is stated to come out of a Monday, coming out of a Tuesday or Wednesday? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you sure it was Thursday, and not Friday, that this man was apprehended? - It was Thursday, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>You know it would have been very gross conduct in you, to have taken in a watch that was in the hue and cry paper? - Certainly it would.</p>
               <p>But of course, if the paper came in on the Wednesday, you took it in very harmlessly on the Monday? - We were both reading it on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Jury to Littler. What time did the paper come in, do you recollect? - It came in on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230188"/>What time in the morning? - At twelve within a few minutes as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Whose duty is it to deliver it? - One of the officers of Bow-street, his name is Maynard.</p>
               <p>Did you read it together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you do in consequence of that reading? - I went to Bow-street, and described a tall thin man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would only observe one or two things; the witness declares I was taken on the Thursday, I was taken on the Friday; he solemnly declares my coat was not changed, the coat I had on was a pea green coat; the officer searched my drawers particularly over, I asked him several times with what view he searched, he said you will know presently; he then said have you any other place where you put your property, I said I have a chest up stairs, he went up there and looked about, he then immediately came into the parlour with me, and said take off that coat you have on, and put on this drab coloured coat, which I did.</p>

               <p>At what time did he come? - At about seven, or between seven and eight, he said there till the watch was going past twelve; he was drinking punch, and smoaking his pipe; there was Humpage, Lucas, and Lewis, I made them a six shilling bowl myself, and drank some of it myself.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say, from eight o'clock till twelve, the prisoner was never out of the house? - He never was out till nine, and about nine I sat down and smoaked my pipe till he went away; from nine till twelve I am sure he never was absent for two minutes together; I am positive to the day, because he begged me to buy him a fowl for the next day, I accordingly bought him one in the forenoon of the Saturday, and hung it up in the bar, and about twelve at night he took his fowl and went home.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does he live? - I cannot say, all that I know of him is his coming to my house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your house is famous for Yorkshire ale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you speak with precision as to this being Saturday night? - Yes, I am sure it was Saturday night, because of the fowl, for I only buy them of a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Jury. What might the salesman's name be? - Kilby, he lives in Red Lion-street, and keeps a shop there.</p>

               <p>Where did you see him that day? - At a house, which I believe they call the Yorkshire alehouse, in Bloomsbury Market, I believe it is a corner house, it goes by the name of the Yorkshire alehouse; I never in my life frequented it, but I went there that day from a certain circumstance; having known the prisoner from a child, and consequently knowing his parents, I knew a younger brother of his, and he having had some dispute or quarrel with his elder brother, the prisoner, he solicited me to endeavour to make friends between the two brothers; willing to lend every aid and assistance to a youth in distress, and not having seen the prisoner, nor spoke to him for two years and an half; I took my pen and addressed myself to him, this was on the Monday, desiring the prisoner would be so obliging as to appoint me to see him, at any house that was most agreeable to him; the bearer of that letter returned to me, who is brother to the prisoner, and told me that the wrath of his brother was such that he had not opened the letter in his presence.</p>
               <p>Did the brother tell you where he carried that billett to? - Yes, to the Yorkshire alehouse, near Bloomsbury Square, and as far as I can remember at Mr. Harwood's; upon which I thought it was rather unpolite not to answer the billet in any gentleman;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230190"/> I went to the alehouse between two and three, and found the prisoner there; I continued with him in the back parlour, conversing with him about his brother, from a quarter past four till a quarter past five, or rather more.</p>
               <p>What business is the prisoner? - He is an engraver, I have employed him in his prosession.</p>

            , who were absent through illness, assembled at Lord Mansfield's chambers, and they fully discussed and considered this case; the difficulty arose from the words of the act of Parliament that I have stated; the indictment seems to be properly drawn, that it pursued the material ingredients that are required by the act of Parliament; the statute of the 23d of his present Majesty, having granted such a duty to the King of twopence upon every receipt, for a sum amounting to forty shilling and not exceeding twenty pounds; the indictment alledges that such a stamp was provided, and that the stamp on these papers that were so exposed to sale and sold by you, had a mark upon them resembling that stamp so provided pursuant to the act of Parliament: the objection therefore is founded, as I have already observed, on the supposed inaccuracy of the words in the statute</p>
               <p>"papers liable to the said duties," which in this case is in the plural number, but in this case the indictment is properly and necessarily applied to the words in question: it was objected, and asked what is meant by</p>
               <p>"papers liable to duties," and how can one piece of paper be said to be liable to any of the duties more than another? if not, then it will follow that all the writing paper in the world, may be said to be</p>
               <p>"paper liable to duties:" but the answer is, that upon due attention to the act of Parliament, and likewise to another act that passed in the succeeding session of Parliament, the 24th of his present Majesty, Chap. 7. all the Judges so assembled, were of opinion that those words</p>
               <p>"papers liable to the said duties," are capable of a clear unequivocal meaning. There are two rules for the construction of acts of Parliament; one is, that if any part is obscure, and other passages in the same act will explain that obscurity, recourse ought to be had for that purpose to such other passages: the second rule is, that if there are several acts on the same subject, they are to be considered together as one system interpreting or inforcing each other: according to those rules it will appear from a collection of the words of those statutes that the words</p>
               <p>"paper liable to the said duties" are not to be taken in the large and absurd sense that was attempted to be imposed upon them, but such pieces of paper as are destined or prepared for those uses; if genuine, they are such as by the 14th section of the 23d of

             the Third, Chap. 2. makes it penal in ten pounds, if it be not so, or unless a stamp or impression, resembling the true one does appear upon it, which is a most equitable exaction: when that exaction appears appears on the face of the paper the party taking it, being innocent or persuaded of its being duly stamped, and if afterwards the fraud is detected, every one must see that that paper being prepared, and destined for those uses, and was liable to the counterfeit mark, and ought to have been duly stamped accordingly; it appeared to all the Judges then present, that those general words in the statute, were to be applied according to the subject matter, to such papers, upon which the counterfeit mark appeared to be used for a receipt, as if the mark was genuine, and consequently liable to the duties; and all of them were therefore unanimously of opinion that you the prisoner were well convicted.</p>
