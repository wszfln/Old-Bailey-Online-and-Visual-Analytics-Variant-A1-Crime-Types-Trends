                  </hi>. I live at 10, Duke Street, London Bridge—I was formerly in the Marine Artillery, stationed at Portsmouth—on Wednesday night I came up to London—I got to the Waterloo Station about 8 o'clock—I saw the prisoner Fryer there with another man, not Carr—I had a bag with me—I asked them the way to London Bridge—I did not speak to either one, I asked them both—Fryer offered to show me the way, and asked whether he should carry my bag—I said yes, he might, and we all went to London Bridge—I had stopped at a coffee house, 10, Duke Street, before, and I wished to go there again—we went in, and I engaged a lodging for the night, and paid for it—we came out again, and Fryer went with me to the Monument—I was to have met a friend there—Fryer then asked me if I should like to hear a song—I said, "Yes," and he told me that the Cambridge Music Hall was the nearest—I agreed to go—we had a glass of ale before we went in, and I gave the man 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for carrying my bag—at the bar of the music hall I gave them some more refreshment, and 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I should not require them any more—I left them at the bar and went into the hall—I stayed there till 11.30—I saw the prisoner Carr there, leaning over the rails about ten yards from me for about twenty minutes—I spoke to him, and asked him if he would have something to drink—he said, "It is very poor drink you get here, I can show you a place where you can get better"—we came out, and went into a public-house—I gave him a glass there—we then went into another house, and had some more—I felt rather hungry, and asked him if he could show me where there was an eating-house—he said he would—just before that Fryer again met me, and we all three went to the eating-house together—they had something to eat; I paid for it—it was very near 12 o'clock when we left—I told them I wished to go to my lodgings—they told me that as they were going that way, they would show me a nearer road than what I should find myself—as we went along, Carr was on the left-hand side of me, and Fryer on the right, a little in advance—Carr put his arm round my neck and squeezed my throat very tight—I was choked for a moment—Fryer stood in front, and I felt Carr's hand put into my pocket—I felt it withdrawn, and was then violently pushed on the ground, and my head came in contact with the stones—I got up, called "Stop thief!" and the two prisoners ran away directly—it was in the centre of the road where the robbery took place—one ran on one side of the street and one on the other—I followed Carr, the one that had the money—I lost sight of him down a street, but he was stopped, I believe, by a constable—I saw him in custody—he was taken to the station, and I charged him with the robbery—Fryer was brought in after we had been at the station a few minutes—when Carr put his hands into my pockets I had some loose silver, and three sovereigns in a piece of paper—I have seen the paper and the three sovereigns since.</p>

I am a general dealer, at 100, Kent Street, Borough—on the 4th of November I was crossing London Bridge, about 2.20 in the after<lb/>noon—I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and directly cross the road—I could not well stop the gentleman, in case of losing sight of the prisoner—I gave information to a policeman, and the prisoner gave us a run from one end of the bridge to the other—he was then taken by the constable, and the handkerchief was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>.

My dear Sir, By the advice of my solictor, Mr. Frederick Farrar, I wrote to you this afternoon the letter you probably have had ere this, and I am now writing unknown to him and contrary to his express wish. He is I suppose doing all he can for me, but says that I ought not to see you, or make any sort of admission, or I shall be ruined beyond hope. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230030"/>
               <p>cannot, however, go to bed without writing far more fully; and taking a different view to him, feeling, too, to the utmost now, the awful wickedness I have been guilty of towards my dearest and best friend I ever had in the world; I cannot help seeing matters differently from Mr. Farrar; but I wish you to know I do this on my own account, and directly contrary to his and my friends' advice (excepting only my poor wife). It is impossible for me to give you anything like full particulars of the bills you require, until I can see Mrs. Hullett, who has all my letters and papers of every kind, but I will meantime do all I can from memory, and I call God to witness that to the best of my knowledge all I write is thoroughly true. In the first place, then, the only persons who hold any of these bills of any sort are the following; whether they hold them in their individual hands I know not, but they profess to:—Henry Howse, 49, Leicester Square, W.C.; Mr. Ford, or Lewis, or other names, of 17, Cork Street, Burlington Gardens, solicitor; Brandons, of Essex Street, W.C.; Ley &amp; Brocklesby, 16, Water Lane, Great Tower Street, E.C.; W. S. Meynell, 119, Warwick Street, Pimlico, S.W.; and Mr. Farrar, 6, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, E.C. These five persons are the only ones who have any bills of mine, or bills with Mr. Eversfield's name to; and I am afraid that they represent a sum of nearly 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I have had the value of at least (or nearly so) 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, but not more. I am sure Mr. Ford or Lewis (he goes by both names) has three with Mr. Eversfield's name, two for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, on which any value has been given. He has, I regret deeply to say, others on which not a farthing of value has ever been given in any way whatever, gave a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque (stopped) on one more. Mr. Meynell has the two which you wrote about in the summer, viz., one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on neither of which has one farthing ever been given. I could tell a tale about these which I hardly think you would ever believe. I was for months persuaded, and every possible inducement made, to get by any means, Mr. Eversfield's name to them. I will not repeat the arguments used, or the wicked, awfully cruel means this villain used. He promised, in the most solemn way, if I could get the name 'by any means, he did not care nor ask how,' he would pledge his word they would be at once locked up, never see light, nor Mr. Eversfield ever know about them, and much more. I was dreadfully pressed at the time, in fearful trouble—a poor young girl of a wife, two dear little innocent children actually in a semi-state of starvation and misery you can never know; but you know the rest. The moment he had them he did as he has done before with others, took steps to shew they were forged; came down to me, told me he would transport me at once, and more I cannot repeat, unless he had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get them back to me, though he never gave a farthing in any way whatever. He lived at Portsmouth at my expense, and the Isle of Wight, and got nearly a hundred pounds from me by threats; told me (which was false) that nothing would prevent your making an example of me; and when you insisted on having back the bills, as he would not part with his, suggested the way of getting over it I need say no more: to get the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had to do what you well know; but God in Heaven only can know the pressure put upon me, and the awful agony I suffered. As for Ley &amp; Brocklesby, they never gave for any one of Mr. Eversfield's bills half its value, but most there was no value for whatever, saving to 'hold on' for a time. They had money from me constantly, almost daily, at one time. They made me send them hot-house grapes, salmon, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., when they were so expensive, a diamond ring</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230031"/>
               <p>worth a great deal, my wife's jewellery, and lots besides. Their letters, taken at random, would show this. They have had in cash from me more than they ever gave, to 'hold over' for a few weeks, Sir, you cannot, as a respectable man, form any idea of the means used by all these people (excepting perhaps Mr. Farrar). My wife has a lot of their letter in her possession, and you have my authority to write to her and say I told you to ask for them, if you would like to have them as a sample of the style of thing, and I have written to say that she is to send them to you if you write for them. I gave a bill of sale to Howse; he sold up my poor home, taking the very beds and clothes from them, while I was taken off by that dreadful man Ford, and put under charge of a detective, who went everywhere with me, but I could not get down to Waterloo, but could only hear of it. Without any possibility of doing anything, and I suffered under Ford's treatment that a savage would be horrified to give anyone. Even the poor little baby's crib was sold, and the poor little thing turned out; my poor dear young wife, so near her confinement, and I am expecting every post to hear of it, and I dare not go near her, excepting only by stealth. I escaped from the detective, and am now hiding. I don't say this for pity; for I, myself, deserve none whatever; but I feel most acutely now how poor Mr. Eversfield, with his goodness, has been used by me, and my sufferings of mind are awful; were I in hell they could not be worse. With regard to your letter, though Mr. Farrar says I must not see you or your manager, I wish to say this: I shall be on Monday, at 12 o'clock, at any place you may appoint by return of post to me at the Post Office, Gower Street, W., or at the place you name in Holborn, if you still think it will be good for your manager to see me. I will give you every possible assistance in my power, so help me God! but without seeing my wife, I cannot, I tell you fairly, tell you full particulars, as I don't know the amounts; but this I do know, that the amounts really received by me do not amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I feel sure. You are perfectly at liberty to write to all parties I have named, no one else has any paper of Mr. Eversfield's, and make any inquiries, or ask any particulars, with my authority, you please. They will furnish you particulars of the bills, and then I will answer any question you like. If it were not for my poor sweet children—poor innocent little children—and my good young wife, I would say this: give me in charge, or custody, and let me pay the penalty. It would save Mr. Eversfield; and those who lent the pitiful mites of money on large bills, can afford too well to lose them; but I pray of you, I implore you, for Christ's sake! to have mercy on them. I have two dear, dear little girls, perhaps (most likely) am the father of another before now, and I cannot be near or comfort my innocent good wife; and let me say she never knew anything of this matter till I was arrested by Ford. I had kept all from her, and I call God to witness that it was seeing their faces, whom, with all my sins, I love more than all the world, starving, that first made me do this. I pray of Mr. Eversfield to have mercy on them poor children, all, for she is a child I will do all I possibly can, in every way. If he will have patience with me, I will pay him all in time. I have put myself in your hands, and wish to do so. Write by return, and say if I shall be anywhere, and whore, on Monday, to meet your manager. My solicitor knows nothing of this letter. Yours, most truly, J. Hullett.")</p>

It would be more convenient to Mr. Goodwin, from my office, to meet you in the City than in Holbom, and he will be at Messrs.

Dawes &amp; Sons, in Angel Court—he spoke to me of an aggregate of bills of Mr. Eversfield's that were in circulation, not of any particular bills—I cannot remember verbally what he said, but he spoke of the bills that he had forged in Mr. Eversfield's name—he first of all referred to his letter of the 28th; or I think it would be more correct if I were to say that I referred to it, and I said, "Can you give me particulars of the bills"—he gave me particulars, which I noted down in writing, classifying them according to the holders—I have not got that writing—I did not preserve it—I have seen it sub<lb/>sequently, but not recently—after enumerating the bills, he said, "I have behaved very badly to Mr. Eversfield, the best friend I have on earth; you had better give me in charge"—I said I had no instructions to do so, and I believed that Mr. Eversfield, on account of his family, had no wish to do</p>

Denne Park. Beloved brother in Christ. You have my consent to the proposal with regard to the bill [or "bills"]. I am glad to hear you succeeded in gaining appointment. I have, and can have, no objection to the bill being held over for three months longer. Most truly yours, Chas. G. Eversfield." "May 14. Denne Park. Beloved Brother John. In an unguarded moment you were tempted to ask assistance of me. It was thoughtless of you, I am convinced; and on that account shall be overlooked by me, in proof of which, I, under God, intend coming to spend, the day with you on Tuesday or Wednesday next, whichever you may appoint as most suitable to you. <hi rend="italic">Qui nam res agitur ito se habeat</hi>. Let bygones be bygones, and be it ours to walk in truth, 3rd Epistle John, and give our God His greatest joy always and by all means.

I am the wife of Henry Wyley, and live at 4, Park Lane, Dorset Square—I am the mother of the deceased—he was ten years old in January last—I remember his coming home from school on Monday, 31st August—previously to that time he was a strong healthy boy, and never bad a day's illness in his life, to my knowledge—he was a stout-built child—he attended St Cyprian Schools for a good many months, but I cannot say exactly how long—I spoke to him when he came home on the 31st—he had been crying very much, and seemed very low—I knew he had been crying, because the tears were all dried on his face—I asked him what was the matter, and he told me that his master had hit him a severe blow on the top of his head, that he had got such a pain in it that he could not hold it up—he sat in the room for a few minutes, then got up and went into the yard and vomited very much—he kept on vomiting, and did not go to school in the afternoon—he had gone to school that morning in his usual health; he ate a hearty breakfast, and there did not appear to be anything the matter with him—the next morning I went to his bed-room and asked him how he was—he said, "Not much better, mother"—he still kept vomiting, and complained of his head and back of his neck—the symptoms became more violent after a few days, and he seemed as if he was gradually sinking—he told me that he had not passed any urine for several days;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230037"/>
               <p>from the Friday till the Monday—MR. Baker, surgeon, saw him, and he ordered him to be put into a hip-bath, and that caused him to make water—he kept his bed for a fortnight before his death—he went to school on the Tuesday morning—he was not willing to go, but I said, "Pack of stuff, you will be all right;" and he went; that was the last time—he became much worse on the Friday, and, in consequence of that, I went to the school, but did not see the prisoner—I saw a gentleman whose name I do not know—in consequence of my communication to him and Mr. Sedgwick, a surgeon, between 5 and 7 o'clock the same day, I did not see him afterwards—I went, but he did not come to the child—I cannot say how long Mr. Sedg<lb/>wick saw him; it was a very few minutes, at his own house—on the Monday, about 10 o'clock, I saw Mr. Baker, another surgeon, and told him all the symptoms of the child's illness; he prescribed for him, and saw him twice that day, and, I think, almost every day afterwards, up to the time of his death—he died about 2 o'clock on Sunday, 20th September, as mad as a dog ever was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it an undoubted fact, that he did go to school on the Tuesday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; from the day after he received the blow, until the day of his death, he got gradually worse—the weather was not so hot, during the week commencing the 31st August, as it had been; if any<lb/>thing it was cooler; it might have been so hot as to oblige me to carry an umbrella, to protect my head and that of my son's—I always carry an umbrella in hot weather—on the Friday I sent the deceased of an errand, but it was only into Dorset Street, a few minutes' walk from where we live—I saw that he was very ill on his return, and that different symptoms had manifested themselves—it was before 8 o'clock in the morning I sent him out; he was only gone a few minutes—his brother lives in Norfolk Square, near the Great Western; I believe he went there on the Friday, about 1 o'clock; when he came back at two, he seemed to be much worse—I went in the morning to St Cyprian School, and saw the gentleman I have spoken of—I believe it was between 10 and 11 o'clock—when I saw Mr. Sedgwick, I told him that the boy complained of being hit—he put his hand on the boy's forehead in this way, and asked him if that was the place where the master had struck him—the boy said it was not, and Mr. Sedgwick then asked him where it was, and the child, to the best of my knowledge, put his hand up and said, "Hit me like this," only so much harder—I did not see Mr. Sedgwick examine the head, except in that way; I did not see him examine it all over; he told me to keep him quiet—it was before this that the lad had gone to Norfolk Square—MR. Sedgwick did not tell me that he did not find any tenderness about the boy's head—he said but very little about it—he did not say that it was the effect of the heat of the sun—he did not mention the sun at all—the Coroner's Inquest was not held in ac<lb/>cordance with the wish of either my husband or myself—I supposed it was held because they could not give a certificate for burial—I did not get any of the witnesses to go there—there were no witnesses that I know of—I am not aware that a Mrs. Jordan was examined—the beadle told me that no witnesses would be required, and we did not interfere at all about it—MR. Sedgwick was not examined.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in consequence of what was said to you on Tuesday at the school that you went to Sedgwick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the gentleman that I saw at the school sent to the clergyman, and he called at my house, and said he should like to see the child—he then men<lb/>tioned</p>

               <p>the name of Mr. Sedgwick, and in consequence of that I took him to his surgery—it is quite true that from the Monday to the Friday the lad gradually got worse, but of course I did not apprehend anything serious—on the Friday, after he had been out to buy some peas for his pigeons, he sat down and said, "Oh, mother, I have been looking at some boys flying their pigeons in Dorset Square, and I began jumping round and round, and I do not know when I should have stood still if a gentleman had not caught hold of me. Mother, I cannot look up;" and he put his hand over his eyes—he looked as white as a sheet when he came in, quite differently to what he did when he went out—on the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he merely went out for a short walk in the street—the vomiting continued every day, but I cannot say how many times—he began as soon as he got out of bed in the morning—the inquest took place on the Thursday after his death—I did not understand it when the beadle brought the summons for my husband—I said, "Oh dear; I am sorry you have not summoned me in the room of my husband, for I consider I know more about the child's death than anyone else can do"—the beadle said that no witnesses would be required on either side—the two boys, Cobb and Toms, were not called at the inquest, but I and my husband were—the prisoner was called several times, but ho was out of the way—he attended afterwards, and said that he had a witness who could be heard—the inquest was reported in the newspapers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Elijah Brown, and live at 83, Boston Place, Dorset Square—in August last I worked for Mrs. Wyley—I was at her house on the 2nd September, and noticed the little boy—he was lying with his head on his hand, on the table—he appeared to be suffering in his head—the prisoner came to my house on the 3rd September, and brought some shirts, but I did not see him on Sunday, the 6th September—he came to me and we had some conversation—he asked me if I worked for Mrs. Wyley, for if so he might get some information about the little boy—I said he was very bad, and that he had told me he was suffering from a blow which he (the prisoner) had given him—the prisoner asked me if I thought he would do such a thing—I said I did not know, but should think it very cruel if he did—he told me the boy was at school on Tuesday, the 1st September—he said, too, that he had not learnt his lessons when he came there, and he asked him the reason why, and the lad answered that he could not learn them because his head ached so from the blow which he had given him on the Monday—he allowed the boy half an hour to learn them, and the boy learnt them within the time—he then said that he remembered the time when he hit him, that he just merely tapped him on the side of the head, and he showed me how he did it, by tapping the head of my little girl—I told him the boy had said that he hit him on the top of his head, with his closed fist, and caused a pain down the back of his neck—the prisoner said that he did not hit him on the top, but merely on the side of the head—I did not see the lad again before his death—I had no further conversation with the prisoner—I saw the lad about throe times altogether—on one occasion, when I went to his bed-room, he did not seem to know anybody—he once said to his mother that he had no feeling in his fingers.</p>

               <p>firmly, to feel if there was an effusion under the scalp, because he had told me that his schoolmaster had hit him on the head with his hand—I did not find any bruise, or any indication of a blow—he complained of pain when I pressed his head—I did not find the scalp elevated from the skull—he com<lb/>plained of soreness when I pressed my hand, and also of pain through the head and neck, but there was no external mark that I could discover—he pointed out the place on his head where he had been struck—he said it hurt him when I pressed my fingers in there—I cannot account for there being no external mark—I simply mention the fact—I attended him to the time of his death—I told his mother that he was in a bad condition, not fit to be brought out, and that he ought to have been kept quietly at home—I ordered a bath and a purgative to be given to him immediately—before his death symptoms of an aggravated form manifested themselves, and they continued till he got effusion on the brain, and then he became in a comatose condition—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—I removed the scalp, but did not find any mark of external violence—on removing the skull I found that the membranes covering the brain, and at the base of the brain, were thickened—this was the result of extended inflammation—there was inflammation under that part of the skull where the deceased said the blow was struck—it was under the crown of the head, and extended down to the back of the neck—such a blow might be struck, and yet leave no external mark—in my judgment the cause of death was concussion of the brain—I mean by that, vibration of the brain sub<lb/>stance, or, as the French term it, a commotion of the brain substance; a shaking of the brain—there may be concussion of the brain without any external evidence of the actual injury—I think a man is capable of giving a blow on the head of a child, in chastisement, and produce concussion of the brain—from what I have heard and seen of the size of the prisoner, I should say that a blow like the one described is sufficient to account for the injury I found on the brain—I think concussion may be caused by a blow with the palm of the hand, as well as with the hand shut—the boy's skull in this instance was very fairly ossified, con<lb/>sidering the age of the boy—a blow of the sort given on the top of the head would be very likely to damage the brain going down to the base of the skull—the vomiting on the Monday and subsequently would be an indication of injury to the brain—vomiting continued nearly up to the time of his death—his inability to bear light, the retention of urine, and the tottering gait, indicated injury to the cerebellum, which I assumed was the effect of a blow, and which prevented him having control over the muscular actions—the effusion on the brain was the consequence of inflammation—the immediate effect of the blow would be a stunning, temporary insensibility—the laying of the head on the desk was the result of the injury—after a time he rallied, and became sufficiently susceptible to walk home—the concussion of the brain, arising from the blow, was the cause of death, in my opinion.</p>

               <p>appear to lose his senses momentarily—the dropping of the head would denote a degree of insensibility—I do not call putting his head on his arms on the desk and crying, insensibility—the tottering gait, the pain at the top of the head and neck, the constipation, vomiting, and retention of urine, are all symptoms of concussion—thirst is a symptom of sun<lb/>stroke, but I do not know that a tottering gait is—a tottering gait might be produced from giddiness consequent upon sun<lb/>stroke—pain at the top of the head and back of the neck would be a symptom of sun<lb/>stroke—it would be a symptom of cerebral irritation, which might come from sun<lb/>stroke—vomiting and retention of urine at certain periods would also be symptoms of the same—I will swear that the deceased did not die from sun<lb/>stroke, to the best of my knowledge—I certainly said, when before the Magistrate, that certain of the symptoms might arise from concussion of the brain or from sun<lb/>stroke—I said that, on removing the skull, I found that the membranes of the brain were thickened, caused by inflammation of the brain—I also said there was evidence of effusion from the inflammation, that I attributed it in the first instance to congestion, and then to inflammation succeeding that; and that external violence or sun<lb/>stroke might produce congestion of the brain—I undertake to say that the symptoms in the case of the deceased were not consistent with death by sun<lb/>stroke—all the symptoms have not been taken in—you have not included all the symptoms of the child when living—some of the symptoms you have named are consistent with sun<lb/>stroke—I knew that Mr. Sedgwick had seen the boy before I had—I did not suggest that he should be called in when I made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—cases of sun<lb/>stroke certainly have been prevalent during the past summer—there may be congestion of the lungs in sun<lb/>stroke—any red spots, or ecymosis, might have been removed by the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—I do not think the blow in this case was sufficient to rupture any large vessel in the head, but it might rupture a smaller one, disturb some nerve centre, and bring on inflammation and death—in sun<lb/>stroke a person gets giddy, falls down, and lies quiescent—he is afflicted with vertigo or dizziness.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there were symptoms present during the life<lb/>time of this boy that you should not expect to find in sun<lb/>stroke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should not expect to find the tottering gait as I find it in him—I should expect a frequent desire to pass water, which was the opposite here—in sun<lb/>stroke you find a very great acquisition of heat, the body becoming exceed<lb/>ingly hot—in this case it was not so, the body being cold and pale—again, the skin becomes rough and scaly, perspiration ceases, and the heat of the surface becomes intense to a degree—I did not find this in the deceased—if he had had sun<lb/>stroke on the Friday I should certainly have expected, when I saw him on the Monday, to find the skin rough and scaly, and the heat of the surface increased—there are some few cases in which congestion of the lungs has not been present in sun<lb/>stroke—in the ordinary course of things, I should expect to find it, but I find nothing of the sort in this case—the other parts of his body were perfectly sound—in slight cases of concussion the patient may feel giddy and confused for a few minutes only; in others consciousness is affected, and he may feel faint and weak, and unable to stand—in severe forms the patient becomes cold, and only answers when spoken to in a loud voice—the second stage, after a few minutes, commences; the circulation stops, the pulse becomes feeble, and the patient vomits—sun<lb/>strokes were prevalent in July and August, and the beginning of Sep<lb/>tember, in this year.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Park Place, Upper Baker Street, and am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries—I have been to India and China, and in those countries, as well as in England, have had great experience in cases of sun<lb/>stroke—on the evening of Friday, the 4th September, the deceased boy was brought to my surgery by Mrs. Wyley, who was accompanied by the Rev. C. Gooch, the clergy<lb/>man of the district—in consequence of an application being made to me for advice, I made a very careful and prolonged examination of the deceased's bead; in the first place, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was any lump, swelling, or sign of external violence; there was none—I then examined it with the points of my fingers to see if there was any tenderness in any part; there wasz none—I then proposed to make a medical examina<lb/>tion of the child, and I examined the tongue, the condition of the eyes, and the skin, and from the symptoms of cerebral excitement that were present, from the top of the head, and the heat generally about the upper part of the body, from the quickened pulse, from the excited appearance of the eyes, from the pain complained of at the back of the head, and generally in the head, I formed the conclusion, from the statement of the mother and of the boy himself, that he was suffering from exposure to the sun—I told the mother there was nothing to indicate to me, as a surgeon, that the child suffered from any blow—having previously ascertained that he had some constipation of the bowels, I directed her to give him a dose of opening medicine, and to keep him quiet at home, and I intimated that she might expect the symptoms would subside—before the child left my consulting-room I directed the attention of the mother to the formation of his skull, and to a somewhat peculiar projection of the forehead as being an additional reason why she should keep him at home, and not allow him to be exposed to the sun, and told her with that formation of head the child might be more liable than other children to suffer from exposure—there are two forms of sun<lb/>stroke recognized by the medical profession—this was the cerebral form, which affected the back of the neck—I have not heard anything to give me the slightest idea that there could have been concussion in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Without finding insensibility, you do not believe in concus<lb/>sion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not; in concussion the symptoms come on immediately a blow is struck—there would be a sudden interruption of the function of the brain—there might have been exposure to the sun on the Monday, causing sickness, but not amounting to sun<lb/>stroke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You cannot rely upon the condition of the urine, as showing whether cerebral excitement is due to the sun or any other cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we cannot—the tottering gait, the constipation, and the vomiting, are all consistent with sun<lb/>stroke—the tottering gait is very indicative of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230044"/>
               <p>the cerebral form of sun<lb/>stroke—retention and the increase of urine might both occur in cases of sun<lb/>stroke—I believe the child died from effusion on the brain, the result of sun-fever, which is the terra now given to what was at one time called sun<lb/>stroke—a patient may have sun-fever after being exposed to the heat of the sun, with exposure to the direct rays—I do not think he died from concussion of the brain airing from violence—numbness in the hands is very frequently the first features of sun<lb/>stroke—in this case it was very indicative, in consequence of the child being transient.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion that the blow on the top of the head had nothing to do with the child's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am; and that has always been my opinion; I say it is my opinion, that he was not suffering, directly or indirectly, from any blow received, then or at any period of his life—I was not present at the inquest, and cannot say what evidence was given by the gentleman who made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination of the body—I was not permitted to be present at the inquest—I received no notice of it—it was concealed from my knowledge—(<hi rend="italic">A letter, written by the witness to Mr. Bakery dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">was produced</hi>)—That letter is in my hand-writing—I wrote the words, "Dear Baker, I intended to have been at your inquest on the little boy, Wyley, but could not manage it"—the hour at which it was held was concealed from me—"He went, it appears, to school up to the time he was brought to me, when I advised he should be kept at home * * * he was only a little strange at the time. It was impossible to say whether the symptoms were due to the blow or to heat<lb/>stroke, to which he was exposed"—Hearing afterwards of the death of the child, it was impossible for me to form an opinion whether there might not be extravagasation of the blood subsequently, and an interruption of all symptoms previously—I have quite forgotten the circumstance of having expressed myself so decidedly in that letter, but with regard to the symptoms, as showing that death arose from con<lb/>cussion of the brain, I may say there was nothing at all to indicate that—I must admit that the expression in the letter is more doubtful than I could have been justified in stating, but with regard to the interruption of the symptoms, when we hoar of death under those circumstances, we are always aware there may be an interruption in the sequence to a certain extent—the letter was written after the death of the, child; and then, hearing the child had died, I could not be able to give so decided an opinion until after the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination had been made—we might have found extravagasation of blood, which we could not tell before—I believed it when I wrote the letter, but I say that I should not have expressed myself so decidedly, hearing that death had taken place—the next sentence, "I therefore decline to give any opinion as to the cause of the symptoms," is a mis<lb/>statement, arising from forgetfulness—"I should have been rather desirous of seeing an undoubted case of heat or sun<lb/>stroke, and thought it possible that this might have been one;"—I mean by this that I have seen a great many cases of sun<lb/>stroke, but I have not been present at a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination of a person who had died from one—the point of interest to a medical man in the case was, that hearing death had occurred, I was desirous of knowing whether it had been an un<lb/>interrupted case, resulting from an undiscovered injury during life, or not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230045"/>
               <p>—by saying that I wanted to see an undoubted case of sun<lb/>stroke, I meant a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination, as being a matter of interest to me—"Of course, the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> appearance would be vague, and, in some respects, negative;"—In the face of this I still adhere to the statement that I was desirous of seeing one case of sun<lb/>stroke, with reference to a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination of the body—I mean by "vague" that we should not be able to tell, from the appearance after death in the brain, that that was the condition resulting from any one form of disease of the brain during life, necessarily—the extravagasation of blood would prove a fact in the case that there was a blow given during life, which would, to a certain extent, show that death might possibly not have been absolutely due to sun<lb/>stroke—I mean that if I had heard there was extravagasation of blood, then that that extravagasation had been caused by a blow—that there was no extravagasation of blood is not the only reason why I think death was not caused by a blow—in this case there was an absence of any mark on the place of injury—if it had been a slight blow the marks might have disappeared between the day that the boy was struck and that on which I saw him—if there had been a severe blow it certainly would have showed itself, and I do not believe the evidence as given by the two boys—I do not think the prisoner struck the deceased in the way they have stated—the letter goes on, "The report of the case in the papers is too short, and influenced too much by local party feeling, to be of any medical value"—I mean by "local party feeling" the statement that the boy was struck at a school represented as being a Roman Catholic one—it is not a Roman Catholic school—the party feeling referred to the religious aspect which was given to it—I have attended the Rev. Mr. Gooch professionally—he passes the door of the house occupied by the Wyleys, which is near to the vestry of the church, and I supposed he asked how their son was, and then that Mr. Sedgwick would see him—the school is a district school, maintained by contributions—I had not spoken to Mr. Gooch before I saw the boy—the boy told me that the blow was given by the master with his flat-hand—the fact of the boy crying immediately after the blow showed that he was not unconscious—the signs of concussion vary according to the severity of the injury—there must be partial unconsciousness in every case of con<lb/>cussion—I do not agree with the opinion that in slight oases the patient may be merely confused and giddy for a few minutes—the sinking of the lad on the seat immediately after he was struck, and his remaining motionless for a few minutes, may be accepted as a condition of concussion—vomiting is a sign of recovery from concussion—it is the first symptom which a surgeon looks upon as the most favorable—patients vomit on recovering from unconsciousness.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you so far forgotten that you had written the letter to Mr. Baker as not to tell the solicitor or myself that it was in existence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was very anxious to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi>, because I expected to find extravagasation—the words "It was impossible to say," refer to the time I examined the boy—the difficulty of the case arose from hearing there was death, and the possibility of extravagasation of blood being found; therefore until the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination was made I declined to commit myself to an opinion; I could not feel justified in doing so—I did not receive any summons to attend the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi>—I remained at home during the greater part of the day, as I supposed they would naturally send for me when the time came—if the child had died from con<lb/>cussion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230046"/>
               <p>I should have expected to find evidence of either extravagasation of blood or ecymose spots on the brain, or one or both—effusion on the brain would be a negative symptom, and would not show anything—the child showed me how ho was hit by the master—he said he was hit like this, with the palm of the hand—notwithstanding all that has taken place, I am still of opinion that the boy died from sun-fever.</p>

               <p>quiet, and we went up stairs again—I asked Mary to fasten the back door, and I believe it was fastened—the area door was fastened at the beginning of the evening, and I did not look again—before going to bed the gas was turned off at the meter—I went to my bed-room, and Mary went to hers—my room is on the same floor as the sitting-room, only two steps lower—the window looks into the back garden—Mary's room is at the top of the house, also at the back—at that time the gas was turned off at the meter, and there were no lights at all—between 1 and 2 o'clock I was disturbed by the dog growling—he was lying on the foot of my bed—I saw a light shining through my door, which is half glass—I called out, "Mary, is that you?"—I received no answer, but the light was put out immediately—my door was a little open—I hesitated what I should do, and whilst doing that I heard a rustling noise, apparently on the stairs, going from the dining-room to the kitchen, outside my door—I was afraid to go to the door, in case someone might hurt me—the key of the door was outside—I jumped out of bed, and said, "Jip, there are thieves in the house; at them!"—I went to the window, and pulled up the Venetian blind—I opened the window, and was in the act of getting out, screaming "Murder,!" and "Police!" when someone pulled me back into the room—I can't say whether it was a man or a woman—I had a struggle—I don't remember the first blow, which must have been the one on my forehead—in the struggle I took hold of the person's hand several times and prevented many blows—I took away a knife from the person's hand—at the time I took the knife away, the person had ray wrist, and was in the act of cutting my throat—I received all the wounds on that occasion in that struggle—I don't know whether there was one or more in the house—my notion was that there were more, from the noise that was made—directly I took the knife away, they tried to make their escape—I got out of the window then—I don't know how I did get out—I recollect being found at the bottom of the garden, and Mr. Smith, a neighbour, and a policeman coming to me—when I took the knife away from the person I got out of the window with it, and kept it in my hand till I got to the bottom of the garden, and then I placed it on the wall—I told Mr. Smith where he would find it—I had left two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in a desk in the dining-room—the desk was locked—two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were missed from my desk afterwards, and the desk was broken open—there was a purse also in the sideboard drawer, which was safe the night before—it contained six or seven shillings—that was missing, and also an opera-glass—I thought there might be more than one person, from the noise that was made to get away.</p>

I was on duty about 1.55 on the 21st September—I heard the screams of a female—I was addressed by someone speaking out of 66—someone called out, "64"—I went to 64, but could not get in—I then went back to 66—I asked the person there to allow me to go through his house—it was next door—he went with me—when I got to the back I saw a female standing on the leads, at the back of the top window of 64—she was screaming then—I got out of the back window of No. 66, to the back window of 64, and then got into the house—I asked the gentleman to come in with me—he said he would fetch some-one else—I got the servant into the house myself—she was in her night<lb/>dress—I went down stain and searched the house—I waited till the gentle<lb/>men came from next door, Mr. Smith and Mr. Batchelor—we then searched the house from top to bottom—we did not find anything till we came to the dining room floor—in the dining-room the gas was burning, and the contents of the plate-basket were strewn about the floor—the door was about half open—the sideboard drawers and doors were all open—Mary Seiler then showed me her mistress's bedroom—the door was a little way open, and the back window was open—the dressing-table and all that part of the room near the window was in disorder—there was blood on the dressing-table, on the floor, and on the window ledge, and this hatchet was standing just under the window, inside the room, all covered with blood—there was no one in the room—we then went down in the kitchen—the gas was burning there, and the door was open—there was a large desk open on the floor—it appeared to have been broken open—the papers were lying on the table and on the floor—the front area door was open—I then went into the garden—there were some area steps leading on to the pavement—the door was open at the bottom of the steps leading into the house—I went into the back garden—the door was locked on the inside—I opened that, and went into the garden—I looked about under the window, but there was nothing but blood on the ground—I heard a female voice, at the bottom of the garden, say, "Here I am, if you are looking for me"—I went and found Mrs. Russell there—she was lying on the ground, partly on her right side, covered with blood, in her night<lb/>dress—she had a large cut on the neck, penetrating the ear—she had cuts and wounds—Mr. Smith was with me then, and he went directly for a doctor—I asked Mr. Batchelor to assist me to take her in, but he said</p>

               <p>he could not, and turned away—I remained there till Mr. Smith came back, and we carried her into the house—I afterwards saw Mr. Smith bring this knife from the garden—it was covered with blood—I produce a pair of boots and a cap—these boots I found covered up in the garden with the mould—the boots are marked, "1326, 59th Regiment"—the cap I found on the dining-room table—the boots were at the far end of the garden—the garden is about ten yards long.</p>

On 2nd November I was at my door, 20, Crown Court, which is about twenty doors from Golden Lane—I saw Sheen near our door by the archway, with either a stick or a piece of iron in his hand—he halloaed out, "Here is a policeman coming; here is a copper; down with the b——swine!"—I went down the court, and a tall man, named Gallagher, made a hit at the policeman with an iron bar—he took out his truncheon to defend himself, and was going to run after the tall man, but he got a blow—I cannot say who gave it to him, but I should know him if I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, and live at Mr. Chorley's, 13, Eaton Place, West—the prisoner is my son-in-law, and lived with us for rather more than twelve months—he married ray daughter—he was married from our house—it was against our wishes, but it was with our knowledge—after the marriage they left the house and lived together—they were living together on the 11th October, but the prisoner was in the country with his master then, and my daughter was staying with a Mrs. Harvey, in London—I believe they were on good terms—about 9 o'clock on Sunday night, 11th October, the prisoner came to the house where I and my husband were living in service, 13, Eaton Place—he was under the in<lb/>fluence of drink—my husband, myself, and daughter, the coachman, his wife and children, were in the kitchen at the time—the coachman and his family left—I and my daughter were then in the pantry—my husband went to let out the coachman and his family, und then came into the pantry—he told the prisoner he could not stop there, it was Mr. Chorley's parti<lb/>cular desire that he was not to stay there, and he must take his things up and be off; and he asked what he intended doing with Fanny, he had never maintained her since she had been his wife—the prisoner replied, "You can take your d——daughter and do what you like with her"—my husband said, "I mean to say, Charles, you are a vagabond"—the prisoner then struck my husband in the eye with his fist; it cut his eye open, and it bled very much—the prisoner immediately put his hand under my husband's cravat and collar, twisted him round, and threw him on his back on the floor by the side of the sink, and fell on him—it is a stone floor, but is covered with carpet—I went as quickly as possible and tried to hold the prisoner's hands—I was not quite on the top of him, but very nearly—I was quite on the floor—I got my hand over his shoulder, and held back his hands to prevent any further mischief—I was rather more lying than kneel<lb/>ing—I parted them as soon as I possibly could, and sent my husband in the kitchen and locked the door, and I locked the prisoner in the pantry—my daughter ran out and shortly returned with Mrs. Harvey and the boy—Mr. Harvey went into the kitchen to attend to my husband, and I begged and entreated of the prisoner to go away quietly, as it was a disgrace to a gentleman's house—Mrs. Harvey came back and told him it was very shocking he should serve Mr. Broke so, that he had never done him any</p>

I will murder the little b——, I will do for him yet!"—he swore several times, and was very much excited—I went for a policeman, and he persuaded him to go out of the house, and he came back again some time afterwards and demanded his wife—she was not there—he searched the house and was satisfied, and went away—I think he came back a third time that night and wished to have his keys, and wished to know where his wife was—he came again on the morning of the 12th, and asked me to go in and ask my husband to forgive him—I saw him again a night later—he was under the impression we were keeping my daughter from him, and I gave him a letter from her to read, to convince him that it was not so—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 12th and 15th October, are in the pri<lb/>soner's writing—my husband complained very much this night after he was injured—I put a mustard-poultice on him next day, and sent for Mr. Wool<lb/>mer, a surgeon, but he was out of town—Mr. Neal came on the 15th and saw him—he rallied a little, but not much, after the Monday—he was in bed on Monday, but he got up on Tuesday and lay on the sofa—he took to his bed again on the Wednesday, and did not get up again.</p>

I am a surgeon, at 18, Westbourne Place, Eaton Square—I attended the deceased from the 15th October—I found him in a state of great depression—he had a black eye, and a cut on the nose, and had great difficulty in breathing—I examined him, and had the impression that two ribs were broken—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Woolmer, and found that three ribs were broken—one penetrating the pleura and entering the lungs—the liver is what is generally called a drunkard's liver—his system generally was bad—the cause of death was congestion of the lungs and brain—the congestion in the lungs was brought on from the penetration of the pleura by the rib—but for that ho might have recovered—being a diseased man he was more liable to be taken away than a healthy person—I should say the ribs were broken by a fall such as I heard described—I don't know whether the rib was broken by the prisoner falling on him, or by the pressure of him and Mrs. Brake together—that might have accelerated it—I can't exactly say what part of the violence broke the ribs.</p>

On board the steamboat he asked if I was going to London. I said, "Yes; and then to Portsmouth, to join Her Majesty's service again." When we got out of the steamboat, at Woolwich, I told the gentleman I was going to look for my brother. I took him to the first public-house. We went into the club-room and had some ale. I then went to see if my brother had come. I returned to the gentleman and we had some half and half. I then went to the closet, and when I went back a man who was there said, "Your friend has gone out;" but he came back again. I followed him. We went to another house. I asked the gentleman if he would have anything more to drink. He said, "Yes;" and a young man who was there said, "You take this pot, and you will see a lark presently." I did not let the landlady have it, but took it to him, and he gave it to the old gentleman to drink. When I saw the colour of it I said, "We will go." I took the umbrella in my hand, and said, "If you will stand here I will go and get my box; I will join you before you get to the station. The policeman overtook me and said, "Whose umbrella have you got?" I do not deny saying that it was mine. I have always got my living by hard work. I am a private in Her Majesty's service.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230061"/>
               <p>to a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Sow</hi>, partly laden with coal—Freshwater went first, and Tullett followed—Freshwater got on board the barge, looked round for a few minutes then got into the barge's hold, and handed a large quantity of lumps of coal to Tullett, who was in his boat, and he placed them in both boats—I should think about 6 cwt. or 7 cwt. was handed out—a boat was then coming towards the barge, and they pushed away, rowed a short distance up the river, and run the boat's head on the mud close to where I was—they then threw some muddy water over the coals—they then rowed towards Blackwall—I got into my boat and followed them, and lay behind a schooner in mid-channel—as soon as they saw me shove from behind the schooner they dropped the sculls and spoke to each other a few words, and then Freshwater commenced throwing lumps of coal overboard, and the boy in Tullett's boat did the same. I rowed up to them as fast as I could, and put a constable into each of their boats, and took them to the Police Ship, Blackwall—they each had about 4861bs. of coal in their boats—there is a difference in the appearance of coal dredged from the bottom of the river and that taken from a barge—there might have been 50 lbs. of coal in their boats which had been dredged, but the remainder had not—it was only wetted on one side, where they had thrown the mud and water.</p>

               <p>a single woman—I have been living with the prisoner about seven years, but I left him for two years—he had threatened me frequently—I returned to him, and left him again in October for one night—I went to Doptford—I went back to him next day—he came to Deptford after me—ho said, "If you don't come back with me you will never go anywhere else"—on Tuesday, 27th October, I was living with him in Snow's Fields, Borough—I had breakfast with him that morning—he came home to his dinner in the middle of the day—I had no disagreement with him—in the afternoon I went to see my sister Annie, at Stanhope Street, Deptford—that was about 2 or 3 o'clock—she was not at home—I went into High Street, and met the prisoner at the corner of Hill Street, between 4 and 5 o'clock—he said, "Oh, come along, what have you stayed so long for I"—he did not appear at all out of temper—I had a pawn ticket in my hand—I had just been into a pawnbroker's to pawn a dress of mine—I had pawned a suit of clothes of the prisoner's for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on that day—he asked me for the pawn-ticket, and I gave it to him—I said I wanted to get the shawl out of pawn, and he said, "Never mind it, now; we will come down on Saturday; come home now"—I said, "Let me go down and see Mary," that is my other sister, she lived about five minutes' walk from there—he said, "Oh yes, you may go," and he walked with me—when we got to my sisters door, at least just as far as the shutters, he said, "I have got you now," and he took my boots off—I was frightened, and I can't remember that he said anything else—he took my bonnet off—he pushed me up against the shutters and the door—he had got on the coat he has got on now—the bottle was in the side pocket—it was a half-pint publican's bottle—there was something dark in it—it was a bottle something like I had seen previously—he took it from his breast coat pocket, and held it up to my face—whatever it was he poured it over me like that—it went on my head first, and then on my forehead—I put my hand up over my face, and it burnt my arm very much—I don't think he had thrown all that was in the bottle—I felt pain from it—I have marks on my forehead, my eyes, my neck; but my face, through turning round, escaped—the marks on my neck have gone away a good deal now—I have still the marks on my forehead (<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>)—I screamed out, my sister opened the door, and the prisoner ran away—I went into my sister's house—I found my hands all red, I thought I was stabbed, but it was not blood, it was from the fluid—my hair was burnt, and a lot of it came off—the prisoner took my boots and bonnet with him when he ran away—he took them off before he poured the stuff over me.</p>

I am a cheesemonger's assistant, now employed by Mr. John Cotterel—I had been previously in his service before I went to Spackman's—I think it was about May, last year, that I entered Spack<lb/>man's service, at 105, Union Street—I can't say exactly—I don't think there was any other assistant at that time—I continued in his service up till the last Saturday in December, 1867—I was there before and after the bankruptcy—before the bankruptcy, there was a very large stock of cheese and butter in the shop—about a week before the bankruptcy, I removed some of that property by Spackman's directions, and I after saw Spackman himself take things away, in the morning, in a horse and cart—sometimes</p>

               <p>cheeses, sometimes butters; there might be two, fire, or ten cheeses some<lb/>times—I saw that done of a morning—Spackman had a stable at that time in Norfolk Street, at the back of the shop—by his directions, I removed property to that stable in sacks of chaff—he ordered a sack of chaff, and cheese and butter was placed in the middle of it—it was then filled up with chaff, and I was told to take them to the stable, as he wanted to get them away without his neighbours seeing it—that happened with cheeses a great many times—I can't exactly say how many; more than half a dozen—it might have been twenty or thirty, and butter about the same, or, perhaps, not so many—I don't think there was anything else—he used to take them away again from the stable—I have seen Ball at the place—he used to come and help us at times, to help serve on Saturdays—he is brother-in-law to Spackman—I had seen him in the shop before the removal of the things—I remember taking two cheeses to Mr. Beard, and I took some to Mrs. Ramsay, or Rose, in Bird Street, West Square—I think it was a cask of butter and one cheese that I took there—I took two cheeses to Mr. Allatt's, the Montpelier Tavern, and a cheese and a cask of butter to Mrs. Franklin, and one cheese to Mrs. Twiss—I took two cheeses to my own place—I believe Ball was living in Trinity Church Terrace, about ten minutes' walk from the shop—I know a person of the name of Fielder, in Trinity Street—I brought one cheese away from there, which Mr. Spackman had left; that was on the morning of the 16th November, the morning of the bankruptcy—I met Spackman in St. George's Road, in another cart, and I gave the cheese to him—I can't say whether I saw Ball on that occasion—I believe I did, but I can't say whether it was him or his brother—on that same day, the 16th, I took the two cheeses from my own house—I met Spackman, and I gave them up to him in St George's Road—I believe somebody was with him, but I can't say who it was—it was either Ball or his brother—it was at the same time that I gave him the other things—I remem<lb/>ber two cases of eggs coming in about three days before the bankruptcy—they were removed before I went in the morning—I saw them there before I left overnight, and when I went next morning they were gone—I believe I saw one of these cases afterwards in the shop, after the bankruptcy—I saw some of them brought back—some were brought back by Spackman, and some by Ball, the prisoner—I can't say exactly how many cheeses were brought back after the bankruptcy—I did not count them—two or three lots were brought back—at one time eight or ten casks of butter were brought back—at another time two casks, and about ten cheeses at another time—I never took much notice of the time—they were cut up and sold in the shop—I was receiving wages as assistant to Spackman—I continued to receive my wages from him after the bankruptcy—he remained in the shop, attending to the business—there was no difference after the bankruptcy to what there was before—the name was altered to Ball instead of Spackman after the bankruptcy, about the beginning of December, I think—I think it was altered to "William Ball," if I am not mistaken—I saw the prisoner at the shop, at times—he did not give me any directions after his name was up—I received my orders from Mr. Spackman—he and his wife continued to occupy the house just the same as they did before—he did not sleep in the house after the bankruptcy, that I am aware of.</p>

Spackman found me out there, and wrote anonymous letters, and I was sent away—I think that was about June or July—I saw one of the anonymous letters in Mr. Randall's hand, and Spackman owned to it at the Police Court—I was then out of employment on Saturday and Sunday—I used to work at Mr. Paveys, till he got me a place at Mr. Davies's, and I then went back to Mr. Cotterall's, where I now am—these are all the places I have been to since I left Spackman's—I worked for a Mr. Benjamin, before I knew Spackman—I left him because his wages were not good enough—I was not sent away for robbing the till—I worked for Mr. Whit<lb/>look one day—I have left things at Mrs. Twiss's, at Mr. Spackman's orders—I never left anything there without his orders to be cooked for me—I might have had a rasher of bacon cooked—that was what I always paid for, my breakfast—I never took bacon there to be cooked belonging to Spack<lb/>man—I bought it of Spackman, and paid him for it—I did not go on having bacon and eggs, and different things cooked at Mrs. Twiss's till she refused to allow me to have any more done there—I did not know that she com<lb/>plained to Spackman about me taking things there to be cooked for me—I took two cheeses there for him, and I took things to Mrs. Ross, by his orders—there was no other man in Spackman's employ while I was there—I know George Newall—he used to come at times to do jobs now and then—he was not a regular man—he had been shopman previous to me—he did not remain in the employ up to the bankruptcy; only jobbing—he came once or twice a week, perhaps, up to about a fortnight or three weeks before the bankruptcy—I was never left alone in the shop—I never served without he or his wife being there—on a Sunday morning I might, perhaps, serve customers for about half-an-hour before they came down—I have never threatened Henry Doe that I would break his neck if he told about the half chesse—I know a man named Hillier—I might have spoken to him, going away from here, on a former session—I did not say to him, that I am aware of "I am sorry I ever began this"—I don't remember saying such a thing—I am very glad I have done it, to clear my own character—my brother never helped me to take the cheeses away, nor anything—I know several persons named Taylor—I don't know any man of that name who came to Spackman and said he had seen me take bacon.</p>

               <p>Kent Road—on Sunday morning, 8th November, I was in Eltham Street, Kent Street—a woman came up and spoke to me—she went away, and I was attacked by three persons—one seized me behind, placed his knee in my back, one hand was put over my mouth, another round my neck, and I received two violent blows in my face—I don't think I was knocked down—I was nearly so, but I recovered myself—I had on this waistcoat, and in it 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pair of silver-rimmed eye-glasses—when the men left me, those articles were gone—the prisoner is one of the men—I cried out "Police!" and "Thieves!" and went after them when I recovered my hat—I met the constable, Hunt, with the prisoner—I saw his face at the time I was attacked; he stood in front of me, on the right side—I have not the least doubt about his being one of the men who attacked me—I had been drinking a little, but was perfectly sober after that choking sensation—I saw the prisoner while the hand was placed over my mouth; and the moment the hand was released I began to shout out, "Police! thieves! murder!" and within a minute the constable brought back the prisoner, and asked if he was the man—I said "Yes," I was sure he was one of the men.</p>

               <p>pass any money here, or attempt to do it, it will be the worse for you"—he said, "You do not suppose, Mr. Turpin, I should attempt to pass bad money with you?"—I dare say I threw the sixpence back—I afterwards gave instructions to my assistant, Mr. Daw, and on 14th December, he brought me a bad shilling—I saw the prisoner at the bar, and said, "Now Jones, as you have brought me bad money again, I shall lock you up, as I told you I should"—ho said, "Do not lock roe up, Mr. Turpin, you know I should not do anything of the kind"—he offered to give me another; I said, "No," and gave him into custody, with the shilling.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on 28th October—I read the warrant to him, and he said, "All right, I will go with you quietly"—he said, "They may as well have brought it against me at the last sessions"—I was present at the examination before the Magistrate—I produced this document which I found on the prisoner—that is the one Mr. Dullam signed.</p>
