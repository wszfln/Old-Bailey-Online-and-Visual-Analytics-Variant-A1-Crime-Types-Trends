Lally said they were his property, and put the coat on, and it fitted him. On the next day, came the prosecutor Wyatt, and Frazier with him; they were delivered to the prosecutor. Frazier said, he put the waistcoat on at Mr. Blackwood's office, in St. Mildred's Court, and went out with that, and that Lally took away the coat and breeches; that they had them from under the pillow where the prosecutor lay, as they all lay in one room together, being to go to the East-Indies in the company's service. Wyatt swore before the justice the cloaths were his property.</p>

            . I am an officer, Lally was brought to me at the watch-house, for knocking a man down in the street, and robbing him of his hat and wig, and a 5 d and 3 d. piece, between 11 and 12 at night. In the morning, I took him to the justices, at the Angel and Crown, Whitechapel: there came the prosecutor, Levi, and others, with the cloaths; there was Frazier in the room, I took him into custody. I took him aside, and examined him. He said, he did not steal all the things, he only took the waistcoat, and that Lally took the rest, and they had sold them to one Philips, in Rosemary-lane, for 30 s. and he had 10 s. of the money, and Lally kept the other 20. I examined Lally, they both of them owned the cloaths were the property of Wyatt. Lally owned he had 20 s. of the money, but said he brought away from Mr. Blackwood's only the coat.</p>

               <p>The owner of the cloaths gave us them out of Mr Blackwood's house, to make money on. We went and sold them for 30 s. We had not come a quarter of a mile from the house, before we were knocked down, and all the money taken from us, and when Wyatt came for the money, we went back with him to where we had sold the cloaths.</p>

               <p>Mr. Honychurch. I am a watchmaker, and live at Rotherhithe; the prisoner at the bar brought this watch to me, on the 20th of October last; he said he wanted to dispose of it (producing a silver watch; deposed to by prosecutor) I bought it of him for two guineas. I was sent for to Justice Fielding, there I heard the prisoner say, he hoped the prosecutor would forgive him, and look over it, as it was the first offence.</p>

             was with me, they bid us stop and deliver what we had we told them we had no money; they began to rissle us; they looked to my shoes, and took one of my buckles out, and held it up to the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing in their hands?</p>
               <p>Worley. They had each a pistol, they unbuttoned my breeches, and wanted to see if I had a watch. When my buckle was held up, one of them said, they were Wedges; then they came and took the other; but before that was taken out, there came three more, then they took Paget's buckles out of his shoes; then Esq: Gore's chariot was coming by, they all five quitted us, and ran to take hold of the horses reins, but the coachman would not stop, and they fired two pistols directly: This was just by us, then they made off. I took particular notice of the prisoner, he stood close by me, with a pistol in his hand, while my buckles were taken from me, being one of the first two that came up. It was a man with a scarlet waistcoat, blue coat, and hat stapt all round, that took my buckles. There was a lamp just by us; as I kept looking in the prisoner's face, he said, if I spoke a word, he would blow my brains out. I am very sure he is the man. I seeing an advertisement afterwards, went to Justice Fielding; there I saw my buckles ( produced in court, and deposed to); after that I went to see the prisoner in New Prison; upon seeing him, immediately I said, that was one of the men. I know nothing against the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. from Brannon. Did you say the same as now before the Justice?</p>

She said to the other woman that came with her, make haste, and tell them to make their escape: So I stopt that woman. Then I ordered the constable to go and search the prisoner's lodgings, there he took the man at the bar; then we went before Justice Welch, and I advertised the buckles by Justice Welch's order, and the prosecutor came and described the buckles before he saw them; he mentioned a little strain which one of them had on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the women brought the buckles?</p>
               <p>Spencer. The other woman did; but said they were Blake's property, and Blake said the same, and that she came by them as I mentioned before.</p>

             M'Gennis. I am a constable, Mr. Spencer sent for me about half an hour after eight, and gave me charge of the woman. I put her in the round-house. I heard her order the other woman to go to her room, and bid the men make their escape, or to come and blow our brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her words?</p>
               <p>M'Gennis. She said, I am taken and stopt upon the buckles, make all the haste you can; and tell the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070005"/> men to make all the haste they can out of the lodging. When I came back I went as we had appointed to meet Mr. Spencer at Justice Welch's; the Justice ordered me to go for one of my brother constables, named Langrey, and search the woman's lodgings. The other woman directed us to the house of M'Dearman, Buckridge Street, St. Gyles's, we went there: The woman bid me take care of myself, saying, if there were six of us we should not be able to take them. We took Mr. Scott and Mr. Carlisle with us; we saw the prisoner lying on the bed with his clothes on, through the key-hole. I cried, Jack, open the door; he would not answer; then I forced the door; open, we all four took hold of him; in searching the bed I found a pair of silver buckles; we found a brace of horse pistols loaded in a little closet near the bed, and two silk handkerchiefs lying with them.</p>
               <p>Paget. Those buckles and one of those handkerchiefs (produced in court, taking them in his hand) were taken from me the night I was robbed.</p>
               <p>M'Gennis. I found a jacket in the room, with some loose gunpowder in the pocket.</p>

They would not let him be an evidence at Hicks's Hall. He has stopt his wife, that he has had five children by, in Clerkenwell prison; he said, he could hang his wife as well as he could hang me; and, if he will hang his own wife, he will hang me and two or three more.</p>

             and me came out of Horselydown, where he lives, and went to the house where the things were.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Stevenson?</p>
               <p>Williams. He is no business, he goes upon the highway and the like, and that is what he was tried for.</p>
               <p>Court. Begin and tell your story; what you have to say?</p>
               <p>Williams. On Thursday, the 20th of October, he came to my house two or three times in Kent-street, and asked for me: I denied myself once, and got out into the garden; he came again and found me at home, and we got to drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070006"/>Williams. This may be two or three days before this robbery, he has drank with me at several houses in Kent-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your conversation?</p>
               <p>Williams. We talked we would go together a house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was this you had this conversation at?</p>
               <p>Williams. We had been together all the day at the Red Cow, in Kent-street, and walking up and down to see what we could get at night, looking at goldsmiths shops, to see what hung in the windows; then we went into the Fore-street, Wapping, about 11 at night; we had been walking there before, and saw what hung in the windows, and had in the day mentioned going there.</p>

               <p>Q. Which mentioned it?</p>
               <p>Williams. I did to him. I had not seen the silver spoons; but I said to him there is a parcel of watches hung up in the windows; we drank at a house by the water-side, then we walked to and fro; we observed the window of this gentleman's house, we saw a light go up-stairs and down again; after 12 we began to work, and bored the shutters as full of holes as we could, with a gimlet.</p>
               <p>Q. Which bored the holes?</p>
               <p>Williams. I did most of them, he stood at the door to listen whether any body was coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you bred to?</p>
               <p>Williams. My father was a shoemaker, but I never learned any trade. The prisoner and I had each a sharp knife, and I cut away as fast as I could, till we could get an arm in; he got mud out of the kennel to blacken it, that the watchmen might not see it. Then I took a handkerchief, and wrap'd it about my hand, and pushed in a pane of glass; then he put his arm in, and broke a show-glass, and took out some silver teaspoons tied up in parcels, and gave them to me, and I put them into my pocket; he took out three silver snuff-boxes, and a load-stone, and a little pair of scales and weights in a box; he might take out more, and put them in his pocket, unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be about this affair?</p>
               <p>Williams. We might be better than two hours about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see no watchmen?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, the watchmen and patroles and other people past by; but there is a back street, and as they were coming, we got out of the way, and then returned again. When we had got what we could, we went off, and sold all the things to

               <p>Q. What time in the morning?</p>
               <p>Williams. It might be before day-light; I sold them, and Stephenson staid at Darkhouse-lane the while.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that Stephenson did not go with you to Abraham's.</p>
               <p>Williams. Abrahams is so knowing, he would not buy goods, if two men came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Abrahams keep a shop?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, he did, and sold cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Williams. He is about 35 years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever trade with him before?</p>
               <p>Williams. He has had goods of me two or three times, which we got at other places. Stephenson said he wanted a couple of tea-spoons for his own use, and I gave him those two spoons out of my own hand, when we got into his own room. Two or three days after, he shewed me them, and said he had filed the mark out of them: I know he has got a file for that purpose: these are two which we had at the prosecutrix's house; the prisoner was taken out of the same house I was, with firearms and a long piece, which we took from a house we broke open in the county of Kent.</p>

We told him Williams had charged him: he said Williams could not hurt him, and that if he had been a thief, he should not have been so ragged as he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Williams said, in Clerkenwell-prison one night, that he never knew me in his life, no farther than seeing me in prison, when he was there himself 2 or three sessions ago, and wanted some prisoners to swear he was mad, for he did not know what he did. I was abroad in his majesty's service, and served him 13 years, pretty near 6 of them were abroad: coming home, I took up with a young woman, and lived with her: those spoons belong to her: I do not know any thing of them: I have seen her have them several times. Williams said, Brebrook made him drink, and persuaded him to swear to me.</p>

He said, if I made any noise, he would knock my brains out, and took something up and throwed at me as I lay on the ground. A man and his wife called out at a window; then he made off, and threw my hat away, seeing the watchman coming, and said, D - n you, there's your hat; I went and took it up about 10 yards from where I lay. The prisoner was taken up the next day, and offered any money to be let go away; he was carried before the justice, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070008"/> I gave the same account as now: he owned there that he had the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he demand any thing of you?</p>
               <p>Owen. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in that house he came out of?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any women at the door of that house?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, the man that was with me, was very much hurt.</p>

            . I live in Buckle street. Upon hearing murder and watch called, I went and opened my window, and saw the prisoner beating the prosecutor on the ground; there was another man there, but he made off in an instant: it was right against my window. The prosecutor got up, and said, Stop thief, I have lost my hat; the prisoner flung it away, and said, if you make any noise, I'll take a brick and knock your brains out, he spoke that as to himself. He took up something, whether a brick or a stone, I know not; he flung it at the prosecutor, but it missed him; he then made off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thorp. I heard murder called in a very lamentable manner, I went out of my own door, and stopt the prisoner; he asked what he had done? I said, if you have done nothing but what is right, you will be let to go again; he made a slender excuse; he pretended the prosecutor and his companion had hit a window-shutter with a stick, which brought him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they had broke a window?</p>
               <p>Thorp. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of October, I had been at Rumford Market, I left the market-place about seven in the evening, and went towards home; my father lives in a court in the Minories; going along Buckle-street, I went in at the Bunch of Grapes; there was a pot of beer on the table; I sat down, and in about half an hour, somebody coming by, hit their stick against the window shutters: I went to the door, and said you have broke the window, I hope you will make recompence for the damage done. Mr. Owen said, I'll knock you down, if you don't go away; he had a stick in his hand; I laid hold of that, we both fell down; after that he followed me with the stick, attempting to hit me; we got to pulling one another about for 7 or 8 minutes, the other man calling murder at the same time. I said to the landlord, I would go and call a watchman; for they were breaking the windows. I went to the watchman, and said, Come and take charge of a man for breaking the windows; then they gave him charge of me, for striking him and his companion. I went with them readily to the watch-house, and Mr. Owen was so drunk that he made a disturbance all the night there. I was in the Bail-dock. The next morning we went before Mr. Pell at the Angel and Crown; he asked him whether I demanded his money; he answered, no In the evening Mr. Owen and Mr. Roberts came to Clerkenwell to me, and said, if I had not charged them with breaking the windows, they would not have appeared against me. He said he would go home and drink with my mother, and discharge me in the morning.</p>

I turned down the Old Jury; he turned back, and ran to me, and catched hold of me, and held me a few minutes, and kept me so as to prevent my crying out. I endeavoured to get from him, but could not disengage myself from him till he let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer any violence to you?</p>
               <p>S. Rice. He did not; he kiss'd me when he laid hold of me. I am sure I had my cloak on when he laid hold on me; it was united; and his behaviour frighted me a good deal, so that I am not capable of knowing whether the prisoner is the man or not; neither am I certain that he took it. He ran cross Cheapside, and I after him, crying, Stop thief. I did not stand to see whether it had fell where he stopt me. The prisoner was taken at the top of Bucklersbury, just at the corner of the Poultry.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the man in your view till taken?</p>
               <p>S. Rice. No, I lost sight of him as he cross'd the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to look at the place where you miss'd your cloak?</p>
               <p>S. Rice. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he was taken?</p>
               <p>S. Rice. He said he knew nothing of it, he was running after the company. All I can say is, it was a man about his size, and he had a light-colour'd coat on.</p>

            . I was coming home that Sunday night in company with my wife; it wanted something of 9 o'clock; as we pass'd the end of King-street, we were remarking how thin the street was of people. When we got past Mercer's chapel, we heard the cry, Stop theif. I stood to listen which way the voice came, and saw the prisoner cross the way from the end of the Old Jury: he salter'd, and was almost down when he got cross (I believe his foot might take a stone): he felt down, and there I laid hold of him. He asked me what I stopt him for? Said I. you are in the hand of a constable, and I'll see what you are charged with. The prosecutrix came up, and charged him with taking her cloak from her. I said, go the way he came, and see for it. I believe six or seven people went down the Old Jury to look for it: nothing was found: he was searched, and nothing found upon him. I asked him why he ran; he said he was running after a friend; but there was no other person running in the street at that time.</p>

               <p>Jos. Williamson. On the 24th of November I was coming from the Mitre Tavern in Fleet street; I am not sure whether the clock had gone 12 or not (I am <rs id="t17631207-10-viclabel53" type="occupation">servant</rs>

About eight or ten yards before he came to me, he clapt his hand cross his breast, and gave a shove with his elbow, I suppose with intent to shove me down, as he came by me. I did not fall by that shove. He said to me, D - n you, you son of a bitch, what do you mean by that? as much as if I had shoved him; and before he gave me leave to speak, he up with his fist, and hit me under my left ear, and knocked me cross the kennel; he took my hat, and ran cross the way: it was some time before I recovered myself; I got up, and heard somebody on the other side the way, cry, Stop thief. I called the same; the watchman immediately pursued him; my hat was taken up at the lower end of Fleet market. A gentleman that cried, Stop theif, came from the other side the way, and said, Young man, you seem to be very much slury'd by the blow, and he took me into the Punch-house; he went out, and came in again, and brought me my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Williamson. No, he is not. I was told the man was taken; then I went to the watch-house door; the prisoner was there: he said, D - n you, you rascal, if you have lost your hat, pray where is mine? (the hat produced, and deposed to) I rather think this hat fell from my head by the blow, than that he took it from my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Williamson. I was very sober. I thought he might be somebody in the neighbourhood, seeing him without a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he had not a hat in his hand?</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>James. This was as I began to go upwards, calling the hour twelve: returning again, I saw him and Mr. Williamson tusling together, and Mr. Williamson fell. I was at some distance, and did not see the blow given: I saw the prisoner take up the hat, and pursued him directly, and collar'd him; he threw the hat away behind him: I said, I had seen him without a hat. He asked me whether ever I had seen him without one before? I said no, not till then.</p>

               <p>James. He had a wig on when I took him; he said, where is my hat: said I, you have taken the gentleman's hat. Said he, I have lost mine, then I looked, where I observed his hand to have moved, and saw the prosecutor's hat lying 5 or 6 yards from him, it was a little dirty; this was at the bottom of the market.

               <p>Dodd.

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I was serving behind the counter about a quarter after eight o'clock that night. I saw two cheeses move from the shelf; I came from behind the counter (which is the opposite side the shop, my face was towards the shelf); there then was only they two on the pile; I ran out at the door, seeing them go out at the window, and followed the prisoner, who had got about 10 or 12 yards, and saw him put something under the flap of his coat. I went before him, and said, Friend, where are you going with them cheeses, and tapped him on the shoulder? He said, no where, only in a joke. I called him, and brought him into the shop, and took the two cheeses from under his arm. These are the same here produced; I am certain they are my master's property. I took him into the counting house, and sent for my master; then the prisoner said, Lord bless me, what have I done this for! a man put the cheeses into my hand as I was standing at the corner.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of last month, I was drinking at the Dolphin, in Honey-lane Market, till about 20 minutes after eight at night. I went home; a man that lodges in the house of Mr. Leven, said, James, I should be very much obliged to you, if you had come home sooner, and gone of an errand for me; said I, I'll go on an errand for you ten miles, if you want it, or for any body else; said he, carry these slides, belonging to a watch. to such a man in Holborn. I set out with them about 20 minutes after eight, and came opposite to Warwick lane; there I stopt to make water, and was buttoning up my breeches; coming out of the passage, a man said, be kind enough to lay hold of these two cheeses for a moment. Immediately I mist him; I had them not a minute in my hand before the man came and laid hold on me, and said, What are you doing with these cheeses? Said I, I am holding them for a man that is making water, or casing himself. I had been but five minutes out of our own house, before that man took me into his house: There were three more cheeses found in a house on the outside Newgate, and two others under Newgate. I never went out of our house till 25 minutes after eight o'clock.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070012"/>Mr. Dodd's brother went to another shop, and wanted the man to swear I was the man that left three cheeses there; the man said, he could not swear, whether I was or was not the man; there were two cheeses left under Newgate; he could not swear that I was the man that left them. My Lord would not hear any character of me; I had as good a character as any man in the world. I have been seven years to serve his Majesty, and am a freeman of the city of London; I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

I saw her pass by me again, out of the shop, with something in her hands, holding them both together; I supposed them to be the two boxes that contained the money; in about five minutes I saw her return again in the same manner. I heard her go to the desk again, and then return out of the shop; as soon as she was gone, we counted the money; my partner and I had before counted it, and marked 10 s. of it; there was to the value of two guineas in one box; one guinea, one half-guinea, and 10 s. and 6 d. and 2 s. in another, in silver and halfpence; out of those two boxes there were missing, 5 s. and 8 d. We missed out of the box, where the guinea was, 5 s, and 8 d. in half pence out of the other; then we locked the desk, and, in the morning, had a search warrant, and found 3 s. that were marked, upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you mark the money?</p>
               <p>Konmacker. We filed a little notch on the edge, in the milling, towards the head, on them. (The money produced, and inspected by the jury.) At first, she said, she had nothing by her but her own money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been servant in the family?</p>
               <p>Konmacker. She had been servant there between nine and ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you use to lock that desk?</p>
               <p>Konmacker. Very seldom.</p>

After three weeks and three days, I had the door broke open; then I missed the sheets and pillowbier: I afterwards was told by my baker, he was in New Prison; I went there and saw him; I asked him for the key of my door; he said, the constable in White chapel had it: I asked him for my sheets and pillowbier; he said, they were pawned, first for 8 s. and after that he had sold them for 10 s. to a pawnbroker, in Golden-lane, near Old-Street Turnpike. I went and got a search warrant, and found them at Mr. Kent's, a pawnbroker there; he said, he took them in all together; and the prisoner owned, he wrapped them round his body, and so carried them out of my house, and pawned them all together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kent. When the prosecutor came, I delivered the pair of sheets and pillowbier to him: I had them of the prisoner on the 8th of October; he said they were his own; that he had been an officer on board a ship, and he was going to sea again, and he would sell them out right: so I bought them of him for 11 s. he had before used my shop, and had the appearance of a gentleman: I did not suspect his stealing them.</p>

They all came from behind a butt, by a tree: he said, D - n his eyes, knock him down; he never touched me. My money was in my waistcoat pocket, half-pence and silver together; the first man that laid hold of me, searched me; he took and stripped my waistcoat pocket open, and took-out 3 s. 6 d. in silver, and the rest in half-pence, 6 s. and 7 d. 1/2 in all; after that, they took up my apron, and clapt their hand upon each thigh, and asked if I had any more? I said, I had no more in the world. Then one of the men that was going away, said, D - n his eyes, give him 3 d. to carry him home, and instead of that, they gave me a groat, which I carried home in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, which you imagine to be the prisoner, seem to be in their company?</p>
               <p>Bird. He did; and afterwards they went all cross the road together; but it being so dark, I could not be positive of the man's face; I suppose it to be the prisoner, by his frock and his hat, an old cock'd up hat, and a brownish frock, like that he now has on. After this, I was drinking with some coopers, at the Ship ale house, the bottom of Nightingale-lane: they asked me, which way I was robb'd? I told them, and described the prisoner; one of them went out, and fetched him in to me. I said, I believed, when he came in, him to be the man, to the best of my knowledge, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070015"/> he said, he never saw me that night, and could bring good witnesses where he was at that time, and offered to go to Justice Scott's directly, and went to the door, but Justice Scott was not at home. After this, he was going to work again.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is he?</p>
               <p>Bird. He is a cooper by trade; he works in the cooperidge near the place where we were: after that, one Newton insisted I should take him up. He was, and the next day taken before Justice Berry, who committed him to Newgate; when he was taken, he had the same sort of a hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light near where you was robb'd?</p>
               <p>Bird. There was a lamp near me. It was not above 5 yards from me, when I stood between the posts.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that lamp afford you such light, so as to distinguish his person?</p>
               <p>Bird. I did think it was he; I was positive it was the same frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the prisoner was the man?</p>
               <p>Bird. I would not for all the world swear he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other witness?</p>
               <p>Bird. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of your house was broke?</p>
               <p>Stanley. To a window in a little back room are siding sashes, and on the outside are iron bars that cross each other, some upright, and some are fixed cross them, which makes square holes in them. In the morning, I found the sash was drawn back, and they made shift to get between the bars. They were not displaced.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does that window open to?</p>
               <p>Stanley. It opens into a yard, and there is a door that opens into Bell-alley, but that has been nailed up 3 or 4 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window on the ground floor?</p>
               <p>Stanley. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sashes fastened?</p>
               <p>Stanley. No, there is no fastening to them; I imagined the bars were security enough.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is the window?</p>
               <p>Stanley. It is about four or five feet wide, we found the cupboard in the bar broke open, that is in the tap room, about 4 or five yards from the window. I miss'd my plate, the same as mentioned in the indictment. They were taken from out of the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your plate last?</p>
               <p>Stanley. I saw it over night. I made some brandy and water in the pint mug just before I went to bed, which was about 10 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your cupboard door?</p>
               <p>Stanley. It was locked over night, but was forced open; there were two folding doors to it, where I kept my books, plate, and spirituous liquors.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were the iron bars asunder at the window?</p>
               <p>Stanley. I think the holes were 8 or 9 inches square. I desired two of my neighbours to try them, and they being thin men, they both got through them. I advertised the things. Some of my neighbours came and told me, the prisoner, from a starving condition, was seen to have some money; so I went after her to shiperton, near Windsor, hearing the coachman had carried her there the day after this was done; there I took her at her mother's house; nothing being found opon her, she was cleared. This was on a Friday in last sessions, and the Thursday after she was stopt with the silver mug. I went to her in Wood-street Compter; there she ordered the goal-keeper to write me a note, to direct me where to get the spoons and things; that I should find some in a washing-tub, and the others in a lye-tub, at her mother's back door, at Shiperton. Then I and

She told us, she got over into the yard, by the help of a nail in the wall, which she put her foot upon. I went along with Mr. Stanley, and saw the other plate found in the tubs, as he has mentioned.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Stanley. I know this plate to be our property (produced in court). I am always the last up. I saw this plate in the bar over night, before I went up stairs to bed, about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no shutters to that window?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stanley. There is none, only sliding sashes; one, one way, and the other, the other. They were both shut when I went to bed. I went to see the prisoner when in Newgate, and asked her how she came to do it? She went on her knees, and cry'd, and said, she had no stays on, and went throw the bars very easy, and had nobody to help her. after she got over the wall, by the help of a nail.</p>

There being some sheep fat advertised on the Tuesday, I went as it directed, on the Wednesday, to the house of Mr. Blandford, in Featherstone-street. Bunhill-row; there I found some fat, but cannot say it was mine.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Barr. I found a sheep dead on Monday the 14th of Nov. between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, in our field; it was my mistress's property; I carried what was left of it home; it was so far skinned, as to take the hind part away with the fat; the fore part and the whole skin was left: it was not a very fat sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it seem to have been fresh killed?</p>
               <p>Argell. It might hav e been killed a day, it was cold.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it before?</p>
               <p>Argell. I saw it on the Thursday before; there were 15 of them in all, the rest were all there.</p>
               <p>Job Blandford. I live in Featherstone street, and keep a tallow-chandler's shop. On the Tuesday morning, about 10 o'clock, the 15th of Nov. the prisoner came into my shop, with a bag in his hand, and asked me if I bought suet?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Blandford. I never saw him before, to my knowledge; he put his bag on the counter, and shewed it me. I said, what is the price? he said, two pence half-penny a pound; he asked under the market price. It appeared to me to be the contents of the inside of a sheep, the caul-fat, the gut-fat, and kidney-fat. I saw some appearance of grass amongst it; I suspected it was stolen out of a grass field. It was not a very fat sheep; the kidneys were particularly thin in the fat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was fat worth at that time?</p>
               <p>Blandford. It was worth something more than 3 d. a pound. I asked him, how he came by it? he first mentioned some gentleman's name that lived on the farther side of Islington, that he brought it from there. I asked him. how he came to bring such fat as that from a gentleman's house? In 5 minutes time he said, he and another man bought it between them, to fell to get some soap. After that he said he bought it of a man in Islington Road. When I found he varied so much, and he was gathering his bag up in order to carry it somewhere else, I having a servant in my cellar, I said, I can't see that I can well weigh it in these scales; I made as if I would go for some scales, and call'd my man up, and got a constable, and took him and the fat to Hick's-hall to the Justices: there he stood to it, that he bought it of a man in Islington Road, and offered to send for somebody to his character, but he declin'd that.</p>
               <p>Q. How much fat was there?</p>
               <p>Blandford. There was 14 pounds and a half, bag and all; and I weigh'd the bag afterwards, and that weigh'd a pound and an half.</p>

               <p>I was going to Islington to look for some work. a man met me, and ask'd me if I would buy some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070017"/> sat, saying, he would sell it cheap; so I bought it.</p>

Alvares brought the watch; I took it of him. He said he had known the prisoner some time, and was very sure it was the prisoner's watch; upon which I lent him the money, 27 s. upon it. The prisoner said, that his father was dead in the country, and it was his watch, and he had left it him; and that was the last thing he had of his father's, and he hoped to have it again soon.

            . I am the officer that took the prisoner out of bed on the 29th of October in the morning (he lodged with Mr. Tuck, within about 50 yards of where the watch was taken from) on the account of another watch. I asked him whether he had been guilty of any other fact? he said, yes, he had stole a young man's watch that worked at Mr. Sambrook's, and had pawned it at Mr. Peacock's. I asked him what he had done with the money? he said, he had but very little of it; that Mr. Aaron Alvares went with him to pawn it, and coming back Alvares took him into a bawdy-house: that Alvares spent a guinea of it in ale and cakes, and gave him but 4 shillings and a penny, and that Alvares had all the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Alvares. When we came into Goodman's-fields, the prisoner would go into a house there: the first thing he did, he called for a bottle of wine. I said, as you intend to buy some cloaths to your back, you had better save your money. He was surrounded by five or six women, and went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070018"/> stairs with one of them. I said, young lad, don't make yourself a fool; you will not have a farthing left to go into the country with. He began to call for wine: the reckoning soon came to 10 s. he put down a guinea on the table; after that I saw he was in liquor. He got out into the street, and pull'd off his cloaths to fight some man in the next room. I went from him to go home: he would not go, nor take the money; so I took it. I went after that to look for him, and met him with a girl in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you take?</p>
               <p>Alvares. I put a quarter guinea and 4 s. and 6 d. in my pocket. The people wanted him to stay all night. I said, don't make a fool of yourself. He would stay all night. I said, come to me in Abel's Buildings for your money: I met him there, at the corner of the buildings, and delivered him his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a sworn broker?</p>
               <p>Alvares. I am, on the Royal Exchange - No, I am not; my father was; I acted under him, when he was living.</p>

All the while we were there he spent my money. He gave me 4 shillings and a penny; that was all I had out of the guinea.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ever since he was a child. When the poor creature came to town, destitute, he having a first cousin who lived servant with Major Collins, he lay at my house on nights, and had his victuals at the major's in the Tower. I never heard any ill of him before: I really believe he was drawn away by this bad company.</p>
               <p>Alvares. Here is a servant of mine that was in company, please to examine her; her name is

            . I have lived servant with Mr. Alvares about 8 months.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He is a 'change broker. He sent me to a public house, the White Lyon, for a pot of beer, for supper; while that was drawing, I sat down by the prisoner at the bar: the prisoner said to me, he had got a watch in his pocket, and he would pawn or sell it, if I would go and lie with him all night. I told him, I was no such person. He said he would give me the money, whate'er it came to, either by pawning or selling. I happened to stay till Mr. Alvares came for me; I told Mr. Alvares what he said. He told Mr. Alvares he would sell or pawn it to get some cloaths. They went out together, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q Where was Mr. Alvares when you went out for the pot of beer?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He was at home.</p>
               <p>Newton. I verily believe Mr. Alvares is greatly more to blame than the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Cook. He has a white spot on the saddle-mark, about as big as a half crown, on the off side. I went about the country, and not finding him, I advertised him on the 1st of Nov. On the same day, I was told there was some reason to suspect the prisoner; he came down that very day fortnight I lost the horse.</p>

            , at Barnet; I saw him at the sign of the Harrow, and asked him where he lived now? he said, in Kent, and that he was just come out of Northamptonshire, and we knew that he was in London all the week before. I got a warrant and took him up, and on talking to him, he told us where the horse was sold in Kent, at a place called Chipset at the Cock, within 2 miles of Seven-oaks: he did not know the man's name. I went down, and upon enquiring, found that the man that bought the horse, was come up to London with him. I found the horse in a field by Kent-street road, in the possession of Mr. Lutham: this was a fortnight and 3 days after we had lost him. I told Mr. Lutham it was my horse: he said if it was, I might have him. The prisoner after that, told us, he drove the horse up against our field gate, and catched him, and sold him to that man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070019"/> between seven and eight in the evening. This was in my hearing, before Justice Hassel.</p>

            . I set out from the Borough to go to Chipset, on Friday the 28th of October, at 5 in the morning, with another person. The prisoner kept us company all the way. We lay at a place called Lock's-bottom; there I bought this gelding of the prisoner; it was the horse he rode on.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that place from London?</p>
               <p>Lutham. It is about 12 miles and a half from London; the prisoner said he was going to Tunbridge. He said the horse cost him five guineas, that he bought him to go a smuggling with, but he was going into place again, and was willing to sell him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for him?</p>
               <p>Lutham. He ask'd 5 guineas; at last we agreed for 2 guineas and a half, and paid for him at the Cock at Chipset: the same horse Mr. Cook came and own'd in the field by Kent-street road. After I paid for the horse, the prisoner gave me this receipt; he said his name was Williams; he could not write, but made his mark by that name.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>

            , Esq; I have known the prisoner about 12 years; he was servant to my brother about six years, or rather better, at Barnet; he left my brother's service about five years ago, and came to me; he lived with me about six months, till I went abroad, and I left him behind. I always had an extreme good character of him, as a very honest fellow: my brother recommended him to me as such, and I found him so; he was trusted at my brother's with horses and things, and with me with every thing I had. My going abroad in the government's service, was the cause of my leaving him; I recommended him to Mr. Danser, a surgeon, at Barnet; this was in the latter end of the year 58. Mr. Danser gives him an extream good character, and would have attended here if possible he could, but as the trial was very uncertain coming on, he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been returned to England?</p>
               <p>S. Seers. I have been in England about eight months; the prisoner came to me about 10 days before he was taken up, and told me he was out of service; I told him I would take care and get him a place. Was he at liberty, I really would take him into my service now.</p>

            . The prosecutor lodged at the same house which I do at present, the Ship in Wapping, so did the prisoner; he absconded six weeks ago to-morrow: as soon as he was taken up, he confessed he had taken 3 s. out of my chest, my property, and that he borrowed Mr. Werge's watch to seal a letter, and afterwards sold it for a guinea and half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any money out of your chest?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I know I lost 3 s.</p>
               <p>Henry Hall. Campbell own'd to me that the watch was safe enough; I went with him in order to get it; he made a break away from me, and was taken again, I carried him before the Justice, but we never could find what he did with the watch.</p>

               <p>I borrow'd the watch to seal a letter; I put it in my pocket in a hurry, and forgot to return it; I met with two or three men that made me in liquor, and they got me to pawn it for a guinea and half.</p>

Hallet said he had a piece of spun yarn in his pocket, which he made fast to the tobacco, and carried the other end to the under part of the deck, near the fore-scuttle; and, in the night-time, between nine and ten o'clock, he took an opportunity, and broke the scuttle, and hauled the tobacco up out of the hole; the hatches were all locked down; the tarpauling was over the scuttle, so that we could not discover it.</p>

            . I am mate of this ship. On Sunday morning the 11th of November, I went on board; the people there said there had been thieves on board. I took a candle and looked about the vessels; there were none broke on the Saturday; I saw a quantity of tobacco was gone, about 20 or 30 pounds. On Sunday morning, I went in search of the two prisoners, who were gone that morning: I took Hallett, who told me there were more concerned than himself. He told me where he had disposed of it, and shewed me the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to do for him in return for telling you?</p>
               <p>Steward. Nothing at all. I told him he should go along with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he expect not to be prosecuted for telling you so?</p>
               <p>Steward. I suppose he understood he was not to be prosecuted. On the Sunday night, I acquainted the captain with it, (I had let him go) the captain thought proper to take him up, and carry him before the Justice, and there he confest the same. When Herring was taken up, he confess'd he was concerned, but he said but little Hallet said Herring was as much concerned as he was.</p>

The prisoner lived with me as a common servant in the house; about the latter end of October, I think, we found out things being taken; I am not certain when they were taken, others in the house suspected the prisoner, but I did not myself, till within a week of what happened; I had unlocked a drawer in my bureau, and left the key in it; when I came into my room at night, I saw the key there; I opened the drawer, and missed a guinea; I knowing no body had had any business there but herself; I went down and told it below.</p>
               <p>Q. How many maid-servants do you keep in the house?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. I keep only one.</p>
               <p>I was afraid then, she was not so good as she should be; I was fearful of taking her character away, as I had a character with her; her bed-fellow took an opportunity to take her key of her box at night, and brought it to my sister that lives with me. In the morning I was told, my sister had opened the prisoner's box, which stood in a garret, up four pair of stairs (the prisoner lay with a journeywoman, up two pair of stairs; I then went to my brother to advise with him, what I had best to do; he said, as things of mine had been seen in her box, that were of a considerable value, I had better send for a constable, and have the box opened; I did, and, when it was opened, the things had been removed out of it; there was a long-lawn apron of mine found in it; I then talked with her, and, with a great deal to do, she fetched the things to me from where she had put them; she would have delivered them to me, and I refused to take them; then she delivered them to the constable: they were all pinned up together.</p>
               <p>Q Where did she fetch them from?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. She fetched them from out of the room where she lay; the bundle was opened in my presence; there were every thing that is laid in the indictment, except the lawn-apron, and two or three trifling things.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention them?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. A pair of silver tea-tongs, four muslin-aprons, a silk-apron, five muslin-ruffles, two gause handkerchiefs, two linnen-caps laced, three yards and a half of lace, three yards and three quarters of gause eight yards and a half of lace; sixteen yards of lace, four yards of silk-ribbon, ten yards of persian silk, one dimity robe for a child a remnant of crimson sattin, a pair of child's shoes, and a fan; when I went for the prisoner first, I told her, my sister had seen these things in her box; at first she denied it very strongly, but afterward she did acknowledge all that was in that bundle were my property; at first, she said nothing of the guinea, or that ever she took any thing that belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you suppose she stole them from?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. She acknowledged, she took the best of the lace from off the counter, while my sister was serving a customer.</p>
               <p>Q Mention her words as near as you can recollect?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. She said, she came down for some thing, and took one of the cards of lace; the rest of the lace we think she took, as it was carried up for work: There were some things in wear, some I believe she took out of my drawers, and out of the soul-bag; when I once went out, when I came to the end of my journey I missed an apron, which I knew I had laid out, in order to take with me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been a quarrel between the prisoner and the rest of the people in the house?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the apron you saw in her box was after the key had been taken from her in the night-time?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the things out of the drawer?</p>
               <p>A. Flight. I did, her back was towards me, I was in the room.</p>
               <p>

            , a journeywoman, the night before she was sent to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. It was betwixt eleven and twelve: I had desired Miss to get the key out of her pocket, and bring it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. I was in bed, and Miss brought it to me in the dark; my room is betwixt her room and the garret. I laid it under my pillow till morning, and got up about six; then I went up and opened her box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay alone?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. I had another journeywoman, named Wintworth, lay with me, she is now out of town. I opened the box, and saw a bundle which I opened, and saw most of the things that were found in it afterwards; then I pinned it up again, and locked the box, and the journeywoman that lay with me took the key, and went down with me, and put it under the drawers, where the bundle was afterwards found: I acquainted my sister with it; I was in the room when the prisoner was sent for, when the constable was there. My sister charged her with taking the guinea, and several other things; she denied taking any thing, then my sister desired her to go up and fetch the things. At first, she said, she had lost the key of her box; but, at last, she pulled it out of her stays. I saw the long-lawn apron, and some laced caps, that were not in the bundle in the box, when it was open. After that, my sister desired her to deliver the bundle, saying, she knew she had it; then she went with my sister into the room, and offered it her; my sister refused it, then she delivered it to the constable. We did not, at that time, know she had removed them from her box, the box was up four pair of stairs, the bundle was in the second pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>A. Flight. She went directly to the drawer, without opening any other. These drawers were used in common by her and the journeywoman.</p>
               <p>Q. To M. Flight. Had any thing passed before the constable was sent for, that gave her any suspicion?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. Nothing but missing the key out of her pocket, which I suppose, made her mistrust.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was she first called down stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. That was between nine and ten o'clock, that was the first notice she had, that she was likely to be charged.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she get up that morning?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. She got up between six and seven, that was her usual time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been out at the door?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. She had not, as I know of; she could not easily have gone out, without being known. I had desired a journeywoman to watch her, that she did not go out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the journeywoman bring you the key?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. I did; I rang for the maid to get up, to go down stairs to warm a little water, in order that the journeywoman might take the key out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any body with you, when you opened her box?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. No; I did not?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. It was?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice to the prisoner, what you had seen, when she first came down in the morning?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her come down?</p>
               <p>M. Flight. I saw her between seven and eight in the morning; she came down to breakfast, and went up to make her bed betwixt eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bundle taken out of the drawer?</p>

I followed her up, and the two Mrs. Flights; when the box was open. there was no bundle to be found; she was asked where it was, and was told it was in that box that morning; she said, she knew nothing of a bundle, or that there had been one there; Mrs. Flight said, she had seen it, and desired her to fetch it; then they went down one or two pair of stairs, I did not go with them; the prisoner there produced the bundle, that was unpinned or untied, before me.</p>

            . My sister came and told me, the key had been left in a drawer, and a guinea was missing. She desired my advice in it; I went there, the constable was sent for. I was present at the opening the things; after the bundle was produced by the prisoner. I asked the prisoner if they were all her mistress's things? she declared they were th at the time we were untying or unpinning the bundle or just before. I took up the bundle and shook it, the guinea was the first thing that fell down; there was also the tea-tongs. My sister said, I do not remember we ever left the shop open. I cannot tell which way you came by this of lane? said the prisoner, you was serving a customer one day, and I came down, and took it off the counter.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of them. I only saw them in my box: I lay with a young lady; they called me up between twelve and one at night my pockets had laid on the drawers two or three days before the young lady owned she had taken the key out of my pocket while I was down stairs they kept the key all night. About 10 o'clock. I wanted to go to my box. I felt for my key, and missed it out of my pocket. I kneeled down, and took it up under the drawers, I saw a bundle which was not mine I took it out of my box, and carried it down into the room where I lay, which I thought a person had put in there, they all owed me a great grudge. I was going out of the house several times, but they would not let me: the next day, they went for a constable, and gave me into his custody; they told me they lost a guinea out of a bureau, and asked me if I knew any thing of it? I said no. They asked me if I had any more things in my custody of theirs? I said I had not. They said we know of more, for we have seen every thing you have in your box. They dragged me up stairs, and in my fright, I did not know where my key was. It was in my bosom; I opened my box; they asked me where my bundle was? I said I had carried it down into the room where I use. They shook a guinea out of it, and asked me if any thing besides was there. I said I believed not. I did not know what they were. I never saw the lace till they opened it in the room; they asked me when I took the lace? I said I knew nothing of it.</p>

I said to Mr. Whitaker, I had lost my hat; we pursued, and one of the other men took hold on my coat, as I turned the corner, and turned me about to stop me: we called, stop the thief; at the corner of the market, we lost sight of him for not above a minute; he was taken near the Queen's Head, in Bear-street, Clare-market; he had a sailor's jacket on, and a pair of trowsers, without a hat; the other two had light coloured clothes on. I do not, by his face, swear positively to him, but, by his dress, he is the man.</p>

I was with Mr. Derand, coming home, in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields: by Mr. Willis's we met three or four persons, but the act was so instantaneous, I cannot tell what sort of men they were, or whether this man was one of them; as I was pursuing, one of them ran against me, I believe with an intent to prevent my running.</p>

I said I was not the man: said they, if you are not the man, you know who did it. I told them I never saw the man above twice before.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 21st of October, about 4 o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came with a watch, and offered it to pledge; he brought the watch in one hand, and the key in the other: I had some suspicion of its not being his own, and he not answering cleverly to some questions I put to him, increased my suspicion; I thought proper to stop it: he went away, and said he'd fetch the man that owned the watch; he returned in about a quarter of an hour, and said the man that owned it was a cook at a tavern in Covent-Garden, that he was not at home. In the morning, one of Mr. Fielding's men came and told me it was a stolen watch. I knew the prisoner before; he appeared to be then much in liquor.</p>

While we were going out of the room, I saw her take a handkerchief from a round tea-table, and put it into her pocket. She and I, and her husband, went all out together: as I had lent her other things, I thought she might take the handkerchief by mistake, so I did not mention it to her; but as we were going along, I asked her to lend me a handkerchief: she said she had ne'er a one. I said, yes, you have one you took from the table, and put in your pocket. She d - d her eyes, and said she had ne'er a one. When I came home, I told her husband of it; he desired me to make myself easy, saying, it would be a great detriment to him, was it known. After that, I was obliged to get the things I lent her from pawn, she had pawned them; after that, I not prosecuting her, she came to my house, and called for a pint of beer, she being fuddled, I would not let her have any; but somebody drew her a pint, she drank some of it, I went and took the rest away; then she swore I was a bitter b - h, and she would prosecute me for concealing a felony; then on the Monday, I went and got a warrant for stealing the handkerchief, upon which she was taken up.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Cole, at Hampstead. On the 17th of Nov. I went into that house, to see for my master. I heard the prosecutor enquire for a bundle as we were in the tap-room by the bar; there was the prisoner and one Buckeridge; the prosecutor was a little in liquor: I saw the prisoner had the bundle behind him, under his great coat, the coat stood out; I said, I believed that man has got it, pointing to the prisoner. I went behind him; there was then nothing lying on the ground. The prisoner said, I got it, I have not got it, and made a sort of hobble in his speech; he went back, and stooped down, and dropped it; after Soaper took him by the collar, the prisoner paid for a glass of rum or brandy, and went out at the door; and ran down Bell-yard.</p>

               <p>Field. It was in the space of a minute or two after; we followed him; he ran with a naked knife in his hand, with a picked point to it; he put it to his side and shut it, before we took him: a man came and took it out of his hand. The prisoner's companion got out of the house, and ran away as fast as he could; there was Mr. Buckridge there at the time: he is not here.</p>

I had a bit of cheese; I took it out, and was eating it, with my knife in my hand; I went out at the door and walked very softly; he came up to me as I was just shuting my knife: they took hold of me, and had me before the justice.</p>

I draw beer in the house; I drawed a pint of beer for the prisoner; he desired me to set it down by him, this was after he came down stairs again; I said, I was very sorry the thing should happen; he drawed out this razor, (a razor produced) and gave it me, and bid me go up stairs and cut the tickin of the bed, and there I should find the watch, and desired I would bring it down to him, and not let any body know of it; I went directly and told my mistress of it, by which means it came to be found.</p>

About 3 o'clock on Monday morning, the 14th of Nov. my master came into my room where I lodge, and said he believed there were thieves in the house; I and my brother got up, and went into another room to call another man; as soon as we came down stairs, we went into master's room, and from the window we saw a light that shone out at a window below us against the pales. Master reached down a pistol and hanger, he kept the pistol himself, and gave me the hanger: then we went to the house door, he unbar'd the door, and immediately I and my brother ran out, round to the cellar window, where we saw the light shine from: when I came there, I saw no light, I said Holo; as soon as I spoke, I saw a man run between me and the wall, close to the window: he stooped as he ran by me.</p>

As we were lighting him along, he put his hand into his pocket, and threw something from him; I called to master, and he came into the road, and picked up a tinderbox; we kept him at the Bull till day-light; then we went for the Headborough; we searched him, and found a silver spoon upon him. We took him to the justices in Whitechapel, and he was committed to Newgate. The window of the cellar was taken quite out: the prisoner at the bar is the man.</p>

I met the prisoner in the door way, as he was coming from the passage that went to the vault; he had passed by my brother, who was before me: the cellar window looks out into that passage (it was very dark) I could not see him to know him from my brother; and could not hear him, for he had his shoes off, we found them in his pockets; as soon as he past me, master catch'd hold of him; he got away again, and master knock'd him down with his pistol; then he bid me hold him, but I was not able, he struggled to the door that went out of the fore yard into the field, there we all three got hold of him; he did not get without the gate: we after that took him to the Bull, he had this iron bar which

            . About three o'clock, on the 14th of Nov. master called me up, and said somebody was breaking into the house, we got up; there were four of us. We went out to the place where we imagined the person was breaking in; we saw the prisoner pass by very near the place; he was knock'd down and taken: after he was down, I pulled this iron bar out of his hand; we brought him to the light within the house. After he had been in the house some time, I asked him how long he had been in the house? he said he had not been in above 2 minutes. He held up his head, and said, O that I should break into a house where were so many men. We took him to the inn, where a constable was sent for, and searched him.</p>

I step'd on board, and asked what they had got there? they made no answer; I found by my feet they had got coals: there were, I found afterwards, to the amount of about 18 bushels. I asked where they were going; they said to Greenwich. I said to where there? they said, they did not know: at last one of them said he was going on board a barge there. We took the boat up to Pelican-stairs, with the coals, and carried the prisoners to the watch-house, and the next day before Justice Berry, who committed them.

I went back again, where my wife was to have been, and found her. I told her the door was open; we went home directly, and found we had been robb'd of 23 s. and 2 d. out of a small leather trunk that was in a drawer, and locked; the shirts were lost out of the same room; we found the trunk was unlocked, and not forced; the key of the trunk was in a nest of drawers, so that we supposed it was somebody that knew it took the key, and unlocked the trunk, and took them; and on Monday the prisoner came into the yard where I was at work; he shook me by the hand, and said he was very sorry for my misfortune: he said it must be my lodgers, or somebody that knew me. I clapt my hand on his shoulder, and said, My friend, was you not nigh my house yesterday? he said no nigher than Hog-lane, which is about a quarter of a mile from my house. I had no suspicion of the prisoner. I went to Justice Fielding's, who advis'd me to advertise the shirts, as they were marked: on the next day (Tuesday) Mrs. Philips, a neighbour, told me that the prisoner had been by my house the day I was robb'd: when she saw him, she thought that he was disappointed of his usual house, as my wife and I were out: upon this, suspicion arose, I pursued him to Tottenham, searched him, and found one of the shirts upon him. I said this is one of the shirts; he denied it. I bid him turn his money out of his pocket; there was a Queen Ann's silver Three-pence, and a George the Second's Two-pence, wrapped up in a piece of paper, which was part of the money stole out of the trunk, and belonged to my child, and also 7 s. I said, what think you of this? He said, Master Cooper, that money is yours, and I am the man that robb'd you. He confess'd the taking of them before the Justice; the shirt he had on was marked with S. R. on the hip.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cooper. I lock'd my door when I went out to a neighbour's, on Sunday evening. I staid there till my husband called; when I locked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070038"/> door, the money and shirts were safe.

               <p>I met a woman on Tuesday, in Brown's lane, I bought a shirt and a pair of stockings of her, from thence I went to Tottenham; I call'd in at a public house for a pint of beer, there I met with the prosecutor; he call'd me into another room, and said he was informed I was the man that robb'd him; I told him I was not; the shirt he swore to, but would not to the stockings; they took me to the justice, and I was committed to Clerkenwell.</p>

I had some victuals tied up in a handkerchief, which I set on the table; the man struck at me, and I struck him again; the prisoner took my victuals from off the table, and went out at the door, I followed her; she went in at a house about three doors lower down; I asked her why she took my victuals away? she said, for fear we should fling it down, and break the bason. I sent for purl there; it was on the ground floor: while we sat, she pulled my watch out of my pocket, and hung it upon a nail. I said, you have no business with that, it is mine; I took it down, and put it in my waistcoat pocket. I fell into a doze, she took it out of my waistcoat pocket, unknown to me; there was only she and I in the room when I missed it, I charged her with it, and she did not deny it: She told me, if I would hold my tongue, I should have it in a few minutes; she said it was gone to pawn for a shilling, and that she would carry something to pawn, and fetch it again, if I did not let the landlady of the house know of it. I sat still a little time, and she did not go: I made a noise, and the woman of the house heard me; she came down, and made an uproar, and many people came in: I would not let the prisoner go out till I sent for an officer, who took her; she had never been out of the room. They pulled me about, that I might let her go. The constable took her to the justice at Whitechapel; as we were going to the justice, she turned round, and seeing my silver buckles, said, if I had known of them, you dog, I would have had them too. ( The watch produced in court, and deposed to, by prosecutor.)</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Saltpetre-bank; the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner; I asked him if he was sure she had robbed him? he said. I am sure. I took her before the bench of justices; she denied the whole. I was ordered to take her to New Prison: we called at the Coach and Horses; I told the prosecutor I would try a scheme to get the watch. I told her that if she would produce the watch, I would prosecute the prosecutor, and acquit her: She said, she had really taken the watch, and sent another person to pawn it for 7 s. I asked her if she could get the watch again? she went to her house; the woman there would not talk English; one of them fell into a sham fit. I said, I see how the matter is, the watch is here, and you want to bubble the man out of it. I gave charge of one. and another, on purpose to frighten them. The landlady ran into a back room, and I followed her, and shut the rest out: she pulled off the bedcloaths, I saw the watch, and took it up. She said the watch was not there, but she would search. Going out of the coach and horses, she took hold of my watch, but could not get it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess she had taken the watch?</p>

               <p>The prosecutor bid me take away his victuals, for fear it should be thrown down, as he and another person were fighting. He followed me home, and wanted to be rude with me. I would not let him: he threw his coat and waistcoat off in a passion on the bed, in the other room, when I suppose the watch dropt out.</p>

I had never seen them before: they laid hold of me by the shoulder, and pulled me in by force; I did not know what they wanted to say to me: as soon as they got me in, they shut the door; there was another room went up about six steps; they said still, they wanted to speak with me, and thrust me up there against my will (the sister did not come into the room):

We were told that Robinson was at a house in Saltpetre Bank, and the woman told us, that if we did not jump over a wall, she would make her escape backwards. Accordingly I, and one of my ship mates, got over the wall to the back part of the house, we found her lying down in a corner of the backyard; it was betwixt six and seven o'clock; we took her to Mr. Champlain, the constable, between twelve and one o'clock.

We took them both before the justice the next morning; the justice asked Robinson whose money it was; she said the 2 guineas were mine, and the quarter her own: Williams said she knew nothing of the matter; the justice committed 'em.

The day after, we took him before justices Scott and Berry; the justice asked me if I knew him to be the man? I said I was sure.

My brother officer, Mr. Batten, a neighbour, came out to assist me; there was a little Irishman in the mob, who said, by J - s C - st, he would cut his liver out, if he did not let her go: he ran away as soon as I came up. I took her into my back room, and asked her if she had any of the money about her? she said what was that to us. Mr. Batten insisted on searching her; she would not be searched. I did not think it proper to search her in my own house, my brother officer going to search her, she struck him; we took her backwards where we keep our coals, to search her; she said she would not be searched; we strip'd her, and found a guinea under her breast; she clapt another guinea into Mr. Batten's hand, and shook it: he said no, I will not take any bribe, and flung it down. After her petticoats were off, he looked on the ground, and found a quarter of a guinea; we persuaded her to own the fact. She said, that when Riley took the money, and ran away with it down stairs, she ran after him, and Riley gave her two guineas, one for Williams, the other for herself; but that she had not had an opportunity to give it to Williams, and that he kept the two guineas and half himself; she said the quarter-guinea was her own money. (Riley said the same afterwards in his confession). She said Riley put the money in his shoes: the money we found upon her, was two guineas, and a quarter, and I believe 18 d. We took Williams the same night, who said she knew nothing of the matter. When Williams was brought into the watch-house, Robinson said, that is the woman that laid hold of the purse first: Williams all along said she saw nothing of the matter. When we took Riley, he said he would confess, if we would stop at a public house; he dallied so, that we could get nothing from him; he at first, said, he knew nothing of it; we took him to the women in Newgate; Robinson said, that is the man: he said his name was Moore. When he was taken to the justice, he said, Don't drag me like a thief along, call at a public house, and I will open the whole affair; so the other officer and I had a private room: he said he took the money to be sure, but it was the first fact; he said he gave 2 guineas to Robinson, for each woman to have a guinea for her trouble, and that he flung the purse away. Robinson said Riley came up with a knife, and cut her arm; she shewed me the scar.</p>

On the 1st of November, I observed her to put a quart pewter pot in her pocket; she took it from the fire where was about a dozen and a half. I let her go out, followed her, and brought her in again, and took the pot out of her pocket: there was a carpenter in the house, I called him to take notice that I took it out of her pocket, and that my name was upon it. I asked her where she was going to carry it: she would not tell me. I took her to Justice Welch, who committed her to New Prison: as I was going by my own house, I called and treated her with a pot of beer; she confess'd she had sold 14 pots to Holloway. The justice desired me to get a search warrant, which I did. Holloway keeps an old iron shop; we found a quantity of pewter melted down, and a quart pot of mine with my name on it: there were several bags hung up against the wall; the three bags we searched, had melted pewter in them: when we took the pot out of the bag, Holloway ran away: this is the pot I found at Holloway's; (a quart pewter pot produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor): it has my name upon it; Fell was at that time in New Prison.</p>

               <p>Whiat. I have in 2 months lost fourteen pots; in about which time, she said she sold Holloway the 14 pots; I missed 18. We found Mrs. Holloway at Maypole-alley, near the New Church in the Strand, at an acquaintances.</p>

I told her I had got a warrant to search her house for pewter pots, belonging to Mr. Whiat: she said she would have us go down in the cellar and search there, and that she had none; she pretended to be calling somebody down stairs, and made her escape out at a back door while we found the pot.</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Holloway about four months; she married a brewer's servant: she keeps an old iron and rag shop, and buys brass and pewter. I see Mrs. Holloway give Fell 6 d. for a pot the last day of October. I was gone on an errand when she first came in, and only heard her say to Mrs. Fell, there's the Sixpence: it was about 11 o'clock at noon. I did not see the pot, but was told afterwards by Mrs. Fell, that the six-pence was for the quart pot that was found when the house was searched. I asked her how she could rob the people? she said if it had not been put into her head, she should never have thought of such a thing. I asked her by whom? she said Mrs. Holloway. I have seen Holloway melt pewter pots many times, but never saw the name upon them. I heard her say to her husband on the next morning (Tuesday) that Fell was a base woman to rob the people that were her support.</p>

               <p>Fell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never took any thing from any body in my life: I only took the pot to get a draught of water.</p>
               <p>Holloway's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never received a pot of Mrs. Fell, or ever suspected her to be a thief; she had 20 l. a year during her life: her husband is dead, she is superannuated. She brought a pot in her hand: I asked her where she was going? she said she was coming to wash her things. I asked her what she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070042"/> brought the pot for? she said she could not tell. A customer came in, my husband went down to weigh some iron, and she tossed the pot in the bag; I never saw, or handled it, if I was to die this moment. She asked me to lend her sixpence; I said, Mrs. Fell, you owe me a great deal of money (she owed me 18 s.) I will lend you no more: my husband and Mr. Whiat are bail for her now, and because my husband would not join with Mr. Whiat in a note of hand to pay the money at Christmas, he has invented this: he said if we would pay money to his attorney, he would prefer a bill of Ignoramus against Fell.</p>

I being a little in liquor, said, Yo ho! again: they all three looked in my face; I was not daunted, and went to shake hands with one of them, which I take to be the prisoner; they all three went away directly. I saw a light at a public-house, and thought somebody was up, knocked at the door, but found there was not: just as I turned from the corner (the public-house is the corner) the three men came up to me again; one of them clapt a pistol to my breast, and with an oath said, Give me the money. I said, gentlemen, what do you want? they said all your money; I had the precaution to slip my watch into the back part of my breeches. I lifted up the flap of my waistcoat, and bid 'em take all they could find in that pocket, for I had none in any other: the man that held the pistol, put his hand into my pocket, and took out 3 s. he asked me if. I had any more? I said no, without it might be a few half pence in my other pocket, I could not tell; he put his hand into my pocket, and took out two little knives and a farthing which they returned me again. He then stooped down, and took one of the buckles out of my shoes, and said, what are they silver? I said no, gentlemen, they are copper, but if you choose, you shall have them: they returned the buckle, and went towards Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain the prisoner is one of the men that robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Phipps. I believe him to be the man that held the pistol: I was something in liquor, and will not be positive. I was going home, and held my hand to my breeches where my watch was, but did not take it out for fear of losing it: they came up to me again, and said, what are you here? they bid me a good night, and shook hands with me, and I wished 'em good success. I thought I must be as good-natured as I could to them. Just after we parted, they met another man, and robbed him of his watch, money, and buckles. I heard a noise, I went to look what it was, and met a man; he said, you may look at me, I have been robb'd. I said to have I. I said I believed I should catch them in the New Road, or towards Ragg Fair: he said, he could not go, for he was obliged to go a milking. I said, if they would give me some watchmen, I would go myself; they let me have six men, I went in pursuit of the thieves, till the watchmen would go no farther; there was fifteen watchmen went all round. On the 27th October, 11 days afterwards, Mr. Champlain, another officer, and myself, went to Saltpetre-bank: I went into a house there, and saw the prisoner; he looked white, and his countenance turned different colours. Mr. Champlain asked me what I thought of him? I said I believed he was the man that robbed me, but that I would not be sure till I see him in the light. He said to the officer, B - d and Z - ds, what do you want with me? he said he knew nothing of the matter; we searched him, but found nothing; we asked him how he came into the public-house, as he had no money?</p>

About a month ago, I began a general repair in my house, which required various workmen to be employed. When we got rid of the workmen in general, we took a proper account of our stock, to see if we had lost any thing during the reparation: we found we had lost two fine pieces of linnen. We could not think of any one person to charge them upon, as there were such a number of them there: we made one complete finish last Monday, then took a fresh account (the first account was taken on Thursday the first of this month) we found we had lost two pieces more since. I recollected as carefully as I could, what persons could have had any concern in the warehouse in the intermitting time, and, we were certain, that it could be none but the carpenter and the painter, who were then in the house. I concluded, it must be one of these men, but had no reason to suspect one more than the other; upon which I called them into separate rooms to examine them a part: they both endeavoured to clear themselves. The prisoner (who is the painter) begged I would take direction where he lived, as he was a house-keeper, that I might not hurt his character. I recommended to them both to continue in my house, while I went with a written order from them to their wives to make enquiry: the painter's direction to his house, was at Redmaid-lane, near the Hermitage, which being a considerable way home, I believe about a mile and a half, gave me some suspicion that he did not go home at night. I took my man with me, and went to his house at six o'clock at night: I had some conversation with his wife; I enquired whether her husband had returned every night from his work at my house, and whether he was a good husband and neighbour; I found he had not been at home since the Thursday before (this was Wednesday), so he had not been at home for a week. I endeavoured to inform myself where he had lodged: the most I could learn of her was, that it was at a public-house somewhere near the Mansion house: I returned home again, and found that they had both continued in my house; then I went down Walbrook to see if I could learn where he had lodged. I called at the Bull's-head, Mr.

            's; I enquired if one Johnson, a painter, did not lodge there; they told me, he did: I was shown into a room, and, after calling for something, desired the landlady to walk in. I represented myself as a buyer of Irish linnen, and asked if the painter was come home from his business? they told me he was not; I asked, if he had any Irish linnen fine enough for my purpose? she answered, that he had such a thing; I was not willing to hurry it, that I might find out the more, and said, if that is the case, I can wait a little while: says I, perhaps this Johnson, after all his stumping so much of his Irish linnen, has but a piece or two; she said she never saw but two pieces: seeing she spoke so openly, I said, the linnens are stole, he is a thief, and I the person robbed, and you having stolen goods in your possession, is a disagreeable circumstance on your account; but, if you will be candid, give me liberty to go over your house, and show me these linnens, and whatever else I can find, I shall be satisfied that you know nothing of this Johnson's robbing me; she desired me to follow her up stairs, and showed me these two pieces of cloth, (produced in court, and deposed to): I found, by the marks upon them, that one of the pieces was one of the two I first lost, and the other one of the last. I asked if that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070045"/> was the room he lodged in? she said, no, and went to the room he did lodge in; I turned up the bed, but could not discover any thing; there was a box in the room that belonged to the house; we opened it, and, in the back of the box, in a tick pillowbear, was another piece of the linnen, which was the other piece of the two I lost last, so that I had both the two last, and one of the former: I made enquiry of Mr. Austin, and his wife, how he had imposed upon them, in point of deception, in bringing the linnen there? they told me that he had supported it all the time, that he was painting a ship in the river; that the captain was a land-trader, and gave him this in part of payment, and told him he might dispose of them amongst his friends; they said, the cloth was exhibited the night before, in the public-room, for sale, and they thought that he was painting a ship, as he had never been home to dinner all the time he lived there. I went from there to Wood-street Compter, and got a constable to my house, and gave him charge of the prisoner: when this was done, I went to the public-house, to see if I could trace the fourth piece, but could not; they told me there was about eight or ten yards of a piece he had brought there; that was put out to be made into shirts for himself; this was what a draper had returned, being damaged, and we made no account of it. We questioned the prisoner about it at another time, and he confessed the taking of it. (Three pieces produced in court, and deposed to). When I told Mrs. Austin they were stolen, I said, as to the proof of it, here is a paper that has the number of the cloth; I told her, she would find the numbers wrote with a pen, in red-ink, on the cloth, correspond with the paper; there was Number 98 on the back of the first pieces I lost; on the second, 56 on one piece, and 73 on the other: when she went up stairs with me, she saw the Number on the piece; they were sent me from the factor in Ireland; the maker of the linnen stamps them at the end, to show there is no fraud in the inside; for, if there was, the man's name that stampt them, is liable to the damage. This is a new method established by the board at Ireland; (the maker of these linnens has so much confidence on the goodness of them, that he stamps them with his own name), the maker's name was stampt on the ends of the cloth; the prisoner owned, he had stole three pieces, but denied knowing of the fourth; and that he stole them at two different times.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the market: last night, Mr. Chantrell's servant gave the butter into my care till morning; I saw it a quarter before 10 o'clock, and a quarter after 12, this flat was gone; I saw nobody there to take it. An acquaintance told me this morning, that a person was in custody at St. Bride's watch-house; I went accordingly, and found the prisoner and butter.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the Fleet-market; the prisoner came between 12 and one o'clock, and brought this butter, desiring me to take care of it: he put it down, I asked him who it belonged to, whether any of the market? he said it did not. I told him I would not take charge of it. He said he was going to carry it to Newgate-market; a young man offered to carry it for 2 d. he said that would buy me a pint of purl. I helped him up with it, and he took it away: he went up Sea-coal-lane. A lamp-lighter told me there was a man with his coat off upon his head, and a basket on it; we went up, he had his coat and waistcoat on, the butter was set down on a form, and he lent upon it. I said, you are not got to Newgate-market yet, and asked him why he would not go? he said he would not go till morning. I said I suspected him; and so stopped him, and got the constable: the prisoner told me he had got 53 lumps: I said it could not be so much, it was not heavy enough: he said they made short weight in his country; he said it came from Pancras town. We opened the basket, and instead of 53, there was only 19 lumps and a pound. (The butter produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor.) He told me it was made by one Mr. Jones, a milkman, that he had it of him. I went to Pancras to find this Jones, and could find no such person: I then went to Kentish-town, and found he lived in a country-house at Finchley, and had left off making butter a long time.</p>
