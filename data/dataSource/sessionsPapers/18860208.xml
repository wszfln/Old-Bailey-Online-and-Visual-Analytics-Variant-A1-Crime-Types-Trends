I am a tobacconist, of Caledonian Road, Islington—on Sunday night, 17th January, about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock, the two prisoners came in—the male prisoner asked for a cigar and the female prisoner asked for a quarter of an ounce of snuff—the man said "Give her half an ounce of snuff"—I did so; the cigar and snuff came to 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the male prisoner put down a half-crown—I took it up, tested it, and discovered it to be bad; it bent easily—I called my wife, handed her the half-crown to look at—I walked round the corner, bolted the door, and sent the servant for a policeman—the male prisoner said "I am a respectable man; I will give you my name and address"—I said "I don't know; I will have a policeman and see who and what you are, and whether you are respectable or not"—the constable came and searched him in the shop—the female prisoner was standing up when the man was being searched; she then sat down in chair about two and a half yards from the man; the constable stood close by—no bad money was found on the man—I then heard a fall of money on the floor—the woman exclaimed "I have dropped a penny—the policeman stooped down and I picked, it up at her feet; he handed it to me and he</p>

                  </hi>. I am Administrator and Parish Priest of St. C—Church, Fitzroy Square—by virtue of my office I caused some repairs to be done to the schools, and became indebted to the builder in 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a committee was formed about October last to collect the money and liquidate the debt—the prisoner had been attending the services of the church for about three months, and apparently took considerable interest in the schools—he was elected hon. Secretary and treasurer to the committee, and was appointed to receive subscrip<lb/>tions and instructed to pay to the builder all that he received—I never authorised him to sign my name to any cheques or to endorse them—the endorsement "T." or "J. Regan" to this cheque, is not mine, nor an imitation of my signature—there is no writing of mine on it, and I did not know of it being received—not a farthing of the debt due to the builder has been paid by the prisoner—on December 24th Mr. Brandon made a communication to me, and on December 27th I received the letter from the prisoner—I had been in communication with him. (<hi rend="italic">This was written from Dorchester, acknowledging the witness's letter of the day before and expressing regret at having caused so much unpleasantness by his careless<lb/>ness, stating that he should be in town on Friday, and requesting the witness not to take any extreme measures, and offering to send a</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">share in, a company at a security.</hi>) I answered to that address, consulted with the committee, and a warrant was applied for at Dorchester—after the prisoner's arrest I received another letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer and tobacconist at 43, Barbican—about the end of November the prisoner came and asked if I would receive a few letters for him for a few days till he got suitable offices ready in the neighbourhood—I arranged to do so, and he agreed to pay me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said there would not be many, about two or four a day—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in advance—he wrote this name, "Jules Maloche," on a piece of paper—after that he fetched letters, one or two, or at most four or five a day—they were all foreign, some from Paris, some from Belgium—in the last week of December one or two letters were returned from abroad, and they contained my address printed on the heading of the envelope—I asked the prisoner why he had had my address printed, as I had given him no consent—he treated it as a slight matter, and said it was only to save the Post-office authorities the trouble of opening them—he continued to call till Thursday, the last day of December—he ceased then, because I told him I would not receive any after the Saturday.</p>

I am a flax merchant in business with my father at Eclos in Belgium—a person giving the name of Brocart came twice to me in July—I saw him again afterwards at Blankenberg—I did not do business with him—I received this letter signed "J. Maloche," 7th December, and these others on the dates mentioned—in pursuance of the order contained in this letter I sent 18 bales of flax to England to the address J. Maloche, Great Eastern Railway Company's station, Liverpool Street, and the delivery order I afterwards sent to 43, Barbican—I was never paid for these goods—I came to London with my father, and went direct to 43, Barbican, where we found no office—we went to the Great Eastern Railway Company, Liverpool Street; we found no warehouse there belonging to Maloche—I was asked to send 150 bales in all, but only sent the 18—I sent those because I believed it was a good firm, and I thought No. 43, Barbican was a great house, and that he had a ware-house at the Great Eastern Railway, Liverpool Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Corrie, Hanson, and Co., flax merchants and commission agents at Hull, which is a recognised market for flax—I first saw the prisoner on the 31st December last year accompanied by a Frenchman whom he introduced as Mr. Durand, flax merchant from Lille, who had 18 bales of flax that he had sold to some one in London, but hearing that the man in London was not so good as he anticipated he came to London, and had brought the flax to Hull to sell it or get some one to sell it for him—I was asked to sell it—the other man only spoke to the prisoner, who interpreted—it was about 3.30 or 3.15—I said I could do nothing that night until I had seen the flax itself—they came again next morning—I went across to the railway, Mr. Durand produced the railway receipt, and showed it to the railway com<lb/>pany—I inspected the flax—the letter "M" was on the bales, I think—I asked the prisoner who had referred him to me—he said some one in the train had told him he had better come to us, as we were one of the principal agents there, if he wanted to sell the flax—ultimately we were commissioned to sell the flax, and we made an advance of 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque to Durand, who endorsed it, and they then went to cash it at the bank—Durand, the other man, spoke only through the interpreter; he promised to send further samples of flax when he got back to Lille—we subse<lb/>quently sold the flax for about 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., off which expenses had to be deducted—I was directed to write to Lille, but the address of the interpreter was given as 14, Wardour Street—I wrote there concerning the sale, because Durand wrote from London a few days afterwards, saying he was detained a few days in London and would I write to him at that address—I now hold the difference between my advance and the price realised.</p>

I have known Mr. Grieves buying fish in the market for 14 months; he dealt with my employers and other people—we gave him credit for salmon and lobsters—he was buying fish from us in very large quantities, as a fishmonger and dealer would buy—he came every day except Sunday; it is an everyday occurrence for men who buy and sell fish to bring other articles to buy or sell in the market—persons in the market are in the habit of selling everything—I knew Grieves's name; this conversation took place in the shop; there are other assistants under me; there are always plenty of people about our place—I have heard of Wilson, a hawker, I think, who deals in all kinds of things, which he sells much below the price they often fetch in the ordinary market, or otherwise we should not purchase them—I was alarmed when the policeman first came—I told Partridge I had bought some umbrellas about a fortnight before—I can't say how long it was before Christmas; it was more than a day or two—Partridge asked me if I knew the man from whom I bought them—I said I did not know; that was not true—he asked me if I bought any more at the time—I replied that that was the only one I had; that was not quite correct—he asked me if I was sure, and I said yes—he then went away; it was between 6 and 7 he called—I had burnt the umbrellas just before; I did not tell him I had—he came again next day, and said "I have reliable information that you had more umbrellas than the one I have got"—I said "No," and then I was taken to the station—the third time I was brought up the policeman asked the Magistrate to withdraw the charge against me.</p>

I am postman at the City Arms and live at 56, Brunswick Close, Clerkenwell—on 31st January about 1 a.m. I was going home through Moreland Street, St. Luke's, when somebody seized me round the throat, threw me down, and rifled my pockets; I could not see who it was—I had 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife in my pocket—they left me on the pavement—I fell backwards and recollect nothing after that, until a man and a woman came and picked me up fire or six minutes afterwards—the back of my head and my throat were injured, and I am suffering from that now and can hardly speak.</p>

On Saturday morning, 31st Novem<lb/>ber, I was in Moreland Street, City Road, against the schools—Langley passed me; I then heard a scuffling on the path—I looked through the iron railings of the school and saw the three prisoners, with Langley on his back; I did not know them before—I was standing at the corner of the school, 10 yards away—Pulbrook was on Langley's right, Phillips on his left, and King at his feet—I stooped down and saw Pulbrook's hand in Langley's right hand trousers pocket as he lay on his back—he was sober; he made a funny gurgling noise, and I walked towards him—King passed me about two yards from him—the school is at the corner, with rails running all round—I went about three yards farther, and Pulbrook and Phillips then left Langley, and I heard some money fall on the pavement—Langley called out "Police, they have robbed me"—I blew my whistle—I took Pulbrook about 40 yards away—the other two ran away—I saw a constable in front and told him to stop them—he stopped them in the same street—I never lost sight of either of them—I picked up this halfpenny where the robbery took place—I found this knife in the doorway where I took Pulbrook—they were taken to the station, where they said they were honest men going home.</p>

On the morning of 31st January I was at the corner of Macclesfield Street, about 70 yards from Moreland Street, and heard a policeman's whistle; I went in the direction of More<lb/>land Street, and saw King and Phillips walking hurriedly towards me—constable shouted "Stop those two men" and I took them both—Finch then came up with Pulbrook in custody and said they had knocked an old man down and robbed him; King said, "I have done nothing," and Phillips said, "I have done nothing"—another constable came up and they were all three taken to the station.</p>

Police Constable 306 G came up two or three seconds after I had taken them in custody, I can't think of his name, he took Phillips to the station and I took King—Inspector Bonner was on duty at the station, I did not hear Finch tell him a story, I heard the charge booked; the inspector did not ask Finch any question particularly, he said, "I charge these three men with knocking an old man down and robbing him"—these three men were in the dock about ten minutes before they were taken down into the cells, during that time the inspector was writing down their names and addresses and the charge against them—Finch did not, I believe, say that he was ten yards away or that these men were taken 40 yards away; he said he was watching them; the other constable did not attend the police-court—Moreland Street is close upon half a mile from the station—I did not hear Phillips explain to 306 G how it was he came to be there: while going to the station, they were just in front of me; I can't say whether he gave his account to the constable—it is not usual always, when three constables take three prisoners to the station, to call all three to give evidence—we have heard since that at the time Phillips was taken, his mother was seriously ill; I don't know that he did not give a correct address for fear of frightening her—he has been admitted to bail—I have seen him several times before but have not taken particular notice of him, I have never seen him with the other two prisoners—Macclesfield Street is about 150 to 200 yards from the schools.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to a firm of engineers, and live at 26, West Croft Square, Hammersmith—in February, 1885, I told the prisoner that the prosecutor and his wife required 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he knew a good channel through which to get it, and that if I would bring him a promissory note made payable to him or order, and drawn by the prosecutor and his wife, he would see about it—Mr. and Mrs. De Belin are great friends of mine; I have know them for years—I told him if he could not get the promissory note discounted he was to return it to me within a week or 10 days—he undertook to do so—I gave him the note, which was, in this form: "We promise to pay Charles Borlase Campbell 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—no actual sum was fixed for commission, but the prosecutor was to have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a specific purpose—I do not know how the balance was to be divided; it was discussed, but nothing was arranged—I gave the note to the prisoner on the 25th February—about three days after he said he had not been able to see the man who was going to discount it—I saw him again about three days after, when he made further excuses, and said he had not been able to see the man—on</p>

               <p>the following day I met him, and he told me he had a hole in the lining of his great-coat, and had lost his pocket-book in which the bill was; that a policeman had told him a man in Ironmonger Lane had picked it up, and had given his address at Dalston, and that he wished to go there but had no money to give the man as a reward—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that purpose—next day I met him; he said he had recovered his pocket-book and got the bill back but had left it at home—I asked him to return it to me—I wrote him a peremptory letter—he answered that he had hunted everywhere but could not put his hand on it, and that of course he would pay on settling day, and that he was thunderstruck at the striking out of the Lambkin—the Lambkin was a horse running in the City and Suburban—I have not got a copy of my letters to him—he has made no payment to me on account of the bill—I wrote to him saying we should take criminal proceedings if he did not pay—he has not returned the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner about five years—he has never lent me money; I have lent him some—I have know Mr. and Mrs. De Belin 17 or 19 years, and have lodged with them for the last 15 years—the prisoner has known them about 18 months; I believe he has only seen them once—I negotiated the note with the prisoner and prose<lb/>cutor—the prisoner was not present when it was made; it was made payable to him at his request—I am sure it was not at my suggestion—I dare say I commenced by saying my friends wanted an advance—I did not want money myself at the time—I told the prisoner I had bought furniture from Norman and Stacey, and had a deposit of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay—I did not say I should like some money to pay it; the prisoner said he should like some money himself—I knew his circumstances were not very flourishing—I knew Mr. and Mrs. De Belin were pressed for a certain amount, not that they were in poor circumstances—I was security for a bill of sale on their furniture; the prisoner suggested the note—I think I said at the Mansion House that I told the prisoner I must have the note back in a week or 10 days if he could not get it discounted—I believe Mr. Sarle is a friend of the prisoner's—he gave me a sovereign and said he came from the prisoner's wife—he owed it to me; it had nothing to do with this matter, I am certain—the prisoner did not appear to the summons—I may have discussed with him the getting of a loan; if he could have done it I would—I may have employed him to get a loan for me two or three years ago; I have not spoken to him since then—I never kept copies of my letters to the prisoner—I did not say in one of them that both I and the De Belins were hard up—I have had two or three trans<lb/>actions with the prisoner during three or four years—I cashed a cheque for him at Hammersmith; it was dishonoured—I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about two years ago and lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was from a friend of his, but he did not help me to borrow it—my first transaction with him was a bill about four years ago for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I think we got 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it; that is the only other transaction I can remember—there was a bill drawn for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prisoner to get discounted—he returned it, suggesting a larger amount should be put on, and then it was arranged if we could get it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was to have the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one back; the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. matter ended in nothing—that was dated about a week before the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was returned in a week or 10 days, and the second note was given on the same terms—the prisoner repeated the terms to me, I swear that—he did not return</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Arthur De Belen—in February last we were anxious to raise money for a private purpose—I was entitled to a reversion on my father's estate, which would shortly have accrued due; my husband has a pension—I know Mr. Gale—in consequence of what was said to me I signed a promissory note for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months jointly with my husband—we were to receive not less than 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but no particular sum was mentioned—we gave the note to Mr. Gale, we have never got any money; we have had an execution in the Mayor's Court—I have not seen the prisoner at all in the transaction—we asked Mr. Gale to apply for the money, but could not get a penny—the prisoner wrote two letters, one to Mr. De Belin and one to Mr. Gale, to the effect that he would call on a certain morning and explain, and if we wanted an advance he would procure it—that advance referred to a sub<lb/>sequent sum, I understood.</p>

Halyett and Company; they had some money of my husband, they drew his pension every month—the reversion yielded nothing to me, I expected to get 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and got nothing—I trusted entirely to the representations made me by Gale—Mr. Cliff called on me with reference to the note five days or a week afterwards, very soon after we gave the note I told Mr. Cliff the note would be met at maturity—I told him I had been introduced to the prisoner and his wife; I heard of him from mutual Mends, but did not know him very well personally—I told him the prisoner was to get it discounted, and we were to let him have something out of the proceeds—I swore as informa<lb/>tion at the Mansion House that I expected we should have the proceeds handed to us and we were to hand some to the prisoner—I heard the Lord Mayor and Mr. Gresham call attention to the grave discrepancy between my husband's information and evidence; the information was sworn by us both—there was no censure, my husband's memory is bad from paralysis—he said at the Mansion House that the prisoner was to have half, I said we were to have half—all I knew was that the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of A. Keyser, bankers and money-changers, &amp;c., 21, Cornhill—we are not members of the Clearing House—we act among our numerous friends and correspon<lb/>dents, as bankers, we open accounts with them—the prisoner came into our service on 11th August, 1879; that is the date of his guarantee—there was a guarantee of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to the time of his father's death, since that it is valueless—he was corresponding clerk—he is a good linguist—he opened an account with us in his own name—a gentleman in our business having left, the defendant inquired if we had any objection to his making commissions, and increasing his income by obtaining com<lb/>missions from friends for executing orders in investments in Stocks—we did not object; that was in his hours—I understood that he was investing money for friends abroad—all the members of our firm are invariably away for worship on Saturday; there are three of us—Mr. Perugini is the confidential and chief clerk—he would open letters on Saturdays, and so would the defendant, but on other days of the week the usual course is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188602080057"/>
               <p>that some member of the firm opens the letters—when the prisoner opened them he would initial them when he had finished them, to show that he had handled them—we keep debtor and creditor accounts with all our customers—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is called "No. 8 Black Book," that is the first book in which any entry is made of remittances received by the firm—it would be the prisoner's duty, in the first instance, if a letter came with a remittance, to enter in this book the name of the customer from whom the remittance comes, and the amount remitted; he would then make out a yellow credit slip and hand it to another gentleman who keeps the ledger account, and who enters from the yellow slip the amount shown on it to the credit of the person indicated as the remitter, first in the journal and then in the ledger—the black book and the yellow slip are the foundation of all the entries of remittances in the journal and ledger—at page 147 of this book I find an entry, "U. A. W. 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., April 13th," in the prisoner's writing—any credit to Messrs. Burnand and Co. of 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be recorded in this book as having been paid in on that day, but I find no such entry—this cheque for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which has been put in has not been received by the firm—it ought to have been entered on that day to Messrs.

A. wegener dis" (which means "Disconter Company") 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at page 166 I find 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on May 1st, and an entry "Credit U. A. W. 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," against which is written "Notes, Brown"—I do not know what "Brown" means—I find no entry on that day to the credit of Messrs. Marcus and Volknar for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we know now that Mr. Volknar did remit that bill on the Credit Lyonaise for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and it ought to have been credited by the prisoner—this credit slip for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "U. A. Wegener" is in the prisoner's handwriting, and at page 206 I find an entry to his credit of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "L.&amp;W."—that indicates a cheque on the London and Westminster Bank—the meaning of that would be that Wegener had paid in 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by means of a cheque on the London and Westminster Bank to go to his credit—I find no credit for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day to the Disconter Company—they ought to have been credited with that amount that day—the Company paid that 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in July, after we had rendered our account to the end of June—an application came from them about the omission—we had to pay them that after the prisoner had left—this discount slip "U. A. W. 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is in the prisoners writing—I find in the ledger on 15th April that Wegener is credited with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in due course, and on May 1st his account is credited by remittances 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 17th June his account is credited with 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is entered on the 18th—there would be a delay in the post—on 16th April here is an entry "28,283" for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn out—on 30th April I see that two cheques were paid in—the account was overdrawn—the paying-in slip is dated May 1st, and this account is April 30th—the account was overdrawn at that time, but the cheque might have been paid. (<hi rend="italic">A number of drafts by the prisoner were read, from</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th to</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th June, amounting to</hi> 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)

(<hi rend="italic">The book was sent for.</hi>) I have Messell's account in the ledger; he is our stockbroker—I can't tell whether this simply charges his account and credits Messell with the amount in our books, as it is made under hit instructions by the clerk who keeps the accounts—I do not suppose there was any cheque drawn in Wegener's favour or by him for this 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure he did not overdraw on us for 1,051<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I say he was indebted to us, that is by striking out from our account with him these items with which he has been improperly credited—we hare here "Loan and interest 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," at the end of April—I dare say one of my partners found out the defendant's account was overdrawn, and instructed that entry to be made—we allow all our clerks interest on their savings, but this is interest charged to him, his account being overdrawn 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would make 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had, over and above any credit—you have pointed out to me what I had not noticed before—this is in Mr. Logan's writing, the bookkeeper; he would not know that the prisoner was having this cash and drafts; the cashier would know it—at the end of May the defendant had 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his credit—the instructions were to allow him interest—we have looked to see how his account stood, and he was once told that it was over<lb/>drawn, and I hear now that it was frequently overdrawn—transactions to a very large amount were taking place, and have done so for years past—I have been a partner since 1878—this book for 1883 shows the total amount of business transactions done with him, debit and credit 51,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there is a balance to his credit of 1,096<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is the clerk at a salary of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—in the first three months of 1884 it amounts to 50,306<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is his own private account—I believe my firm have had transactions in Stocks with him; our transactions with him are all recorded—I believed at the time that they were investments; I do not believe it now—the transactions were very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was informed that the prisoner had occasionally received commissions for the purchase and sale of stocks for friends abroad—he gave some addresses but no names—I occasionally required Denver Bonds—I ascertained that he held some of them—we had in<lb/>structions to buy some, and knowing that he had some we allowed him to have the benefit of it, and now and then we have asked him to buy something for us, but we have made absolutely nothing oat of it—here are a number of the defendant's cheques for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was the amount of his monthly salary—he represented when he came that he had money of his own—I know that his parents are fairly well con<lb/>nected and well off—he did not tell us at the time that he intended to deal in Stocks for his friends, but he did afterwards, and it was generally understood between us—when these amounts have been drawn out, the sums into which we have been inquiring have been drawn out by the prisoner as well as many other sums which I have mentioned, and we are deficient 4,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consequence of these entries.</p>

Messell that any order we grave in our office they might do, sending the contract marked No. 2 so that it might not be mixed up—they are our stockbrokers—we had remonstrated with the prisoner prior to that for speculating on the Stock Exchange, and he begged to be allowed to wind up pending affairs, and either at that time or shortly afterwards promised, that he would not make use of it for his own account—I said, in order to wind up the out<lb/>standing matters you shall deal with our stockbrokers, and we will open a separate account, so that we shall have supervision over you—that is the whole history of No. 2 Messell's account; No. 1 Messells account is our own transactions with them—when it came to our knowledge that the prisoner was speculating we remonstrated with him, we have never speculated with him or gained any profits of any kind whatever.</p>

Keyser's account at Martin and Co.'s, who had credited them to Messrs. Keyser. He had certainly put a name in the books at that of the persons paying the money, who had not done so, and to got credit for sums which he had not paid, and which went to reduce hit account, and to had falsified the books, but that was not larceny.</hi>

I a am tinplate worker, of Casey's Yard, Gray's Inn Road—on 17th January, about 12.30 a.m., I was on my way home through Gray's Inn Road from Holborn, and about 100 yards up the road I met the three prisoners—Paris came on my right side, put her hand on my shoulder, and said something to me; Hearn came on the other side and put her hand in my face, scratching it, and then put her hand in my left trousers pocket, where I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a little tin box—I knew it was there, because it rattled as I came round the corner—while her hand was in my pocket Hume came up and struck me with his fist; the blow stunned me, and I staggered back and fell down—when I came to I found the police there—I put my hand in my pocket, and my box was gone—I had also had a kick on my wrist—I had a good view of the prisoners, as they came towards me on the same side of the way, Hume was in the centre of the two females—they were taken into custody—I went to the police-station, where I saw the inspector on duty and the divisional surgeon—I was sober; I did nothing to either of the prisoners.</p>

About 1.30 a.m. on 17th January I was in Gray's Inn Road, near the Holborn end, and saw Small going towards King's Cross and the three prisoners coming from King's Cross towards Holborn, about 100 yards from the corner of Gray's Inn Road, about opposite Fox Court—Dampier was with me; we were in plain clothes—Paris something to Small, and then Hume struck him a violent blow, and then Hearn put her hand in Small's trousers pocket; he was stunned but did not fall—he went off towards Holborn about 20 yards, but was caught by the two females and knocked to the ground, and they kicked him with their heels—we were kept back by a crowd of roughs who came from Fox Court—with the assistance of a police officer we took the two girls in custody—I did not see Hume again till we got to the station, where the prosecutor and I identified him as the one that struck the blow—he had followed the women to the station with a crowd of roughs, and had Paris's mantle in his hand—the prisoners said nothing in answer to the charge at the station—on the way there they used very obscene language, and were very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil broker in partnership with Mr. Baures, at 38, Bishopsgate Street—last year on the Oil Exchange I made Kendal's acquaintance; he gave me one or two small orders for petroleum—<hi rend="italic">prompt</hi> on that market is 14 days—I had 18 barrels of cylinder oil, three tone—Kendal remarked he had a market for that particular oil; that he could not take the parcel at that time, because of the <hi rend="italic">prompt</hi>—he could not pay for it at that time—he could in three weeks—believing he had a market for it I agreed to let him have it on the three weeks <hi rend="italic">prompt</hi>—I made inquiries, and while they were pending Kendal came to my office and produced a letter from Sims to Kendal, threatening that if not sent at once he would charge him with the difference—I read it, and believing they had a market for the goods and were in a hurry for them I sent the 18 barrels—instructions were given to deliver them to Mr. Smith, a carman in Poplar—they are not there now; they are at Mr. Clark's yard, to the order of Kendal—Kendal then gave me other orders for petroleum—subsequently I asked him if it had been taken away and used up—he said it had—Mr. Middleton was present when the conver<lb/>sation took place—I went to the yard to see whether it had been used up, and saw the 18 barrels there to the order of Kendal—on 12th Decem<lb/>ber the prompt had expired, and Kendal gave me this bill of exchange, drawn on and accepted by Sims, for 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the price of the oil was 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd a ton—41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the invoice price—he said the bill was for Mr. Sims and the difference between it and price of my invoice was for the profit made by Mr. Sims, and he asked me to give him a cheque for the difference—not knowing Sims I asked him if he was a man of substance; he said he had known him some years and had taken hundreds of pounds from him—I found Sims's name in a Directory of some years back as an estate agent—I then gave him this cheque for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went with Middleton to Sims in the Mile End Road—he was presumably an auctioneer and estate agent—at that date the oil had not been delivered; it had not been touched—I knew where it was—I was introduced to Sims—I said I understood he was the buyer of the oil—he said he was—I asked him if it had been taken away and was satisfactory—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to the prosecutor—it was substantially the duty of the prisoner to conduct the correspondence—on ordinary days of the week the morning correspondence would be opened by the partners—on the Saturday they were away, and then, if I was not there, it was customary for the prisoner to open the letters and take out the different remittances—it was his duty to make an entry of each in No. 8 book—he would put into one column a number to show to whose account it would go, and in another column the amount—then he would make out a yellow credit slip, putting on that the names of all the persons who had made remittances, with the amounts—those slips were handed to an entering clerk, a bookkeeper, who sits alongside of him in the office, or were generally put into a drawer, and as quickly as the entering clerk conveniently can he enters from those slips the accounts to the credit of the different persons who's names appear on the slips—they would be first posted into the journal, and then into the ledger account of the customer, and then it would be the prisoner's duty to take the different remittances and make out a credit slip on Martin's Bank, an ordinary paying-in slip—our firm banks with Martin and Co., but we open accounts with all our correspondents, and in that sense we are bankers as well—the prisoner came into our service about 6th August, 1879—he used to have a salary of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—he opened a ledger account with the firm—on 3rd February I find an entry in the black book of 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with "U. A. W." (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's initials</hi>) against it—the whole of the entry is in his writing—that purports to show that U. A.

A. W., "U. A. W., Beckett 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ditto notes 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on the paying-in slip of 8th June appears U. A.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been nearly six years in Keyser and Co.'s service—I am, on the whole, fairly well acquainted with the business of the house—I am chief clerk—we are bankers, and at the same time have a banking account at Martin's; we have had that as long as I have been there—all money is paid in, except what we want for the working expenses, for cash—Martin and Co. are the people to whom notes and cash would be paid in the ordinary course, and it is therefore quite proper to pay in notes, bills, and cash to them to Keyser and Co.'s credit—Keyser and Co. have control by the cheques they draw; of whatever sums are paid into their credit at Martin and Co.'s, and Keyser only—therefore it would be quite proper to pay the cheque sent by Marcus and Volknar into Keyser's account at Martin's—I see on this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "Martin and Co." twice—I have no doubt it was paid into Keyser and Co.'s account at Martin's, and that Keyser and Co. have had the benefit of it in their account with Martin—Martin and Co. have credited us with it, and have been debiting us ever since with the cheques we have drawn against that account—so far as that money is concerned it went in the accustomed channel—this bill on the Imperial Ottoman Bank of London would come within the description of drafts payable in London—this cheque is endorsed A. Keyser and Co. by Mr. Franklin, one of the firm, and then it found its way as I have described—I find on one of these two notes of the set of three constituting the bill for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mr. Keyser's endorsement, he is another partner; therefore, subse<lb/>quently to their coming to London he has put his name on them—I see Martin and Co.'s name on the back of that bill, but it is a paying-in stamp not a receipt—the bill is payable on 23rd March—on the paying-in slip for that date is "400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I cannot say that that was paid into Martin's, if the bill went to Martin's we should have credit for it in our account with them—I cannot say that slip containing the entry of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. refers to that bill—I have no doubt the draft has been paid into Martin's, but I cannot say it applies to that slip—Mr. Youngman's cheque of 21st May, 1885, for 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has Keyser and Co.'s endorsement on it, so that it must have arrived and</p>

               <p>been put before one of the partners for his endorsement; it is Mr. Slazenger's endorsement—on it is "Received, Martin and Co.," I have no doubt it has gone through their bank, paid into our account—the prisoner had made an entry in the books as if he had paid the money to Keyser and Co., when he had not—he has had an account with the firm in their books almost ever since he has been there, and he has got and paid us moneys—the result of the entries is that he has been credited with the account at Keyser and Co., which he has never paid, and there<lb/>fore, if he had overdrawn his account, it reduces the claim against him by those credit entries—large amounts have passed through his account, many entries, on one side and on the other, in a month; and apart from these credit entries we complain of, he has paid moneys that have been put to his credit, and he has drawn out different items at different times—the cashier makes payments at Keyser and Co.'s—there is only one recognised cashier, and the money to make the payments is placed in his control during the day, but there are three or four clerks in the establish<lb/>ment who pay money—there are two tills, to which they go as they have to pay money—we use cheques, by which money can be drawn from Keyser and Co.; those cheques are honoured by the clerks when they come in—the prisoner, when he wanted money, drew cheques on Keyser and Co., and those would be honoured by the cashier, and debited to his account in the ordinary way—the prisoner sometimes got money as well from the clerks that paid the cheques, applying to them for it and signing a paper containing the amount given to him, and his account would be debited with the money so received—he would get cash payments generally for small amounts, and draw cheques for larger ones—that would be the course of business—he would sometimes draw a cheque on me, which he would pass away, and then it would be brought in like other cheques—if he wanted large amounts, the firm would sometimes draw on Martin and Co. in his favour—for small amounts paid over the counter there would be an entry in the cash book first of all, and then ultimately they would be posted to his ledger account—his own cheques, if paid over the counter, would also go into the cash book of the day, and ultimately be debited to him—if the payment was a large one, and by cheque circulated before payment, it would be paid for by a cheque drawn on Martin's, and then would be charged in No. 8 book and debited to his account—I have no doubt the books have been properly posted, and that all the items received in this way have been charged to his account, and therefore all the entries to his credit are posted to the account, where all the entries to his debit have been made, in parallel columns—the result of writing his own name as having paid money when he had not is to diminish the account against himself—he sometimes overdrew his account—payments are essentially the work of the one recognised cashier, but it is done by the three or four clerks under him; they assist him when cheques are presented; they make payments—if any question arises as to whether a cheque shall be paid, the cashier consults the principals.</p>

               <p>—No. 2 account is not between Keyser and Co. and Messell and Co.; it does not read "Keyser and Co. in account with Messell and Co."—that account does not appear in our ledger; we have papers sent, "Keyser and Co. in account with Messell and Co.; "that formed the basis of the account—these were our servant's transactions both as to buying and selling, but they took place in our name—we had transactions with Messell and Co. ourselves, for which we gave instructions; that is not No. 1 account; there is no No. 1 account—the accounts showing moneys to be paid on No. 2 account and paid by Messell and Co., are debited and credited to our ser<lb/>vant's account, but not with the knowledge of any members of the firm—after No. 2 account was opened I am sorry to say I never looked to see the nature of the engagements which were being entered into in our name, but my partner did, and when he found anything that he did not like he complained—he is not here, he was here yesterday—in February, 1885, we paid Messell and Co. on the prisoner's account 403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all that was debited to him with Messell and Co. in our name, and our firm actually paid it—nearly all the sums we debited him with in January 1885, are drafts on us, except 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 28 of them are marked cash and 17 of them are drafts on us—on February 2nd here is "Cash 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." that would be got by giving the ticket and getting 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the cashier—the ticket for it would be in the till; whether he put it there and took the money out, or whether the cashier did it for him the ticket would be deposited to debit his account with the money, but generally the cashier would pay him the money—in May, 1885, we received 1,826<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his account as money due from Messell's on these transactions—his account was not frequently overdrawn to the knowledge of any member of the firm—I have been looking through the books—the April account is balanced; it was overdrawn in April, it may be 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

What he had done was to draw cheques which might not have been honoured if the prosecutors had known all the facts, but that was not larceny or embezzlement, and he therefore ought to be acquitted, and not put to the expense of having a question argued in the Court of Criminal Appeal which had been already decided there.

               <p>11.30, I saw the prisoner in the Lord Napier—from instructions I received I told him I should detain him on suspicion of setting fire to the house—he said, "I know nothing whatever about it, we were all sitting at supper when the alarm of fire was raised"—I asked him who he meant by all—he said, "Kate, myself, and the rest of the barmaids"—I handed him him over to Sergeant Leeman, who took him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I recollect exactly what passed, I made a note of it at the time, which I have here—I made it about half-past 3, having de<lb/>tained him there till the fire was over—I had nothing to drink, three-pennyworth was allowed after the fire was over at half-past 2 to the firemen and police engaged—I should say the prisoner had been drinking, but he was not drunk.</p>

On the night of the fire I was on duty near the Lord Napier—about a quarter past 11 I heard screams and rang the bell—Mr. Young was with me, he had walked about 100 yards with me—I went for the fire engine as quickly as I could—after the fire was extinguished I took the prisoner into custody; that was about half-past 3—I told him I should take him into custody for setting fire to the house; he made no answer at the time—at the station, when the charge was read over to him, he said, "I did not do it, neither do I know how it got on fire."</p>

I was potman at the Rose of Denmark; I am now potman at the Lord Napier—on this Sunday I went to the Lord Napier at 10 minutes past 9 and saw the prisoner there; I knew him by going in there as a customer—I asked him how he was getting on—he said, "I am all right up till now, how are you getting on?"—I said, "I am all right up till now"—he said; "It will soon be all over by-and-by"—that was all that passed—I did not ask him what he meant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went over the two rooms; they were burnt out, the roof was off—I stepped on the rafters, portions of the boards were left, no shelves—there were portions of a bed left and other things that had been burnt, it was almost difficult to know what they were—I should judge there had been intense heat—about a foot in width of the floor remained, not enough to walk round the sides of the room—in some places there might have been a little patch unburnt at the side, not more than a foot or so—I am speaking of the lumber room—the rafters were about 15 inches apart, they were only partially burnt—the things lay crossways on them—there was rubbish remaining piled up in different parts of the room, if it had all been scraped up there might have been a cubic yard, what I should call a cartload—I did not notice enough to see whether there was any place where a bottle might have lain hid; it is possible it might be behind some rubbish without me seeing it—if the label had been on the bottle at the time of the fire I should hardly have expected it to have survived—I went there for the purpose of taking the dimensions of the room and making this plan, not for any other purpose.</p>
