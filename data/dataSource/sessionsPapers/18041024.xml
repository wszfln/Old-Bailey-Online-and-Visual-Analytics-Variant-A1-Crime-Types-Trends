On the Saturday it was in the same situation; I went to look again on Monday morning, and found the bag filled, in another place a little farther; it was a sack that would hold a bushel; it was pretty near full of split beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to this place? - A. Yes, constantly, the beans were kept there in a little room: On Tuesday, at near eleven o'clock, the prisoner came in with his cart; he went into the stable, and came out again in about two minutes with a tarpauling; I perceived he had something concealed in the tarpauling by the bulk; he put it into his cart, and I gave information to Mr. Viner; the prisoner went away, and I went to look in the stable, and missed the bag; I saw it again at the Office on the Saturday following; I knew it again by a patch near the bottom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peatt. Q. It was a very common thing for the prisoner to carry out bags with beans? - A. Yes, but not a single bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Viner has a great many bags? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who put the bags there? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a corn-dealer and miller: I have a room at the end of the hay-loft, where we keep a quantity of beans for our horses; we send a weekly allowance there; the prisoner only had to feed the horses; they were delivered into his custody for that purpose. In consequence of Mr. Francis's information, I followed the cart, the prisoner was driving it; he was taking a load out; he had part of the load to deliver in Old Gravel-lane; I followed the cart there, and when he had delivered the goods, he went into the house; I went up to the cart, and observed the tarpauling on the top of the cart bulky, it was doubled up on the top of the load; I asked him what he had got in the tarpauling; he said he had got nothing; I desired him to take it down; he got upon the cart, and pretended to open it; I insisted upon his opening it more than he had done, and I then discovered a bag with beans in it; I made him take the bag out, and leave it in the house, and I went in search of an officer to take them away; I went with the officer, and he took the bag of beans; they were beans that I knew perfectly well, because they were damaged before they were split; they were very remarkable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240007"/>for age, smell, and blackness; I am sure they were my beans.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peatt. Q. Did you never give directions to the carman to take beans with him to give the horses a taste on the road? - A. No, I never would have suffered such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This tarpauling was often used for covering your goods? - A. Yes, in wet weather, but this was a remarkably fine day.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you bid him a less price than eighteen guineas? - A.No; it was a very useful serviceable house; I asked him if it was his own; he said his father kept two breeding mares, and had bred this from one of them on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was his father's? - A. No, he said it was his own property.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you then buy him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say where his father lived? - A. Yes, he said he came near Hindon, but I cannot mention the place's name; I told him it appeared to me that he had stole the horse, and then he jumped up upon the horse, and was for making off; I caught hold of him, and he said I had no business with the horse nor him either; I seized him upon the horse, and gave charge of him to some other people, while I went over the way to the Magistrate's; I came back, and found the horse upon the same spot; the people had got the prisoner off.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the horse? - A. The horse was taken into the stable, and the prisoner into the parlour, at the Duke's Head; I brought the horse up to Bow-street, and the prisoner was brought up by the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at Bow-street, when young Harding saw the horse? - A. No; the horse was put into the stable, and delivered to Mr. Harding, and he took him home with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person here who received the horse from you? - A. No; I saw the same horse last Sunday at Belfont; Mr. Harding rode him up, and sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harding.) Was the horse that Hankin saw you with on Sunday last, the same horse that you had missed out of the field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was your father's horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hankin.) Are you sure the horse you saw on Sunday last, was the same horse the prisoner offered you for sale? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harding.) Where did you get the horse from? - A. From a stable near Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the horse? - A. I should suppose it was worth twenty guineas, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Berwick St. Leonard to Belfont? - A. Eighty-four miles.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hankin.) Was he worth more than fourteen guineas? - A. I should not have liked to have given more than that, knowing nothing of him; I should have thought him worth that money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find your watch? - A. Yes, I found it on Mrs. Brown; I went in pursuit of her to her lodgings, in Baldwin's gardens, Gray's Inn lane, and waited there till she came home, and the woman that I live with was with me; the prisoner came home to her lodgings a little after twelve o'clock, as we were waiting at her door; I told her I would secure her till I found the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Behave decently. (The prosecutor appeared very much intoxicated.)</p>
               <p>Q.Who searched her? - A. She dropped the watch on the ground, after I had charged the watchman with her; I saw him take the watch up, but I did not see it fall.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; on the 22d of September, about a quarter before one o'clock, this man came with the prisoner at the bar and insisted on my taking charge of her, and on her entering the watch-house door she dropped the watch; she said, she only took it out of a joke, that he should not see what o'clock in the night it was. (Produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Look at that watch, and tell me whether that is your's? - A. It certainly is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the particular mark that you discover it by? (The prosecutor looks at the keys and the seal.) - A. There are two different keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the watch itself; how long have you had it? - A. About two years and a half; I will swear it is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know the watch by? - A. By the paper inside of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What do you know the paper by? - A. It is a paper very much worn; I put it in so fill the case up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it is a printed piece of paper, or a plain piece of paper? - A. I never examined it very much; I know it is torn at one corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the watch or the maker's name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have known the prosecutor about two years, and he and the woman that he cohabits with are very much addicted to drinking; he gave me the watch for an improper connexion with me; I did not wish to have any concern with him; this man has very often tried to get the better of me, and he has taken half a guinea at a time out of my pocket, and has got very much in liquor with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the watch? - A. As I was going through Clement's lane he was beating and turning the woman out that he lives with; she called me, and said, Betsey, come in, for God's sake, I shall be murdered; I had been out a charing to Mrs. Large, and I had half a crown and some victuals for my day's work; I gave her some supper, and spent the half-crown and 3 s. more with her; I drank more than I ought, the more to my shame be it spoken, and I begged to lie down, and the old man, the prosecutor, said to me, here, take this watch; he wanted to have connexion with me; I have an uncle, a man of property at South Lambeth, so he thought to make a property of me; I was not guilty of it; by all account, he does not care what he does for money.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the money of the draft? - A. Thirteen pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence; I had no change to give him the difference; I do not know whether he gave me the draft, or somebody else; I asked him if he would wait till I ran to Drummonds' and Co. and get the change; I told him I should not be gone long; he said he would call in the evening for the difference; he offered to leave the goods; I told him, no, there was no occasion for that; I was going to the West end of the town that night, I called at Drummond's, and offered that draft, and it was refused.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. I do not exactly recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find him at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of the wig? - A.Five guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240011"/>Q. Should you know the draft again if you saw it? - A. I should not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He had been at your house before? - A. Yes, I had seen him several times before; he was a remarkable person.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not want to take the wig away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He offered to leave the wig; you telling him you would go to Messrs. Drummonds'? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about the distance of two miles and a half; Messrs. Drummonds' is at Charing-cross? - A. Yes, I told him he might take the wig.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took the check to Messrs. Drummonds', and it was refused; how soon after that did you part with that draft? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it away from Messrs. Drummonds'? - A. O yes, I took it away, and I gave it to my father, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the draft again? - A. I cannot say exactly; about six weeks after I saw it at the office, when the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>- READ sworn. - I am cashier to Messrs. Drummonds' bank, at Charing-cross.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable belonging to the office in Worship-street, on the 14th of August I apprehended the prisoner at the outside door of this court with a city constable, he was inside of the court and I called him out, and he came out, I was not certain of the prisoner's person; I asked him his name; he told me his name was Rippingham; I asked him if his father lived in Ratcliff highway; he said, yes: I then told him that there was an information lodged against him at Worship street office, on suspicion of having committed a forgery on Mr. Ross, in Bishopsgate-street; his answer was, that he had sent a friend to Mr. Ross to compromise that business, and that Mr. Ross had promised his friend that he would not proceed any farther for the present; he was then taken before the Lord Mayor, and there he was ordered to be taken before the Magistrate in Worship-street; this check I received from Mr. Ross, the elder; it was marked on the back by Mr. Ross.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you apprehended him his observation was, that he had sent a friend to compromise the business with Mr. Ross; was not that the expression; and he thought it was settled? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER ROSS, sen. sworn. - Q. You are the father of the first witness? - A. Yes. My lord, I am in that situation in life, that I should be sorry for any person to think I should compromise this business.</p>
               <p>Court. A thousand things may be said behind your back, that does not attach upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive this check? - A. Mrs. Ross brought up the check to me, and asked if I would give the difference; I said, I will not give any change; the check was given to my clerk, and it was in my possession some time; I thought it might be a fraud, and I sent two or three people after him; and I went after him myself to his father; I said, you are the father of him; tell him to come and take the check; I had no idea of it being a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. The check which the officer Vickery has produced to day, and was produced before the Magistrate, you swear you had it from your clerk, and who he had it from, you yourself do not know personally? - A. I do not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a journeyman to Mr. Ross, the prisoner came to our house the latter end of July, or the beginning of August.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the draft? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that draft before? (The draft handed to him.) - A. I have seen it before in my master's clerks hands, and in Mr. and Mrs. Ross's hands; I am not positive whether I had it in my own hands or not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not have it in your own hands, how do you know it is the same draft? - A. Because I have seen Mrs. Ross and several people reading of it; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Ross, jun.) You look at that draft, is that the same draft you received from the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear positively to that, because it was not in my possession.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not know, at the time, what they were taking? - A. No; they went out two or three times, the waiter said, but I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say so before; mind my question - was Welch in their company at the time? - A. Welch had been in the course of the day drinking with me; I went up to the Duke's-head, and Welch came in with this same mahogany.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you think he is sober?</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, I live at the Northumberland arms, Russell street, Covent-garden: Welch, the young man at the bar, came into my house on last Monday morning se'nnight, about six o'clock, and stopped drinking there a good while; the men that worked at the Hummums they came, and Follett with them; Welch did not work there, nor his partner, he had a job in the country. I heard one of the men, that worked at the Hummums, say, that Nest had lost his place, he was foreman before; the other men said, that Collins had got the place to be foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Collins one of those men that came in? - A. No, not early in the morning; he came in afterwards, between nine and ten o'clock, when Welch and his partner were going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing in with him; - A. He brought in a piece of mahogony with him; he asked me to put it inside of the bar; it was a small shelf, he put it in one corner of the bar, and it was there the greatest part of the day; I did not see any body take it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. First of all, Welch and his partner came into your house, they were not at work at the Hummums; Follett, and the men that were at work at the Hummums, came in by themselves; after they were in, did he join in company with those men? - A. They were drinking altogether in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Collins came in at the same time with this piece of mahogany? - A. Yes; and they all drank together.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street: I was standing at our Office-door when Mr. Nest and Mr. Headson came; I went with Nest to the prisoner's lodgings, at No. 26, Litchfield-street, on the 17th of this month, where I apprehended Follett, I found no property there; I brought him down to the watch-house at the same time; this Follett, he behaved very well; I told him I had got information from Mr. Headson, the head carpenter, that he had robbed Mr. Brown, of the Hummums, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he told you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he do to you? - A. That was flung out; we generally meet with a small trifle of a skirmish; we do not call that any thing, that was flung out by the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You hang upon that it was flung out; was there any circumstance of an axe in the case? - A. When I entered the room along with Nest, he took up his axe and struck at me, but he did not hit me; he was very much intoxicated with liquor at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a deal better behaviour; what did he say to you? - A.Says he, I will be the death of you; I was glad to get out of the room.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know what you can make of that fellow Nest's behaviour; and as to you, you have behaved very improper; you have not told the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240013"/>truth, but you have represented that he behaved extremely well.

When I had cooked the dinner, I went into the bar, and laid the cloth, and I asked him to have a bit of dinner with us; accordingly he did: he asked me if I thought Mrs. Harrison could make him up a bed, as he had come down with a view of stopping there all night; I told him the house was very small, but I had no doubt but Mrs. Harrison would make him up a bed; he said he did not care where he laid, as he must lay there that night; with that, after the dinner was over, he stopped a good bit, and I went into the tap-room, and the young man sat down; I went out, and went across the way, and come back again, and the young man was gone; I do not know when he went, I never missed him; about half past three in the afternoon, a person came and called for some gin and water; I desired the girl to bring in a little warm water, which she did, and going to the till I missed the spoons; there was one table-spoon, two tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs missing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen them before? - A. I saw them when I sat down to dinner; after I missed them I was very much frightened, and began to ask when the young man went out; finding him gone, and not paying for the pint of beer, and never saying he was going away, and knowing nobody had been in the bar but him and ourselves, I knew it must be him.</p>

He humbly implores that this honourable Court will grant him that mercy and humanity, which makes them so conspicuous.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Harrison.) Did Mrs. Harrison come to town after the prisoner? - A. When I came home, my wife's sister told her what had happened; she said to me, my dear, I must tell you I have been robbed; that man that went away from you at Westminster, has been here; with that my wife went to town on Saturday, and said, I will not leave town till I find him, or meet him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again? - A. No; she went by the watchman as he was crying the hour of one, the watchman told me, and I went by as he was crying the hour of three; I slept all that time; she wandered away home, and I never saw her before last Saturday, she was in at the Bull; I asked her then about this watch; she denied it to me, and said she knew nothing at all about it; with that, the landlady went out, and fetched in two officers, and they took her into custody, and put her in the watch-house; I appeared before the Justice, in Worship-street, on Monday, about eleven o'clock; there she owned she had taken the watch from me.</p>

I asked her if she knew any thing about it, and she kept denying it, but when she came before the Magistrate, she owned she had taken it, and she asked the liberty of my going with her, and Ray, the officer, and we went to the house that she carried it to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watch there? - A. No, the watch was not in the house; she told me she went there in the morning, after she had been with me, and rapped at the door, and the mistress of the house said, who is there; she said, Molly, and she opened the door; she said to the prisoner, where have you been all night; the prisoner said to her, I have been with a countryman, and I have drawed him of his watch; this woman said, Mary, let me look at it; she took it in her hands, and she said she did not know whether she put it under the bed, or under the cloaths.</p>

            ; the prisoner at the bar was a driver of one of our waggons; the waggon the prisoner drove came from Gloucester on the 26th, and arrived in London about three o'clock in the morning on the 29th: he came the last stage into London.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot tell that? - A. He was employed by me, upon the last stage, to bring the waggon into London; the waggon was locked up; we never open the waggon but at Cheltenham, Gloucester, North-Leech, Burford, and Oxford: at these places, there are keys with the different book-keepers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Whatever parcel or package that was put into your waggon to come from either of these places to London, is there any account taken of them? - A. Yes; this was taken up at Cheltenham; the way-bill has an account of the goods; I received it from the prisoner at the bar, upon the arrival of the waggon on the 29th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the way-bill, and see whether there is any article directed to Sir

            ? - A.There is, directed to Sir E. Bailey, 5 s. 4 d.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it a box or a trunk? - A. A trunk to Sir E. Bailey; they never put the address in our invoice, nothing but the article.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. What is the sum charged against that? - A.5 s. 4 d.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the way-bill delivered by the prisoner to you? - A. Yes, I received the way-bill, and was present at the unloading of the waggon, and there was no trunk directed to Sir E. Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account for the sum which is charged against it to you? - A. Never, in any way whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any parcel directed to Mr. Budding? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar, as driver on that occasion, account to you for that package or the produce of it? - A. Not in any way at all.</p>

               <p>Q. The custom I suppose is to deliver the waybill immediately on the waggon's return to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is an invoice of what is put in at Gloucester, and there is a way-bill of what is taken in in the way; then at Cheltenham they put in, where they change horses; and whatever they take in at Northleech, that is put in the way-bill; and at Oxford, if they have a parcel, that is put in the way-bill; and so the same way-bill comes to London, and is evidence of what things are put in at these places? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood the prisoner to be the person that took the waggon from Gerard's cross to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never comes back from Gloucester? - A. O yes, he comes back in his regular routine of the waggon's going.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is he coming from Gloucester to London? - A. About a fortnight, from his going out to his coming in, I am not exactly correct in that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that sometimes a waggoner may make a mistake in his accounts, and he may correct it in another? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always had correct waggoners? - A. The way-bill corrects them; I was in the way when the waggon arrived: I questioned him about these trunks; he declared he knew nothing of them; he told me the waggon was exactly as he received it from Gerard's cross; he swore it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If there was any mistake in the way-bill it must have arisen at Cheltenham, because there they gave the way-bill, and there they put down the articles in the way-bill, and therefore, when he brought this way-bill, and you looking over the parcels finding a trunk in the way-bill and not in the waggon, you asked him how that came, and he said it was as he received it from the last carrier? - A.Justly so.</p>

Yes, about three o'clock as near as I can guess: I received a box and a trunk; I have the book here;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240017"/>it was written in the book by my master from my dictation, - Cheltenham-waggon, Bailey, a trunk, left 3 s.

Yes, I am pretty sure he was the driver of the Gloucester and Cheltenham waggon on that occasion; I have no doubt but that it was the prisoner; I took them into the warehouse; the trunk to Sir E.

               <p>Q. And then, when my friend put it more confidently on your part, you said you had no doubt whether you could positively swear it was him, aye or no? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you were pretty sure it was him; do you mean to swear it was him, or you believe it was him? - A. I am pretty sure it was him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he delivered the box and the trunk, did you pay him the carriage? - A. No, my master paid it in the evening when the man called.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Who told you to charge 3 s. for one and 4 s. for the other? - A. The waggoner; one was taken in at Cheltenham; he did not tell me where the other was taken in at; I put it down in chalk till my master came down, and then my master put it in the book.</p>

            , the other prisoner; I hired him to conduct a bakehouse, in Union street, Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Armitage recommend him to you as a servant? - A. He recommended him to me as an honest worthy servant; he said he would be bound for his honesty, he had lived with him for six or eight months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he was to manage a bakehouse there for you; what wages was he to have? - A. Eighteen shillings per week and the privilege of the bakings; I took the house, and bought the fixtures, and put him in, as <rs id="t18041024-32-viclabel163" type="occupation">baker</rs>, the same as the others; I had one or two more at the same time; I paid every expence of the business; the assize-papers, salt, yeast, and coals, and every individual thing; I paid for the printer's bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into that house, and into that business for you? - A. He did; I from my own stock provided flour; he paid me as he sold the bread for the consumption; we settled once a week, on Thursday; I believe I always went to him; I settled up to the 6th of September, debtor and creditor. (Produces the book.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell the flour to him, or did he receive it as your servant? - A. I never sold to him a sack of flour, but he was to account to me as bread; on the 6th of September there remained twelve sacks of flour on hand; that was on Thursday; on the Tuesday following he came to my house; he said he wanted some more flour; he was getting on famously; he baked a great deal of it, and begged I would send him some fresh flour in; I immediately ordered twelve sacks to be sent to him; this was on the 11th; on the 13th, Thursday, I went, as usual, to settle with him, and very much to my surprize, I found the house shut up, and every thing taken away that he possibly could, and he himself was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Armitage come to your house at all? - A. Yes, he came to my house on the 16th; he enquired if I had heard or seen any thing of Trotman; I said, I think, Armitage, you know where he is; he declared to me that he had not seen him; he wished he had, for that he had borrowed of him 5 l. the week before, on purpose to make my money up, and he had run away with it; on the 22d I went to Armitage; he lives on Saffron-hill; Mr. Cole was with me; I knocked at Armitage's door; he is a baker; I said, what, Armitage, are you here; I told him I rather suspected he knew something about Trotman, and about the flour, as I had told him at my house; he said he knew nothing about the flour; I told him I believed I should make him know something about it, before I had done with him; I looked round the shop, and could not see any sack belonging to me, but one, and that was marked Hobrey; it was standing with salt in it; I had sent that sack to Trotman with flour in it some time before, and I had seen the sack at Trotman's house with some salt in it, that he had bought of some person, not on my account; he denied the flour; I sent for Mr. Trott, an officer, and when he came Armitage was very much frightened and alarmed; then he acknowledged to have received twelve sacks of flour from Trotman, but he would not keep them; he sent them away the next morning; I asked him where he sent them to; he said, Trotman took them away himself, he did not know where they were gone to; we were altogether, Trott, Armitage, and me; Trott said that he had observed some few sacks of flour go out a few days before, and he could not make out where the flour went to.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did Trott and you go to any person's house? - A. To one Salter's, a Baker, in Leather-lane, and there I found two sacks that I had sent from my own house to Trotman's; it had not been unsewed, it had the appearance of being in the same state as I had sent it from my own warehouse to Trotman's, and there was another sack, marked Man, but I did not swear to that, I had no doubt of it; after this I came back to Armitage, and told him what we had found; then he acknowledged to the receiving of twelve sacks from Trotman.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he produce any bill or receipt to you? - A. Yes, he produced a receipt for twelve sacks of flour, signed by Trotman; D - n me, says he, that is the receipt, you can do me no harm, I have bought the twelve sacks of flour, and paid for it; the receipt expressed twelve sacks of flour: I said to him, that would not account for the 15; Trott took him then into custody, and took him to a public-house; he seemed very much frightened; if this be the case, says he, I will tell you the whole about it; Mr. Tusting, I should never have served you so, if you had not used me ill; I told him that I never had used him ill; he said I had, in not letting Trotman be best for him, in some difference there was between his wife and him; he said, I will tell you were Trotman is; he has been at my house near a week, and he left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240021"/>me on Wednesday last, and he is gone down to the Devizes, but if I would not believe him, if I would go to an inn at the top of Fleet-street, I should find his box, directed Crouch; he had altered his name, for fear I should find him out; I accordingly went to this inn, as he directed me, one of the waggon-inns, just at the top of Fleet-market; I did not find his box; I found an entry of the box, in the name of Crouch; upon this, Trott and I went to the Devizes that evening; we got there the next morning very early, and there I found Trotman in a little room, with his wife, at a public-house, up stairs; they seemed to be repacking their clothes up; Mr. Trott entered the room before I did; I was close by to hear what passed; Mr. Trott said, you are the man that we want; you must pack up your things and go with us; he said he would get packed up directly; I was in the room all the time; Trott asked him if he had any property belonging to me; Trott found some money on him, that he acknowledged to be my money for the bread he had manufactured the week before, and also a debt that he had got from a neighbouring person, it was 11 l. I asked him if he had received any money of Armitage; he said he had not received a single farthing of it, nor for the flour sold, nor the candles; he had borrowed 2 s. of his wife, which he paid him at that time; he told us that Armitage desired him to give a receipt, in case that I should find out the flour, that he might shew the receipt, that I might not do any thing to him; he gave him the receipt, in the presence of Paul Hatton, but it was a false receipt; he acknowledged to being with Armitage, and he had been down a day or two in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Before Armitage said any thing to you about it, you probably told him, it would be better to confess? - A. I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you would prosecute him? - A. I meant to do it, if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten him you would prosecute him, if he did not confess? - A. No, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Armitage came to you, after Trotman had gone off? - A. It appears to me, that he was at his own house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He was gone from Union-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He produced a receipt to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Trotman was your servant? - A. Yes, he was.</p>

            , bread and biscuit baker; and the cards that you paid for, were made out in his name? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q.Henry Trotman, bread and biscuit baker and flour manufacturer, Union-street, Kingsland-road; this is the card he distributed to your customers, therefore he appeared to the customers, and the world at large, as one who had the management of the shop; as one that kept the shop; who made the return? - A. He made the return, but I never charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Trotman, as the proprietor, did not make the return in his name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Any body might suppose Trotman was the master; did any body besides Armitage know of the engagement between Trotman and you? - A. It was not likely that any body should know; I do not know that any body knew of any engagement but Armitage and him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You had employed Trotman to open a cheap bread shop; a loaf for three-halfpence less than any body else would sell it for, and he was to return the money of what he had sold? - A. Yes, he had no right to sell a sack of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had sold a sack of flour, he was to return you the money? - A. To be sure he was; he had no right to sell a sack of flour at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he sold a sack of flour to

               <p>Q. Did you ever make any application to the prisoner, that if he would pay you the money, to the amount of what the flour was sold, you would let him off? - A. I never have.</p>
               <p>Q. You know very well, as a baker, a return should be made every week; did not you desire the prisoner at the bar to make your return, as under your direction? - A. He was my servant, and had a right to go by my directions, or else I would have turned him off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever give him any profit of any flour he had sold? - A. No, he had his wages and the privilege of the bakings.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are an officer of Hatton-garden? - A. Yes, on Saturday, the 22d of September, I went to the house of Mr. Armitage.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the account which Mr. Tusting gave? - A. Yes, it is true; there is one thing that Mr. Tusting has not related; the prisoner Trotman asked me who had told me where to find him; I told him it was Armitage; he said, he was a d - d rogue; then I put the question how much flour he had sold to Armitage; he said, fifteen sacks; there was an agreement made for twelve sacks, of which Armitage got him to give a receipt for; I said, why not give a receipt for the whole fifteen; I cannot exactly remember the words about the receipt; it was something concerning the receipt-stamp would not do for the whole amount; he said that Armitage said to him, if he had a receipt for twelve sacks that would take off any suspicion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This was what Trotman said; Armitage was not present? - A. No, Trotman said he had received no money from Armitage; he supposed he should be served the same way as he had served Mr. Tusting, get none; I produce the three sacks I received from Mr. Salter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a few days before seen any flour removed from Armitage's? - A. Yes; I live nearly opposite; it might be three or four days before that Saturday; I was coming out of the door, going up to the Office, and I observed a grey horse, which is not able to carry flour a great way, and a very little cart; I observed the sacks being put in in a great hurry; it struck me very surprisingly that he had not been in the shop long, on account of removing the flour; I saw them put it in a cart opposite Armitage's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the flour come out of Armitage's house? - A. I did not take particular notice; I saw three or four sacks put into the cart; on the morning of the 22d, I went and enquired, and these are the sacks I had from Mr. Salter; one of them is marked with a piece of leather, No. 1; Mr. Tusting told me it was marked so. (The sacks produced and identified by Mr. Tusting.)</p>
               <p>Trotman's defence. Mr. Tusting, the prosecutor, employed me to print these bills; he indited them himself at his own house, and what was denominated to me as wages, was in case of fines, before I went before the Lord-Mayor; I told him the consequence, that I was going to do a thing that was wrong; he did not seem to like me to have that shop, without I made an affidavit of the return; he said, you must go and do it; I am sorry he has betrayed me as he has done; he allowed me to sell the flour, I did not do any thing but what he allowed; he said if I had not flour in the shop, to come to his warehouse for it.</p>

               <p>Armitage's defence. I did not know that Mr. Trotman was a servant of Mr. Tusting's; I happened to see a hand-bill - Trotman, bread and biscuit-baker, and flour manufacturer, Union-street, Kingsland-road; bread sold three-halfpence under the assize price; flour sold by the sack or score, at the shortest notice. - There is a hand-bill there of the same.</p>

I cannot say that, I was at too great a distance from the place, I proceeded about half way across the street; when the door opened, the prisoner rushed out, and struck Mrs. Wilson on the face, I did not see the blow directed particularly on the face of the lady, as he passed he gave a violent blow; running up Thayer-street, the prisoner was passing by me, I sprang and seized him; he struggled, and with his right-hand raised an instrument, and made a violent blow at me, which very luckily I avoided as much as I could; it was an iron crow, I saw it afterwards; he struck me on the thigh, and just cut through the skin, (the crow produced); that is the crow, he struck me with that.</p>

On the second floor front room; the door of that room had been forced with that crow, or one similar; I likewise found some marks on the copper; the copper had been raised out of the brick-work, the marks exactly fitted this crow; there was a dark lantern in the house; I produce it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a surgeon? - A. Yes, in Thayer-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being called in on the evening of that day to this lady, Mrs. Wilson? - A. Yes, about seven o'clock in the evening; I found Mrs. Wilson had received an extensive wound on the right side of the face, near two inches in length; it appeared to be inflicted by a sharp instrument; at the inferior part of the wound the instrument had penetrated into the mouth; it had cut through the flesh; it is what we denominate a fresh wound; one of the large double teeth in the lower jaw was loosened in the socket, and there was a considerable hemorrhage. (The crow shewn to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt but it might be done by such an instrument as this? - A. I have no doubt but such an instrument as this would inflict such a wound.</p>

               <p>Q. When were you robbed? - A. On Friday, the 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the whole of the house to yourself? - A. No; I let the middle room on the first floor to a lodger; I rent the whole of the house myself, I only let one room to a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - A. I have six children, but only five at home; myself, wife, and five children.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday night at what time did you go to bed? - A. About ten; it might be rather before.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house do you sleep in? - A.In the upper room of all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to bed first? - A. My wife slept down in the lower apartment with two of the youngest children, they being ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was up last? - A. My wife was up after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell how your house was fastened when you went to bed? - A. No; my wife fastened it all but the front door, which she did not, because there is a young man belonging to Sadler's Wells, and he used to fasten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed about ten o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your cloaths? - A. I had been at work without my coat; I am a tailor by trade, and a labourer in the East-India Company's warehouses; I had been at work without my coat; my waistcoat I threw on a chest, which I sat to work upon, at the foot of the bed; my breeches and stockings I threw on the floor, as I sat at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the course of the night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your room-door any lock or bolt? - A. It had a lock, but the key was on the outside, and was a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that door was shut? - A. Yes, it catches very easy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut the door yourself? - A. Yes; I was the last that went up stairs; the three children were in bed before I went into the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning did you get up? - A. About five; I have a Dutch clock, and I set the alarum at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the cloaths you had pulled off? - A. I had left my coat below; I found my breeches and stockings on the floor, where I had left them; my waistcoat was moved off the chest on to the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not laid it on the chair? - A. Yes, I am quite certain; when I took it up to put it on, I perceived it to be light; I remembered I had put eight-pence in copper in it over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that gone? - A. Yes; I had three farthings, a bad halfpenny and a farthing, and it was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it tumbled out of your pocket? - A. No, or else it would have been found in the room; I then went down stairs, and found the door wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that your room door was shut when you went to bed? - A. Yes, I can swear that I shut it; there is a catch to pull back, and outside there was a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hook to keep the catch back? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it caught? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come to leave the key on the outside? - A. I was not afraid of any thing; I always shut the door on account of the children, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240026"/>it would give them cold, it being at their feet.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs, did you perceive any thing? - A. The yard door was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. How that was left you cannot tell? - A. My wife fastened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you were the first up in the house? - A. I am certain I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing about the yard door? - A. I could hardly see; it was getting light, it was about five o'clock; I mostly set my clock fast, because I wish to keep my time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your clock strike five? - A. No, the alarum went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you set it for five o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was rather before five than after? - A. It might be rather before than after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing near the yard door? - A. The bar was laying along-side, at the bottom of the door, on the inside of the house; it was only barred with a wooden bar that goes into a staple, and drops into another.</p>
               <p>Q. That must have been opened on the inside? - A. Yes, they came in at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a shutter which goes up on the door? - A. No; there are two small panes of glass at the top, of about eight or nine inches; one of them had been broke ever since I had been in the house; there was a hole in part of it before, but about three parts of the piece was then taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a hand reach from that to the bar? - A. No, I don't suppose it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock to that door? - A. No, but there were two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find them? - A. The door was open in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the passage? - A. I went into the parlour, and I found a scarlet cloth waistcoat lying on the floor, nearly opposite the parlour door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the waistcoat over night? - A. In the drawer in the room where I slept; it was a waistcoat I had made for sale, when I was out of employment; I went into the parlour, where my wife and children slept, and awoke her; I then went up stairs again, thinking my best cloaths were gone; I found them safe in one of the drawers in the room I slept in; I looked about, and observed the two small drawers belonging to an old chest of drawers, one on the ground, and the other at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe them when you got up? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether those were locked? - A. The one which had the money in was, and the key was thrown into the other small drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it locked? - A. I cannot say to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you been at the drawer that was locked? - A. I cannot say; nobody had any business there but myself; it might be a few days, or a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your wife any business with the drawer? - A. She brought money down to me at times, but she has nothing to do with money affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the key was then? - A. No, we could not find the key for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it found? - A.My wife found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of that drawer? - A. I did not miss any thing immediately but the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was it? - A. There were twenty-five guineas in a wooden screw box, and a piece of a letter put inside to make it fix better.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in that screw-box? - A. Twenty-five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box in the drawer? - A. It was at the far end; I used to shove it to the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the box when you found the drawer? - A. It was taken away, containing twenty-five guineas all in guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else gone? - A. I missed several trifling things - a blue silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the same drawer? - A. No; I wore it the day before, and threw it down, and the pad which was inside was shook out, and the handkerchief gone; a knife was in the right hand pocket with the halfpence, which was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Something of a ring was mentioned before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, we did not miss it till afterwards; it used to be put in the drawer where the money was, and many other trifling little things we had no use for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in the possession of any body? - A. Yes, in the possession of Mason, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your ring? - A. Yes; it was an old jeweller's gold ring, with hair in the middle of the stones, not worth above two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your handkerchief or knife again? - A. No, nor box or money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, he lived next door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he occupy a house there? - A. His father did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation that morning between your wife and the prisoner? - A. No; he was not at home that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You went to bed a little after ten? - A. It might be before ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking at all? - A. No, I had been to work up stairs as long as I could see, and after dark I went down stairs to work.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs to bed, you left your wife below? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your bed-room, it was your custom to shut your bed-room door, which had a catch-lock, and the key outside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240027"/>Q. Sometimes it might or might not catch? - A. It would not slam to; I am obliged to pull the knob back inside to shut it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never left it ajar? - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If you left it ajar, it might blow open again, if you cannot swear you shut it? - A. Yes, I can, I never left it open.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not charge your recollection that you had positively bolted that door? - A. To the best of my recollection it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down in the morning, you saw the wooden bar of the yard-door on the floor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Above the yard-door are two panes of glass? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of those was broke before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, you found a drawer on your bed? - A. Yes, upon the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have seen that when you got up? - A. I slept in the bed by myself, and it was dark when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have been put on the bed after you got up? - A. Yes, it might.</p>

               <p>Q. This night did you do any thing towards securing the house? - A. Yes, I always do; I put up the bar at the back-door.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before you went to bed? - A.Almost directly, as soon as my husband went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.His that door any bolts to it? - A. Yes; they are not very good bolts, but the bar is very good.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they both barred? - A. No, the back window was only nailed; one window is to the front, and the other to the back; the back window was never opened; the front had a large wooden bar across the two shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the front door? - A. My lodger fastened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at home that night when you went to bed? - A. Yes, but he fastened the front door.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about a ring? - A. Yes; Mason came, and asked me if I missed any thing; he shewed it me, and I knew it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You went to bed at a quarter past ten? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did you get up? - A. Not till after my husband came down; it was hardly light.</p>

             said it was her's; I then searched her, and the first thing I found was a new silver seal; I asked her how she came by it; she said the prisoner gave it her; I found a ring in her pocket, and asked her how she came by it, in the prisoner's hearing; she said it was an old ring of her mother's; I did not think it of any consequence, and I put it down with the rest of the other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the whole account she gave of it? - A. At that time I laid it down; with the money and things she had, and left it; Mr. Armstrong came, and we took Swan and the prisoner, leaving the other woman in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say any thing else? - A. After we locked them up, at the lock-up rooms behind the office, the same afternoon, they were put in separate rooms; Swan cried and took on very much, he called to her, and told her not to fret, for he knew what to say that would clear her; and begged her not to swear against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. In the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off? - A. About three yards; they were obliged to speak loud, it being a thick plank partition lined with iron, to prevent it being cut through; they had a good deal of talk; he asked her what money it was the tall man said, (because both the prosecutor and Loader came up to Swan's room); he said, what money did he say it was I took from him; he said, the tall man would swear to the ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words? - A.</p>
               <p>"Which I took" were his words; she said, twenty-seven guineas; he made answer directly, and said that was wrong, it was but twenty-five; he said, the tall man would swear to the ring; she made answer, that as soon as Nance came, which was the other woman, I will tell her to make away with it; we took her out of the lock-up room, and she, Armstrong, and I, went back to the room, and took the ring, in her presence; I missed it out of the window, it had fell down, I pick it up, and brought her back to the public-house next the office; Blair was fetched out of the lock-up room into the same parlour with her; Mr. Armstrong asked her, in the presence of the prisoner, where she got this ring; she said from the prisoner, he did not deny it; Mr. Armstrong then asked him where he got it, he did not answer directly; he was asked several times before he gave an answer; he said, it was given him by somebody, but he would not tell who; Mr. Armstrong asked him how long ago; he said, not long. They were then locked up again separate; he asked her how we came by the ring; she answered, we went with her to her room, and took it; he said, if one of us had thrown that ring away, when it was put down in the window, we should have done right; she answered, I could have done that if I had known it, but I did not know how you came by it; he said, mind Sal, I depend upon it that you will not swear against me, who was with me nobody shall ever know, I will die myself first; we took them to prison, they were brought up the next day, examined, and committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the paper? - A. Yes. (The paper handed to his Lordship).</p>
               <p>Q. You have written something down about ten guineas? - A. He told her to say ten guineas; she said she could not, because she had said it was twenty; Swan told me, that he had told her somebody had given him twenty guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. Nearly as he is now; but he was described to me in a blue jacket, and dirty trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any inquiry made about the new clothes? He would not tell me, he told me where he bought the watches; I asked him how he came by the money; he said, honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you examine the house? - A. The Sunday morning I was called up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the house on the Saturday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the house? - A. The shutters had been removed; the woman told me how they were found.</p>

             I know as a bit of an acquaintance, by drinking in company where he was, at a public-house, where I used to go after I had done my work; I had not seen him for the space of two months till the Sunday morning when he came up to my room.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sunday morning? - A. The Sunday morning Mr. Mason came and took me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge? - A. I had a room in Webb-square, Shoreditch; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink; I thanked him -</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A.About 20 minutes before twelve; the other young woman, I, and Blair, drank what we had to drink in my room; he went away afterwards, and said he would come back again; in about twenty minutes he came back and gave me the seal of a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so positive to the twenty minutes? - A. Because he looked at his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you? - A. He took a seal from off his watch and gave it to me; I asked what it was for; he told me to remember him; then he gave me a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a ring? - A. A fore finger ring with a stone out of it; he said if I had a stone put in, it would be a handsome ring, but that the stone had dropped out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when the stone had dropped out? - A. No; the other young woman was present at the time; while we were talking, Mr. Mason came up and asked for Sarah Green; I told him no such person lived there; he asked me my name, I told him,

             had given it to me; I don't know that I was asked any questions about the ring, or made any answer whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Q. The truth is, he did give it you? - A. Yes. (The ring produced by Mason.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the ring? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Gibb.) Do you know the ring? - A. Yes, I have had it a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your's before marriage or since? - A. My mother-in-law gave it me just in the state it is.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240030"/>Q. How long ago? - A. Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a stone in it when given to you? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that is your ring? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it usually kept? - A. In a drawer where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it? - A. I cannot justly say, it may be within a month, but I am certain within two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever you went to the drawer did you see it? - A. Yes, there were but few things in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gibb.) What do you say to it? - A. I know it, I had it from my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the ring missing from your drawer? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how lately it was in the drawer? - A. I cannot, there is a parcel of trifling things in the drawer; a silver coral, and other things the children had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coral taken? - A. No, it was in several pieces; I have the waistcoat here that was found down stairs, and the waistcoat I had on.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had the care of your linen at the different places? - A. Myself; I had the key in my pocket; it was kept in a closet in our bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to the closet beside yourself? - A. Nobody; if any one went to fetch linen for use I went with them; I have seen part since at Bow-street; the prisoners were discharged before it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was not entrusted with the care of the linen? - A. No; we found false keys in their room after they were discharged, that would open three closets; I found the key of the closet in one of the closets in their own room; the locks in our bed-room, and the locks where the linen was, were entirely spoiled; I could not open them.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been there? - A. Probably more than an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he? - A. I cannot say; he appeared to me to be a sober consistent man, and therefore I trusted him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the note? - A.No, I had it about three days; we met at a public-house opposite, and I went to his house to get shaved; I was not there two minutes before he had the note.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He told you readily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you were an Officer? - A. Yes; I told him I thought he was a great fool to spend the money in the manner he had; yes, says he, and the gentleman was as great a fool as me for trusting me with it; I said I thought so too.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, but I never knew any harm of him.</p>

             sworn. - My father is a brass-founder in Cursitor-street: On the 9th of August I saw the prosecutor about three or four o'clock, as I was standing at our gate; he seemed very much intoxicated, and fell down, and cut his face, which occasioned a great deal of blood; I picked him up, and set him on the steps of a door; I asked him his name, and where he lived; he did not immediately answer, but afterwards told me; I asked if I should get him a coach, which was sent for; he said he had money, and pulled out some Bank-notes, in order to pay the young man for his trouble of fetching it; he gave me a one-pound note to pay the young man, who would not have any thing; I took the notes out of Mr. Chambers' hands, rolled them all up together, and put them into his righthand breeches-pocket, and buttoned the flap; several of the neighbours were standing by, and were saying, let us endeavour to get him into the coach, when the prisoner came up, (I have no doubt he is the man,) and asked what was the matter; I said, the gentleman was intoxicated; upon which he offered to see him home, saying he knew him, and would see him safe; they got in, and the prisoner desired the coachman to drive to the King's Arms, in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>- HOUGHTON sworn. - I am a coachman, and drove No. 716: On the 9th of August I was called to Cursitor-street, between two and three o'clock; I saw Mr. Chambers very much intoxicated, and had fell down; the prisoner was standing against him; I believe he is the man, but there is another gentleman, whom I have seen about the street, very much like him, but I believe the prisoner to be the man; Mr. Chambers and he got into the coach, and the prisoner desired me to drive to the King's Arms, in Compton-street; at the corner of Red Lion-street, in Holborn, the prisoner pulled the string; I let the fore-glass down, and heard him say to Mr. Chambers, where do you live, I have got a gentleman to meet upon particular business; I said, you had better see the gentleman home, as you pretended to be his friend, I don't know where to drive him to, and he is so much in liquor; Oh no, said he, I must go, I have particular business, and out he got, and went up Red Lion-street; I stepped upon the step, and said to Mr. Chambers, has that man been playing any tricks with you, have you lost any property; he made answer as well as he could, I don't know, drive me home to the corner of Middle-row, St. Giles's; his shopman assisted him out, and Mrs. Chambers began crying, and searched his pockets, and said he had been robbed; I said, Ma'am, I hope you don't think I have robbed him; I stated what had happened, and she went with me to Cursitor-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240034"/>where she was satisfied, and desired me to drive her to Bow-street, where I could describe the man; I did so, and they knew him; he was not taken up till five or six weeks afterwards; he had not got the same dress on then; I was going along with a fare a few days ago, and saw just the back and side face of a man very like the prisoner; but to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. You say you did not know the person who got into your coach? - A. I did not know him; I thought I knew his face somewhere, but could not call it to mind.</p>
               <p>Q. A few days ago you saw a man who resembled the prisoner? - A. Yes; but I have not the least doubt this is the man who rode in my coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, but to rely upon the judgment of the Judge and Jury; I am falsely prosecuted, I never was in the coach, nor did either of the people who have sworn to me over see me; it is all a shameful prosecution; I was in the country at the time, and have sent for my witnesses, but they were acquainted with it so late, that they are not come; therefore I would not detain the Court any longer. I did think my witnesses would be here to prove an alibi, but they are not come.</p>
               <p>(The Court was informed his witnesses were ready.)</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, your witnesses are here; it is for you to say whether you will have them called, or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I will decline it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Wednesday the 3d of October, a black man coming to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; I asked him if he wanted any clothes; he said he did not want clothes, he wanted something else; I told him to walk in, I sold watches; he came in, and pitched upon one old watch, and he agreed to give me two guineas for it; afterwards he gave me a ten pound note, and said he wanted change; I told him I had not got change, but I would go to a neighbour and get it; I went to Mr. Newton's, and he gave me ten one pound notes for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of these notes? - A. No, I cannot write nor read.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the man? - A. I don't think it is the man; it was a man, I am sure, a head less than that man.</p>
               <p>Q. A black man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold him a watch; look at that watch? - A. I had several watches like that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that again? - A. It is very hard to swear without being sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no marks upon your watches? - A. I cannot read nor write.</p>
               <p>Q. There may be marks upon it that you may know, without being able to read and write? - A.I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it this string with it? - A. No, only a bit of packthread.</p>
               <p>Q. What change did you give him? - A. Seven single notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What small change did you give him? - A. My wife sold him eighteen shillings worth of other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by at that time? - A. No; I gave him in change seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that waistcoat? - A. I sell such waistcoats, but I cannot tell whether that is one or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240036"/>Q. You cannot say that the watch and waistcoat are not the same? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But to the same man were sold a watch and a waistcoat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The waistcoat and handkerchief went from you stock, but you did not see it delivered by your wife? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make waistcoats? - A. No, I buy them ready-made.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had been robbed of those things, you would not have been able to have sworn to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Holloway. When I took this watch to Moses, the next day, he told me that was the watch he sold to the black man.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Moses.) Q. Now I call upon you to recollect whether you did or not state that to be the watch you have sold? - A. By sight I could nearly swear to it, but there are many alike.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a watch, to get a glass and a minute-hand put to it -</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Wendy.) Q. Did he, before the Magistrate, offer to produce any Greeks? - A. No, he did not; he said they lived in East Smithfield, and I went the next day but none of them came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The waistcoat was given to me by a black man, a Greek, that lives in East-Smithfield; on Saturday night we had a little merriment; I gave the servant the waistcoat and jacket to put up for me, and on Sunday morning they were both gone; I went to my comrade, a black man, a Greek, and asked him if he had a waistcoat to lend me; he told me, he had never a one just then, but would get one for me, and he bought this waistcoat for me.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN MOXON sworn - I am servant to Mr. Cording, a pawnbroker, in Ratcliff-highway, (produces a gown) On the 15th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought this gown to pledge; I lent her eight shillings upon it; she gave in the name of Joanna Murphy, in Sun-yard.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my gown; I apprehended the prisoner; I went, in consequence of the directions from the pawnbroker, to Sun-yard, but could not find her; I took her about five o'clock in the evening, in Swan-court, East-Smithfield; I could not get an officer; I went into the house where the prisoner was, and there was a man with her; he took up a broom, and beat me out; I am told it is her brother; I called to several people, but no one would lay hands upon her; I had to drag her myself to Whitechapel Office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the woman, nor her place, in my life.</p>

             sworn. - On the 15th of this month, I was going from Maddox-street to Swallow-street, about twelve o'clock in the day; I had in Maddox-street put my pocket-book in my left-hand pocket; I had taken it out upon some occasion, not exceeding five minutes before I lost it; I had not advanced more than twenty yards in <placeName id="t18041024-54-crimeloc279">Swallow-street</placeName>

In consequence of his information, I turned back, and with him pursued the two prisoners; I had a glimpse of a third person somewhat taller than the little boy at the bar; he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the time that he made his escape going faster than usual? - A. Yes; the prisoners quickened their pace, and there appeared to be some consultation between them; I hailed them, but they took no notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you saw them talking together? - A. Yes; they availed themselves of every turning they came to, but quickened their pace; I said, stop my lads, stop there; they looked back, but kept on; the first turning was to the right, and the second was to the right.</p>
               <p>Q. What street were you in when you overtook them? - A. I turned the third street to the left; I don't know the name of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the chimney-sweeper follow with you? - A. Yes; I came up to them, and I asked them what they had done with the pocket-book they had just taken out of my pocket; they both declared themselves innocent; I searched them, but did not find the pocket-book; the chimney-sweeper came up addressing himself to the prisoners - you are the persons who were in company with the other that picked this gentleman's pocket; I desired them to tell me the person who had picked my pocket, and I would let them go about their business; a great mob collected, and advised me to take them before a Magistrate, which I did.</p>

             sworn. - When I first came down Swallow-street, I saw the two prisoners, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240040"/>another that escaped, standing at the corner of the Nag's-head-yard; before I got to them, they turned themselves before me, and went down Swallow-street, all three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they walk as persons in the same company, or seem accidentally to have met? - A. They stood at the Nag's-head-yard, it might be five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular that drew your attention to them? - A. Yes; as they were standing I thought they were three poor post-boys come out of the country, they were talking together; they went before me down Swallow-street, and made a stop; when they came to the corner of Conduit-street, they all three stopped, and turned round, I was crossing Conduit-street at the time; then I got rather behind them as they turned round, and then the one that made his escape got away from them, as if he was going up Swallow-street again; then the big one, Marks, gave him a beckon to come back. This gentleman came along, and then he beckoned by his hand for them to come up; the little one ran over to him directly; then the little one, Williams, was close to the other lad, and Marks a very little distance behind; then I saw the young lad's hand, who has made his escape, go into the gentleman's coat-pocket on the same side as the wall. A coal-waggon passing at the time hid the sight of him from me; I could not see whether he 
               <persName id="t18041024-54-person505">drew</persName>
             any thing out then; they made their escape through Orange-court, the prisoners went first.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they quicken their pace? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes, Marks stopped at the corner of Orange-court, beckoning me to go to him, but I thought he was doing what was not right, and I told him it would not do; then I went down Swallow-street, and ran after the gentleman, and told him. I asked him if he had lost any thing, and he felt in his coat pocket, and said he had lost a pocket-book; I told him, if he went back with me, I believed I could shew him the party; he went back with me to pursue them. We went through Chapel-court, and then saw them standing at a green-grocer's shop; when they saw us, they moved away directly, we caught them first at the bottom of King-street; then the gentlemen asked them for his pocket-book; they said they had not got it; I assisted in securing them. When I was taking hold of the big one, he asked me if I wanted forty pounds to hang a man; when they were stopped, the big one, Marks, pulled out a pocket-book, and the gentleman said it was not his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. When you first saw them, how far distant were you? - A. I suppose fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant did you continue when the coal cart came? - A. I suppose as far again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you ever was nearer than fifty yards to the prisoner, before you saw the prosecutor to speak to him? - A. Yes, about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that was the nearest you were to them at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner who made his escape put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and then the coal waggon coming, it was impossible for you to see whether the prisoners were doing any act? - A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. The tall prisoner beckoned to you, whether it was to give you information of what the other had done or not, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable, I live close to Golden-square: I heard that there were some pickpockets, I ran out and found the prisoners in the custody of a great number of people, I immediately went up and seized Marks, I knew him before; I asked where the other one was; Marks said he would not go without I was an officer; I told him I was an officer, and I insisted upon his going; he walked about ten yards, and swore he would go no further, he struggled, and endeavoured to make his escape from me, having one in each hand I did not know what they might do; I called out for assistance, which I got immediately; Marks struggled very hard till we tore his clothes, he walked then very quietly to the watch-house, and there he was searched; the first thing I took from him was, a gold watch, a gold chain, two gold seals, and a gold key; I put my hand into his breeches-pocket, and took out eleven guineas in gold, the principal part seven-shilling-pieces; and from his inside coat-pocket I took out this new pocket-book, there is no name or writing in it; there were three one pound notes in the pocketbook, a silk handkerchief, a knife, and a large key; in his hand a new umbrella that had never been wet; in his waistcoat-pocket I found a dollar and a few halfpence, he said they were his own, that he had bought the umbrella that day; I told him it was a fine day, he did not want a new umbrella that day.</p>
               <p>Marks's defence. The gentleman let me go several times, and the mob insisted on his taking me; I told the gentleman I would go with him, five or six times, to Marlborough-street.</p>

We found the house locked up, and the prisoner absconded; we found the key in a little house where he kept his working tools; when we got in, we found a little box and a chest of drawers taken away; I had seen them about half an hour before he had the key; the chest of drawers were removed into a barn just by, and the back broke; I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) to the amount of about 50 l. I saw the prisoner about three weeks ago in Spital-fields watch-house, in custody; I asked him how he could think of robbing us, after we had put him in possession; he made no answer to that, but when I asked him if he would acknowledge that he did it; he said he did it with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to acknowledge it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor use any threats if he did not? - A. No: he left his own cloaths behind him in the little house where he kept his tools, and took my husband's.</p>

She frightened me very much when she said so; she told me she had conveyed the bundle into my coal-hole, containing the woman's property at the corner; I said, Lord have mercy upon me, Walker, how could you be so cruel; she said, don't frighten yourself, for I will take it away; I saw her go towards the coal-hole, but I fainted away, and when I came to myself, she was gone; she was taken up the same forenoon.</p>

             is an infant. I am a carpenter; I left my house about half past six o'clock in the morning, and returned about a quarter before twelve at noon, in consequence of an alarm; I found the room-door broke open upon the attic floor, I had left it locked; I sleep in the room, I am sure it was locked; I first missed the money out of my breeches pocket - two half guineas, two dollars, a crown-piece, a one-pound Banknote, a seven-shilling piece, and some silver, altogether about three guineas and a half, as near as I can guess; I then missed a sattinet waistcoat, and a great coat; the coat cost me 1 l. 18 s. and the waistcoat 1 l. 8 s. I had not worn them more than ten times; I had left the waistcoat in the room that morning, but the coat I cannot say where I left it, I saw it in the room on the Thursday morning; I have seen the prisoner many times about the neighbourhood, but I do not remember to have seen him for three or four months before this happened; he is a plasterer's labourer, and did work for a person who lived in the same street, at a house in Russell-square; I found the prisoner the next day, with the coat and waistcoat on his back, in the Coal-yard, St. Giles's, at a public-house next the watch-house; I had been in pursuit of him the whole night; he said he had bought the coat and waistcoat on the Saturday; I told him, if it was my coat, there were no pockets under the flaps, but one inside at the breast; in the great coat pocket I found part of a sawyer's bill of mine, that I had paid, and in the waistcoat pocket I found a knife which I can swear to be mine; I had used it the Sunday before; the room door appeared to be broke open by a chisel; there is the mark of a chisel about an inch and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I had seen her twice before; she came into the shop to pass that bad shilling; she came into the shop, and asked for half an ounce of thread, it came to two-pence; she asked me if I could change her a shilling, I told her I could not; she told me it was not of any consequence, she was going over the way to the baker's, and she would bring me the money when she came back; I then told her I would get her change directly; she gave me the shilling; I went to the other end of the shop, and called my master, because I had had a charge before, that whenever that woman came into the shop, to stop her; my master came, and I told him who the person was; my master sent for the beadle; the woman continued in the shop till the beadle came.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What became of the shilling? - A. I delivered that shilling which she gave me into my master's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is the same shilling that you received from the prisoner, that you gave to your master? - A. I am positive of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You keep a haberdasher's shop, in Thames-street? - A. Yes, the last witness is my servant; she called me down in the morning, on the 10th of October, and gave me a bad shilling; she said she took it of the prisoner; I sent her for the beadle, Mr. Comley; I looked at the shilling, I thought it was a bad one; I gave the shilling to Comley. While Comley was sent for, the prisoner said she would change that shilling, she had never offered a bad shilling before; I told her I could not accede to that, for if there were no passers of bad money, coiners would have no employment; when Mr. Comley came, he asked her if she had any more about her; she said, no; he told her then, she would undergo a very strict search, and if she had any, she had better discover it. After that we went up stairs, for the purpose of searching the prisoner; the staircase is dark; I went up stairs first, and opened the right hand door to cast a light on the staircase, and by that means we saw, as she was coming up to the top stair, she made something like a stumble; I saw her hand lay downwards towards the stair, and it gave me an idea that she had dropped something; Mr. Comley was behind, and he said, you had better have dropped this before you came into this house; he picked it up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Comley pick it up? - A. Yes, he opened it in my presence, and in the prisoner's; it turned out to be seven bad shillings, rolled up with a piece of paper between each shilling; we turned out her pockets, and in her left hand pocket there was a pocket handkerchief, and four-pennyworth of good halfpence; in her right hand pocket were five or six shillings of good silver.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q You are a beadle of Queenhithe ward; were you sent for to Mr. Costen's house? - A. Yes, on the 10th of October; as soon as I came in doors, he said he would give me charge of the prisoner for uttering bad money; I asked the prisoner how she could utter bad money, knowing it to be such; I asked her if she had any other money about her; her reply was, no, she had none of any description; I told her she had better confess, I should minutely search her; Mr. Costen went up stairs first, and opened a door, and on the top stair I saw her put her hand down. I immediately said to her, you should have dropped this before you came into the house; I picked it up, and took her into the room to search her, and found they were seven bad shillings; they were rolled up in one piece of paper, with the paper between every shilling to prevent friction; I told her I thought it would bring her to some bad end. In her left hand pocket I found four-pennyworth of good halfpence, and in her right hand pocket I found five good shillings, and to the best of my knowledge four good sixpences. I delivered the money into the constable's hands; I delivered them all separate, the good and bad distinctly; I had one shilling delivered to me previously by Mr. Costen; I kept that by itself, and the other seven by themselves.</p>

Did you work in the craft? I did, was his answer. To whom did the craft belong? I do not know. Do you know Messrs. Holmes and Bough? I do not know them. Who employed you?

Who were the principals in the bargain - upon your oath, do not you know that Holmes and Bough were the principals, and not Inman? I do not know, Gudgeon was my master, and paid me my wages. What is Inman? I do not know what he is by business. Whose money paid you, and the workman their wages? I do not know, Gudgeon paid me my wages. How long did you work at 4 l. per week?

Inman offered: him 7 l 14 s. and told him, if he wanted more, he would give him a note to Messrs. Holmes and Bough. Did he give him a sealed note to Mr. Bough? Yes, and he went with him to Holmes and Bough, and Mr. Bough flew in a passion, and said he would have him to the Police-office, and make an example of him.</p>

Upon the oath you have taken, did not you abbreviate the sentence you have been speaking of - it was not that: I do not know Holmes and Bough at all - But I do not know Holmes and Bough in this business? - A. No such words; the question was asked, do you know Holmes and Bough? he swore he did not, without any comment at all. and that led to the question. Whose name was on the craft? he admitted that the names of Holmes and Bough were on the craft.</p>

               <p>Q. On whose part did you pay him? - A. For Messrs. Holmes and Bough; he was employed among Messrs. Holmes and Bough's men, and he was paid in the same manner as Holmes and Bough's other men were paid; sometimes I paid the money myself, and sometimes I sent it by other persons; the money came from them; he was discharged in January.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he discharged in January? - A. He went out of my department at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being impressed by Goddy? - A. I do, I attended the Police-office when they sent up to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. He first swore he did not know whose craft it was, then afterwards he admitted their names were upon the oars; were it possible that he should not know that the craft belonged to Messrs. Holmes and Bough? - A. I should think that he must know it.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what Gudgeon said when James was there? - A. He said he thought it was a very hard case that he should be a loser of the money of the oars: I told him, if the oars were found he should not be the money out of pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time make any pretence of Inman being their employer, and not Holmes and Bough? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time that conversation took place was the prisoner present? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the book? - A. I keep it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write the whole of it? - A. It is some part of it my own hand writing, and I was always present when the other man wrote it; he wrote it from the tick that I paid the men with; I did not think myself a proper person; I could not write well enough, to tell you the truth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a most extraordinary thing to charge the defendant with perjury, because if perjury is imputed to any one, it ought to be imputed to a man against whom a verdict is recovered. If there were any interest on the part of the defendant it would be some thing; but there is not one single particle of interest in the defendant, nor even in Gudgeon; that I will shew you. An action was brought against the last witness, by a man of the name of Gudgeon; it was tried at Guildhall, in the month of June. and a verdict was recovered for work and labour performed by Gudgeon for the last witness.

               <p>Q. Had Inman said who was to pay you? - A. Inman told me he was to employ me, and was to pay me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you or did you not look to him for the payment of the money? - A. Exactly so; the prisoner James was present when the agreement was made; I called him for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the principal of the action when the action was tried in the Court of Exchequer? - A. Yes, I was present at the trial.</p>

Take care Mr. Gudgeon, for half a dozen people will prove the contrary than you mean to swear, and have it taken down in writing, that you did not know, when Warden employed you; you did not know that it was Holmes and Bough that employed you? - A. No, I thought it was his money.</p>

               <p>Q. Half-a-dozen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not forty? - A. Very possibly there might.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never conceived Inman or Warden were servants of Messrs. Holmes and Bough? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were employed, together, about a couple of months? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received four pounds from Warden, and you gave James his two pounds? - A. Yes; this

             said, you shall take him and work with him; he had been at work many months before me; he was summoned before the Waterman's Company, by a person of the name of Turner.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you discharged for at last? - A. There was no turn off at all, I gave them a fortnight's warning; I went about my business because I could not get my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Inman telling you there must be a guinea stopped for a pair of oars, and six shillings for something else? - A. Yes; we put them on shore, and they said, they were not put on shore to their minds.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped the guinea? - A. Mr. Inman; I asked Mr. Inman for a tick, and he sent me to Mr. Bough; he gave me a note, he said it was a tick for my money; I went to Mr. Bough, and he said he would have me the next day to the Police-office, and there he would make an example of me; I did not tell Mr. Bough I came for the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whose oars were these that were lost? - A. It is uncertain, because there are many oars in the craft; I never saw the oars with my eyes at any time, I have seen as many other people's oars, with other people's names on them, in his craft.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not the oars belonging to Inman? - A. No; Mr. Inman told me he would stop the money for the oars; I told him it was very hard that he should stop the money, but if it was legal I would pay it; they stopped the money because I would leave them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find out who these oars belonged to? - A. It is impossible, there is such a quantity of oars; these people told me they were to employ me, and pay me my wages;
