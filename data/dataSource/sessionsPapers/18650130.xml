                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Golden Anchor, Great Saffron-hill—I know the prisoner by sight—I have known him about three months, I think—on Monday evening, 26th December last, he came to my house about 6 o'clock; it might have been a few minutes before 6—I and my wife were in the bar, very busy—the prisoner made some remark to her—I don't think she took any notice, and it passed on—I did not hear what he said, but he made some allusion towards myself; he said he could kill any such six Englishmen like me—I took no notice of that—I never spoke to the man in my life until after the occurrence took place—he stayed there some few minutes, and left—there were five or six others with him, all of them foreigners—they remained when he left—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after that, I saw a foreigner of the name of Gregorio, or some such name—he was speaking Italian, and all of a sudden I saw his arm go up, and he struck me just by the side of the mouth with his fist—there were three or four other people there—this was at a little side-box leading from the taproom into the bar—it was not inside the taproom—I was in the bar at the time, on the side leading to the taproom—there were several foreigners in the taproom, I believe—there is a door from the taproom and a small passage into the bagatelle-room—there are two steps and a small passage between—there was no disturbance in the taproom till Gregorio struck me—after he struck me I was about to get over the bar to him, and he went into the taproom among the others—some of the customers in another compartment rushed round the bar and caught hold of me, and I was dragged into the bar-parlour, or as far as the door, on that occasion; I was about going into the taproom, but I was prevented, and pushed into the bar-parlour by several of the customers—I then went as far as the door and looked out, and saw Richard Fawell, 425, A—when I went out, I saw some of the Italians rushing out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300004"/>
               <p>of the house—I went out to look for a policeman, and Fawell came in with me—he went into the taproom, and then several of them got hold of me and pushed me into the bar-parlour, and there held me—I saw no more till the prisoner was dragged out of the bagatelle-room—I saw him being brought from the bagatelle-room in custody of the police—I saw Michael Harrington, the deceased, brought outside into the bar-parlour—I heard that he had been stabbed, and I raised his clothes, or his shirt rather, which was all he had on at that time, except his trousers, and saw his bowels protruding—I did not observe what sort of a wound it was at the time—he was taken by the constable to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I observe you say that when the prisoner came in on 26th December, he said something to your wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he did as he passed; we were very busy—I did not hear what he said—I believe my wife is somewhere about the Court—it was to me he spoke about killing the English—I was within a foot of him, and he turned direct towards me and spoke—he said, "I could kill six any such Englishmen like you"—I am satisfied that is correct—I do not make the slightest mistake about it—I have always been certain that those were the exact words he made use of—I have been examined three or four times, I suppose, or two or three; I can't say—I was examined before the Magistrate on the first occasion, and afterwards before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read to you what you said before. "He said they would settle me, and that he could settle any six Englishmen like me;" do you observe that you said "settle" there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have made the mistake in the con<lb/>fusion—I should think it is to the same effect—I should think now that the word "settle" was used—he might have used the word "settle"—I should take it to mean the same if used towards me, and I think you would too—he might have said either "settle" or "kill," I could not swear to it—he then went away—there were a number of Italians in the taproom at that time—I did not go in to see how many there were, but I should think from what I did see there were a dozen or fifteen—you can go into the bagatelle-room through the taproom, and there is another way—there is a door from the taproom into the bagatelle-room—I should think the size of the bagatelle-room is about twenty feet by twelve—there were chairs in it and a bagatelle-board in the corner, and a table on which refreshments are put for the people who are there—I told you there were about twelve or fifteen in the taproom; it would hold about as many again—there were about a dozen in the bagatelle-room, I should think, all English—there were no Italians in the bagatelle-room—I can't say whether other Italians came in with the prisoner—at the time the prisoner made use of the expression to me, the Italians were distributed about the room; they go in and out of the taproom very freely—I daresay they had gone in—there were only Italians in the taproom, no English at all to my knowledge—I did not go in to see—I can't say how long the Italians had been there—the prisoner went out about 6, I suppose—there had been some dancing in the house before that, being Christmas-time, in the taproom—I had seen the prisoner about three times previous to this—I can't say whether he had been dancing or not—the dancing was not going on between 5 and 6, before 5; I think it might have been between 4 and 5—there was nothing after 5; I would not be certain to a few minutes—I mentioned the name of Gregorio, not Rigorio; I thought you said "Rigorio"—I did not understand that was the man you meant for certain, because there are so many names alike—he struck me—I have learnt his name is Gregorio; I did not know the man's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300005"/>
               <p>name till afterwards—I have said before to-day that he struck me; I said so at the Police-court before the Magistrate—I am sure of that—I signed my depositions, and they were read over to me—I have been in the police-force—I did say that Gregorio struck me; I swear that—I was examined before the Coroner also. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated that Gregorio was excited, but did not state that he was struck by Gregorio.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is what you said before the Coroner; you introduce the name of Gregorio, and say he was very excited, but you don't say one word of his having struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not say anything about him till I heard his name—I did not know his name till the following morning—very likely I mentioned his name before the Coroner; I did not go before the Coroner for a week after it occurred; I had plenty of time to learn his name then—Gregorio said something about my striking an Italian, or something of that sort—I can scarcely understand what they say—I understood the prisoner—he can speak as good English as I can; better English than he can Italian—I could not say distinctly what it was Gregorio said—he was muttering; he is an excitable fellow—I saw his arm go up; lie was then standing in front of me—I was in the bar; he was on the other side of the bar—it was his left arm I saw go up, and then it was he struck me in the month—he then rushed into the taproom, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it the fact that you had had any scuffle with an Italian? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had turned one out the Saturday night previous.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your father-in-law there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at that time; he was there some time before, I believe before this happened between me and Gregorio—I can't say where he was when Gregorio struck me—he was not in the bar—I don't know where he was—I believe he was in the house—he was in the house when the transaction occurred about Harrington—I can't say where he was—I believe he is not here to-day.</p>

I am potman at the Golden Anchor—on 26th December, I was engaged serving in the bagatelle-room—I went into the bar for a pipe—the entrance into the bar is at the end of the bagatelle-room—the door which leads from the taproom is at the side of the bagatelle-room—there is also another way into the bar through the taproom—I passed through the taproom to get to the door at first, before I went for the pipe—as I passed through the taproom I saw a great many Italians all together; among others was the prisoner—he was there by the door of the taproom—one of the other Italians named John spoke to me as I went out—the prisoner might have heard what John said; I can't say whether he heard it or not—in consequence of what John said, I went back into the bagatelle-room—when I got there, I made a statement to the English<lb/>men there—no one went and tried to shut the door then—I was asked for a pipe, and I went into the bar by the bagatelle-room door—there were no Italians in the bagatelle-room then—I got the pipe and brought it back into the bagatelle-room—when I got back I saw one of them knocking Mrs. King down—she was at the door at that moment, in the doorway going to the taproom—there were not several people together then—Seraphini, the prisoner, was leading the way in; he was first—I told him I did not want any row here—as I got up to the door, the prisoner stabbed me in the right side—I saw the knife—I don't know what sort of a knife it was—I did not see the handle; I only saw the blade of it—I had known Seraphini before; I have known him for the last four or five years—when he stabbed me, I hit him in the head with a stick, a broom-handle—he ran at me again after I hit him in the head, with the knife still in his hand—I was then just inside</p>

               <p>the bagatelle-room door—I heard one of them say, "Here is one in the room; look out, here is one in the room"—Mrs. King was behind the door then—Boon after, I turned round and saw Seraphim on the top of Harrington—there was no other Italian besides the prisoner in the room at that time, that I saw—I rushed on Seraphini, caught him by the collar, and then lost my senses—I am still a patient at the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever said before to-day that there was no other Italian in the bagatelle-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said there was no other in the room at the Clerkenwell Police-court—I was asked the question there—the Magistrate asked me if there was any other in the bagatelle-room, and I said, "No"—my depositions were read over to me before I signed them—I believe the Magistrate asked me the question—since I was examined before the Magistrate nobody has asked me—I have not been asked about it—I had been in the bagatelle-room before I saw this happen—I had left the bagatelle-room to go through the bar for a pipe—a great many of them were in the bagatelle-room when I left it; English, not Italians; there was Harrington and another man of the name of Pikey, with one or two Irishmen—there were no Italians—there were Italians in the taproom; as near as I can judge, between twelve and fourteen—the taproom-door was open; the bagatelle-room door was not—the door from the bagatelle-room to the taproom was open; I passed through, but they would not let me go quite through—a man told me to go back, a man they call John, an Italian-struck the prisoner with a broom-handle—I brought it up to protect myself—there was a blind-roller there and a copper-stick, I believe—there were two blind-rollers, I believe—they were in the bagatelle-room—I brought them up about ten minutes before that, from down stairs, in the kitchen—I brought them into the bagatelle room, because one or two in the room said, "If they come in here, we will protect ourselves, "when I told them there was going to be a row—I can't say who it was who said that—the expression was not, "Bring us up as many sticks as you can"—they said, "We won't go out, we will wait here; if they break in on us, we will protect ourselves"—then, afterwards, one of them said, "How nice we should look; if they come in here with knives; what are we to do, we have only got our hands?"—they then asked me if I would have sticks ready to protect themselves if they came out, and I brought these up to them—there were two blind-rollers, a copper-stick, and a broom-handle I brought up; I believe that was all—there were not more, that I am aware of; I don't know, I did it all in a flurry at the time—I was in the bagatelle-room at the time I laid the broom-handle over the prisoner's head—after I brought the broom-handle up it was lying in the bagatelle-room; I put it down on the form—I don't know whether any of the sticks were broken; mine was not, that I am aware of—I don't know whether the prisoner's head was cut and bleeding—I hit him in the head—I did not see any other man's head cut—I was at the bagatelle-room door at the time he struck me with the knife—he was in the passage, coming from the taproom—he was nearer to the bagatelle-room than the taproom; he was right in the bagatelle-room door—the passage is about two feet wide, just about a little wider than this witness-box—as many as liked could come through, if they followed one another—I was nearer the bagatelle-room door than he was, because I was at the door—I was not looking into the bagatelle-room; I was looking at him coming, looking towards the taproom—when I saw Mrs. King knocked down, I was coming into the bagatelle-room with the pipe—it was not in the taproom that she was knocked down, it was in the passage—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300007"/>
               <p>she was leaving the bagatelle-room door—by the passage, I mean that passage which parts the bagatelle-room from the taproom—I was not in the taproom when she was knocked down; I was leaving the bar, and coming into the bagatelle-room with the pipe—she was going out of the bagatelle-room—I saw one of them knock her down—I don't know which it was; I can't say it was the prisoner; I don't know; I don't think it was him, but I can't say—I am not sure it was not him—I swear that—I can't swear whether it was him or not; it might be, and it might not—I can't say it was him.</p>

I am the wife of William King, of Leather-lane, a bone button manufacturer—I was with my husband on the night of 26th De<lb/>cember at the Golden Anchor—we were in the bagatelle-room—Michael Harrington, the deceased, was there, and several others, English persons, in the same room—there were no Italians in that room; they were all English—I left the room, and proceeded to come out; that was from 6 o'clock to half-past—I was leaving to go home—my husband was there with Harring<lb/>ton and the other English persons in the room—I was coming out at the bagatelle-room door to pass through the passage—when I came to the door the prisoner knocked me down—he knocked me down with his fist, in the mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a button-maker—on the night of 26th December, I was at the Golden Anchor, in the bagatelle-room—Michael Harrington was there; he sat opposite me, and when the Italian rushed in, he stood beside me—I had been singing a song when the Italian rushed in—Harrington was close by my side—Seraphini is the Italian who rushed in—the prisoner; no other Italian besides the prisoner got into the room—as he rushed in, he struck the deceased in the stomach with his right hand—it was a side blow—I did not see anything in his hand; but when Har<lb/>rington was struck he fell to the ground—my wife was in the room at the time, close to me—she pulled me away from the side of Harrington after he fell—immediately she pulled me away, I observed some blood on her shawl—after I recovered, I went to Harrington again, and saw that he was stabbed.</p>

I live at 27, Charles-street, Hatton-garden—on the night of 26th December, there was a disturbance in the tap-room, after which young Rebbeck came into the bagatelle-room, where I was; from the taproom—he pulled his trousers up, and the blood was all pouring down his legs—he showed it to me, and said it was nothing only a cut on the knee; directly after that he got out at a window at the back, and got some sticks which were broken up, and laid on the bagatelle-board—during that time there was a disturbance again, and fighting between the doorways and in the little passage—I cannot say who by, because there were a great many of them, English as well as other parties—there was no fighting in the bagatelle-room—I saw Harrington wounded by the door, and saw Seraphim there—the door was pushed open, Mrs. King was struck on the mouth, and the prisoner came in with another behind him, but he was stopped by a man they call John, who used to play the organ there—all I saw the prisoner do was to give a back-handed blow—there was nothing in his hand; I will swear that—he was knocked down by a young man they call Painter, struck over the head with a stick, and Harrington fell from the blow—Painter struck the prisoner on the head and knocked him on top of Harrington—a man named King laid hold of the prisoner by the collar, and held him down till two policemen came—I did not hear of Harrington being wounded—no<lb/>body knew that he was wounded but when the prisoner was taken off of Har<lb/>rington they took the prisoner away, and me and Mr. King lifted Harring<lb/>ton up, and put him on a seat behind the door—I went and asked for a drop of water, took it into the bagatelle-room, and bathed his face because we thought he was faint from being knocked down—we did not know that he was wounded—there was no fighting after that—I saw no knife in anybody's hand—I did not see any of the Italians get into the bagatelle-room; they were kept back with the sticks—the man who plays the organ, who came in behind him, is an Italian—he did not get into the room, he was knocked on the head with a stick—I did not see whether he had anything in his hand—I should say that man got as near to Harrington as I am to this gentleman.

Queen Victoria"—the date is in the ordinary place, but on the reverse side; on all the Queen's current sovereigns, it is on the obverse—the reverse does Dot resemble a sovereign, because the composition is different altogether; the King is riding with a crown on his head, which is quite different from St. George—this is neither St. George or a dragon—the only thing like a sovereign is the Queen's bead and a knerled edge but there is a considerable likeness in colour—on the coins of George IV., 1821, the date is on the re<lb/>verse side, and in George III. you will find it under the head again.</p>

Mappin—he told me he was receiving 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year there—I don't know that he said he also made 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission—I will not swear he did not, I cannot bear it in mind—I don't know that I went to him at Mappin's warehouse, and told him that I thought he could do better if he established a business for us; it was more his arrangement than ours; it came about in a casual conversation; he said the place did not suit his health, being confined in the room and so on, and I told him we had often thought of an agency of that sort; that was the way in which it first sprang up—I did not tell him that we could not allow him quite the commission he asked, but that I and the two partners would share thirty per cent. between us, each taking ten per cent. profit on the goods; I swear that—I believe during the six yeans he was at Mappin's he bore a most excellent character—I did not give him notice according to the terms of the agreement; he had a very nice way of putting things off; when I came up again in December, he said his wife was confined, and one of his children was very ill, and made many feasible excuses, and I know that both of his children have died since, and I passed it over more easily perhaps than I might have done—I asked for his books, and he said they were at his private house, and from these circumstances I did not press the matter then, but arranged to come up the second week in January, which I did—I should say he has not sent accounts to Sheffield constantly according to the terms of the agreement; I will swear that—he has sent some few accounts, I think about three or four—he has sent shuffling letters; I could produce letters that would take you almost a week to read—he has sent an account of the money he has received from various parties on the one side, and the money he has paid on the other—it was not a balance-sheet; we never could get one; we often pressed him for one, and he always framed some shuffling excuse—we placed trust in his accounts at the time, from what we thought, till we found him out—we took stock in February, 1864; the balance is contained in the letter of March, 1864.</p>

                  </hi>. In September last I sailed in the barque Snowdrop—I shipped as carpenter—her burden was 396 tons; she was bound for Cronstadt in ballast—the prisoner White was the captain, and Sutton the mate—on the morning of 4th October the vessel struck upon a reef called the Stonescar reef, to the eastward of Revel, about a quarter of a mile from Stonescar island, and about twelve miles from Port Cundar, the mainland nearest the island—the vessel struck twice; she got placed between two rocks, one on the port bow and another on the starboard quarter—the wind was W. N. W.; it was not blowing very hard; it was blowing a pretty fresh breeze, but nothing very hard—after she struck the sails were clewed up; they were not furled at that time—I sounded the pumps when she struck; I found she was making no water—I did that three times, and reported it to White—he was then on the quarter-deck, the poop; there were other per<lb/>sons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300050"/>
               <p>there who heard me—after that the captain called me down into the cabin; he said, "Come down and have a glass of grog"—he then said, "Now, carpenter, the ship is here, and I don't want her ever to get off; she is not making water, can you make her make water?"—I replied, I could—he asked by what means—I said, "By boring a couple of holes into her"—he said, "Go and do it, carpenter, and I will see you all right"—he said that his brother and he were young men, and if they did not get their in<lb/>surance they would be ruined—he talked about the qualities of the vessel, that she was the fastest sailing vessel in the Baltic, and that he was the best navigator in the Baltic—he said, "Go on and do it, and I will keep the crew employed about getting the anchor out astern during the time you are doing it"—I then went on deck, went down into the half-deck, and took a half-inch auger; I am wrong, it was an inch and a quarter auger I took at that time, a chisel and a hammer—I took them out of my tool-chest, I brought them on deck, and hove them down the fore-hatch on the top of the ballast; then I went down myself—I took up the tools and put them on some dun<lb/>nage-wood aft—then I came up out of the hold again, and went down the half-deck, and took, a half-inch auger out of my chest and put it in the hold in the same way—then I went down into the hold myself again, followed by Button, the mate, and he asked me if I could not start the wooden ends for<lb/>ward—I said I could not—I went aft on the starboard side and took a graving piece out of the ceiling; that is the inside lining of the ship, and I bored a a hole with a half-inch auger between the timbers—Sutton was standing be<lb/>side me at that time—I bored the hole in the outside plank, and the water came in—I then replaced the graving-piece—I then went forward on the port side, and took out another graving-piece and bored a hole in the same manner, and returned the graving-piece—I put it in the same way as it had been before; I put it in with my hand—I hammered the one aft in on the inside—Sutton was there when I bored the hole in the port side—I then went on deck—the crew were getting the anchor ready, and the boats—they made an effort to take the anchor astern—they went about a boat's length from the ship, on the starboard quarter, and returned in about ten minutes—they then took the anchor on board again—White then asked me to sound the pumps—I did so, and reported that there was twenty inches of water in her; that was about between 10 and 11 in the day—I went into the cabin again; the captain asked me—he said the ship was not making much water yet—I said no, but I could make her make more if he chose—he said, "Go on and do it then, carpenter"—I went on deck again, went down the hold, and took an inch-and-a-quarter auger and bored two inch-and-a-quarter holes in the same places as the half-inch holes were—I stood upon the ceiling to do it; I took out the graving-pieces again—I could not manage to put one of them back again, for the force of the water—I then went on dock and found the crew getting their things ready to go ashore—I Went down into the cabin again and had some conversation with the captain and mate—we were talking about the ship, and we had a glass of brandy each, and then the captain and I went down into the hold to see if the ship was making the water—we went aft on the starboard side, and were standing by the water-tank; that was about six feet from where the holes were, and the captain said, "Now, carpenter, between you and me and the water-tank, this must never be known; you must not speak about it, and I will see you all right"—while we were there I saw the steward come part of the way down; he came half way down the ladder, down the main hatch, with the captain's belt—he said, "Here is your belt, Captain White"—the captain said, "Take</p>

               <p>it away, keep it, I don't want it"—we went on deck after that, and the cap<lb/>tain went down in the cabin and packed up his things—he and I left the vessel; we left at different times—we were not all ashore before 3 in the afternoon—there was no pumping at any time—I went to Revel, then to St. Petersburg, and then shipped for England.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first engage to go this voyage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was when I got paid off from my last voyage to the West Indies—the Snowdrop sailed from Gravesend on 10th September—I bad engaged as carpenter on board her, three days before that; it might be four days, I don't recollect exactly; it was before we started at Graves<lb/>end—my wages were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—I had sailed to the West Indian in this ship, before, under Captain White—It was about 9 o'clock in the morning that I bored the first hole, as near as I can recollect—I sounded the pump immediately after the ship struck, as soon as I came on deck, and I sounded again in about ten minutes—I bored two separate holes, one on the port side of the ship and one on the starboard; one on each side, with a half-inch auger—an auger is the same nature as a gimlet—I afterwards enlarged those holes with the other auger; that would be about a little after 10 o'clock—I remember the long-boat and the jolly-boat being got out—I don't recollect that one of the thole-pins of the long-boat was broken—I did not go down into the long-boat and mend it; I swear that—I went into the long-boat but I did not make a thole-pin—there was a thole-pin in the boat, and one broke, that had been in the hole, which I took out, but I did not make any thole-pin; there was a thole-pin in the boat to put in—the thole-pin was broken in the hole, in the gunwale of the boat—I did not take my ham<lb/>mer and one of the augers into the long-boat and use them—I got the end of the thole-pin out—I did it with a top-maul and a piece of wood; I backed it out; I did not use the auger—nothing more passed between me and the captain but what I have stated—my chest of tools was in the half-deck—the boatswain and the two boys had their berths in the half-deck besides me—Banter is the name of one of the boys; I don't know the name of the other—I saw Captain Downward when I came to London.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I reflected upon what I had done on the passage home, and I thought I was in a critical position, that I was endangering myself—that was the first time I so thought—it was in coming from Cronstadt in the vessel I shipped in; I dare say it might be about half the passage home—it was then for the first time I thought I was in a difficult position, and had done wrong; I swear that—I did think it was wrong at the time, but I did not reflect upon it; I mean that the first time I reflected upon it was when I was coming home—I was not drunk on that morning; I had been drinking; I was not the worse for liquor; I don't say I was quite sober, never having tasted liquor; I took three or four glasses of liquor—I went to Mr. Downward to ensure my own safety, thinking, perhaps, some of the crew might give it in in London, and that I might be brought up—that was my reason and no other—I had heard of Mr. Downward before I went—I bad not heard of any reward offered by Lloyd's Salvage Association; I swear that—I never heard of any reward—I did not know anything of Mr. Downward before I went to him first—I was told to go to him by the master of the house where I was stopping—I have not been earning my living since then; Lloyd's Salvage Association have been supporting me, they have been clearing my expenses, giving me sea wages, and paying my board—that has been for ten or eleven weeks, I dare say—I have never heard of any reward offered by Lloyd's Salvage Associa<lb/>tion for giving information; I swear that—I don't expect any reward; I</p>

               <p>swear that—I have not been promised any—nothing has been said to me—about any reward—before I went to Gravesend to join the Snowdrop, I was lodging in a coffee-house in St. George's-street, with a plumber and glazier, named Marshall—I was not living there with a woman of the name of Margaret—I was at that coffee-house sleeping with a woman—it was not my wife—I had been living with her there about a week—I called her Margaret—I did not say just now that I was not living there, and sleeping with a woman of that name—I thought you meant the woman I was living with was the mistress of the house—I am married—my wife was at home at Liverpool at that time—I have two children—I had an advance note—I did not cash that with a person named Brown—Mr. Gambridge cashed it—Brown got it done for me—it was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was my duty to have joined the ship in London; I failed to do so—I was staying at this coffee-house; it is not a brothel; there was never anything of the sort in the house before—I spent the whole of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before I joined the vessel at Gravesend—I bought clothes—Mr. Brown and a person connected with the Board of Trade came to me, and insisted upon my joining the vessel—I did intend to join; I did not refuse to join; I went to join in London, and the vessel was gone—they did not take me down to Gravesend and put me on board; Mr. Brown did—one of the inspectors of the Board of Trade came to me; a person whose duty it is to look after the seamen—when I was going on board the ship the captain did not at first refuse to take me—I did not hear him say to Mr. Brown, "Oh, let the vagabond come on board"—he did not say that in my presence, or hearing—at that time I owed the mate about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not hear the mate say. "Let the vagabond come on board"—I did not hear the mate say anything—I never said I would not go on board unless I had some more money—the captain scolded me for not being on board in London—he said, "Carpenter, this is a pretty time to come on board; the ship has been detained through you"—I sent Brown to ask the captain for money to pay for the boat for bringing myself off, bat not with any threat that I would not come on board—Mr. Brown did not tell me the captain refused to give me any money—I was sober at the time the officer of the Board of Trade came to me—the captain did complain that I had detained the ship—I did not, that I recollect, say to Mr. Brown, "Never mind, Mr. Brown; d—the old tub; I will be one with then yet"—I will not swear positively that I did not—I did not say those words—I swear that I did not say the words, "D—the old tub; I will be one with them"—I did not say I was d—sorry I had come to the ship—I dare say I said the vessel was an old vessel, and I could get a better, but I did not say, "D—the old tub"—I did not say "She is nothing but an old tub; they are a bad lot"—I said it was only a short voyage, and I dare say I could put up with it—I saw Mr. Brown on my return home—I did not owe him anything when I came home—his wife had a pawn-ticket belonging to me, which I went for; I had left it with her—I did not say to Mr. Brown, "I have got plenty of money, "or "shall get plenty of money"—Brown did not ask what for, nor did I say, "Why, for scuttling the ship; I have been to the Insurance people, and they will pay me handsomely"—I said I had been to Lloyd's, and reported what I had done—I was very badly clothed when I returned—I did not say to Mr. Brown, "I shall have to get plenty of money from Lloyd's next week, and then I will come and pay you for the ticket of ray pawned coat"—I never said to anyone that I was going to get money from Lloyd's—I do not expect it; that I say on my oath—I am living with my wife now; she is in London—After leaving Stonescar Island, we went to Port Cundar—I had not deposited my chest of tools with the</p>

               <p>mate for money he had lent me; the mate had sold me a coat and a shirt, that I had not paid him for—I was wearing that coat at Revel after the wreck—in Cronstadt the mate insisted upon my taking the coat off my back and returning it to him, because I had not paid him I for it—I went to him almost crying, and asked him to let me have the coat, because I bad no other—when I saw that he would not give it to me, I told him to take it, that I would have a coat yet—I sold part of my tools at Cronstadt; I lost part of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the mate complain at Cronstadt of your getting drunk every day, and spending your money in that way instead of paying him what you owed him after the wreck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never complained of my drinking, or of anything else, until the money I had was all spent, and I bad shipped again, and then he complained that I did not pay him when I had the money—he did say that I had spent my money in eating and drinking instead of paying him—he complained to me, and he kept the coat—I signed a protest at Revel—I was sworn to the truth of it—an oath was administered to me—I could not tell you who administered it—the oath was to this effect, "We swear to God, the Lord, that all that the cir<lb/>cumstances mentioned by us, and contained in the underwritten declaration, and again at this present fairly read before us, are the real truths as sure as God and His Holy Gospel shall help us now and for ever Amen."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, were not the boats ordered to be got ready half an hour after the ship struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The boats were ready, everything was ready for getting the boats out all ready—I may have said before the Magistrate "Half an hour after the vessel struck, the anchor was ordered to be taken out at the stern for the purpose of taking the vessel off"—I did not say that, that I am aware of—an order was given by the captain to clew up the sails immediately—no order was given to furl the sails at that time—I did not hear the captain give an order to furl the sails, and caution the men who went up the rigging to be steady and careful, or they might be thrown overboard by the heaving of the ship—I did not see the captain come out of the cabin in his drawers; he had his clothes on—I heard him say, "Good God, boatswain; what is this?"—that was after the ship had struck—I did not see him at that time, but I heard him say those words—I have said before to-day that the captain told me the ship was the fleetest in the Baltic, and that he was the best navigator in the Baltic—I said it</p>

                  </hi>. I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Snowdrop</hi> as cook and steward 1—I was awoke from my sleep at 4 o'clock, on the morning of 4th October, with the ship running on the rocks, and bumping occasionally—I ran up the companion before dressing myself—I saw reefs in front of the vessel, and on the right an island—I went down below again, and the captain, not knowing I had been on deck, said, "Turn out, steward, old boy; the ship is on shore"—I said to him that I was sorry for him—he said, "For why?"—I said it was a serious job—he told me to pack up his things, as he had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth in the state-room—I heard the men clewing up the sails at this time—I heard the carpenter tell the captain that the ship made no water, two or three times within about half an hour—I went down into the hold of my own accord to examine whether she was making water; I found her per<lb/>fectly dry; that was about an hour and a half after the vessel had struck—she was then in an upright position on the rocks—I asked the mate if there was any tide flowed there, whether the vessel could be got off, and the reply was, no there was none—I do not recollect seeing Craig and the mate to<lb/>gether—I saw Craig and the captain together in the cabin at 6 o'clock—I was there also—I was sent on deck by the captain with a mug of rum to give the men—I was absent on deck about ten minutes—I then went down into the cabin again, and went on packing up the things—Craig was still in the cabin when I went down again—I went in the jolly-boat—I think that was about 9 o'clock; I can't positively say the time—I went with the mate, one seaman, and two boys; we went to take the long-boat in tow, by rights, in point of fact, we never left the side of the vessel, only went a little way—the anchor was over the stern of the long-boat; it was not put into the water—when we were in the boat I remarked to the mate that the car<lb/>penter ought to have been sent into the boat in place of me, for he was more of a seaman than I was—he made no reply—I can't say particularly as to</p>

               <p>the time we were before we returned on board the vessel; I suppose about a quarter of an hour—the ship was dry when we went back—I did not go into the hold; I passed the main hatchway, and I heard water rushing in; it seemed to be in the after part of the hold, and I told the captain—I said, "The water is coming in aft"—he said, "Never mind that, steward; go on about your work"—I went down into the cabin again—when I was there I heard a hammering, and a rush of water; I heard the hammering first—I had finished packing up nearly all the captain's things, and having his belt out, I went on deck to find him; he was in the hold at the time, and I went half-way down the ladder, and saw the captain standing with his back to me, and the carpenter standing sideways, by the pump-well—I heard the captain say something about making him all right, or words to that effect—I said to the captain, "Here is your belt, sir, you had better put it on"—he started, and looked confused at seeing me, and said, "Take it away, steward; I don't want it, "meaning that I could keep it—I then went back again into the cabin; the mate was there, lying on the after lockers—I believe we had two pumps on board—there had been no pumping up to that period; I never saw any pumping, only at the time the hold was being washed out—when I came to England I made a statements to Captain Downward.</p>

N. E.—the captain then came on deck—he asked what I had done; I told him, "Nothing"—I told him I had called him at 3 o'clock, and he did not turn out—he said he perfectly under<lb/>stood that I did do so—all hands were called on deck, the sails were clewed up, and the pumps sounded—the carpenter sounded the pumps, and I heard him say to the captain that there was no water; I heard him say that twice; it might be three quarters of an hour between the times—the sea did not break over the ship—the boats were got out some little time after, I dare say about 5, or half-past 5, in the morning—they were got out by tackle, put over the side into the water—a man got in to make the line fast to them as soon as they were over the side—I saw the jolly-boat got out; that was the first one that was got out—there was an effort made to tow the long boat; they tried to do it—that was after we got the anchor in, at 9 o'clock; that was the first and only time the anchor was got into the boat—I have been at sea fifteen years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything to your knowledge to prevent that being done sooner than 9 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it as soon as we could; we were clewing the sails up, and the like of that, and getting things ready—the jolly-boat was manned with four hands, two boys and two men; the steward was one of the men and an able seaman—we tried to pull the anchor a-stern—we never got from the vessel at all—while we were getting the anchor out, I saw the carpenter pass his tools down the hold, and heave them on the ballast—they were an auger, a chisel, and a hammer—the carpenter went down the hold himself shortly after; that was about 9 o'clock—the ship was making no water before that—at that time the captain was in the fore-hold with me, getting the warp ready—that was after I had seen the carpenter go down—the captain remained with me a quarter of an hour—the mate, I believe, was in the hold at that time, because I know he followed the carpenter down—the pumps were not used at all—after I came out of the long-boat, I heard the carpenter report that there was twenty inches water in the ship; that was about half-past 9; about three-quarters of an hour after I had seen him throw his tools down the hold—the pumps were not used after that—I was called down into the cabin: the captain, the mate, the steward, and carpenter, were there—I was asked to have</p>

               <p>a glass of grog; I drank it, and came on deck again—the captain also asked me to get a boat's crew to take his things on shore—I got four hands, and we took the things ashore—they were four of the able seamen and myself—the same four able seamen could have pulled the anchor to sea—we left the vessel at 11 o'clock—up to that time there had been no pumping—the vessel was then lying nearly upright on the rocks—next evening at 8 o'clock I went to the ship, with the captain, mate, and some of the crew—there was no appearance of straining about the vessel; it was a very fine morning, and no sea on; it had been calm during the night—the water was then nearly up to the beams; nearly on a level with the water outside—we visited her next day, and every day—I afterwards went to Cundar and to Cronstadt, and when I returned to London, I made a statement to Captain Downward.</p>

I now live at Mrs. Garraway's, 7, Prospect-place, St. George's-in-the-East—I am sixteen years old—I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Snowdrop</hi> in September, 1864, on a voyage to Cronstadt—I remember the time when she was wrecked—for some days previously to that the weather was not very good; there were head winds—we were obliged to anchor—the captain was on deck night and day, part of that time—I was in the watch on the night the vessel struck—it was our watch from 12 till 4 in the morning—the boatswain, Brewer, bad charge of the vessel during that watch—I held the reel for the purpose of ascertaining the speed of the ship during the watch—I don't remember how many knots she was going exactly; I think it was seven—the yards were squared about ten minutes before 4—the boatswain ordered that, the wind being more aft—it was a dark night—I was on the look out—it was my duty at 4 o'clock, eight bells, to go below and call the carpenter and Joseph Banter, on the aft deck, and as I was going down the ladder I was knocked right down—I called the carpenter and Banter—the carpenter said "Good God, what is the boatswain doing?"—directly I got on deck the mate ordered the sails to be clewed up—before that I heard Middleton say, "Here is an island on the starboard bow"—the ship struck just after that—it was after she struck that the mate called out to have the sails clewed up—they were clewed up directly—while it was being done, I saw the captain—he ran forward with a lamp or lantern to see what rocks they were—the sails were furled after breakfast—we had breakfast just after 8 o'clock—the wind had effect upon them when they were clewed, but not near so much as before—clewing means tucking them up by pulling the ropes loosely up—that can be done almost in a moment; furling takes a long time—it was quite dark then—the captain ordered the tackles to be rove for getting out the boats—he assisted in that himself—he did everything that was necessary that he could do; he worked with his own hands along with the crew—it took about an hour or two to get the boats launched—the ship was bumping every</p>

I belong to Hamburgh—I was an ordinary seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Snowdrop</hi>—when the ship struck I was down below, calling the watch—I ran on deck—the ship was stern on a rock—I thought at first it was a sea run into her, but when I came up I saw the land—the ship was going about seven or eight knots an hour at the time—I saw the captain on deck when I got up—he was in his drawers and shirt—he caught hold of the helmsman, and said, "God Almighty, where is the ship going to?"—he was frightened—after that I heard the captain and the mate give the carpenter an order to see what water there was in the ship—the first thing we did was to clew up the sails—I have been at sea about five years; that was the right thing to do—we did not take down the topsails; we clewed them up after we got the boats out—the captain afterwards gave orders to get the topmast down to lighten the ship, to get her off from the shore—the sails were furled after we had the boats out; we clewed them before—when we furled the sails it was getting break of day—as the men were going up to furl them, the captain said, use very careful, and hold yourselves fast, that you do not fall down, "because the ship jumped so much, she was striking on the rock so hard—the forepart of the ship was on the ground, on the rocks, and the stern in the sea—the sea was strong enough to lift up the ship—there was a good sea; the sea knocked against the ship; that was what made the ship jump so much—when it jumped up it fell on the rock—that was going on constantly, all the time after the wreck—the carpenter had been drinking a little that morning—I was in the long-boat, when I got into it, I noticed that a thole-pin was broken—I was going to pull the hind oar—a bolt and hammer was first handed down to me—we tried to get out the broken pin, but could not, and we sung out to the carpenter to come down and get it out, because we thought he could understand it best—he came down, and ho could not get it out with the tools we had in the boat; he sung out to one of the boys to hand him down a gimlet or something like that, to bore it out—it was a good big gimlet, bigger than my finger—the long-boat had the anchor in her, and the jolly<lb/>boat was trying to take her from the side of the vessel, in order to carry her astern—I had an oar—we were all standing clear for a pull, but the first boat could not come out of the way, because it was too heavy a sea, and it was blowing too hard—everybody was in the two boats, except the captain and Jackson, who had a bad arm, and could not come down—we made a little way, but were not able to get clear—we were trying for about three quarters of an hour, or an hour—as far us I could judge, those who were in</p>

               <p>the jolly-boat tried all they could—if there had not been a sea, they would have been able easily to take the long-boat astern—the cause was the sea and the wind, and it was full of rocks, we were frightened of the boat going on the top of one of the rocks; the sea was heaving the boat—I do not know whether there is any tide at that island—I saw the captain after the vessel struck—he worked very nearly the most of all of us—he appeared to work in a genuine way, anxious to do what he could—he did the best he could—I am sure he did all he could to try and get the vessel off the reef, and the mate was trying his best too—I was working with the carpenter that morning—we were all working together—sometimes he was alongside of me, and sometimes far off, but I could always see him—I never saw him go down into the hold—I remember our anchoring at Norgen island two or three days before the wreck—that was because there was a gale of wind right against us, and we could not get on—it lasted four or five days—during that time, the captain did all he could to keep his vessel safe—he only went to bed about 12 o'clock for a couple of hours; he was very tired—I know Brewer, the boatswain—he has been to my house four or five times—he never brought any one with him—yes, once he had somebody with him.</p>

I reside at South Shields—I was for many years in the Merchant Service as a captain—I think I commanded some<lb/>where about thirty years—amongst other parts of the world, I have been in the habit of navigating the Baltic—it is very intricate navigation at the latter part of the year when the days are short—I have been in Court and heard the evidence as regards the course the vessel was steering; it was a correct course—supposing the vessel had not struck on the rock, but had successfully passed Ogland, the navigation becomes much more difficult between that and Cronstadt, and in my judgment would require the constant presence of the captain on deck—he would have no other opportunity for rest than he had that night—the clewing up of the sails and getting out the anchor was the proper course to pursue; I don't know of any other—I do not think it was possible to get the boats out with the heavy sea there was, with the ship's company; I mean, not with that number of hands—doing their best, I do not think they could do it—the sea would be such that it would be impossible to pull a boat to windward, even without the anchor—it appears that the ship was going seven or eight knots; therefore there must have been a strong wind to drive the ship—from the bumping up and down of the vessel as has been described, I do not think she would be long before there was a breach in her bottom; it would depend on the nature of the ground she was on—I know Stonescar island—it used to be uninhabited</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could she have gone clear fourteen or fifteen miles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is some time since I looked at the chart (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>); I should suppose she would have gone ten miles at least; she might have gone a little more—if a ship got on a reef at 4 in the morning, the first thing I should have done would be to clew up the sails; I would then make an attempt to get the anchor away—there would be no other means of getting a ship off than the way she got on—I should make that attempt by getting the boats out—I would have run a small anchor out first in the jolly-boat, if I could have got away, and fixed it—perhaps it would take longer than half an hour to clew up the sails; they would be in a state of confusion—it would depend upon the state of the weather whether they should have begun to get the boats out the moment the sails were clewed—daylight was coming on; I should think they would let the boats remain until daylight; I would have prepared for getting them out—ropes do not require much getting into order on board ship; they are always ready—the longboat would be on deck at the time the vessel struck—if the boat was not launched at once, they would prepare the oars, tholes, and such things—I should give orders to some of the officers to see that the boat was ready—whatever opinion I express would entirely depend upon the state of the wind and waves—supposing water gets into the hold; if there was any possibility of getting the vessel off I should try to pump it out—the anchor would be the first thing I should attend to; to launch the boats as soon as there was an opportunity, as soon as it was daylight; not pump—if they could not take the anchor out there would be no alternative; the ship would have to lie—I should not pump then, because it appears the water was coming in so fast—it is useless to use the pumps in some cases; if the sea was not coming in so fast then you might pump, but if it was coming in fast it would be use<lb/>less to attempt to pump it out.</p>

               <p>twelve to sixteen or seventeen ships—I have known Captain White from his infancy; his mother, his grandmother, and the whole family—he has always borne the character of an honourable, upright man—I know the Baltic, and I know Stonescar Island very well—there is sometimes a slight current there, but not strong—there is no rise and fall of tide—after leaving the island of Norgen, on his course towards Ogland, east half north would be as near a direct course as he could possibly steer—I think, as the wit<lb/>nesses have stated the wind was in the south, the captain could not have bad a better opportunity for taking a little rest than on that night, as he was going into a narrower channel after passing Ogland—the bumping up and down as described by some of the witnesses would, in my opinion, soon cause a hole in her; I should say in less than three or four hours—the pace at which she was going would indicate a good sea and wind—I have heard a description given of what the captain did; the getting out the jolly-boat and longboat, I think that was a right thing to do, as far as my judgment goes—whether they would use the pumps would depend on the number of persons there were to do it; in this case there were only twelve persons, and I think they were fully occupied the whole time in clewing the sails and getting the ropes and anchor into the boats, and such like—I don't think they would have much spare time—I think if there had been a few smacks near at hand, and forty or fifty hands, it might have done to use the pumps, but not with the number there was—the island is uninhabited.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 48, Church-street, in the parish of Stoke Newington—I am superintendent of the Home for the Reception of Fallen Women—the house is ruled by the committee, one of whom is Richard Beynon Williams—the prisoner was an inmate there twelve days—she left on 3d January—on the evening of the 4th the house was shut up and closed, and on the morning of the 5th, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I found the back part of the house open, which had been barred up—I think it had been entered by the kitchen-window, which does not fasten, but which was closed the night previous—I saw a foot-print which, I think, was a woman's, on a table under the window, and the same through a pas<lb/>sage,</p>

On 27th January, at a quarter part 11 in the morning, I was on duty in Euston-street, and saw the prisoner and ten or twelve others standing just inside the door of the Adam and Eve public-house—I ordered them all to move from there as they were obstructing the door—they all stepped out on the pavement—I told them they could not remain there, they must go over the way to the soup kitchen if they had come there for soup—they all left but the prisoner, who said he would see me b----before he left—I said that I must remove him if he did not, and put my hand on him to shove him into the road—he came on to the pavement and said, "You move me away from here again if you dare; I will stand here as long as I like"—the landlord came out, and asked me to remove the people, as he could not carry on his business—I told the prisoner he must go away, and he used very bad language, and said, "Now I will give you something;" and struck me on the face several times for five or six minutes—I closed with him, and we had a severe scuffle, during which somebody shouted out, "Mind, policeman, he has got a knife;" and I felt something sharp under my cheek—he was seized by several people, and with assistance, we got him to the station—I was cut through my cheek, and on the side of the nose—my cape was also scratched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lewis, of 28, Bolton-road, Bayswater—in December last, I had a brother, named John Knight, who was confined in Millbank penitentiary—on 1st December I wrote and posted a letter to him directed to the prison, by the governor's orders—on 28th December the prisoner came to me at my house, between 7 and 8 in the evening—he brought two letters to me; the one I had sent my brother, and a note from my brother in pencil—these are the letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't say whose handwriting the one in pencil is; I don't think it is my brother's; I don't know—the prisoner said he was an officer in the Millbank prison, and that he had come from my brother; that he had run a great risk by coming, and that I should see by the note what he required—he then handed the note to me—he said, "This letter will convince you that I have come from your brother"—my husband was there—he read the note, and went down to him to answer him—he told him he could not give the pound to him mentioned in that letter; and then the prisoner said, "You must send a note to that effect"—my husband asked him up stairs; and he said, You have got to write a note to your brother, to tell him you can't let him have a pound"—I said, "I thought it was against the rules"—he did not make any answer to that—he staid about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—we gave him no money, or tobacco, or anything; my husband said he could not afford it; he had just buried my mother—(<hi rend="italic">The note in pencil was as follows</hi>;" My dear sister—I received your last kind and welcome letter, and was very glad to hear that all of you were in good health; and so am I, and I thank God for it; dear sister I am very sorry to say that I do not get half enough food to eat; but, dear sister, I have got this kind officer to come to you; I wish you to give him one pound and some tobacco, and then I shall be all right, and it will be a great comfort to me, because I may never have another opportunity of sending to you by this way. This man is very kind to me, and so, dear sister, as you should know that he is come from me, I send you this letter that you sent me last. If you give him it, what I have sent for to-night, I shall get it in the morning. So no more. Send me a note.")</p>

               <p>some samples of these plates down to Mr. Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's—Mr. Newbury told me to do that—I was to see what I could get advanced upon them—I showed them to Mr. Cloud, the manager at Mr. Atten<lb/>borough's—I won't be sure whether I told him how many I had got—he said how much a pound he would advance on them; I can't say what the price was—I went back and told Mr. Newbury how much I could get upon them, and afterwards, on 8th April I took about 160 of those brass plates and thirty-six copper plates down to the pawnbroker's by his direction—I put them into his horse and cart which he had not sold then—I and Welsh took them to the pawnbroker's—Mr. Cloud had them weighed and made an advance upon them of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—he gave me this deposit note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not swear this is the one; when I got it I signed this, that is my signature, "William Luck"—I took the deposit note and the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back to Mr. Newbury—this signature on 21st September is not my handwriting—I was examined at the Court of Bankruptcy on 20th October—I had nothing to do with the removal of these things from the pawnbroker's—(<hi rend="italic">The deposit note contained the weight of the plates</hi>, 7<hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">gr., left on security of a loan of</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">with power of sale if not redeemed within</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">months, it was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1864.)</p>

               <p>I did not know who he was—I knew he was not the same party who deposited it, I thought as a matter of course that the transaction was all straight-forward—the plates were redeemed on 20th October, I do not know who fetched them away—there was a horse and a cart and a man—this deposit note was brought to me when they were redeemed—the money was paid and the goods given up—the first I heard of the name of Newbury was when this prosecution was instituted—I don't know bow many copper plates there were—they were all weighed together.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">In each of these accounts, there was a charge of "Boat and two men through canal</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—I paid him the total sums on these papers—these accounts were delivered at the same time as the wages' accounts, and the amounts paid to the prisoner on each, on the faith of these documents being genuine and containing a true, account—I had not given him in<lb/>structions to discharge any one after the second and third voyages of the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi>—I saw him every Monday from 6th June up to 18th October; but until 18th October, I was not aware that the number had been reduced from eight to seven—I met Cutting subsequently to 18th October—I after<lb/>wards saw the defendant and told him I thought he was acting unfairly and unjustly towards Cutting, after his having passed and obtained Her Majesty's certificate—he said that the man had not carried on the duties of the ship to his satisfaction—I afterwards saw Cutting again, and communicated to him what the defendant said; and I subsequently, about 6th December, had Cutting face to face with the defendant; and, reading from this document, I said, "It appears for three weeks after 12th April, up to the time of Cutting leaving, you have been working the vessel with seven hands instead of eight, and it is a very awkward thing"—he said, "I was not aware of it"—Cutting left, and I then pointed out to the defendant the very serious nature of affairs; and said that, unless he could prove that his documents were true, he would stand in a very awkward position—he said after a little while that he was not aware of it, and that he could make it good; he could return it—I said that that was not the point at all, and that he would be in a very awkward position, and I could not treat with him upon that—this occurred on Tuesday, and he left Mr. Robinson's service on the following Monday—I did not dismiss him, for which I was reprimanded—the money I handed to him on 23d May was Mr. Robinson's—he carries on business in Mark-lane, and I am manager under him—they were not my moneys—I gave him a cheque signed, by myself by procuration for Mr. Robinson—at the time of his dismissal, my attention had not been called to the charge of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going through the canal to Rotterdam, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going back from Rotterdam—the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> continued her voyages after</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I live at 28, Marine-street, Bermondsey—I was on board the Magnet with the defendant, as chief officer—he was master—on 12th April, 1864, I was transferred to the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi>—she sailed for Rotterdam every Wednesday, and returned every Sunday—on the first voyage I went, I had eight hands under my control—these are their names (On a list), and there was a boy named Peter Conolly—I paid the hands—I got the money from the master—I paid the eight hands and the boy On the first voyage—I had nothing to do with the engine-room, or with the steward and cook—after the third voyage, the defendant told me that Mr. Robinson would not allow more than seven hands, and I was to discharge one, and mentioned Turner in particular, who he said was neglectful at the wheel—I told him Turner had been quartermaster so long, and proposed discharging the last man who entered the ship, Charles May, which I did—he had been under me previously, as well as a man named Todd, who was working with May for a week before his discharge—Todd afterwards left the service—that was in the fourth week—May had been only one week in the ship when he had to leave—Todd left the next week, and then May was</p>

               <p>taken back again—May was in the ship a week and out of the ship a week, and then he returned—only seven hands and a boy were then used to navigate the ship, and I paid them the amounts against their names, amounting to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that included the second mate and carpenter—it was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when I first joined the ship—I got the money to pay the wages from the captain—I had nothing to do with these lists—I did not see them alter I had left—the captain did not hire a boat to go up the canal to Rotterdam during those three weeks, 23d May, 30th May, and 6th June, nor any boat or men to come down the canal—a boat was used at the entrance of the canal at Helvoetsluys to run the ropes away, going in and out—I know nothing about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being paid for it—another boat was used at the New sluice going out—no boats were hired but those two—no other boot was used through the canal except the ship's boat, manned by her own people—I had nothing to do with making up these disbursement accounts, and never saw them—on 18th October, I left the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> as the prisoner came to me and told me that it was Mr. Robinson's request that I should stop at home to obtain a master's certificate, as they could not allow any mates to be without one—I stayed for that purpose, and passed ray examination; I have my certificate in my pocket—I then went back to see the captain, and told him I had got my certificate, and that Mr. Robinson had told me to see him as he had said nothing about it—I then walked away and applied for another berth, but was refused, as I could not give an account why I had left my last ship—I afterwards saw Mr. Roberts—he had this paper (produced) in his hand—it is ray writing—he told me to Walk Outside the office and I do not know what he said to the defendant—I do not know how many people were in the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> after I passed my examination—I occasionally went on board—the mate took charge of the ship in my place—there were seven hands when I left—I know nothing about these accounts—I said nothing to Mr. Roberts about them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the eight men under your control? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I discharged May on Monday afternoon—we went away on Wednesday, and when I returned on Sunday, Todd bad a little more tobacco than he was allowed, and I discharged him for it; May came on board looking for a berth, and I took him on again—the captain was not consulted at all; it was always left to me—I give a discharge to the men—printed forms are signed by the captain in blank, and I fill them up on discharging seamen—I filled one up for May, who is now in one of Mr. Robinson's steamers; the Lyons, trading between London and Harlingen; he remained till the end of Sep<lb/>tember—he was out of berth a week, and then he went up the Baltic; he came back and went into the Lyons—I gave Todd a discharge; it does not specify the character; he came to the captain afterwards and got a written character—he has been working for me lately in my new ship—I left the Magnet because her station was altered and bet captain and deck hands transferred—I had shipped from the <hi rend="italic">Lyons to the Magnet</hi> on 7th August previously—when I lived in Marine-street, and was not at sea, I used to drive about a little now and then for pleasure, in a light working cart—the man who the cart belonged to drove—I never drove a pair of greys—I drove twice to Bexley, and twice to Bromley, and the last time I went down the Croydon-road with my wife and friends—I believe I gave up driving out before I was discharged; I began it in the spring—I did not drive every Sunday, because every other Sunday we were late, according to the tide—the cart holds six; we paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, drove to a public-house to tea, and divided the expenses—my wages are 21 a week—in going through the canal</p>

               <p>the boat is not kept at the stern; it is kept to heave the ship off by—our own people go into our own boat and make the ropes fast to the posts—there are men at the ends of the canal to fasten the ropes to the posts; I do not know whether anything is paid them for that, as the same men attend to the ship after she is through the locks—the boat is used to pull the vessel away from whichever side she touches—I am mostly on the forecastle deck, but not altogether—the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> is 560 tons—other boats are hired at the entrance and the exit of the canal, going out and coming in—men always go ashore and attend the ship until she is locked through—I do not know what the charges are—the canal is about seven miles long, and there is a lock at each end—one lock is close to Helvoetsluys, and the other is called the New Sluice—I told Mr. Roberts that Todd was discharged when I was at the office.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the crew frequently changed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not fre<lb/>quently, we had fresh faces perhaps once in a month or two—the seven seamen would be all over the ship during the voyage, wherever they were required—the helmsman is one of the seamen—five men are employed in different parts of the vessel, and two quartermasters to look after the cargo in harbour—the canal men fastened the ropes to the posts to keep the ship straight in the lock—we seldom had any ropes out in the canal unless a ship was passing, and then we used our own boat—she gets aground occasionally and then we throw out the ropes and use our own boat—the ropes are made fast to the posts by our men—we employ a boat to pull us into the first gate of the lock, and when we are in the lock and the gate is shut we occa<lb/>sionally use the canal men to make the ropes fast—the lock is one ship's length and seven or eight feet more—when we are through we have to go through the canal and do the same thing at the other end—going through the two locks will sometimes take an hour and sometimes two—Mr. Savage is the new mate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say a word about the captain till you had been discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said it then—I did not go before the Police-court—I have not given evidence before this—some lad came and said that I was to be at Mr. Robinson's office at 9 o'clock next morning as they wanted to see me, and in the evening Mr. Cutting came round and also asked me to go next morning—he knew where to find me, because I had left my address on board the ship and at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Mount-street, New-road, Whitechapel, and am a carman in partnership with Mr. Cook—I know the three prisoners—I know a place at Brewer's Quay, belonging to Messrs. Barber and Co., which is known as "Phillips' Warehouse"—Phillips was the warehouseman, and the other two were foreman—I have been in the habit of going to Brewer's Quay, I think, ten years—I saw the prisoners every time I went there—I have been in the habit of buying the sugar-sweepings—I first commenced, I think, in 1855—I bought them of Phillips at that time—I used to be at Fennings and Fishers after some empties—Mr. Brickler took me to Mr. Kent, and Mr. Kent took me to Mr. Phillips, and I bought the sugar-sweepings of him—Kent now occupies the situation which Mr. Green occupied—I remember a transaction about eighteen mouths ago—on that occasion I bought two and a half hundredweight of sweepings, one cask—I made the bargain for that cask with Green—he was not then in the service of Barber and Co—he was at Bow Common, in a chemical place—he was out of their service for a short time—I believe the bargain was made at my house at the same price as before—he said there were some sweepings down there they wanted to sell; I could fetch them away at the same price I had before; that was five shillings a hundredweight—I went down to the warehouse in the course</p>

               <p>of a day or so, and saw Holman and Phillips—I gave Holman half a sovereign then, and in the coarse of a day or two, I went and took the cask away—the ten shillings was as part payment—Phillips was there when I took the cask away—I paid the rest of the money to Holman—Phillips was present—I, and Phillips, and Holman went out and had a glass of ale together—the cask weighed about two and a half hundredweight—I took it to my own pre<lb/>mises—my partner, Mr. Cook afterwards sold it; I dare say I had had it in the yard a mouth when he sold it—he sold it to a Mr. Cohen—Mr. Cook is here—I did not see Bacon—I do not know him—I did not see the money paid for the sugar.</p>

I am a detective officer of the City—on Friday, 18th November I took Green into custody at his house in York-street, Stepney, about three or four in the afternoon—I told him I had got instructions to apprehend him for stealing a quantity of sugar-sweepings, the property of his late employers, Messrs. Barber and Co.—I said, 'I shall ask you a few questions, you can please yourself about answering them, how often have you sold sugar-sweepings?"—he said, "Three or four times,"—I said, "Do you mean three or four times previous to the middle of last year, July or August?"—he said, "Yes, the last lot I sold was about July last, they realized about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that his share was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and that the other money was divided between Phillips and Holman—he said he had sold the sweepings to Pope by Phillips* order—I took him to the station and he was charged—I took Phillips about 24th November, I think, at his house in Grafton-street, Mile-End—I told him that I had instructions to apprehend him for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of sugar-sweep<lb/>ings, the property of his late employers, Messrs. Barber and Co.—about a week previous to that, in company with Sergeant Huggett, I went to Phillips' house and saw him—I then told him that we were officers and that there had been a very large robbery of sugar at Messrs. Barber and Co.'s warehouse, that we were going to put some questions to him, and that it would entirely depend upon his answers how we should act in the matter—I particularly told him that he had better say the truth or else not answer at all—I then took down his statement in my memorandum book which I have here (reading: "Mr. Saunders was above me—I never sold any sweepings, directly or indirectly—I have known sweepings have been collected—I have seen chips collected—I did not receive 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at any time—I never received any money—in 1851 Mr. James Barber gave me a few sweepings—I have known sweepings go out about four, five, or six years ago to the man who bought Fenning's hogsheads—the money was divided among the whole of us on the floor; previous to June Holman gave me some money, but I do not know what it was for—Green has often tried to sell loaves of sugar to Mr. Ferguson at the Duke of wellington the back of Stepney Church, near</p>

I am a clerk in the employment of the prosecutors—the mode of business is this, when goods are coming in, take, for instance, 1270 loads of sugar coming in on 4th July, 1864—it would be first the duty of the foreman Phillips to see what quantity was coming into the warehouse so as to make allowance for room—he then would appoint a tallyman, a man to tally the sugar into the warehouse from the quay—previous to that it would be weighed by the Custom-house officer, who is one of our clerks, and then tallied into the warehouse by the tallyman—that is for the Customs, for the duty, and for our own protection—Phillips would appoint his tallyman in the warehouse, and he would see the sugars tallied, and if there was any discrepancy between the tally in the warehouse and the tally on the quay, reference would be then made to the tally on the quay—if it agreed it would be put into this book, which we call the stock-book by Green or Holman, the under foremen—we should return a landing account, the landing weight of the sugar to the merchant from the quay—in the event of sugar going out from the warehouse; if a merchant requires fifty loads of sugar he would give a delivery order for it to his carman—the carman would take it into our counting-house, which is on the quay, away from the warehouse, that order would be marked by an authorized clerk,</p>

               <p>who has a counterpart of what is in the warehouses in his book, and given back to the carman, who would be told what particular warehouse to take it into—it would be the duty either of Holman or Green to receive the order in Phillip's warehouse, or, perhaps Phillips would receive the order himself, one of the three—they would then see the goods put into the scale and weighed out, and then loaded into a van—the foreman, whoever he might be, would give what is called a cart note to the carman—it is a sort of receiving note—it describes the ship, the date of the importation, and to whom it is going—whoever delivers it signs that for our firm, and the weight is put on the back—those are the counterfoils of the notes which you have there—the same would be on the counterfoil as on the note—sweepings would not be delivered out of the warehouse without an order from the manager—sugar sweepings would not be in our books, because they are waste—the order from the manager would undoubtedly be in writing—I have been in the service about twelve years—the men were never in my experience permitted to take the sugar sweepings—I never saw Green or Holman on the matter of deficiencies until after the discharge of Green—some two or three weeks after his discharge he called at our office—I said to him, "Do you know anything about sweepings?'—he said, "No, I don't know anything about them"—I said, "Did you never sell any"—he said, "No"—I said, "But you received in July or August 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your share"—he said, "It is a lie"—I said, "Holman told me so"—I then sent for Holman—when he came Green said, "Yes, there were some sweepings"—I said, "How much did you sell them for?"—he said, "About a shilling a hundredweight"—I turned to Holman and said, "It was more than that they were sold for"—Holman paid, "I think it was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but I do not know how much they were sold for; I only had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my share"—Green then said, "It might have been five or six shillings"—nothing more was said—in the course of the year 1864 we have had to pay a very great deal to merchants for deficiences in sugar.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>). I am an in<lb/>spector of labour at Brewer's-quay—I was above Phillips—I attended daily at his warehouse—I could direct him what to do, and what not to do; in tome things, I did—I was supposed to be his master—I controlled his pro<lb/>ceedings when necessary—I have been there between six and seven years—I was not always master over Phillips; I have been to ft year, or not quite, perhaps, not before June, 1863—a man named Owen was his master before then; he was in my position—my duty is to attend round all the ware-houses and see that everything is done properly, and to see that there is no waste in the out-door expenditure; that is, in the ware-houses—I am often in Phillips' warehouse; I might be there perhaps twice in half an hour, and I might not ho there for three-quarters of an hour or an hour—I am not aware where Mr. Owen is now; he has left the employment—I don't know that efforts have been made to find him—the number of loaves broken all depends on the parcels—I have known seventy or eighty loaves broken in a hundred—they are wrapped up in paper, and you can't always tell whether they are broken—I have known as many as seventy or eighty per cent. broken, but very seldom—of course there would be a great deal of waste—a quarter per cent, is a liberal allowance for waste—all the pieces that could be possibly put in would be put in and tied up—the paper is not always broken with the sugar, not in the majority of instances—it is passed up through the hands, and there is no breakage—it depends upon how the sugar is broken whether it would break the paper—a thousand loaves an hour is very quick for packing into the warehouse—it is not often so quick as that; from nine hundred to a thousand would be about it.</p>

From about May down to about September, 1864—about five or six months on goods imported—what amount of goods were imported during that time I am not in a position to say; these losses were on particular parcels of sugar—the gross weight of those parcels might be 60, 000 tons, or it might be 100, 000—it was a very busy time; it might have been 60, 000 or 70, 000 tons, per<lb/>haps about 75, 000—we had a receiving stock of about 2, 000 tons in the warehouse, in and out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know anything about the deficiencies you paid in 1863? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We paid no deficiencies in 1863—previous to that the importa<lb/>tion of refined sugar was comparatively small—it was after the reduction of duty that we had to pay the deficiency—the reduction kept the coarser quality out—the class of sugar that came previous to the reduction was of a finer description—we have reason to believe that having a fine class of sugar, it was substituted the one for the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some of these deficiencies you had to pay for in 1864 might have arisen from sugar that came in 1863? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have done so—no notice was posted up at all forbidding perquisites; we don't have written rules in our establishment, the men know what the rules are—that was a mistake with regard to the butter-scrapings—I can explain with regard to the bacon-scrapings; in the provision-floor a merchant will have, say 200 barrels of pork, he will want them cleaned and put into merchantable condition; he would have the casks turned out, and all the pieces of beef or pork trimmed—he will then say to the warehouseman, "You may have the pieces, they are no use to me"—that is the merchant's allowance—they are allowed by the merchants—the wharfinger does not have to make up any deficiency or loss.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any arrangement as to what should be done with these sweepings that were swept up from these floors? A. No more than putting them on the dust-heap.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that Phillips was acting under the impression that he was entitled to those? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say what his impression was—the firm certainly had no knowledge of it; they did not recognise any waste except the merchants' perquisites—if the loss did not exceed a quarter per cent. the merchant did not object—I was associated with the late manager of the firm, and he would never allow anything of the kind in the shape of perquisites—I have spoken to some of the officers in the establishment on the subject of per<lb/>quisites—if a new man was engaged he would not be told that no sweepings were allowed to be taken, because to allow perquisites would be giving them a <hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi> to sell what they liked—the dust on the heap was taken away by the parish contractor.</p>

I had only just returned from there; it was very foggy indeed; it took me some time to get home. I went to meet the suffering man's wife, and saw her part of the way home, and came down the Cut into the Waterloo-road. I had not returned very long before the constable came and apprehended me for this offence. I am as innocent of it as any one of you.</p>

About half-past 3 o'clock on 2d January, I was in Brunswick-street, and saw the two prisoners and another distinctly—I was within twenty yards of them, and knew them by sight, having seen them before—Mabley spoke to me after they had passed, and from what he said I followed them down Brunswick-street into St. George's-street, New Kent-road—I pursued them over a mile into Brent's-court, Borough—I was going down the court when Osborne bolted out of it, and a constable who was in front of me stopped him—I had not lost sight of them—I distinctly swear Osborne is one of the men—Lawson escaped over a wall at the other end of the court, and No. 360 sprung his rattle—I distinctly saw Lawson, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lawson. Q.</hi> How came you to lose sight of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I went after the other prisoner—I had a good view of you all the way, and you passed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Osborne. Q.</hi> If you knew I was a thief, and was coming up the court, would you allow me to pass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have stopped you if I had had the opportunity.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 295). On 26th January, I was on duty near St. Saviour's church, and heard a rattle springing—I saw Lawson run<lb/>ning, pursued him, and got up within a yard of him—he undid the front of his trousers, took a piece of velvet out, and threw it at my feet—I imme<lb/>diately struck him, secured him, and found this scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his pocket—he said, "The other man has got the <hi rend="italic">lob</hi>"—that means the bulk of it <hi rend="italic">Lawson's Defence.</hi> I met a fish-carrier, who I know; he had two parcels, and said, "I do not want to get these wet." He put one inside his trousers, and I put the other inside mine. There was a taller man with him, and when we got into the court he said, "You must throw that velvet away. To tell you the truth, I did not come by it right." I threw it away, but I did not throw the scarf away, as he made me a present of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Osborne's Defence.</hi> I had been to the Surrey theatre, and was stopped by a policeman. Nobody gave me in charge. I was kept standing there for ten minutes before I was taken to the station. If I had been a thief, I should have got over the wall also. No property was found on me.</p>
