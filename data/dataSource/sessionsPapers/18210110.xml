                  <interp inst="t18210110-1-crimeloc6" type="placeName" value="Drury-lane"/>

                        targets="t18210110-1-off1 t18210110-1-crimeloc6"/>; on arriving opposite Charles-street, and passing near the north-east corner, I was near a house which was shut up - I received a push on my right side, and thinking somebody meant to pass, I turned aside, and got into Charles-street; immediately on my arrival there, a person stood close in front of me, and I received a violent blow on my head, which, from the position in which I stood, must have been struck behind me, or on my side - it cut a hole in my hat, and my head bled considerably. I have the scar still, and shall carry it to my grave. Immediately on receiving the blow, the man in front cried out</p>
               <p>"Halloo! where are you pushing to?" and at the same instant my watch was snatched from my fob - it was a gold horizontal watch, capped and jewelled; the dial plate, instead of the usual figures, had my name and the date, 1808, in Roman characters; a ribbon, two seals, and a key were fixed to the watch. On my receiving the blow, and the snatch at my watch, I was staggered for a moment, then made a plunge at the man who took the watch, and he endeavoured to lay hold of me, but I fell with the effect of the blow with my hand down on the pavement, and my back against the house. I immediately jumped up to pursue the man whom I saw with the watch in his hand. I believe the man who cried halloo to be the man who took it, but am not certain; he ran up Charles-street, I immediately got up and attempted to pursue him, but had not got above three or four steps before some person in the street made a blow at me, which I warded off. I got into Drury-lane, some persons came round, and said</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, you are all over blood?" I went into a shop, found myself covered with blood, which streamed down all over my face. I enquired for a surgeon, a boy came into the shop, and gave me information. I went home, was confined to my house fourteen days, and was under a medical man's hands for three weeks. The effects of the blow raised the scalp, and injured one of my arteries - the surgeon feared I should have had a locked jaw. When I recovered, I went and found the boy out, and went with him to the Coach and Horses, Belton-street, St. Giles's - I did not go into the house - the officers brought the prisoners out. The boy was waiting in a coach in Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoners were taken into a public-house in Holborn, the boy was sent in and came out again. I stood in the passage, and saw there were about thirty persons there. This was about half-past ten o'clock on Saturday evening. In consequence of what the boy said we took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent your watch to be repaired - A. Yes; in April, 1819, I sent it by my clerk to Mr. Fowinkle; I had let it fall, and the works were broken - I received it back repaired. In October I broke the glass, and it was repaired again by Mr. Vanburin. When I broke the glass I was all day on horseback, and the motion of the horse bent the hour hand. I received it back from Vanburin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was the state of the night - A. It was a dark foggy night - the gas was lit. I think it was about ten minutes past five o'clock. I saw several women of the town about, but not the boy; there were gas lights in the shop on the opposite side. The boy came to me immediately after, but I did not ask his address, he is the same boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Bullock say at Bow-street that he bought the watch - A. On his first examination he declined saying anything, but when he was fully committed he said he bought it.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Was there sufficient light to distinguish one person from another - A. Yes; but from the effect of the blow, I will not speak to either of them.</p>

            . I am near sixteen years old. I have known the prisoners perfectly well for nearly a year, and have often seen them in company with each other. I remember Mr. Hall being knocked down. I saw the prisoners come out of the Coach and Horses, Charles-street, they went towards Drury-lane - a third man stood in the road, in Drury-lane, facing the end of Charles-street - one of them whistled, I cannot say which; the man in Drury-lane shoved Mr. Hall into Charles-street as he crossed, then the prisoners pulled him in - they pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100004"/>him down, and struck him with a little ash-stick as well as I could see; another man came up and said, halloo! and something else. Wootten pushed his hand up, and at that time the watch was taken; I did not see the watch, but saw the seals in his hand as he pulled his hand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hall struck before he was pulled down - A. He was pulled down first as far as I could see; I am sure Bullock struck him, he had the stick, I have seen him carrying that ash-stick about often before. When they ran away Mr. Hall got up, and went into an eating-house, I went to see how he was hurt, and he went to a surgeon's with the waiter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. I work at Mr. Bryanston's, wheelwright's shop, in Charles-street. I was going to fetch a candle for one of the men, and was coming up Charles-street into Drury-lane, when this happened, I was on the opposite side to Mr. Hall. I was afraid to speak, but I saw what was done, and heard the man say, Halloo! Bullock had a top coat and top boots on. Wootten was close by when Bullock struck Mr. Hall, he had a black or dark blue coat on, brown pantaloons, shoes and stockings, they both had copper buttons; I took a deal of notice of their dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not notice their dress, because you could not see their faces - A. I knew them perfectly well. I noticed their dress for fear I should be asked about it. I knew them without their clothes. I noticed their dress to make myself more certain, as I had not an opportunity of seeing their faces. I do not remember speaking to Mr. Hall in the shop, I spoke to the waiter; I told my parents and the men what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not say, that you did not know the men, and noticed their dress that you might describe them as you did not see their faces - A. No, I knew their faces well. My sister lives at the eating-house, I went in one night, and the master of the house asked if I was the boy who saw the gentleman knocked down? it was a week or a fortnight after. I did not give information at the office, being afraid they would injure me; my father did not tell me to go till I saw Mr. Hall. I have often seen the prisoners in the Coach and Horses public-house, my father uses the house, and whenever I saw them in the street after, I said to my father</p>
               <p>"There are the men." I was brought up in Clerkenwell charity-school, and go to St. Giles's church. I pointed the prisoners out when they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been living since Mr. Hall found you out - A. In the Commercial-road, I was taken there for fear any of the party should catch hold of me.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. When Mr. Hall found you, did you describe the prisoners to the officers - A. Yes, I saw them in the day-time at the public-house in Charles-street, and fetched the officer, but when we went they were gone, and were taken at night. When the officers brought them out I was in a coach waiting to see them, they brought them past the coach, and I knew them. I afterwards went into a public-house to see them, and pointed them out standing up with a great many people, who were drinking spirits. When I spoke to the waiter of the eating-house, I said</p>
               <p>"I saw this done, and know who did it."</p>

            . I am an officer. From the description of the boy, I went and apprehended the prisoners at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Belton-street. The boy was in a coach; we took them to the Spread Eagle, public-house, Broad-street, we did not take them by the coach, it was on the other side of the way. The boy saw them at the Spread Eagle, with three or four others and some other officers; he said the prisoners were the two - they were taken away directly - this was Saturday evening the 2d of December. I searched Bullock, and found this watch on him, which I produce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are well known about St. Giles's - A. I have lived in the neighbourhood eight years, and have known the prisoners by sight a good while, and saw them at different times after the robbery; two or three women and three or four of our officers were with them when the boy pointed them out. I never heard anything of this sort of them before. The boy's description led me to look for them. I apprehended them ten minutes after I had received it.</p>
               <p>MARTENUS VANBURIN. Mr. Hall sent me a watch to repair in October last. I straitened the hour-hand, and put a new lunet-glass to it, the dial plate had, John Hall. 1808, or 1818, in Roman characters, instead of the figures, The watch now produced has now quite a different dial, but I know it by the hour-hand, which has a dent where it was straitened, and where I burnished it over; the centre wheel arbor was raised, but on account of the glass being low I filed it at the top to keep it from the glass.

            . In 1819, I was servant to Mr. Gantony, a watch-maker, in Cheapside. I received a watch from the last witness, which was Mr. Hall's; it was repaired and returned to him. We always enter the number of the watches we receive. I produce the entry of this, - (reads) -</p>
               <p>"Gold watch, name Chater, No. 8,348." It had had a fall, which broke the cylinder; we put a new one and a new wheel. The name Chater is not on it now, the name piece is now thinned, the screws are as they originally were. The name appears to be filed out, and another put on; it is newly gilt. I do not find the number on it now, but on the cap I think the No. 8,348, has been filed, and an attempt made to scratch it out; I can trace those figures now. It is usual for the manufacturers to scratch the number on the cap. I find it has the same wheel and cylinder which I put in it; the index-piece I can speak to, it being very remarkable, and to the best of my belief it is the index-piece of Mr. Hall's watch. I do not know Anthony, a watch-maker. I remember the case was much bruised, and was not repaired so well as I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100005"/>wish - they hung rather on the hinges, which they do now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know you repaired that watch - A. Yes, and know it was for Mr. Hall. The alterations could possibly be made in twelve hours.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL re-examined. I know the watch by the hour-hand, the dent remains in it, which I observed on receiving it from Mr. Vanburin, and on the cap the old number appears to be obliterated. The No. 4,276, is put on, and the old No. 8,348, appears under it; I also know the string and key now affixed to it, to be mine.</p>
               <p>WOOTTEN'S Defence. I call God to witness that I am innocent. The boy does not know the nature of an oath, or that my life depends upon his word; he is a cruel boy, and God will reward him.</p>
               <p>BULLOCK'S Defence. I bought the watch for 11 l. 10 s.</p>

            . I live at No. 33, Great Earl-street, Seven Dials. I hardly ever miss passing a night at the Coach and horses, public-house, Belton-street. I know the prisoners, they frequented there very often; on the night after the fire in Drury-lane, in particular, I remember seeing them there. Two persons came in and mentioned the robbery, one came in about a quarter of an hour after the other; when they came in I saw Bullock sitting by the left side of the fire, and Wootten sat facing me. Bullock was playing at dominoes. A person came in, and said a gentleman had been knocked down at the corner of Charles-street, was cut in the face, and taken to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. I left work about a quarter past four o'clock, and I think I got there about half-past four o'clock; I had been there about a quarter or half an hour when the man came in and stated about the robbery. I suppose it was about half-past five o'clock, but will not speak to a quarter of an hour. Bullock was not out of the house for more than five minutes - they could not be out of my sight long enough to commit a robbery in Charles-street and return. I can almost swear they were not out at all till the men came in.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Why frequent a house so far off - A. It is not far. I work for the landlord and several who come there - there were fourteen or fifteen people there, one Ingram was there; I do not recollect any others by name, I may know their persons. I was present when Maidment took them out of the house - they were both playing at dominoes together; they asked what was the matter? he said he did not know. Next day I saw Maidment, and asked what it was for? he said for a highway robbery on such a day in Drury-lane; I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, the men were in my company at the very time." I did not ask where I could go to state this.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not five o'clock when you got to the house - A. Yes, I left work when it was getting dark, cleaned myself, and went there; it was not very dark when I got there. I believe the lamps were lit. Bullock might leave the room for a moment for a particular purpose. When they were taken all the company in the room said they were not out of the room - eight or ten said so - they said so the night after they were apprehended. I came here to day of my own accord, nobody asked me to come. I asked Maidment when the trial would be - I told nobody what I was going to state here.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the misfortune to be here before - A, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on this side of the bar or the other - A. The other, I was charged three or four years ago with receiving two sheets.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you convicted - A. I had twelve months imprisonment. I think the latest time I got to the public-house was half-past four o'clock. I suppose it was an hour afterwards that I heard of the robbery; one of them must have passed me to go out. Vickers was sitting in the room under the clock.</p>

            . I am a printer. The last place I worked at was for Russell, at Guilford. I live at No. 38, George-street, Bloomsbury. I frequent the Coach and Horses, public-house, and perfectly well remember one night somebody coming in and saying a gentleman had been robbed in Drury-lane. I got to the public-house that day between three and four o'clock - the information was given after five o'clock; the prisoners were in the room at the time, Bullock sat in the box when I went into the room, and Wootten was in another part of the room.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Where did Farthing sit - A. At the opposite end of the box facing the fire in the corner-seat; Bullock sat about the middle of the table between Farthing and me, on the left of Farthing; Wootten sat opposite to Farthing by the fire side. I was there when they were taken. The robbery was talked of in the course of the next day. Wootten was smoking his pipe, and joining in conversation; Bullock and I were talking together. I do not remember their playing at any game. I first saw them there between three and four o'clock. I was there all the evening with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since Russell employed you - A. Three years, I have been out of employ ever since. I receive money from my son, who works for Mr. Davey, a printer. I have no money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first mention this - A. It was the general conversation. Pritchard, the landlord, knew the prisoners very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in trouble yourself - A. I have, I do not know that I am bound to say what for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you charged with a robbery - A. Yes, only once. I was tried here for house-breaking two years ago. I have had no conversation with the prisoners since they were taken; their friends told me they were to be tried to-day. One Brandon told me it was necessary to prove, if possible, that they were there, and asked if I objected to come and state the truth. I have worked on the Sun, Statesman, and Examiner newspapers, some years ago. I kept a public-house at Westminster some years back.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night the prisoners were taken, are you sure it was said that the prisoners were at the house at the time of the robbery - A. Yes, I am confident it was mentioned the night they were taken, directly after they were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you derive the information that they were charged with a robbery that night - A. Directly after they were taken it was said they were charged with this robbery - I do not know who mentioned the charge. I recollected their being in the house, and said so; Farthing was there - I remember it because it was the day after Lord Mayor's day, and in the course of the following Sunday or Monday I ascertained the gentleman's name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100006"/>who was robbed. I heard the prisoners were to be tried last Session, but I did not come.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did the officer say what they were charged with - A. I do not know. I have lived in George-street at different times for twelve months, Mr. Ennes is my landlord.</p>

A great number came up, and placed themselves in the same position with their backs towards me - there were fifteen or twenty of them, they walked backwards towards me all shoulder to shoulder. I was alarmed, and tried to force out from them by pushing between them and the wall with my shoulders; they forced me back again, and hustled against me - the prisoner was one of them. They enclosed me all round against the wall. I felt a hand come against my watch-chain, and collared the prisoner, who held my watch-chain; I am positive he is the man, I had seen him three or four times before, and am as certain of him as of my own existence - he had been pointed out to me as a thief. I held him by the collar, and saw him pull the watch from me; a hand came between us, and received the watch from him - I have not recovered the watch. Somebody seized my hand, and held me fast; I held the prisoner with the other hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have I got you?" I called out A thief! and immediately they all fell to striking me. My head was so swelled with the blows I could not put my hat on for several days, my neck and shoulders were much bruised - they struck with their fists. I was totally senseless, and do not know what happened to me. When I came to myself I was on the ground, I had forgot what had happened, and felt for my watch - the men were all gone then. I was only senseless a short time, for the crowd with the procession had not got up on my recovering. I saw the prisoner again on the next Friday evening, and knew him instantly. I had a good view of his face, and I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Are you acquainted much with thieves - A. No, only two; the prisoner and another had been pointed out to me as such; when he was pointed out his nose was bleeding, a young man had struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the officer before you came here - A. No. It was about ten minutes before eleven o'clock; the procession had not got up. They all enclosed round me - the blows were struck before my watch was taken - I saw the prisoner take it, I had such a view of him as to identify him immediately - I had an oblique view of him. I think it was the second Saturday after the death of the late King that he was first pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you could swear to him by the colour of his coat - A. No, never in my life. He had an olive brown frock-coat on, black velvet collar, a high shirt-collar, and a fashionable bell-crowned hat; he was always dressed genteel when I saw him. If he was tarred and feathered all over except his face I could swear to him. I described him at the office, and mentioned his particular walk. I could only see the hand of the man who received the watch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Friday the first time you saw him - A. I saw him on the Tuesday, but was not certain he was the man, and there being two or three together I did not like to take him. The prosecutor described him minutely.

               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say so - A. Because he was very poor, and had nothing about him. I thought if he was a thief he would be better dressed, and there is a man about Whitechapel very much like him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of December, I saw the officer in Salisbury-street, and asked him if he had heard of my being imprisoned for a thing I knew nothing of? he said he had heard of it, and wanted me for a gold watch got near Northumberland House on Monday; I said I could prove where I was. He said if I came up to the public-house at seven o'clock in the evening, he dare say he would make it all right. I did not go, and on Friday another officer took me; I was in the public-house by myself about three hours, and about half-past seven o'clock the officer called out</p>
               <p>"Mike," and told me to go into the parlour to see if the man knew me. The prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man, I can swear by the colour of his coat." I was at the Swan, public-house, from Friday night till near two o'clock on Monday.</p>

            . I keep a coffee shop in Swan-yard, Drury-lane. About eleven o'clock on Sunday night, the 10th of December, the prisoner came with a female, and engaged a bed - he called her Julia. They passed the night at my house, and next day about a quarter past one o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came down, and ordered a cup of tea and toast, as the female was rather unwell; he went up stairs again. When he came down he had some shoes, or something in his hand to be cleaned; he had not his shoes on, they were only slippers. It was a dirty day, and they appeared dry - I should have observed if he had been out. He returned up stairs - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100007"/>did not see him again.

On the 10th of December, I met the prisoner in the Strand with his brother, about eleven o'clock at night, and walked almost to Westminster-bridge with them; he turned back with me, and went to Swan-yard. I was in his company all night; he got up about a quarter past one o'clock. He did not leave the bed before one - he sent me up some tea.</p>

I examined it - it was folded in a handkerchief. I brought it into the shop, replaced it again, and when the prisoner returned from breakfast charged him with stealing it - he denied it for half an hour. I said I was convinced he took it - he said he knew nothing of the handkerchief. I turned to one of the other men, and asked him if he knew anything of it - he said he had seen it in the prisoner's possession several times. I asked him if he still persisted in denying it; he did so, and I gave him in charge; he then acknowledged taking it. I had made him no promise.</p>

I went to the shed, the prisoner left the place where he worked, and went to the stove - I came down, found him there, and behind a parcel of skins I found this leather, wrapped in a handkerchief. I informed Mr. Rose. When the prisoner returned from breakfact he went to the stove, and I saw him bend his body back towards the leather. Mr. Rose and the constable came up almost immediately, took the leather from the stove, and asked who knew anything of it. Burgess said he knew nothing of it. I said I believed the handkerchief was his, as I had seen him with it many times - he still denied it. Mr. Rose gave him in charge - he was handcuffed, and as he was being taken from the shop he said it was his first offence, and desired Mr.

            , who live in Whitechapel-road. On Saturday, the 30th of December, the prisoner came in about noon, and enquired the price of gin; he said his name was Swan, of the house of Swan and Son, at Nottingham, and he intended to pay money. We agreed for a puncheon, he desired me to make out the invoice, and he would call again that day and settle for it. About one o'clock on Monday he came, I gave him the invoice, and he presented me with a check for 120 l. 7 s., requesting the difference, which was 54 l. 3 s. 6 d. in change. I suspected it, made an excuse, and asked him where I could send him the change? he said he would call again in two hours for it. I then immediately presented the check at Cox and Biddulph's. In consequence of what I was told, I went to Slaughter and Co., the purported drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you heard what did you do - A. I got Griffiths, the officer, and had him apprehended. We found him at the counting-house. Mr. Smith interrogated him as to his possession of the check? he gave him the same account as he gave me of it; but after being very closely pressed he said he found it. The check was not out of my sight at the banking-house. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100010"/>confident it is the same check as he presented to me. I kept possession of it until I gave it to Mr. Smith.</p>

               <p>"Let me look at them." My brother officer searched Joseph. The last witness said James had dropped something from his hat - I found it was a pocket-book and a razor, which fell close to him. I found two keys on him, one is broken; I asked him where he got them? he said two men met them near the London Hospital, and asked them to sell them. I took the lock off the prosecutor's street-door, and found a piece of key in it, which corresponds with the broken key. The books and all the property, except the desk, were with the clothes.</p>

I heard a pane of glass break and heard something being drawn through - I went out and found the window broken. In about a quarter of an hour I saw a man go and look in at the window; he then pulled out a piece of print seven yards long, which hung six or seven inches from the glass - he could not have got it out without putting his hand or something in - he ran away, I pursued him, he was brought back by the patrol. The properly was given me again in a few minutes. The glass was cracked before and puttied in - force must have been used to get it out.</p>

On the 5th of January he came and asked if he could lodge with me again; he sat by the fire, and the watch was on the mantle-piece, in a case; he looked at it, and admired it. I told him he might go up stairs and dine with my children, but while I was in the shop he went out, and in about five minutes after I missed the watch. I found it at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>"The watch be d - d." He held me against the wall, while the other four took my property and turned my pockets inside out - all five then ran up Bell-yard, and the watchman stopped the prisoner at the corner of Apollo-court and Bell-yard. I am sure he is the man - he was not out of my sight. I do not know what became of the others. I have not found my watch. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You had been spending your Christmas night - A. Yes, at No. 3, Bedford-place. I was quite sober. I had no girls with me. Two women followed me into the street and had a glass of gin at the public-house - they teazed us for drink. I did not return to the coffee-shop. The women were not in my company, they followed the two men. I never told the landlord of the coffee-house that two women had robbed me - I never told anybody so. I do not know Cole - (looking at him.)</p>

            . I was going on an errand for my mother, and passed Bell-yard about half-past six o'clock. I saw the prisoner lay hold of the prosecutor up against the wall, he had a white great-coat on. The prosecutor tried to hold him while he called Watch! but he hustled away, and ran up Bell-yard. I ran to see what became of the prisoner; he was turning down Apollo-court, the watchman came up and stopped him. I belong to St. Dunstan's charity-school.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About twenty minutes or half-past six o'clock, there was a repeated cry of Watch! at the bottom of Bell-yard; I got out of my box, which is in Bell-yard, ran towards the bottom of the yard, saw four or five men running up, and saw the prisoner in a white great coat; he turned short round Apollo-court, I seized the prisoner as he was the foremost of the men. I collared him and said,</p>
               <p>"Is this the man?" The prosecutor came up and said he was the man, and gave him in charge for robbing him of his watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I was constable of the night, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with holding the prosecutor while four others robbed him of his watch and seals. I searched him, and found 1 l. 14 s. on him, but nothing else. When I took him to Guildhall he had a coach; he threw his white great coat out of the coach-window to a person, who caught it and ran away with it.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop in Ship-yard, Temple-bar. The prosecutor came to my house about four o'clock on the morning after Christmas Day, and asked if the young woman was there who had been to my house with him, I said I did not know he had been with any woman. He said,</p>
               <p>"She has robbed me of my watch." I said,</p>
               <p>"We will go up and see if it is in the room." We went up and found a girl's bonnet but no girl. He said,</p>
               <p>"Keep this bonnet till I come, and if the girl comes keep her." This was the first time I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that morning - A. He came, and asked me to light his pipe. He said there were three or four houses about, and I must see her if I went to them.</p>

There were gas-lights ten yards off. I fell on my back, he stood over me - I am positive he is the man. I had passed the prisoner and three men, who were standing at a public-house door, just under a gaslight, before he stopped me. I am certain of him.</p>

He said he would, and next morning, or the day after, he brought me another bill - I had trusted him on the 6th. I agreed to take it, and said I would enquire into the respectability of the acceptor.

We found fifty-four yards of figured woollen stuff, twenty-six yards of brown twilled stuff, fifteen yards of green stuff, six deal boards for wrapping it on, and also 139 duplicates, two of them relating to two pieces of stuff - the pawnbroker gave one up. I cannot say when they were lost from our shop; a person might put their hands in to take them. My partner lives entirely at the other shop. We never sell them with the boards, except to houses we know. We have nine shopmen, they would not sell them without my knowledge.

I saw them surround the prosecutor, and get him up against the shutters; Judd made a snatch at his watch, but did not get it then.

            . I was with Rhind, and had spent the evening with him. I left about three o'clock or a little after with him. We watched several persons into a public-house for a quarter of an hour or more. Hancock came out soon after they went in, and several came out after him - they knocked him down, but whether he was robbed then I cannot say. I saw the pad of his handkerchief fall on the ground, but did not see them take anything - the prisoner was one of them, I did not know him before. I saw him over the prosecutor as he was on the ground, I could see his face. I did not notice any lamp there, but know him; I am sure he was one of them.</p>

Birch came in to ask the price of some shawls - after consulting together they agreed to buy one, left me sixpence as earnest, and said they would call in the evening and give me the rest. Birch gave me the name of Hughes; she left the shop, Titkins called her back by that name, and said she wanted to buy a small bit of calico; they then bought one yard of calico, and tendered me 1 s. I went to the other side of the counter to give them their change, I kept my eye on them, and saw Titkins fumbling with something under her cloak. Birch came to receive the change, I was so agitated that I could not give it to her. Titkins then left the shop, I followed and told her she had taken something; she denied it, and offered to return for me to search her, but before she got to the door I felt her side, and found this property, - it was twenty-eight yards of calico. I gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Birch leave the shop - A. No, she remained for the change. I only went out two yards after Titkins.</p>

On the 2d of January, about nine o'clock, the prisoner and another man came in and asked for some fustian, I shewed them three or four pieces; the other man fixed on a dark one; the prisoner walked to the back. I saw him look at the black and blue cloth which stood there, I suspected him. The other man told me to cut half a yard of fustain, and then asked for buttons. The prisoner walked towards the door, I saw his great coat bulky. I missed the kerseymere off the counter. I looked out of the door and saw him walking with it under his arm - I pursued - he dropped it. I picked it up and called Stop thief! he was secured. I did not see it under his arm till he was out.</p>

             to take care of it. I left a lodger in the house. We ordered Marsh to take care of the house every Sunday. I returned about nine o'clock at night, and found the house robbed and completely ramsacked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and found fourteen locks broken. It appears some small wire or instrument must be put through the door to raise the latch, the wood of the door was broken to admit the wire. The doors were broken open by an iron crow, which was found on the premises. The property lost was worth above 100 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Marsh was always sent to take care of your house - A. Yes - a great quantity of goods were packed up, and not taken away - what was taken away were light goods, which would go into the pocket - it might all be done in twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>

I went to Mr. Smith's house at five o'clock this Sunday evening, all was then safe - I did not continue long - about a quarter of an hour - I then went home - I returned about ten minutes, or a quarter past seven o'clock with my child - I had a candle when I put the key in the counting-house door - I heard a scuffle inside and called out, who is there? I then went to the street door, found it open - I pushed it from me, it was snatched violently from me by a man who rushed out. I put the candle to his face and knew him. I knew him before, but could not mention his name - I called out</p>
               <p>"I knew him," he put his fist in my face. I am positive the prisoner is the man - I knew him before very well, and had seen him frequently in the neighbourhood. I saw nobody about the door that I knew. I never had any quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Ought you not to have remained at the house till Mr. Smith returned - A. They always told me to go home to tea and put my children to bed - he used to come home about half-past ten o'clock. I had the key. I always stopped till he returned, but always went home to put the children to bed - my house is only across the way - I then went to the counting-house door, which I came out at, but hearing the scuffle I did not open it, but went to the street door. Before I left the house I tried all the room doors that I had the keys of, and they were safe - I made it a rule to do so.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I saw the prisoner on the evening of the robbery - I know him by his lodging at my father's house - he came in a little before six o'clock. He had a great coat on - I cannot say what colour. I did not see him again until night, before eleven o'clock, he was undressed then, in his room, and appeared going to bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of December I examinced Mr. Smith's house and found a crowbar on the desk - it fitted the locks that were broken. I apprehended the prisoner at a public-house in New-street, Fetter-lane, at his lodgings. The prosecutor charged him with breaking into his premises - he said it could not be him, for he was at home all day; immediately after he said about half-past five o'clock he went to Norris to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100019"/>for a job. Norris lives about thirty yards below Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Norris is a lighterman - A. Yes. The prisoner said it could not be him for he had not been out that day, and just after that he said he had been to Norris. I have known him many years.</p>

I found the street-door and windows fastened. My fellow officers lifted me up to get in at the window, but my foot slipped, and I fell down; the prisoner immediately jumped out of bed, came towards the window, and from under the window, inside, I saw him take a brown paper parcel and throw it towards the stair-case, I was half in at the window then, I called to my brother officers to break open the door, the prisoner was then on the stairs with his shirt on. They broke open the door, and I called to Vann, to see what lay on the stairs. Vann immediately brought me a brown paper parcel - it contained a quantity of notes. I asked him how he came by them? he said</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of those notes." I asked him who lived there? he said nobody but himself, and that young woman, who was his house-keeper (there was a woman in bed with him). I pointed to a looking-glass over the mantle-piece, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whose is that?" he said his, and all the furniture was his. I marked the notes and paper which enclosed them (looking at some notes,) these are them, they were tied up in three rolls - there were two rolls of twenty each and nineteen in the other.</p>

I returned and met them in Broadway, and told them he was committed to Newgate, they told me to make haste back and tell him not to have a coach by any means - (it was about two o'clock.) I went and delivered him that message, before that I went to the Ship, public-house, with them and saw the two Keylocks, Herd, and M'Bride - Skillow, Watts, and Herd went with me - a great many others were there, whom I did not know - some of them had large sticks.</p>

I saw Herd and M'Bride at the end of the steps - they called me, and asked if I told Sam about the coach.

               <p>"Do not you think it better let alone, for it will bring more trouble." All three said could they have mustered strong enough the night before they would have had him out of the watch-house. They then agreed, that one was to go to the Ship, public-house, and another to the watch-house to meet their companions - they went and I saw no more.</p>
               <p>JOHN HODSON. I keep the Two Brewers, George-street. On the 15th of November, fifteen or twenty persons came in between four and five o'clock, they came chiefly together, and stayed a quarter of an hour - four or five had bludgeons - all went away together rather in a hurry. A few minutes after I heard a great noise. I did not look out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the prisoners - A. No - they were all strangers. I heard a great noise of people running by, but no shouting, or exclamation.</p>

             the painter (Hardy) going towards Russell-street. Stanley had a stick about a yard long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they walking alone - A. Another person was walking after them - there was a great many people walking up and down, and a great rush going towards Russell-street. I think Stanley had a blue and a brown coat on. I know his top coat was brown. Hardy had a light pair of breeches, and I believe a black coat. It was as near four o'clock as possible.</p>

            . On the 23d of November I was in Bell-yard, Fleet-street, about five o'clock, and saw a crowd of thirty or more persons coming down in a hasty way - some had sticks. I got out of the way, one of them struck me violently; in falling I caught hold of his coat which tore, and I received another violent blow. William Jones was the man who first struck me. I believe him to be the man. I was at Marlborough-street, and knew him - he is dressed in a different way - he had coachman's coat on, which he was desired to pull off - he had a brown coat under it, which had a rent newly sewn up, but that was not where I laid hold of it. I only heard it tear - the rip was in the back back near the button. I pointed him out from others.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was alarmed - A. Yes - but I was on my guard. I really believe Jones to be the man. I was near a lamp, his coat was not torn on the part I had hold off.</p>

Being reduced in circumstances I followed my profession as a miniature painter; my profession led me among a class of people, who would be eagerly shunned by many; this will account for my being in the neighbourhood of George-street. Can you believe a man, whose house is open for both sexes? you will discard testimony coming from such an impure fountain; the poverty of his testimony is a proof of the wickedness of what is urged against me. The female was the companion of a woman lately convicted of passing forged notes, and the regular mistress of Jones, who was convicted of a highway robbery; since which, she became a sharer in the fortunes of another hero, who was cast last Session. The whole of this evidence is derived subsequent to the reward of 100 l. Money ever entices men of respectability from the path of rectitude, and much more people who defy the laws of God and man. Gentleman, I leave myself in your hands with the utmost confidence of your justice and humanity.</p>

               <p>"You are joking with me." He pulled out a 10 l. note and one 1 l. note; I saw him putting the notes into his fob. He said,</p>

               <p>"Count it over into my hand." I counted it over in my own hand - it was 17 s. I closed my hand, and held out my other for the 1 l. note; he immediately tore the silver from my hand forcibly.</p>
               <p>Q. You remained quiet - A. Yes, he hit me over the shoulders. I could not find an officer; I went home, got a warrant, and had him apprehended two or three days after; he was taken before the Magistrate, who said he could not settle it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What did the prisoner say - A. He said I owed him 23 s.; he robbed me opposite the public-house, and had a dung-fork over his shoulder. I was afraid to touch him or call out; several persons were passing, but I gave no alarm.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Queen Ann-street, New-road. On the morning of the 19th of December, I was going into the City; when I got to the gate of Carroll's back garden, I was informed a boy was coming out with a sack, and saw the prisoner coming down. I waited at the gate, and desired to know what was in the sack; he said</p>
               <p>"Certainly, look at it," and threw the sack down. I collared him, and said I wished him to see the contents as well as me; he began shuffling about and splashing me. The sack contained the articles stated in the indictment. I left the prisoner in Carroll's charge.</p>

I had him secured. I found a small quantity of kitchen-stuff in the stable, also two of the prisoner's aprons, tied together, with the marks of the kitchen-stuff on them. I cannot swear to the kitchen-stuff, but there was a mark where it had been taken out.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and live in Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 6th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, Field sold me 15 lbs. of kitchen-stuff for 3 s. 1 d. I told Mr. Bradbury, and went to the stable with him, having watched Field there. He said he had it from the prisoner.</p>

I am porter to Mr. Bradbury, a tallow-chandler, and live over these stables; between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner at the stable door - he sent me to sell the kitchen-stuff - it was in an apron. I sold it to Biddel. The prisoner gave me 2 d. for my trouble. In about half an hour the prosecutor came and asked where I got it. I said from the prisoner. I knew he lived with a tallow-chandler.</p>

I suspected and asked where he was going with it - he was close to Mr. Laws, a grocer - he said he was going in there - he turned as if to go in, and threw it down on the first step. I secured him.</p>

Leake said he found it, as he came from Uxbridge, in the middle of the road, and Meads said he saw him pick it up, and he promised him he should share in the profits of what he sold it for. I examined the saddle, found it quite clean and dry - It was a dirty night. I suspected them and took them in custody - I found the bridle on Meads. I took them before the magistrate, I have discovered that they were in distress.</p>

On the 29th of December, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street - I stopped at the door of a wine-vaults, the prisoners overheard me say I was going to fetch a bundle - they followed me to George-street, St. Giles's, and waited till I came out with this bundle; they then followed me to Charing-cross, and by Northumberland House Livings asked twice if she should carry my bundle, I refused - she asked a third time, I suffered her to carry it, being tired and weak, having just come out of an hospital, I thought she might be a prudent character. At the corner of Downing-street I treated them with a glass of liquor - both carried the bundle. I then went down towards <placeName id="t18210110-64-crimeloc371">Westminster</placeName>

I followed Painter to a house, and asked where the woman was with the bundle? she said she would soon be there, and I had better come up stairs; I did so, but would not sit down, being uneasy about it. She took me down to look for her. I gave Painter in charge - she said if we would let her go out she would shew us where the girl was with the bundle. She went out, and the other prisoner was brought in with her. I was not acquainted with them.</p>

She then said she would take me to the house - she took me to her lodgings, No. 44, Duck-lane; I found her sitting by the fire-side - we have not found the bundle.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house. I asked if the geese were dead or alive? they said they were both dead, and that they bought them between the Two Brewers and Woodford Wells, of a man in the room. I found one was dead and the other alive, and in Watkins's pocket I found a screw wrench - there were marks of it on the door of the place.</p>

I was in Holborn on Monday morning, about half-past eight o'clock, and within six doors of the prosecutor's I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Williams's door, from the position he stood in, it struck me he was after an umbrella; he turned from the door and walked towards me with the umbrella in his hand, and as he passed me put it under his apron. I gave information at the shop, and they immediately missed two from the door. I ran up Museum-street, and saw the prisoner walking some distance up; he turned, and when he saw me he immediately began running. I called Stop thief! and he was caught in a court; I asked what he had done with the umbrella he put under his apron? he denied it. Mr. Williams's young man came up with it - I am certain he is the boy.</p>

I went to the bar, and all in a hurry I saw two or three go out, in haste, Dalton followed and returned with the coat. Godfrey, Johnson, and Annison came back afterwards, and asked for another pot of beer. I refused to draw it. Annison left almost directly. Dalton charged them with stealing his coat. Johnson denied it - the others said nothing - there was no constable near to send for. Johnson and Godfrey staid till eleven o'clock, and had nothing to pay there reckoning.</p>

On the 11th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, this woman and her two sons came in and asked me to buy some matches. I said several times I wanted none. Not suspecting them, I went to my board and kept cutting out leather - they being in the shop. They left in about three minutes. I went to the window, and found the shoes in a confused state. I missed two odd shoes from the first window, and a pair from the other. I went after them, and about five houses down Drury-lane the mother stood on the step of a door buttoning a pair of shoes under the youngest's (Jeremiah) jacket. The largest boy ran away. I took the mother and little one into a butcher's shop, opened his jacket, and took a pair of shoes out.</p>

I told him to call again for it, and let them out, and about eight o'clock the servant missed the spoons - in about a quarter of an hour Darch came for the money. I told him to deliver up the tea-spoons - he denied knowing any thing of it. I told him to wait a moment. I turned round - he opened the door and ran out, and I after him. I secured him in a court which had no thoroughfare - the constable asked where the spoons were - be denied it, and then said he had given them to another sweep named Darby, and wrote on a paper</p>

            , JUN. I saw my father's breeches safe five minutes before they were taken. The prisoners were then playing upon a heap of dung with another boy, When my mother missed them, I saw the prisoners going along the footpath; my father went after them, but did not catch them. I saw them last Wednesday, standing at a sadler's door, and my father secured them. Richardson then had the breeches on.</p>

On the 14th of December, about half-past three o'clock the prisoner came to my house with some herrings, and made motions for me to let her fry them; she then sent me for half a quartern of butter and a twopenny loaf; she eat that and made motions that she was thirsty. I went down and brought her up some water, she did not drink it. In about three minutes she was taken with a violent pain, as I imagine. She put her hand into her pocket, and gave me twopence to fetch twopenny worth of liquor. On my return she stood with a tea-cup in her hand; she received the liquor, drank it, and went down stairs quite pleased. I went immediately to my chest, found it unlocked, and the watch gone, I had left it locked. I went and told her mother, who told me to go and look for her. On my return home I met a neighbour, who sent me to a public-house where I found her. I gave her in charge of a watchman, who found a leather glove on her, in which the watch had been wrapped.</p>
