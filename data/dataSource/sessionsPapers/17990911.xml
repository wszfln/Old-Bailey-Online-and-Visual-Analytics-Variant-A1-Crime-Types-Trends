               <p>Q. How were you certain that you had hit one of them? - A. Because he was so close that I could not miss him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell the Judge and Jury any thing about his knocking the boy off the horse? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was one of the Bow-street officers who went in the chaise; when we came to Bedfont, we observed two men drinking on horseback, at the Bell, that gave us a suspicion; about a quarter of an hour afterwards we had got down the lane, I suppose about a mile and a half, I repeatedly looked out at the window, and then observed two men coming after the chaise; I immediately said, here they are coming, one on each side; in about a minute they both came up nearly together, one rode violently past the other, and ran against the post-boy, knocked him off the horse upon the lead horse; he said, d-n your eyes, stop, or something of that sort; the other tapped the pistol against the glass, and said, money, you b-rs, money; Edwards then replied, gentlemen, do not be in a hurry, and I will give it you, at which moment the man at the horses' heads said, d-n your eyes, Jack, give it them; he spoke very quick, as if he was aware who we were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the christian name of the man that was convicted here? - A. John Haines; at that instant the pistol was fired from the man at the side of the chaise, it came in at the side glass, and went out at the front off glass, taking a bit of the frame of the wood with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, from the effect, whether it was loaded with ball? - A. Very clearly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110004"/>because it took a piece of the wood with it; Edwards then returned the fire, and said, I have hit him; I said, I am sure you have hit him; momentarily, the fire of the man at the horses heads came in at the front of the chaise, I have the ball,(produces it); it went into the lining just over Edwards's head, it had rolled itself up in the stuffing; I pursued the men but could not overtake them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any notion of the persons of the men? - A. No; except the colour of their clothes, and their horses being nearly alike; the horses were both dark bays, or rather brown bay; this is exactly the colour of the coats that they appeared to have on; the man at the horses heads, I thought, did not appear to be quite so tall as the other man; I got this coat from the Windsor-castle, at Hamersmith, where I got the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered you the mare? - A. The ostler, he is here.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a Bow-street officer: I went with Dowsett and Edwards when the chaise was stopped.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any recollection of the persons of the men that stopped the chaise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the horses? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you know him? - A. I never saw him above once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I was a labourer in the India-House, I am now in the portering-work; any thing I can get to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Haines? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the man that was convicted in this place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any application to you by the prisoner Clark, or by Haines in the presence of Clark? - A. The prisoner at the bar came, on the 8th of November, with Haines, to the house where I lodged, the Moguls's-head, in Drury-lane; I believe it was on a Friday, I am not certain, it was about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure it was the 8th of November? - A. Yes; Haines applied to me to get him a horse; I told him I would ask a person at the west end of the town of the name of Coles, whom I knew, I would try to get him one; and the next morning I got him a horse from Mr. Brown's in Clipstone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you to Brown's for the purpose of getting a horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you to Coles's? - A. No, not up to the house; the prisoner at the bar, and Haines, went to a public-house just by; Coles lived near Mr. Brown, but he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Haines and Clark wait for you? - A. At a public-house near Fitzroy-square, I do not know the sign of it; I returned to Haines and Clark, and told them I could not get one; I then went to Brown's, and left Haines and Clark at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on the Friday you went to Brown's? - A. Yes, the day after they applied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing the day that they applied to you? - A. No, I did not till the next day, and then they went with me to a public-house near Fitzroy-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Clipstone-street from that public-house? - A. A very little way; I got a horse there, and took it to them at the public-house where they were waiting for me, that was about five or six o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was that horse? - A. A brown horse; I delivered the horse to Haines at the end of a street leading into Piccadilly, they walked with me from the public-house; Clark was with Haines at the time I delivered the horse to Haines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from Haines, or from the prisoner Clark, where they were going with the horse? - A. No, I did not; I had hired the horse to go to Croydon, Haines told me he wanted a horse to go to Croydon that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clark on foot, or on horseback, when you delivered the horse to Haines? - A. On foot; they both went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Haines, or the prisoner? - A. On the Friday following I saw the prisoner at the bar in St. George's-fields, about the middle of the day, just beyond the Obelisk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone at that time? - A. No, he had another person in company, who it was I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by accident that you met him there? - A. I had been to Clark's house to enquire for him, he lived in the Walworth-road, a little below the Elephant and Castle; Clark said he was going up to Islington to get a doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him before that? - A. Yes; I told him I wanted to see Haines particularly, because Mr. Brown would look to me to bring the horse back again, or something similar to that; he said he was going to Islington to meet the doctor, and he would shew me where Haines was; I went with him some way up Islington, and then he directed me to Union-square, Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he direct you to Union-square? - A. To see Haines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the number of the house? - A. I think No. 4,</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the house? - A. Mrs. Jewry; I went up stairs, and there I found Haines up stairs in bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110005"/>Q. How long was it before you saw Haines? - - A. He came in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, with the doctor; the doctor and the prisoner Clark had some private conversation, but what it was I did not hear, I came away soon after.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you came away, and while Clark was there, did you make any enquiry of Haines, or Clark, respecting the horse you had had from Brown? - A. Of Haines I did, Clark was in the room at the time; I told Haines I should Certainly get into trouble if there could be no step taken to let Mr. Brown have the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Haines, or Clark, say any thing in answer to that? - A. Haines desired that Clark would go and see if there had been any intelligence given at Bow-street about it; Clark told Haines that he would go and see about it, as Haines was very ill, and could not give any answer about it; he seemed very bad.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Haines in good health on the Friday when you saw him? - A. Yes; he seemed very well when I delivered him the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Haines, during the time Clark was present, give any account what had happened to him? - A. In the conversation with the doctor, he said, he was certain it was the Bow-street officers that shot him, as the windows of the chaise were all up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clark hear what he said to the doctor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that both Clark and the doctor heard it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any other conversation that passed? - A. Yes; the prisoner said he had had a good deal of trouble with Haines in coming over the stones in the chaise, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing else? - A. No; soon after that, I came away and went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have told us you were a labourer in the India-House? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You resigned your situation I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you are saying all that you say here upon your oath-were you not turned out? - A. There was a committee held, and I was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me the period when you were turned out of your office? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you at work there last? - A. I was at work there in November.</p>
               <p>Q.Probably some time before the 8th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the 8th you could not very well work there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up, and put into the House of Correction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A very good place for you-you were taken up for this very business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you were taken up, you thought it a good thing to give evidence against somebody else; it was a safe way you know? - A. I did not speak any thing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it a more convenient thing to give evidence than to be tried? - A. I hired the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of hiring horses? - A. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. You have hired horses of Coles before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of going to him? - A. Because he deals in horses.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear you never were tried there? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this committee held that turned you out? - A. Very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have been out of the House of Correction these three weeks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they would not let you come back to work? - A. I have not been at work since.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I had seen him once or twice before he came with Haines.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of life was he? - A. I cannot take upon me to say; I heard that he belonged to the lottery.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the night of the attack upon the officers? - A. It was on a Saturday evening, but I did not take any account of the month; I was going over the Common, and heard some pistols fired, I am not certain whether it was two, three or four.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110007"/>Q. At what time was that? - A. I am not positive, it might be between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the report of these pistols appear to come from? - A. From between Staines and Bedfont, I believe they call it Bedsont-lane; I then went to the King's-head, at Ashford, and mentioned that I heard the pistols fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing besides pistols that drew your attention? - A. I thought I heard a horse galloping towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horse come up? - A. Not then, it might be about half an hour afterwards; a gentleman on horseback apparently came to the door, and asked for a glass of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where you heard the pistols nearest to Bedsont, or the public-house nearest to Bedfont? - A. Very little difference.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been at the public-house could you have heard the pistols? - A. I think I could.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you enabled, by the assistance of the light, to see what sort of a man he was? - A. I looked at him in the face, and observed that he was a stout made man, with a cast in his eye, as I thought; I said, dear Sir, how your horse swears.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other observation that you made upon his face? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round and see if you can see the man that you saw upon the horse that night? - A. The prisoner might be the man, but I cannot say positively.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the colour of that coat? - A. No, I do not; it might be done up in something, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it? - A. It seemed to be a large big-boned horse, or a mare.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the horse that this person was upon? - A. He did not seen in very good condition, he seemed warm, and sweated.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a post-boy belonging to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the evening that this business happened taking any person from the Nag's-head to London? - A. From the Red-lion I was sent for to the Nag's-head, that was about a quarter or ten minutes before ten, there I took in a gentleman; the landlord desired I would drive as near to the door as I could, because the gentleman was lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that person direct you to drive to? - A. He did not speak to me at all; the landlord desired me to drive to Smithfield; as we were going through Hammersmith, he saw a light at the Windsor-castle, and called to me; he said, stop, here is a light, I want something to drink; after having remained a little time in the chaise, he went into the house; the landlord brought me a glass of liquor, and I had drank it, and was standing by the fire with a newspaper in my hand, a man came up, and asked me if I could take him to town; I told him, yes, I had only a single gentleman, and if he had not any objection, I had not any, and he walked away from the door, was gone the space of a minute, I suppose; he came back and said, the gentleman was agreeable, and gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at any time, an opportunity of observing him, so as to be able to recollect him again? - A. No, for I had broke the glass that contained the liquor, and was stooping down, when he gave me the shillings, to pick up the pieces; then they both got into the chaise, and we came away; as I was driving on this side of Kensington, the man who appeared to me to be the well man asked me to stop at the first house that was open; I told him there would be none open till we got to Piccadilly; just before I came to Hyde-park-corner, the same man let down the glass again, and asked me if I could not drive through Westminster, and go by the Obelisk, in St. George's-fields; when I was going through Westminster, the same man stopped me again, about one hundred and fifty yards after I had got into the street, I believe York-street, he got out of the chaise, and fetched some other man to the chaise; he was in the chaise about two minutes, and then he got out; I went on again; then I drove till just on this side the Obelisk, as he was getting into the chaise, and I was shutting the door, he said, I must stop at the Obelisk again, for he must get some assistance for the gentleman, who had dislocated his collar-bone by a fall from his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards stop at the Obelisk? - A. Yes, he stopped me about fifty yards before I got to the Obelisk; he got out, and called somebody by name, but I did not hear what the name was; then he said he would not take him any farther, he would get a coach for him, and get some assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any coaches near that you could perceive? - A. No, I did not perceive any at all; he discharged me there.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Best. I am a barber, in Lambeth parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Clark? - A. I have known him a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the 10th of November last? - A. I saw him and shaved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110010"/>him in the evening, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was on the 10th of November? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you known Clark? - A. A great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been an old customer of your's? - A. Not a constant customer; he has called when he has come that way.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you shave him before the 10th of November? - A. It might be five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you shave him after the 10th of November? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q.But you are sure this was the 10th of November? - A. The day after Lord-Mayor's Day; and about eight or nine or ten days after that, I saw him advertised ten guineas reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else there? - A. Yes, my wife, she is here; when I saw the advertisement, it mentioned the day, the 10th of November, ten guineas reward for committing a robbery, or stopping a post-chaise on Hounslow-heath, and shooting at the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this nine or eleven days after? - A. Yes, and I knew directly it was that Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q.Saturday night is a slack night for business with a barber? - A. Sometimes it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is there any night that you can name in the week more crowded than a Saturday? - A. No; only I have sometimes had as many of a Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the only man you shaved that night? - A. Not by many.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that there was nobody else in your shop of a Saturday night? - A. My customers in the winter time drop in early in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it not a fortnight or three weeks after that this advertisement appeared? - A. Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect so particularly that it was Saturday night, the 10th? - A. Because I had not shaved him for so long a time before.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no memorandum of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ any body else in your business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time? - A. Only my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she generally attend in the shop? - A. We often sup in the shop in the winter.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you were at supper when this man came in? - A. Yes, my wife and I were at supper upon bread and cheese and beer, and asked him to drink, and he would not drink, because there was some bread in it, and he sent out for a pot; my wife went out for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some conversation with him, I suppose? - A. All the conversation was, he wished I lived near him, I should always shave him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a companion of his? - A. We have drank together before.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house did your wife fetch this beer from? - A. The Three Compasses and the Artichoke are both customers of mine; I don't know which she fetched it from.</p>
               <p>Q. How many customers might you have come in after he was gone? - A. Several; they came in now and then till eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing remarkable in the day to six it upon your mind? - A. No, but I am sure it was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be Friday, perhaps? - A. No, I am sure it was of a Saturday night; I always go to have Mr. Mills, in Lambeth-road, and then my wife generally gets a pot of beer, and we have our supper, and he came in while we were at supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing particular to six it upon your memory? - A. I said, as soon as ever I read it, that he was the man that I shaved that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where does he live? - A. At Newington; his father has got two houses in the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life is he in? - A. I understood he was in the Custom-house or the Excise.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Best. I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Clark? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him any time? - A. Yes, a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 10th of November? - A. Yes, it was past eight o'clock, and before nine, I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him at that time? - A. At our house in Lambeth parish; he came in to be shaved.</p>
               <p>Q. What fixed it in your mind that it was the 10th of November? - A. It was the day after Lord-Mayor's shew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any advertisement? - A. I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that you saw the advertisement? - A. I cannot say exactly; I thought it was very hard he should be accused elsewhere, when I knew he was there; I have a great Judge to come before, and I know the consequence of an oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How many customers did your husband shave that Saturday night? - A. I cannot pretend to tell you that.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a busy night, is it not? - A. Yes, sometimes people come in unawares to be shaved.</p>
               <p>Q. But this particular day, and this particular man, you are sure of? - A. Yes, I am very particular as to the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110011"/>Q. It made no impression on your memory, I dare say, till after the advertisement? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it struck you all of a heap, I suppose? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not have made any impression upon your mind if you had not seen that? - A. No, for I had never heard any thing of the kind of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been at the shop a good many times before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been there in the week before, had he not; had you seen him? - A.Certainly I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you think your husband had shaved him the week before? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that the week before he was not shaved? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 10th of November, how many times, in the course of the last two months preceding this; was it more than four times or six times? - A. I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it more than once within the two months? - A. He might and he might not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him shaved more than once in your shop within two months? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many times had you seen Mr. Clark shaved by your husband in the course of two months? - A. Very likely he might come, and I not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. But, when you did see him, did he come more than once in that time? - A. He has been shaved a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. With in the two months? - A. I cannot tell you whether he was or not; but I can tell you the day that he was shaved there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a tolerable good customer of your husband's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him shaved in the course of two months previous to the 10th of November? - A. I will not swear either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet with respect to that day, you will swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you sup that night? - A. We were at supper when he came in, and my husband asked him to drink with him, and he would not, because there was bread in it, and I went out and got a pot for him.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q.How long might he be there? - A.Drinking and washing himself he might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And can you recollect how long before you had seen him there? - A. I cannot tell, he said, whenever he came that way, he would come to be shaved, and he wished my husband lived nearer, because he shaved so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been there within a month? - A. I cannot say, he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been within three months? - A. I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Within four months? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say he came frequently? - A. Yes, there was an estate repairing in our neighbourhood, as much as twelve months ago, and then he used to come very often; he was a promiscuous customer.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he was frequently at your house-have you or not seen him within three months at your shop? - A. He might, and I not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Jury whether you did see him within three months? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the Jury that he was there the week before the 10th of November? - A. When he came that way, he used to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how lately before the 10th of November had you seen him there? - A. I cannot tell if I was to die upon the spot.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was there any body else in the shop at the time? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was it? - A. I believe only three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110012"/>shillings; he then demanded my pocket-book; I told him I had none; upon which he swore that I had; I having no great coat on, I was conscious that he must see the books in my pocket, and therefore I gave them to him, they bulged out in my pocket; there was a Tyburn-ticket in one of them which I was going to purchase; there were two pocket-books, and a small book with asses-skin leaves; I assured him the books were of no use, and requested him, when he had perused them, to send them to my address, which he would find in the books; after that, he insisted upon my standing up in the chaise for the purpose of rifling my pockets; upon going away he waved his hand, and said, upon my honour I will return you your books; in about a week after I had one book brought me by a letter-carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the men? - A. One of them; I cannot swear to both.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw the books again? - A. In a week, they were found in a ditch upon the Heath.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the two men is it that you know? - A. The one next me, John Durham.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that he was one? - A. I am certain, I am not under the least apprehension in the world; I have not forgot the man since he robbed me, he was impressed so forcibly upon my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side was he? - A. On my side of the chaise; the other was so disguised, that neither my friend or I could swear to him; but the man that robbed me had a handkerchief over his face, and when he came up to me he pulled his handkerchief off, and I saw his face as plain as noon day, the sun had not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your things after? - A. Yes; my watch was found by one of the Bow-street officer; the watch and seal I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner at the bar before? - A. I never saw him in my life before.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a time did the robbery take up? - A. I cannot say, but I should suppose three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you were considerably alarmed? - A. Yes; the surprize was great, undoubtedly, being so early in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much alarmed? - A. I was not so much alarmed as surprized.</p>
               <p>Q. Being so surprized, and considering the short time that the transaction occupied, do you mean to swear positively to his person? - A.Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time was his face covered, and how long a time do you think it was uncovered? - A. I am sure I cannot tell, it was the greater part of the time uncovered, he could not enforce his language without.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Fourdrinier was with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not swear to either of these men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say more, that he did not believe they were the men? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CARPMEAL sworn. - I belong to Bow-street, I apprehended the prisoners on the 29th of May, in Oxford-street, they were standing at a public-house door, I believe the sign is, the Man loaded with Mischief, about nine o'clock in the evening; we went after them in consequence of informations that had been lodged at Bow-street, Mr. Reynolds's information was one; Limerick took one, and I took the other, in a coach; Limerick took a watch from Thomas Durham, which Mr. Reynolds swore to, and I took another watch from John Durham; we took them to my house in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Limerick take any thing from the other? - A. I held Thomas Durham's hands while Limerick took the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This robbery is charged to have been committed on the 20th, and this apprehension did not take place till the 29th? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Bow-street; on the 29th of May we apprehended the prisoners at the bar, and upon John Durham I found this watch, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I can swear to the watch, I am sure it is mine, I know it by the number and the name, and also the outside of the case; I had it cleaned but the week before; I got the number and the name from the watch-maker, Mr. Chater, in Cornhill; but, independent of that, I can swear to it by the outside of the case, by the device, doves, and arrows, upon the back; it is a lady's French watch, and I know it by the chain.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. Have you ever seen a French watch before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never recollect seeing a French watch with a device like that before? - A. I never saw any like it before; I wore that watch for a considerable time, I can swear to it without any hesitation.</p>
               <p>JAMES LIMERICK sworn. - I belong to Bow-street; I was at the apprehending of the prisoner, Thomas Durham; I took this watch from his sob-pocket, one of the seals belongs to the prosecutor; there are two seals and a key to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Here is one seal I am almost positive came off my watch, it has no particular mark upon it, but I have no hesitation in saying it is mine; there was no device upon the stone, but there has been another stone put in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110013"/>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is of a size and shape that other people might have? - A. Yes; I cannot speak so positively to that as to the watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BACON sworn. - I belong to the pastol of Bow-street, I was in company when the prisoner were apprehended: I took a gold hunting watch from John Durham, which I have in my pocket, and which has been sworn to by Sir Henry Every.</p>
               <p>John Durham's defence. The small watch that Mr. Reynolds speaks to I bought, and the seal I gave my brother, it was on my brother's watch, and when this gentleman came to Bow-street, he said the seal belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Thomas Durham's defence. My brother gave me the seal.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses who had known them from their infancy till within a year and a half of the present time, and gave them an excellent character;</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know you had a peace-officer with you? - A. Yes; I looked at the upper leathers, and found them to be my own; there were twenty-four pair of upper leathers besides fifteen or sixteen pair that he ought to have had.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he had not had them for the purpose of his business? - A. Yes; he could not have had them without the bottom stuff, and those had not; we often deliver out bottom stuff without upper-leathers.</p>
               <p>Q. But never upper leathers without bottom stuff? - A. Very rarely; my man is here that delivered them out, his name is Simpson; the upper leathers have the initials of my name, 8. M.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any other person deliver out besides Simpson? - A. It is usually by him, it is rarely other wise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the sole of a shoe? - A. Yes, at Mr. Godwin's, near the Obelisk, to whom the prisoner had sold it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Whether you here confident that no body has given out the work besides the person appointed for the express purpose? - A. I before stated that I am not confident of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the articles that were found at the lodging of the prisoner? - A. Yes, they are upper leathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those upper leathers your master's property? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered them to the prisoner for the purpose of working them up? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deliver upper leathers with the bottom stuff to journeymen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever deliver them without the bottom stuff? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it out of the ordinary course of trade so to do? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q.Can you positively say you never gave out any upper leathers, to any person that works for Mr. Miller, without the bottom stuff? - A. I cannot positively say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember your having some returned to you by a person of the name of Lediard, that you had given over the number? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Barahem. These are the shoes I received from Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Miller. These are the shoes that I had from Luke, one of the soles has my stamp mark upon it, by which I know it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered to the prisoner that sole? - A. To manufacture for me I certainly had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordship, Gentleman of the Jury, as I am called upon for my defence, I shall endeavour to he as concise as I can; near two years since I began to work for Mr. Miller, and from that time to this I have every reason to believe I did him all that justice which he could expect from me as a journeyman; about the middle of January, or March last, these very upper leathers I am charged with stealing, were given to me in addition to the usual quantity of work; he gave me out a dozen upper leathers with half a dozen of bottom stuff, I made up the work; I conceived it was done for the purpose of trying my honesty, but certain I was that either that was the case, or it was a mistake; in a short time the same circumstance occured again, and I declare I am as innocent of the charge as the learned Judge upon the bench; they were given out to me in that manner I positively declare; and with respect to the sole, your Lordship will pardon me, I am sure it is better calculated to provoke the mind of any man rather than to alarm; I would ask, how could I steal one sole? I declare, all the time I worked for Mr. Miller there was not one sole in the shop, how could he insinuate that I came by that one sole? I believe he has taken upon him to swear to that sole, but it is a very difficult matter, for there are slaws in soles, so that it is impossible; and I caution Mr. Miller, the prosecutor, how he encourages himself to persist in it, for I am persuaded he will have enough to do to stifle the stings of his own conscience; there was no sole leather kept in the shop; in the name of God then, how could I steal it? the leather is given out in large pieces, according as the shoe runs, and when that piece of leather is designed for eight or nine pair, it will sometimes turn out to such advantage that it will sometimes deceive ourselves, and then do they ask this to be returned? certainly they do not. When I began my defence, I told you I should be concise; my defence is somewhat incorrect from the agitation of my mind; I now return you, my Lord, my most hearty thanks for your manner of examining the witnesses, and I wait with heart-felt impressions the verdict of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Miller.) Q. Do you never sell leather after it is stamped? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are the soles given out in a piece of leather, or cut out in soles? - A. It is frequently given out in a piece of leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, is it not possible he might have stretched the leather so as to get a pair of soles out of them? - A. It is possible by paring them close.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. I am a linen-draper at Twickenham. On the 13th of July my house was broke open; I left every thing secure when I went to bed about eleven o'clock the night before. I was alarmed between two and three o'clock in the morning; I got up and found two of the shutters and the shop-door wide open; the bar of the door, which fastened the shutters, had been taken out, and a square of glass in the window cut. I found every thing in the shop in the greatest confusion; I looked round the shop, and observed a great quan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110015"/>tity of goods taken away, and the remainder in confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the river? - A. Very near.</p>

Yes; between one and two o'clock in the morning, on a Sunday, as I came through the church-yard, I saw two of the shutters standing right against the window, and the door wide open. I immediately went in; I then went round the corner, and thought something had happened more than ordinary; I found a square of glass had been taken out; I directly alarmed Mr. Read.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. It might be about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in the boat? - A. Yes; I saw some men in the boat, but could not say who they were. We pursued the boat, and jumped into the boat; they got out of the boat into Mr. Wood's craft, at the end of Northumberland-street, and ran up towards Craven-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in the boat? - A. Two bales; I do not know what they contained, they are things of linen-drapery; I found also an iron crow, picklock-keys, some bullets, and a bundle of matches, in a basket, and a coat, (produces the basket;) there was a knife in the coat, with a broken blade; I did not find it, but I saw it shewn in St. Margaret's church-yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect on Sunday morning, the 14th, any thing particular happening? - A. Yes; a little after five o'clock I heard the alarm of stop thief upon the water; I immediately ran down to the water-side, and saw three men run away from the boat, and run up Mr. Wood's wharf; it was a boat loaded with goods; they ran by me and I followed them through Northumberland-court, across Craven-street, up Hungerford-market, into Charles-court. I called out stop thief, and two soldiers followed them, and caught one of them in New-street, Covent Garden.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you see the face of any one of them? - A. I stood and looked at them as they passed by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, sixty pounds would be a very valuable thing to you? - A. It would be none to me, because I have got money of my own.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect pursuing any man with the last witness? - A. Yes; on Sunday morning, about twenty minutes past five, I heard the cry of stop thief; I had just come off guard, and was in the Strand, I went to the street-end that the cry came from, and saw three men coming up; I do not know what street it was; it was a street leading down to the river. Taylor was crying out stop thief; he said, soldiers, those are the three, why do not you stop them?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing their persons? - A. Yes; they came close by me, and bad got about eight yards from me when I began to pursue them. Two of them took up the courts that go into Round-court, and the other ran a little higher up. Before he turned up, I went after the two together into Bedford-bury, from there to St. Martin's-lane, then to Bedford-bury, then to St. Martin's lane again, and met him in New-street. I never lost sight of them all that time; I collared Orrell, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing of the other man? - A. The other took across St. Martin's lane, and made towards Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the other man that ran with Orrell? - A.Mackaway; I took particular notice of his face when he passed by me, by his nose and hair, he has got a large bump upon his nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon earth that he is the man you saw coming up the street from the water? - A. No, I am sure he is the man; I took him down to Scotland yard, and they told me the boat was gone to Westminster-bridge, and I took him to St. Margaret's watch-house; they would not take him in there, they said I must take him to Tothill-fields, and I lodged him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The persons pursued by you were running? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you had not much time to see their faces? - A. I stood there I suppose above a minute before they came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Two of them took up one court, and the other up another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The person whom you pursued crossed Bedford-bury again and again, and then taking a different course, met with the person you after wards took? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then going up New-street, and the other person going up Bedford-bury, you of course lost sight of him? - A. Yes, I lost sight of him three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you met Orrell, and thinking he was the person you had been pursuing, you took him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Mackaway for above a fortnight afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q.Have you any doubt that the man that you saw in New-street was the same man that you saw running up from the water? - A. It was the same man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a private in the guards, I was with Hutton; there were three persons coming up Charles-court into the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your seeing them come, did you pursue them? - A. Yes, for about twenty minutes, till we took one in New-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q.Which was that? - A.Orrell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other person with Orrell? - A.Mackaway.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to his person? - A. Yes, he got into another court, and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt with respect to the person of Orrell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that Mackaway was the other person? - A. No; he smiled at me as he came up Charles-court, and I observed a dent on his nose, and that he was of a fair complexion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long time had you an opportunity of observing the person you now suppose to be Mackaway? - A.Not above half a minute, if it was that.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen that man before in your life? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.And you did not see Mackaway for a fortnight afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you did see him at Bow-street, had you any doubt that Mackaway was the man you had seen with Carpmeal? - A.None at all.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Bullet, a waterman and lighterman; I ply the City side of Blackfriars-bridge at the lower stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar, Orrell and Mackaway? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known them? - A. Orrell I have known about three months, and Mackaway I knew by sight; I used to take coals to Orrell's; my master keeps a coal-shed, and he served him with coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they apply to you to go in a boat any where? - A.Orrell did, about twelve o'clock, on Saturday, the 13th of July; he said, he had been looking for me a day or two, he wanted me to go up to Battersea; accordingly I told him I would take him; he said he was going over the water, and he would go when he came back; I told him I might be gone out with a fare, I would go with him; I went with him to Duke-street, leading to the Borough-market; he told me to go to the Bell public-house; he said he was going to see for Mackaway, and he told me a bean was as good in my pocket as a stranger's.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you understand by a bean? - A. A guinea: I went to the Bell, and he went to seek for Mackaway; I staid there an hour and a half, or near two hours, and he came to me; I understood that he had seen him, and he asked me to go to

            's, who lives with his mother, a shoemaker, in St. Saviour's-college; he told me to go and ask him whether they were done or not, as he wanted them, I supposed he meant shoes; Wade said, he would come in a few minutes afterwards, and he did come, and had some discourse; I heard Orrell say, I must have them to-night, for I am in great want of them; Orrell and Wade<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110018"/>then went out together, and I with them, and going through the Borough-market, there was a man that they knew they called Dick, and they went into the Plough and Harrow, the corner of Stoney-street, and had some beer; we left Dick there, and went by George Smith's door, and there we met Mackaway coming up; Wade said, he must go to work, and he would meet us; then we went to the Waterman's-arms, Bank-side, and had some beer there; I went to launch my boat, and Mackaway went away; I went back to Mason's-stairs, which leads to the Waterman's-arms, and might stop a quarter of an hour, when Mackaway came in with another man to me and Orrell; about seven o'clock, Orrell, and Mackaway, and I, and a strange man, got into the boat; Mackaway went for a basket, and this stranger brought it down to the water-side, and told me to put it in a dry place.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this basket? - A. It was such a basket as this, sewed over so, that the things in it should not jingle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any thing else on board the boat? - A. No; we set off about five minutes after seven, it was just at stood, the wind blew very hard down the river, I did not know where I was to go to till they got into the boat, and then Orrell told me we were to go to Twickenham, and I made no objections to it; we stopped at the Magpie and Stump, at Chelsea, we went into the white house, like a summer-house, opposite the other house, and we had bread and cheese, and gin, and onions; we staid there about an hour, or an hour and twenty minutes; then we got into the boat again, and me and a stranger rowed above Kew-bridge; Mackaway and Orrell took a spell to row, they said they were cold and shivery; I went to a place they said was Twickenham, I never was up so high before; when we got to Twickenham, Mackaway, or Orrell, I cannot say which, asked me for the basket; this was about twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one; they took the basket upon the grass plot, and took some things out of it, but what it was I did not know, I heard something jingle.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with the basket then? - A. The stranger threw it into the boat; they might be gone three quarters of an hour, or an hour, and desired me to wait till they came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark at that time? - A. The moon was going down, and shaded in and out behind the clouds; Orrell returned in about twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were at Twickenham before; did you land near the church? - A. There was a building which I took to be a church, and there was a gravel causeway that I heard them run down with the things; Orrell brought two pieces of linen cloth, and he said something concerning the cloths, and ran away again instantly, and then Mackaway and the stranger came down several times one after the other, three times, or they might go four times, and brought something with them every time, and threw them into the boat; they brought some white parcels, and a bundle done up in a kind of linen, and put in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Orrell return after the first time? - A. Yes, they all returned backwards and forwards; Orrell went about twice, I believe, or three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they performing this? - A. They might be about half an hour, or better, before they quite finished.</p>
               <p>Q. When they all came back, and the thing was finished, did Orrell or Mackaway say any thing about it? - A. One of them said, shall we have any more, I cannot tell which of them it was, I did not hear any answer given to it; then they all came into the boat, it might be about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark then? - A. It was dark when they came into the boat; the stranger said, they might as well go and do a thimble crib for about forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.What did that mean? - A. A watchmaker's shop; I made answer that it was high water, and they had better go down; by their discourse I found what they had been about.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you discover it then for the first time? - A. Yes, I judge so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was there any other conversation? - A. Yes, Orrell said, there was a good swag.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that mean; a good weight, I suppose? - A. A good load, I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other conversation? - A. Yes, they all said, they wished they had some sacks, and when we came to Kew-bridge, the stranger said, there were some sacks hanging upon a barge's quarter, and he went to see, and came back, and said, they were not sacks; then we went on, and stopped below the Red house, at Battersea, for some sacks, at the mill, they wanted some sacks there, and I told them they would be seen, and they shoved me ashore several times, and I would not land them; then Orrell and Mackaway rowed through Westminster-bridge; there were some men ashore, and I saw Orrell's countenance change; one of them said, who are they; I said, I believed they were the Marine Police-officers; I then saw that Orrell and Mackaway had got pistols, which they put into their breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you observed that? - A. No, I observed them glittering just after they came from Twickenham, when they put them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110019"/>in their breeches, and when they came to row, they shifted them again; then a boat came off after us, and I begged they would put me ashore, and I was put ashore upon Mr. Wood's craft, in Scotland-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the boat? - A. Mackaway, and Orrell, and the stranger, and the property.</p>
               <p>Q.Which way did you go when you went on shore? - A. I went up towards Parliament-street, and went over Westminster-bridge; I heard the cry of stop thief; I made the best of my way, and did not look behind me; a few days after that, I went and delivered myself up at Bow-street, and Mackaway was taken by my account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. That you were at Twickenham, there is no doubt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the persons with you talked of a bean in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no explanation of that given at the time? - A. No, I understood it before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Twickenham at a perfectly seasonable hour of the day? - A. No, it was night.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you went there at twelve at night, you had no suspicion that you and your companions were going on an improper purpose? - A. I had not till they came with the things.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. That I swear - when I landed them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no suspicion before that? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were going on a party of pleasure? - A. I had no doubt, for I did not know who the stranger was, he said he lived at Richmond, and they hired me as a waterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, for taking any body to Richmond, should you expect a bean? - A. Yes, it is a long row.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came back, you discovered they had been plundering somebody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then I dare say you pushed off your boat, and said, these goods shall not come into my boat? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. No fit of honesty of that sort seized you? - A. I did not know that they were stole till they came down with their discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think, even when they brought these things into your boat, suspect any thing? - - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.And you went a few days after, and delivered yourself up at Bow-street, you gave this account, and then Mackaway was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, upon your oath, when you first went to Bow-street, did you tell the story you have told now? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not deny all knowledge of either of the persons in the boat? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you not yourself committed for trial? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not you committed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not you in jail? - A. I was in jail, but not for trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your master committed to jail for harbouring you as a felon? - A. I do not know what my master was in jail for; I heard he was in jail.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not present when he was committed for harbouring you as a felon? - A. No, I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q.Where have you been since? - A. In the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you were sent to jail was it that you were brought up and examined again? - A. I was brought up several times backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought it a pleasanter thing to hang other people, than be hanged yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when you were first brought up to Bow-street, and examined, deny knowing any of the persons in the boat when the robbery was committed? - A. No, excepting it was the stranger, I did not know the stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give in your examination - did you give it in the month of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it correspond with the account you gave now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the parish of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what parish the house is in which Mr. Bye lived? - A. Yes; in the liberty of Glasshouse-yard, in the parish of St. Botolph. I was upon duty at the watch-house; I heard an alarm of fire; I went to the fire, and pulled out my staff, to keep the mob off, that the engines might play. In about ten minutes after, I saw the prisoner come out of the house; he had a wash-hand bason-stand and an old pipkin in his hand, or a glass, I do not know which, and he called out, where am I to put these things? and the mob cried out, between the rails; meaning the rails of the Square. I then took him by the arm, and said, if you have any more property, throw it down like a man, and go about your business. I had a little pocket-staff in my hand at that time; says he, I know you. I said, never mind that; if you have any property, throw it down. He said, search me, I have none.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that he said he had none? - A.When I first took hold of him; then I ran my hand down his waistcoat and his breeches, I found nothing there; I then took off his hat, and found this property in it, (producing the cloak, salt-spoon, and punch-ladle.) I found them between the lining and the crown of his hat, in what they call the false crown. I then got assistance from the Gentlemen of the Association, and took him to New Prison.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman of the parish of St. Luke's. I heard the alarm of fire; I went, and Mr. Rittson desired me to stand along with him; and the prisoner came down with a wash-hand bason-stand and a glass. He told him if he had any thing more about him, to put it down like a man. He said he had nothing, and then he searched him; I saw him pull the things out of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Bye.) Is that your cloak? - A. It is; I know it by the pattern of the lace and the pattern of the gauze: there are the initials of mine and my husband's name upon the ladle and upon the salt-spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the ladle and the salt-spoon? - A. On the same day, in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to this fire to give every assistance I could; I came down with several loads; I found a cloak in the two part of stairs room, and put it in my hat, that I might have my arms at liberty to carry the other things; he would not give me the least time in the world, or else I should have put the things down, but I had not time; and I was so exasperated at his saying search him, when he knew me, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BYE sworn. - Q.Whose house was this? - A. Mr. John Solloway's; we only had the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live in the house at the same time that you and your wife did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOWLER sworn. - I was at the fire, at the next door but one; nobody could wake the woman of the house, and the prisoner climbed up the lamp-iron, and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was through his means that the people of the house were preserved? - A. Yes, I would not have got up upon any account; for, if he had fell, he must have fell upon the iron spikes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his master with whom he worked for two years up to the present time, and three other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>JOHN KEENE sworn. - My partner told me, about half past eleven o'clock, that Mr. Clarke's stable had been broke open, and he asked me if I had seen Foreman, and told me what had happened; at one o'clock I saw Foreman with two women, and he asked me to give him some gin; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to market and bought some goods, and when I came back, I was told Clarke had been to get an officer to take me up; says I, if I have done any misdemeanour, or any thing wrong, I will go to him directly; I went to him, and told him I would go with him any where, and I went with him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Clarke.) Did he call upon you the next morning? - A. Yes; he called upon me, and said, Clarke, do you say I broke your stable-door open; I said, no, I cannot say you did, but there are people to prove you did; he said I was a d-d liar; he did not offer to go with me till the watchman came and said he was the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is a transaction some time ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she now surrenders to take her trial? - A. No, she was stopped at Bow-street; I was sent for, and at the desire of Mr. Flond I now prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you prefer your bill of indictment? - A.She was stopped in July or August, I went immediately before the first Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you not know there was a Sessions here in September? - A. Upon my oath I did not know it; she got bail, and came to my shop after that to attempt the same thing again.</p>
               <p>Q. One half-guinea is very much like another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the reason that she was not tried before was that she had been lying-in? - A. I have been attending here for three Sessions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110022"/>running, and it is impossible she should be lying-in each of them.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Barron; the prisoner came into our shop in April, 1798, for a quire of gilt paper; I requested Mr. Barron to give her half-a-guinea; she refused the money I gave her several times; Mr. Barron desired I would give her her guinea back again, and she went away; when I took up the money, there was no half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it possibly have slipped off? - A. No, there is a glass case upon the counter, and Mr. Barron put it down upon the glass case, the rim of which rises about the 8th of an inch; I went after her, but she was gone; I could not find her; about the end of July she came to the shop again, she came for the same article, and with the same pretence; she gave me a guinea to pay for it; I gave her change from the till; she said it was all bad, the seven-shilling piece particularly; she said she used to pay but one shilling for it; Mr. Fentum, a gentleman who keeps a music shop next door to us, gave her another seven-shilling piece for it; I then sent for an officer to take her to Bow-street, and she attempted to force herself out between me and the door post, but I kept her in; she was taken to Bow-street, and I attended there.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it not have slipped down? - A. No, there is no possibility of it, because there is a rim all round it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no bad half-guinea found, I believe? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he when he gave you the eighteen pounds ten shillings? - A. Opposite my accompting-house door, just where he had been cleaning the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you took him up stairs? - A. About five minutes, (produces the money); the eight half-crowns I can positively swear to, because I had marked them myself; I had missed money before.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you carried on business there? - A. About six months.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in business for yourself before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you live servant? - A.With Mr. clark, upon Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your partner? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q.Who furnished you with money to go into business? - A. My friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it lent you on bond, to have a share of the business? - A. No, it is a distant relation of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is not to participate of the profits? - A. No, any more than the regular 5 per cent.</p>
               <p>Q. His name is Lovatt, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lives in the same house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never make a proposal to you to participate in the profits of the business? - A. No more than you.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the freeman of the city of London, he or you? - A. I am the freeman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make an application to him for the money, or did he offer to lend you the money? - A. He offered me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lovatt comes into the shop, does not he? - A. Yes, I consider him as the only person capable of being intrusted in my absence.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you pay him for the trouble he has in the shop? - A. He is only with me for a few months, he has no share in the business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not Mr. Lovatt take every thing out of the shop that he wants? - A. If he wants butter, he does nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet he has no share in the business? - A. None, no more than you have.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he pay you for his board and lodging? - A. He does not board and lodge with me.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a warehouse at Charing-cross, where the coach comes. Cox, the coachman, brought me a bundle, and said, he had got a thief that had stole a bundle out of his coach. He had got the prisoner with him and the bundle; it was in a white cotton-handkerchief; I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner talk English to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a way that you could understand him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it explained to the prisoner what the charge was? - A. Yes, I explained it both going along and in the watch-house. He said in English, as plain as I could speak almost, that he found the bundle under the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coachman, in the hearing of the prisoner, give an account how he had lost the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110024"/>bundle? - A. Yes, he said he had stolen Mr. Lingham's bundle out of the coach; the prisoner then said he had found it under the coach: the coachman said he had found it under his arm. I made answer, and said, if he had found it under the coach, it must have been very dirty; but it was as clean as it could be Mr. Lingham took the bundle that night to his family at Greenwich, and brought it to Bow-street next morning.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lingham.) Did you take the bundle to Greenwich that evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you had the things ever since? - A.No, I had them; but they have been in the hands of the Greenwich coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your's? - A. Yes, they have my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Lingham.) The coachman is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, whether the coachman might not have given him the bundle, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was sort of an evening was it? - A. Very dirty; if the handkerchief had fell in the street, it must inevitably have been very dirty.</p>

             sworn. - I drive a hackney-coach: I was sitting upon my box, and saw the prisoner viewing the coaches, there were three Greenwich coaches; he crossed over between them, and about two minutes after I saw him come round the coaches upon the street-side: he opened the door of one of them, threw his body in, and reached the bundle out; the coachman was at the wheel of the coach, on the other side, at the same time; and I told the coachman of it, and he took it from him; he took the man by the collar, and he said he had picked it up in the street; the coachman delivered him to the book-keeper, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a coachman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it this was at noon-day? - A No, just before nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been dark then? - A. No, it was not; it was the 5th of July.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not the 5th of August? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lingham. It was the 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Gould. I am no scholar; it might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. We all know it is pretty dark upon the 5th of August? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not past ten? - A. No, it was not past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness here before? - A. If I have not here, I have elsewhere, before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You was never prosecuted yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many informations have you lodged before Magistrates? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been before a Magistrate except on this occasion? - A. Very likely I may be there before a week is out; sometimes people will not pay, and then we are obliged, and sometimes we charge too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in a gentleman's service? - A. Yes, Mr. Vaughan's, the tanner, over the water.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he turn you away for? - A. I turned myself away.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lingham.) What time of night was this? - A.Within five minutes of nine; and it could not be above ten minutes past nine when he took me up in Parliament-street.</p>

             sworn. - I am coachman of the Greenwich-stage.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - did you ever see him before? - A. Yes; the first time of my seeing him was at Charing-cross, on Monday night the 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Gould, the hackney-coachman, there? - A. Yes; Mr. Lingham came and gave me a bundle in a cotton handkerchief, I put it into the coach, upon the seat, and shut the windows up on both sides, there was nobody in the coach at all; about two or three minutes afterwards Gould came round to me, and asked me if I belonged to that coach; I told him yes, I did; he pointed to the prisoner, and said, that man had taken a bundle; I cannot say whether he heard him or not, he was nigh enough to hear him; he was on the other side of the coach, and I ran underneath the horses and caught hold of him; I said, holloa, my friend, where did you get this parcel; he made no answer; I opened the coach door, and missed the parcel; I then looked at it, and found it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say to this? - A. He said something, but I could not understand what he said; I called for a watchman, but could not get one; I took the bundle, and gave it to Mr. Lingham, in Parliament-street; I delivered the prisoner to Mr. Strickland, and he was carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Lingham.) Are the articles you have produced the same you had from the coachman? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In going by, I saw a bundle, and picked it up.</p>

               <p>JAMES JENKINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Hovell. The prisoner lived with me as <rs id="t17990911-14-deflabel74" type="occupation">groom</rs>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you made him any threat, or offer of favour? - A. I had not; he said they did not belong to me, and if I would take the trouble of inquiring, I should be satisfied they were not mine; I told him I hoped it would prove so; I then told him I would not press it any further at present, if he would call in a day or two upon me, and satisfy me that it was not my property, I would settle with him, and I let him go; I searched at the pawnbrokers, and found two jackets and a pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110027"/>of trowsers, (they are produced); I cannot swear to them certainly.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: These two jackets and trowsers were taken in in my presence, but not by me, from the prisoner at the bar; the trowsers on the 6th of June, one jacket on the 31st of May, and the other on the 12th of June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jenkins. - Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell me where you live? - A. On Dowgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of business? - A.Manchester-warehouseman, and manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner lived with you - in what capacity? - A. As groom, and waited at table.</p>
               <p>Q. He never did any extraordinary work for you- I will tell you what I think is extraordinary work, such as making beds? - A. He might for two or three weeks, when we were without a female servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never cook for you? - A. He might dress a mutton chop for me; he said he was very clever at a mutton chop, and so he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid him no wages? - A. I agreed with him for twenty guineas a year, and provided him with clothes as long as he was in my service; he lived with me about three months.</p>

               <p>Q.They were for the purpose of attending the stable as groom? - A. A part of them; she striped jacket could not, hardly.</p>
               <p>Q.You turned him away on the evening of the 25th or 26th of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the pockets of this apron the same evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These are all the duplicates upon which, after a great length of time, you have brought to found a prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the Lord-Mayor the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take him up the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He called for his wages the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you took him to the watch-house; upon what charge? - A. In consequence of finding these duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you charge him with stealing some of your plate? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. So then, this servant of yours you took up with a constable, charging him with stealing your plate when he came to demand his wages, and then you tell the constable, in the absence of the Lord-Mayor, to discharge him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come the next morning, after he was discharged from the constable, to demand his wages? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him his wages? - A.Certainly not; for I had not time to run from Hyde-park-corner to Bermondsey, which was the extent of the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come again after that for his wages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not call every day for his wages till you brought this fresh charge? - A.Every morning might amount to three mornings.</p>
               <p>Q. And as you had not paid him his wages, he summoned you for his wages? - A. Yes; I went agreeable to the summons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he summoned you before the Sitting Alderman to pay him his wages? - A. Yes, surely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you that morning bring forward this charge? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The very first morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the 3d of August, was it not? - A. I cannot speak to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. He called upon you day after day for a long time for his wages? - A. He did, the long time of three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever trump up this charge to any body living till he had summoned you to compel you to pay these wages? - A.Certainly; I told him I would be first satisfied how it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you mention any one person to whom you mentioned this before you charged him? - A. Yes, I suppose to twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any charge before any Magistrate till you was summoned? - A. No; I told him I would wish to be satisfied, as I did not want to take him before the Magistrate if he was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. And, perhaps, you owe him these wages at this moment? - A.The balance of the wages, undoubtedly, except 20s. that I gave him when he was committed, and the balance of accounts while he was in my service, that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you are not so ignorant of the world, as not to know that this man loses these wages if he is convicted upon this occasion? - A. I suppose it is so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110028"/>Q. You have these sort of things made for your service? - A. Yes; I find them in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him reason to conclude that he would have these things for himself? - A. Yes, certainly, at the end of twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. But you turned him away at a much shorter time, and he told you he had pawned them? - A. No, he denied that any part of these duplicates related to any property of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a very good character with this man? - A. No, I had none at all; he gave me a reference to a gentleman at the west end of the town, but I did not go, I was pleased with the man, and I found him the best servant I ever had, and I did not take the trouble.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovell. Q. In truth, then, you have been robbed of plate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you searched the prisoner's pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make any charge to the Magistrate till you had found your property? - A. No; and then I did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not pursue further property, because you wished to prosecute upon this moderate scale? - A. I wished to prosecute upon a moderate scale.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Jenkins.) Q. Can you say with certainty, that the apron, in which you found the duplicates, was the prisoner's apron? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much distressed for money, I had asked Mr. Jenkins for money several times, when he has had company, to get some tea and sugar, and he has said he has had none for me, and that distressed me very much; I pawned my jacket and trowsers to support Mr. Jenkins's house.</p>
               <p>Dobson. There was a jacket pawned by the prisoner which turned out to be his own, before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovell. (To Jenkins.) Q. The prisoner says he applied to you for money when he was so distressed, and you refused it? - A. I never did refuse him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have denied Mr. Jenkins many times to trades-people round him, when he has been at home, that have come to him after money.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When you asked him for the clothes, which he had had from you, what did he say? - A. He said he had them, but would not tell me where they were; he denied having pawned any thing himself, or that any thing in these duplicates belonged to me.</p>

I did not offer her any thing, I had nothing else but a seven-shilling-piece, and a shilling in silver; I had seen my money at the last place I had paid my reckoning, at Bethnal-green, and had had no conversation with any other woman. I was sober enough to know all that passed, I had been drinking some time, but I do not drink much; I was fresh, and knew every thing; I drank nothing but porter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it me instead of a sixpence? - A. No, I gave you no money at all.</p>

               <p>Ash. It is a crooked half-guinea, and a pale one; there is a small mark, it is bent up on both sides, and there is a head, I did not notice it any further; it was an old one, and I cannot recollect whether it was a spade half-guinea or not, I had it in change.</p>
               <p>Briggs. I took it out of the prisoner's hand in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110029"/>watch-house; Ash charged her with robbing him of half-a-guinea; she said, Ash had given it to her for sixpence, there was nothing freer than a gift, and she would keep it; I have kept it ever since; he told the same story the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I gave the half-guinea into the watch-house, he gave it me instead of a sixpence; between Queen-street and Bow-lane, two men met me, and asked me where I was going; one asked me to stop a-bit, as he was going to his friend to wish him good night, and he would come to me again; I stopped, and he came back; I am an unfortunate woman; I mean the prosecutor; we went down on the left hand side of Bow-lane; I stopped there, and asked him if he would give me a compliment, and he gave me, as I thought, a sixpence; I asked if it was all he was going to give me, as that would not buy me a breakfast; says he, I will give you a shilling, and he said, out of mistake I gave you half-a-guinea, and I said, nothing is freer than a gift; the man says, he was robbed in Old Change, I was taken in Bow-lane. <rs id="t17990911-15-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know John Whittocks? - A. Yes, he had been my fellow-servant; he came that evening to see the servants in general, about a quarter past nine; he staid till near twelve, if not quite twelve.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you much in the kitchen that evening? - A. I was very often up stairs, and was often in the kitchen; I saw my lady to-bed about nine in the evening, she was indisposed; I went down into the kitchen immediately after, and he was not then come; I went up stairs to my lady again, and stopped with her a few minutes, and upon my return I found him there then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be, taking all the times together, in the kitchen? - A. It is impossible to say; I staid half an hour at a time, and three quarters of an hour at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Whittocks in the kitchen all the time that you were? - A. He was absent one time, it might be about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do ou know where he was at that time? - A. He went to the door to refer some friend to a neighbouring public-house to wait for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the box being in your mistress's bed-room? - A. It was not in my lady's bed-room, and I had no business in that room, but when I went on messages; I know there was such a box there.</p>

Yes, the deceased was there, and one Spicer, and Fox, and Hayward, and Mr. Fenn and Spicer's son; I was in the other room; I heard the corporal call landlord; my husband was gone to bed; I went into the room, and he asked for a pot of beer, and said, he would pay for it, though this rogue and rascal had cheated him; the corporal was then in the tap-room; he said, though this rogue and rascal had cheated him, he would treat the company with a pot and pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by this rogue and rascal? A. He meant that Mr. Aldwin had cheated him.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is Spicer's son? - A.About one or two-and-twenty I suppose; I turned out to fetch the beer, and I heard Aldwin say, can you make a rogue and rascal of me: I turned short round back again, the prisoner was gone out, and Aldwin was going out; I gave him a push, and said, for God's sake don't go out, Mr. Aldwin, pary keep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Aldwin sober? - A. He was not sober, nor he was not drunk; he was between both.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner? - A. I do not think he was drunk, he had been drinking for an hour or two with his comrades in the parlour; Hayward and Aldwin gave me a push back, and then they both went out after the prisoner; I shut the door and shut them all out, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. - Q. You, upon seeing Aldwin wanted to go out, wished to stop him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented him? - A.Hayward and Aldwin both pushed me back.</p>

               <p>Q. What were they going out for? - A. I suppose to see which could fight best.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Hayward in cool temper? - A. He was rather hot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you or not that Hayward went out as a friend and encourager of Aldwin? - A. He went out, to my thinking, to see that Aldwin was righted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any words pass between them? - A. The prisoner asked Aldwin if he would go out of doors and try.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there the appearance of any friends or acquaintance of the prisoner near? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was become of Spicer and the other people? - A. They sat still, and never got up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the soldier see him do that? - A.

Yes, he asked, I believe, three times what o'clock it was; he asked first at half past eight, next time it wanted a quarter of nine, and the next time he asked it was nine; and then he went out directly.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FOX sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I was present at Dunton's house directly after eight; soon after, there was a rumour in the passage of the house, and, when I came to inquire, I found it was the prisoner and some of his recruits having words. Soon after, Syme came into the room, and looked very angry, and seemed disturbed in his mind, but to who I knew not; he called for a pot of beer, and was asking different people to drink; he was walking about, not sitting down quietly: after this, he challenged

             to play at dominos for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Aldwin been playing before? - A. Yes, one game with Spicer; they played one rubber without words; the corporal paid for it, and then said he would play him another game for another pot: I am not sure whether it was the first or second game he told Aldwin that he cheated him, and the prisoner made answer, and said, I will not play foul, I will play a fair, honourable game: they played a second game; then Aldwin cheated him again; he threw his cards down in a great passion, and said he would play no more; that he was a rogue and a rascal: he kept his seat, and then Aldwin, being aggravated, got up, and said, if he would not go ut of doors, he would knock his head off; the soldier was standing up at that time; he went towards the door, and Aldwin followed him directly, and then Hayward went out with Aldwin: in the course of this time, the corporal asked two or three times what it was o'clock, and said, if he was not home by ten, he would be locked out of his lodgings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110036"/>Q. Do you recollect at what part of the play the corporal asked what o'clock it was? - A. I made answer to them, by this dial it is a quarter past nine, that was after he had had the words; the soldier had a stick in his hand almost as big as a cane, it might be as much an an inch diameter, and his side-arms as the soldiers wear them; he went out without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for his going without his hat? - A. It was in passion, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. He took off his hat in a passion - did he not appear to have gone out and forgot it? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.After he had accused this man of cheating, he asked what o'clock it was, and yo told him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Aldwin perfectly sober? - A. He seemed to me to be sober; the soldier was not quite sober, but seemed enough of what he was doing.</p>
               <p>- HAYWARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a gardener: I was at Dunton's the 25th of July, with the prisoner and Aldwin, and other persons; I went into the White-hard, and called for a pint of beer, about nine o'clock, William Aldwin was there, and the prisoner was there; Aldwin was sitting, and the prisoner standing up with his hands behind him, and seemed to be in a passion about something, but I did not take any notice of that at all; I had my pint of beer, and sat down in the corner of the room; presently after, I heard somebody call out for the dominos to be brought, but who it was I do not know, and the landlord immediately came in, and said, either that he had none, or he would not let him have any; there was a man of the name of Spicer sat by me, and I saw the dominos pass by him; after that, the prisoner and Aldwin sat down near me and played dominos, I believe, for a pot of beer, and the prisoner caught Aldwin out in cheating him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that he did cheat him? - A. No; I took no notice at all of it, any further than the prisoner said he had cheated him; he threw the dominos down, and swore he would not play any more; then the prisoner called for a pot of beer, and said he would pay for it, and kept on quarrelling, but I did not pay attention to the words that passed; Aldwin got up, and said, if he called him so again he would give him a knock or a punch of the head, I do not know which it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Or knock his head off his shoulders? - A. It was either a knock or a punch of the head, as near as I can remember; the other still kept on quarrelling, and they challenged each other to fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that? - A. There was a challenge give between them, and they were both agreeable to go out to fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the soldier enquired as to the time of night? - A. No; I did not take any particular notice of any thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him ask what it was o'clock at any one time? - A. At no one time at all; then they went out to fight, the soldier went out first, and left his hat behind him upon the tap-room table, with a stick in his hand; Aldwin followed him, and I drank my beer, meaning to go off, but I followed them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might you be after them? - A. As soon as I had drank my beer out, it might be a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Not in less time? - A. Not in less, to my knowledge; when I went out, the prisoner was standing about ten yards from the door of Dunton's house, and Aldwin was standing near to the door, I observed them by the light of the candle through Mr. Tollit's window; I stepped before Aldwin, and said, do not you see the danger you are in, you shall not fight him; I asked the prisoner why he got so far back in the dark.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you explain to Aldwin what the danger was? - A. No, I did not tell him the danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what was the danger? - A. I saw him with a stick in one hand, and a bayonet in the other; he still got further back, till he got from the light of the candle altogether; then Aldwin gave a slip by me, and said, you rascal, put up your bayonet; at the first examination, before the Magistrate, I was in a great fright, and had not the presence of mind to remember that word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he did put up his bayonet? - A. No, I did not, he got into the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me whether you believe he put up his bayonet or not? - A. I do not know whether he did or not; but I have great reason to believe he had put it up, for I did not see it when they were struggling together; they struggled across the street, and both fell down together; I did not go nigh them to his assistance till I heard some other person's tongue with them, and then I went across the street, and William Hayward was there, and John Young was there, there were many people came up, but I did not observe who; when I came up, I saw the prisoner, and Aldwin upon him, and as soon as Aldwin was lifted up, somebody else lifted up the prisoner, I do not know who; I saw the stick in Aldwin's hand immediately after he was lifted up.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had Aldwin a stick when he went out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The soldier had one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose stick was it that Aldwin had? - A. I do not know; it appeared to me to be like the same stick, but I could not say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110037"/>Q.Had the soldier any when he was lifted up? - A. I do not know, for I was not looking at him, but asking Aldwin if he was hurt; I did not mention that at any examination that I asked him if he was hurt; he said he was not hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the soldier? - A. No, I did not take any notice of the soldier; I then immediately heard the sound of a bell with a stick, but I could not say what it was it was very near to a tree; but I am not sure whether it was against the tree or the prisoner, but I rather thought it was against the prisoner; after that, I turned myself about, meaning to go home and not to follow them any farther; I saw the prisoner walk away upon the pavement, and immediately after that, before I got across the street, in the course of a minute or too, I heard an alarm given by the people, somebody said, the rascal has drawn his bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the prisoner and Aldwin were scuffing together or not? - A. No; after Aldwin had struck a blow with a stick, I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never sworn, that after the blow with a stick, you saw Aldwin and the prisoner scuffing, and then you heard that the man had drawn his bayonet? - A. I never said, or swore such a thing; I then went under the gateway to take care of myself, I found a heath broom belonging to a poor woman, and I took that; I did not mention that in my examination, as he did not hurt me, I did not think it worth while to mention it; but as I came out from the gateway he was coming across the street with a bayonet in his hand, and he met me full; but there were many people in the street running about for fear.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they saying any thing, or making any noise? - A. The prisoner run at me with his bayonet, and struck at me three or four times, and I struck at him several times with the broom, to try to knock the bayonet out of his hand; I found I could do nothing with him, I threw the broom away, and made my escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have made your escape sooner if you had chose it? - A. I could not in safety; I did not know which way to run when the alarm was given that the bayonet was drawn, and then I run up the gateway to get this broom in defence of myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you never said, that the corporal and Aldwin did fight together after they had got up, and after the blow was struck? - A. No, I never did, that was the only blow I saw struck, nor I did not see the prisoner do any damage to any person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.First of all, who were the people that called out the rascal has drawn his bayonet? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that come from Youans, Hayward, or yourself? - A. It did not come from me, nor from them, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it called out, d-him, knock his brains out? - A. That I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be assembled when the call was made that he had drawn his bayonet? - A. I cannot say; there might be as many as a dozen or more, I cannot say, nor I do not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. And the object of them all was to attack the man because he had drawn his bayonet? - A. I suppose that every man might try at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one man, in all this concourse of people there assembled, that seemed on the part, or the side of the prisoner? - A. I did not see any person against the prisoner or for him, any farther than the man he was fighting with.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a minute or two before you followed Aldwin out of the house? - A. It might, I stopped to drink my beer; if they had not gone out of the house, I should have gone home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of the house, this minute or minute and a half afterwards; Aldwin was then nearer to you than where the soldier was? - A. Yes; he was gone nine or ten yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came there, Aldwin rushed past you up to the soldier? - A. Yes, and said, you rascal, put up your bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q.After that, you saw a stick in the hand of Aldwin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you prevent Aldwin from following this man? - A. I had no business with it, it was all done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Dunton, the mistress of the house, desirous to prevent Aldwin from following the soldier? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not shove Mrs. Dunton away from her attempt to stop Aldwin? - A.Not to my knowledge; I do not remember seeing Mrs. Dunton at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now supposing Mrs. Dunton has said that you did, has she said true or false? - A. I do not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out at the same moment with Aldwin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How many people might there be at the time you laid hold of the broom stick? - A. There might be ten or a dozen people, more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Aldwin strike a blow with a stick? - A. A blow was given by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did yo see the corporal return that blow, or offer to return that blow? - A. I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I came up during the scuffle between Aldwin and the prisoner on Thursday evening the 25th of July, I was coming through Uxbridge town on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110038"/>horseback, I heard some of the populace cry out, a fight, a fight.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think there might be? - A. From a dozen to twenty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What are you? - A. I keep a mill at Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night might this be? - A. I think nearly about ten o'clock; when I came near enough to see, they got out in the middle of the road; there was one in the middle, a soldier; I did not at first discover that he had a bayonet in his hand; after a short space of time I discovered it, he brandished it, and they were all round him, eight or ten people, or more; it was exceedingly dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the people employing themselves? - A. They were attacking him, they knocked him down several times, and the man was extremely ill used.</p>
               <p>Court. I have seen all the depositions, and after what this gentleman has said, there can be no doubt what this case is: it cannot be less than manslaughter, nor can it be more.</p>
               <p>WASEY HAYCOCK sworn. - I am a surgeon: I examined the deceased.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you suppose to be the occasion of his death? - A.An inflammation, which terminated in a gangrene; there was a wound about an inch below the navel; he died about twelve o'clock on Saturday morning, the blow was on the Thursday night, it was a triangular wound, and I have no doubt of that being the cause of his death.</p>

             the stocking off my hand, put my hand in my left-hand pocket, took out a little red morocco pocket-book, containing ten guineas in gold, eight of the old coin, and two of the new, a crooked half-guinea, a crooked seven-shilling-piece, and a plain seven-shilling-piece, I thought I had two sixpences, but I found I had no silver at all about me; I told him I had no change; then I put all the money into my red morocco pocket-book again, and put it into my left-hand pocket; the next words he said to me was, you are not to know any distress; I said, thank God, I am not in distress; then he asked me, will you chuse to take a walk; I answered, I don't chuse to take a walk with strangers; then there was nothing more passed, good nor bad, and another man came in and sat down; then they had a little talk together, but what they said I do not know, because I am rather shallow of hearing; I asked the second gentleman that came in to please to tell me what o'clock it was; then he drew out his watch, and told me it wanted about five minutes of four, then the man rose up and went out of the box; I did not stop above five or six minutes afterwards, when the prisoner at the bar rose up from the box, then he looked up, and he looked down; then he turned round and seized me by the two arms, then he slammed me down on the bench, and punched me with his knee, while he picked my left-hand pocket; he placed his knee upon my stomach; then, owing to my flurry, he put his hand into my left-hand pocket, and took out my red morocco pocket-book, with ten guineas, eight of the old coin, and two of the new, a crooked half-guinea, a crooked seven-shilling-piece, and a plain seven-shilling-piece; then, owing to my flurry and my fright, and my screeches and cries, I cried out, for heaven's sake, for God's sake, for Christ's sake, to return my money, it was all I had in the world; then he went behind the summer-house and looked all round, and saw nobody coming; then, owing to my screeches and my cries, he came to me, and held the pocket-book in his right-hand, and said, he only did it to frighten me, then he put it in his right-hand coat-pocket again; he never let me have it, but held it in his right-hand with the money in it, and put it into his pocket; then he ran all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110039"/>across the gardens towards Hyde-park-corner; then I ran almost three quarters of a mile after him, till my hair dropped with water; then the first man that came to me was captain Willis's coachman, his name is Thomas, I believe, but I don't know his sirname; then I put my hand upon his hand in my flurry, and said, for heaven's sake, for Christ's sake take that man that is running in the blue coat and black collar, for he has robbed me of all my property; then I had no power, but dropped down, and that gentleman's servant stopped him, and asked what was the matter, and he cried out, a mad woman, a mad woman, a mad woman; I never lost sight of him at all; he spoke very loud; I was near enough to hear what he said; there were a parcel of haymakers at work, and they all came up to see what was the matter; there were two men stopped him, Thomas, and another person; I do not know what the other person's name is; then I pitched upon my knees to captain Willis, to hear what I had to say; when that rebel was brought up, I described the money to that gentleman; then the prisoner at the bar was brought up face to face, and a person that was there said, for God's sake, if you have got the money, give it to the poor girl, and she shall not hurt thee; then he put his hand in his pocket, he had thrown away the pocket-book.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you seen him throw it away? - A. No, he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and in his right hand were ten guineas clear; in his left hand pocket there was a crooked half-guinea, a crooked seven-shilling-piece, and a plain seven-shilling-piece, plenty of silver, and a few halfpence; then he fell down upon his two knees to captain Willis, and owned the whole fact; he threw the money upon the grass, and pitched upon his knees for pardon; I did not hear what he said; then the gentleman, I believe, told him to take up the money; he picked it up, and put it in his waistcoat pocket again; the gentleman said, he thought if he forgave him, that somebody in the gardens would be murdered, and he ordered his servant to take him to Bow-street, and he went in a coach, and I in the coach with him: then the next word he said to me in the kitchen was, my dear lady, says he, forgive me; then I answered, you wicked man, you deserve to have some punishment; then the next word he said was, but will you forgive me: he said that to the gentleman's servant, and he said, he could not forgive him, he must obey his master's orders; then the prisoner said, I did rob her, I did take the money from her certainly; then the other man asked him what he would give me to make up the matter; he said, I will give her all I have in the world not to bring me to no shame nor disgrace; then he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, took out all the gold, and threw it into my lap; I told him I could not forgive him, and then he was taken to Bow-street, and there examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. At this time you were a servant out of place? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been a servant out of place? - A. Two years and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you put your money in your pocket-book? - A. I put my money in my pocket-book on that Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. The morning of the very day that you were robbed? - A. That very morning.</p>
               <p>Q. And you counted it piece by piece, I suppose? - A. No, I kept it all in my box; I went in the morning to the pastry-cook's to get change for a guinea to pay my rent, and they could not give it me.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you were a very industrious good girl; I went to take a walk for the benefit of the air, because I was poorly in health.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several persons in the gardens who knew you? - A. There were several persons passed the box.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard what some of those gentlemen said of you, perhaps? - A.Not at all, I am not a girl of any disrespect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever robbed before? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever think you were robbed before? A. I do not think I ever was robbed of one single halfpenny before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You never thought you were robbed at any time before? - A. No, I can take an oath of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, upon your oath, did you ever accuse any body of having robbed you before? - A. Never, never.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is as true as that you were robbed on this day? - A. I was robbed, if God were not to suffer me to live another moment; if I were to drop down dead directly I was robbed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked any gentleman to come into a box with you in Kensington-gardens, either that day or any other? - A. If I were to die before you this moment, I never spoke to a gentleman to sit in a box with me in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never ask any gentleman about the Strand, or the Park, or the Temple, to go with you any where? - A. I never was agreeable to walk with any gentleman in any gardens, nor Park, nor any part of the town.</p>

               <p>Q.While you were sitting in that gallery, were you not reproved by a gentleman for behaving with great indecency only the day before yesterday? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I never spoke to any gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110040"/>Q. I ask you, whether a gentleman did not find great fault with you for behaving indecently, and threaten to turn you out? - A. No; if you can bring that gentleman forward to swear that he knows me, I will suffer the law, which I am innocent of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never have solicited any gentleman whatever to go with you any where? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you to be a perfectly chaste good girl? - A. I have been two years and a quarter in Mary-le-bonne parish, and if any gentleman can bring any proof that I was a girl of any disrespect, or a thief, I will suffer the law.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask if you were a thief, but you have been a perfectly chaste, modest girl - you have never been walking about the Temple, asking gentlemen to go with you? - A. No, I never walked with any gentleman about the Temple.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor about the street? - A. No, I am a girl that keeps home.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor in Oxford-road? - A. No, nor in Oxford-read.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you never accuse any gentleman of having robbed you in Oxford-road? - A. No, I am not a girl of that disrespect, if I had, why had not this gentleman exposed me before this misfortune; I will swear by my God that I never was a girl that made known my distress to any gentleman, I never asked any gentleman for money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that gentleman, (Mr. Brace, of the Temple) - Did you ever see him before? - A. Never; he is a wicked man if he dare say so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If you have the misfortune to be an unfortunate girl of the town, you had much better own it? - A. I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you never ask that gentleman, Mr. Brace, an attorney of the Temple, whom we all know, for money? - A. I will take an oath, that I never saw that gentleman before to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that gentleman before? - (Pointing to a gentleman on the Bench.) - A. I will give an oath that I never saw that gentleman in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Griffin here? - (Mr. Griffin stood up)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that gentleman before? - A. Yes, that gentleman came to me last Sunday was a week, and another gentleman, to examine me about this business, and that gentleman that sits there, (Pointing to Mr. Ramsey, the Short-hand Writer). was with him, and he held up a stick to me, I thought he was going to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask that gentleman, Mr. Griffin, for one shilling, in the street? - A. I will take a solemn oath I never saw either of them before in my life, there they are both together, there they are both together - Oh you wicked men.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Bradshaw there? (Mr. Bradshaw stood up.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never picked up that gentleman in the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any man? - A. No, I have no occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. This person, before he robbed you, looked up and down? - A. Yes, to see whether there was any body in sight, and there was nobody in sight then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the hay-makers were not in sight? - A. They were not in sight, but they heard the screeches.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not cry out at first? - A. I screamed and cried out near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out while he was taking the pocket-book? - A. Yes, I did; I cried out murder when he punched me with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run away from the box the very instant he had got the pocket-book from you? - A. He did not stop above a minute, no longer than he had power to take it out of his pocket again; he ran as if he would tear the very earth up towards Hyde-park-corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep crying out murder from the time he had taken your pocket-book till he was stopped? - A. Yes, and running all the time as hard as I could run from the very instant that he had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell me how you had got so much money, having been out of place upwards of two years? - A. I am not ashamed or afraid to tell you, I had it by a sister that died in Sodbury, knowing that I was shallow of hearing, that I might put myself apprentice to a mantua-maker; I did not get it by gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your sister's name at Sodbury? - A.Sarah Willis.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never sworn that that sister's name was Sarah Hill? - A. Her maiden name was Sarah Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her name Ann, ever? - A. No, I never said the name of Ann.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she your own sister? - A. No, my sister-in-law; she left me all her clothes, and every thing she had, about two years ago, about a quarter of a year after I had been out of place; there was an old gentleman that allowed me half-a-guinea a week constantly for four months, a gentleman that was old enough to be my father, but never to be a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did your sister leave you? - A. Twenty pounds, and her clothes, altogether about thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You never pawned any thing to raise this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110041"/>money? - A. I have pawned, because I would not break into this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you had pawned things to raise part of this money? - A. No, I have pawned a few trifles to keep this money whole, because I would not break it.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard all that this man said at the time he was stopped? - A. Yes, I had run all the way till I dropped down, and the people came to bear me up; I trembled like a leaf, I was the same as if I had been drawn through a river, when they told me he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you told me that you saw him taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what occasion was there for any body to tell you that he was taken? - A.All the haymakers ran to me to help me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to him when he was taken? - A. As near as to that wall, (pointing to the prison), or not so much; but when he was taken he was walking with his hands in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, was it a quarter of a mile from the box? - A. It was above half a mile, and nearer three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very deaf? - A. I am not very deaf, only with one of my ears.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not hear the conversation between him and the other man in the box? - A. They whispered one to another.</p>
               <p>Q. That gentleman, perhaps, may be here? - A. I wish he may, they were very gently in discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. As he was as far off as that wall, how came you to hear all that he said to the people that stopped him? - A. He spoke loud enough to be heard; he said, a mad woman, a mad woman, a mad woman; you might hear him a great way.</p>
               <p>Q. How many brothers have you? - A. I have got two brothers, and I have had two mothers; one brother lives now in the parish of Kennington, and the other in the parish of Sodbury, eleven miles on this side of Bristol.</p>

             sworn. - I am coachman to Mrs. Reynolds, in Bedford-square, the lady of Dr. Reynolds: at the time this happened, I was coachman to the Rev. Mr. Thompson, Kensington-palace. I was walking along Kensington-gardens, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon I heard a great noise of somebody crying out; I thoght it was the hay-makers, I walked a little farther, and heard the out cry of murder; I saw the prisoner at the bar run, and a woman after him, crying stop him, stop him. I ran directly to the woman; I asked her what was the matter; she said, that man had robbed her of all the money she had got in the world; I said, what man; she said that man that runs along there; he had just passed me then; I directly pursued him through the trees: when he had got between the trees, I lost sight of him; he went on one side of a tree, and I on the other; I could not see him through the tree, that was all that I lost sight of him: he then ran down into the valley among some ladies and gentlemen walking in the grand walk, and then he turned short round on his left hand, put his hands in his pocket, and walked on as solidly, and looked as honest and as innocent as could be; then I walked myself as though I had not seen him; I then ran and laid hold of him by the breast-collar; I laid hold of him by the handkerchief; says I, you are the person that robbed the lady on the other side of the gardens; he said I am innocent of it, I have not been on that side of the gardens; says I, you have, for I will swear to your being the person that run by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that was the man you saw the woman pursuing? - A. I am sure of it; says I, let you say what you will, you are my prisoner, you shall go back to the woman; in going back, he said, I ran from her because she was crazy; then says I, what id you deny the running for, if you had not been not that side the gardens; I then brought the man to her; says I, is this the man that robbed you? yes, says she, and I will swear to him: I walked on a little farther, and captain Willis called her aside, and I let him go; another person, of the name of

               <p>Q. Had she described the guineas? - A. I cannot say; she said there was a crooked half-guinea, a crooked seven-shilling-piece, and a plain seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she describe the guineas, whether they were old or new? - A. I cannot say; no money had been produced at that time; some person came up and shook his right-hand waistcoat-pocket, saying, here is the money, I suppose; the prisoner directly put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, and said, I have plenty of money, and pulled out a handful, and there happened to come a rop a crooked seven-shilling-piece and a crooked half-guinea; I said there is the money that the woman has described; he directly shot it down upon the grass, went upon his knees, and said, I did take it from her, pray let me go; he said again, I did take it from her, and I will give her the money again, and all the goods I have got in the house, and all the clothes I have, and every thing I have in the world, if she will not appear against me; I was very willing to let the man go: captain Willis made answer, and said, if this man is to come here and rob who he likes, my children are not safe to walk in the gardens; says he, if you let him go, I will prosecute you: who are you, he says; I told him my name was

            , at Bow-street, I picked up the money from the bottom of the coach, I called to some of the Bow-street officers, and said, here is a person that has robbed this woman in Kensington gardens; two officers took him out of the coach, and I called directly for another to be a witness to see me pick the money up; I picked up ten guineas and a crooked seven-shilling-piece; there was a hole in the bottom of the coach, that was all I could find; there was a crooked half-guinea and a plain seven-shilling-piece missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remark the guineas at all? - A. No, I have the money in my pocket now. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. That you are perfectly sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Might she not have seen it as it lay on the grass? - A. No, she was not nearer to it than that place, (pointing to the bar.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Upon hearing an outcry, you pursued the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you out-run the woman? - A. Yes; she did not run much more than half way through the gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him behind a tree, and therefore I presume a person behind you could not see him so well as you could? - A. I don't know I might probably see him best; I think she must have been very nearly half a mile from where I took him; it might be more, or it might not be quite so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near enough to hear any thing that either of you said? - A.Certainly not; when I was bringing him towards the woman, she fell down and fainted away.</p>
               <p>Q. That was some minutes after you had taken the prisoner? - A. Yes; I had taken him, I dare say, half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. He said to you, I have not been on that side of the gardens, and you said that he had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, did you say one syllable of that at Bow-street? - A. I told some of it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sworn to tell the truth, and the whole truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, whether at Bow-street you said one word about it? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. And signed it as a part of your examination at Bow-street? - A. I am no scholar, I cannot read, and therefore I cannot say what they might put down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not read over to you? - A. I am no scholar, and I cannot tell what they read.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this woman before? - A. Not to my knowledge; I will be upon my oath I never was in company with her; but if I ever did see her, it must have been once when I was going along with the carriage in South Audley-street, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you can have no resentment against this gentleman, Mr. Beck? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever expressed any? - A. No, any further than that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any expressions of resentment no longer ago than last night? - A. I might or I might not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there was any thing like this - there is nothing but Beck talked of, but d-n him, I will hang him if I can? - A. A gentleman came to me, and began talking to me about Mr. Beck, and said, you are to give evidence against Beck; and I said, d-n Beck, I will speak the truth, it is nothing to me, if he is doomed to be hung, he must be hung.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say, d-n him, I will hang him if I can? - A. I don't know, I might say, d-n him, I will do all I can in my evidence; it was very impertinent in any body coming to me so, and I might say so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Captain Willis was examined as a witness at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - I have been long anxious for the present moment, and have not felt any of those apprehensions that a guilty man usually does in my situation, I am standing here, charged with a crime as disgraceful as it is criminal; it rests with me to state to you, and I will do it in as few words, and as correctly as I can, the circumstances that took place between this woman and myself: On the 20th of June, I was at Kensington; about two o'clock i left the town to go into the gardens, I was going down the walk next the Uxbridge-road, this woman was sitting mending stockings, she beckoned me to her; says she, don't you recollect, me; I recollect you perfectly well, visiting at a house where I was servant; curiosity led me to ask the woman where she had lived servant; I sat down, and she told me she had been servant in a family at Twickenham; I told her I knew no family at Twickenham, I never recollected being at Twickenham but once, and then only passed through it; she asked me to give her some ale; I told her she could get none in the gardens; she asked me to go with her to a house in the neighbourhood, where she used to go; I refused; then she requested me to go, several times, among the trees, I suppose a dozen times; she told me she was not a servant out of place but an officer's wife; I thought if she was an officer's wife she was the wife of a gentleman, and I was inclined to relieve her; she told me she lived near Portman-square, but she could not take me home; she said she could take me to some house where she frequented every day, but, she said, instead of going there we had better go among the trees; I declined doing either; she pressed me very much to give her some money; I put my hand into my pocket and was going to give her a shilling, when she put her arm round my neck, pressed me very strongly to her bosom, and held me so tight, that she put her hand in my pocket and took all my money out; I expostulated with her, and she then gave me back the gold pieces, piece by piece, and then the silver; I told her never to mind the silver; I had passed through all the hay-makers (there were thirty of them I dare say) before she began to cry out; she then began to scream murder; I was alarmed, and expected that she would charge me with some improper liberties, and I ran, and said, the woman must be mad; I ran down to the great Mall; several persons said it was impossible it should be that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110045"/>gentleman; then Lediard said, I shall have the reward, and my expences paid me; then another servant came up, who, I understand, has since ran away, and Lediard and he took me along towards the Palace, there we met with captain Willis; I was very much alarmed and irritated, so much so, that if I had given fifty pounds for a drop of spittle I could not have produced it in my mouth; Lediard said to captain Willis, this is the man that has robbed the woman; I said I had not robbed her; but I would have confessed almost any thing, having a wife and family, to have got rid of so disgraceful a business; when we got to Kensington, I begged for some water, Lediard was very ill-natured, and would not let me have any; there is a gentleman here who saw me in the box with the woman, who will tell you, that there were a great number of hay-makers within sight, and that if this robbery had been committed, it must have been in the presence of at least thirty spectators. When we had got in the coach as far as Piccadilly, the woman said to Lediard, I am willing, if he will give me the money, to let him go; Lediard said, for my part, I will let him go; no, says Goddard, I will take him to Bow-street, and then I shall have forty pounds reward; I threw the money into her lap, he knocked her hand, and the money went to the bottom of the coach; I was going to pick it up again, but Lediard held up his fist, and swore he would knock me down if I picked it up; I was taken to Bow-street, and nothing more transpired till I came before the Magistrate. Gentlemen, I have nothing more to say, these are exactly the circumstances that brought me here; and I solemnly declare, I am as innocent of the crime with which I am charged as the child unborn; and I do most solemnly declare before the Almighty, that I am innocent of this charge; I trust my case will be stated to you by a wise and impartial Judge; and I trust the Jury will sist, as much as they can, the facts of this case, when they consider that the life and character of a fellow creature is at stake.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a solicitor in the Temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that woman that you have heard examined to day upon this trial? - A. I do, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you Under Sheriff for the County of Kent? - A. No; my cousin is, who is in partnership with me.</p>
               <p>Q.Relate when you saw this woman, and what was the transaction between you? - A. I never saw her but once before she came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any relationship, or acquaintance, with the gentleman at the bar? - A. I never saw him till I saw him at Bow-street. The transaction that took place between her and me is a considerable time ago; it may be a year and a half, or two years, or it may be rather more; I was passing, I think, near Charing-cross, leading up Cockspur-street, in the evening, it was not dusk, a woman came up to me and asked for charity, she said she was distressed, or something of that kind; I turned round, and said, I have nothing for you; upon which, she immediately exclaimed that I owed her money, or had promised her money, she repeated several words; her manner of speaking drew my attention so much, that I turned round and looked at her, from which I am able to say that she is the same woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of year was it? - A. In the summer; when I looked at her, I really thought she was mad; and if she was not mad, I thought she had an intention of bringing a crowd round me; in consequence of which, I made the best of the way I could, and got from her; when I saw her at Bow-street, I there mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long was this conversation passing? - A. I did not stop at all with her, it was only as I was passing her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is nothing uncommon for a person to ask charity in the street? - A. What I allude to, particularly, is her manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was her manner such as to surprise you? - A.Certainly; I thought she was mad, or meant to get me into some disagreeable situation.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you sent for to Bow-street? - A. No; I am concerned for Sir

               <p>Q. Have you the smallest doubt that that is the woman who made the attack upon you? - A. I have not the smallest, or I should not have picked her out at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Am I to understand that this conversation passed as you were walking along, and that you had not seen her for so long a time, and yet you picked her out at Bow-street? - A. It made such an impression upon me at the time, and I think it is impossible for me to be mistaken, from the expression of her face, I have not a single doubt of her being the same person.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you heard what she has said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And still you say, you believe she is the same woman? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>REV. DR. FORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. We need not ask you who you are, we all know you too well I believe; it is by mere accident you are attending here? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen this woman before who has been examined to-day? - A. An hundred times, at least, in point of time, I cannot authenticate it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110046"/>but either previous to Christmas last, or a little afterwards, I was going from a public-house in Hand-court, Holborn, to my own lodgings in Bedford-street, Bedford-row; when I had got nearly to the top of Brownlow-street, I was met by this woman; she stopped me in the usual manner in which women of the town do; I replied to her, I was not likely, either from my years, or my profession, to be a customer of her's; she used a number of arguments to induce me to go with her; I crossed from her, it was on the right-hand side coming up from Holborn, to go to the oil and soap office, the mistress of which I knew; I went over there to knock at the door, in order to get rid of her, or at least by knocking to intimidate her, for she began to be very riotous; she then laid hold of me by the collar with both hands, and said, you b-y thief, give me back the money you have taken from me; I said, immediately, you have changed your blandishments wonderfully, for you were very loving this moment; I was a little alarmed, I confess, because the woman was taller apparently than myself; I looked up and down the street, and saw no creature walking but myself; she then cried, watch; she took me by one hand, and put her hand to my pocket to feel for the money which she said I had taken from her, and said, you have it here; I immediately, with my right-hand, seized her by the right-wrist, in this manner, (describing it); and being left-handed, and pretty strong in my arm, I said, if you do not let me go, I will certainly knock you down; and I was going to knock her down, for I really thought, from the face and the manner, that it was a man in woman's clothes; I said, if you do not let me go I will knock you down, or words to that effect; for I had not the smallest idea of giving evidence here, till I happened to see the woman giving evidence, and recollected her immediately; she again called watch, and I wished very much that the watch had come up to have taken us both to the Compter; no watch came, and there was no creature walking; every body that knows Brownlow-street, knows it is very retired, though it was not nine o'clock, for it is very badly lighted, and worse watched; I said to her, I wish the watch would come up, I am just at home, I am extremely well known in this place, and it will be worse for you if you should charge me with the watch in this place; she then said, if I would give her something to drink she would let me go; to which I said, if there were a pump convenient you should have water enough, but as there is not I with you a good night.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you see her after that? - A. The very next day, dressed as a quaker, in a lead-coloured gown, a close cap, and dressed exactly like a quaker; that was about eleven o'clock in the morning; I held up my first to her, and said, you know me; she nodded, and went on; and I have met her, I am sure, a dozen times in Brownlow-street, and know her face as well as I know the face of any gentleman I have the honour to know here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she appear to you to be deranged? - A. Not in the least, because every word she said was delivered with collectedness, and in a bullying kind of style.</p>
               <p>Q.You was not habited in your robes, I presome? - A. No, I had a little brown wig on.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt in your mind that she is the same person? - A. I am as sure of it as that I am here myself; I have met her almost every day in my way from my lodgings into the City; her face is a very remarkable one; I observed that evening that I thought I could pick her out of a thousand; here is another gentleman, who has been sitting by me, who came into Court accidentally, and who also can give some evidence respecting her.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any acquaintance with Mr. Beck? - A. I never saw him but once before, and that was at his second examination at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard this woman, Jane Gibbs, examined here to-day? - A. I heard a part of her examination.</p>

None in the least; I saw her about nine o'clock at night in the Strand; she was going down the Strand before me; I came up to her, and entered into conversation with her; taking her by the left arm, she said, I mistook her, that she was not a bad girl, that she was not that sort of girl, that she was a servant out of place, that she thought she knew me; she said she was not of this country, meaning London; she said she knew me very well, and thought she had been me in her country; I asked her my name, and she could not tell; when she said she was a servant, I asked her if she was in place or out of place; she said, out; she gave me several squeezes of the hand while she was saying she was not a bad girl, but having seen her face, I wished to quit her as soon as I could, as she was such an extraordinary looking animal as I had never seen before; I pushed her off, and said, take my advice, and go into place again; I meant to have crossed to the other side of the street, when she immediately closed up to me, and seemed to be very much agitated, much in the state in which she appeared this morning, and said, you rascal, you have robbed me, you have picked my pocket of a gold chain, and she called the watch; she repeated very loud that I had robbed her: I said, if she wished to make any charge, not to call the watchman from his duty, but to go down with me to the watch-house, and make whatever charge she pleased before the constable of the night: finding she was not to be intimidated, I remarked to her the dangerous consequences that would attend her in making any such charge, or endeavouring to extort money under false pretences; then she said I was nothing but a rascally servant out of place; then I crossed over the street, gave her a push, and got off.</p>

               <p>Q.How long before the examination in Bow-street had you ever seen her? - A. Two evenings before, in St. James's-park, as I was going home to Sloane-street, from the play; it was late in the evening; I generally go that way through Buckingham-gate; I was walking up the walk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110048"/>next the pales; she crossed over to me, and said, why, do not you know me, how do you do? I told her, I had not the honour of her acquaintance, but, upon looking at her, desired she would go about her business; then she took hold of my arm, and said, she would go with me: I told her if she did, she must walk very fast; she walked about one hundred yards with me; she began crying, and said, she was out of place, and very much distressed; she said, she had not a farthing to help herself; I put my hand in my pocket, and had no silver, but one or two half-crowns; I told her I had no silver, and insisted upon her going about her business; when she found she could get nothing, she turned off, and went about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you any acquaintance of Mr. Becks'? - A. I never saw him in my life till I went to Bow-street to wait for the half-play time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a woman like her before? - A. No, never, she is a very remarkable woman.</p>
               <p>HATTON TURNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you by profession? - A. A gentleman, residing in Bloomsbury, very near Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen the woman that was examined here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - A. I believe I saw her in the latter part of June, but I cannot be positive to identify her, I believe it to be the same person: in the middle of Oxford-street, I think the corner of Newman-street, I saw a bustle, and heard a very strong and violent altercation between a woman and a gentleman; she had hold of his arm, which she clasped with some degree of violence, and said, d-n you, you have stole my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same woman? (Gibbs was called into Court.) - A. I have no doubt in my own mind, I think I have no doubt, but I would not under take to identify her; she spoke with a great deal of rancour, and, I believe, repeated it forty or fifty times that he had stolen her handkerchief; the gentleman seemed to be very glad if he could get rid of her, but she held him as firm as a rock; he said, for God's sake, good woman, you had better go about your business, and let me alone, for I know nothing of you, but the charge was still persisted in with great violence, d-n you, you know you have stole my handkerchief, till they came to a street, I think Dean-street, near Soho-square; the gentleman then gave her a most violent push upon the kirb stone, where she lay some seconds, and he bounded away like a shot from a bow; she got up and pursued him, and then I lost them: it made a strong impression upon me at the time, and when I heard the charge being made against Mr. Beck, I held it my duty to call upon Mr. Beck, and offer him my testimony, could it be of any service to him.</p>

             GILBERT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am assistant-clerk at St. Bartholomew's hospital; I live in Salisbury-square, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you been subpoenaed at all? - A. No, I came here induced by the singularity of this trial; I never saw the prisoner before, and I have been induced, from curiosity, to look at this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect and know the woman again as to her person? - A. I think I do; I firmly believe this very woman made a peculiar attack upon me one evening coming from Spitalfields, I think in Sun-street, about twelve o'clock at night, seven or eight months ago, I had a person with me; this woman, as I believe, a person in female attire, however, seized me violently by the arm, and dragged me towards her with such violence, as I should hardly have expected from one of the foster sex, and, in a voice rather coarse, desired I would accompany her to her lodgings, and though I cannot be positive, I think from her motion she endeavoured to put her hand in my waistcoat pocket, however, I lost nothing; but, upon the first glance of the face, there was something so shocking to my ideas, that I as quick as I could got away from her, which was with some difficulty, and I am pretty strong too; I did, however, get away from her; I believe firmly that the person who so attacked me is the present prosecutrix.</p>

               <p>Q.Had he this iron lock when you saw him at the Saracen's-head? - A. No; it had been taken off at the Saracen's-head.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Jagger.) Was your horse upon the same Common? - A. Yes; I found him at the Saracen's-head.</p>

               <p>Joel. I can swear to this lock, but the key is not mine; the lock is marked No. 2, and I have got the right key in my pocket belonging to it; the key is marked No. 2, as well as the lock.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner was at work upon my premises, doing some repairs to the brick-work; I missed two iron sash-weights on the 2d of September, I was from home at the time they were taken, I was sent for; I found the prisoner in the shop, he told me it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the kind, and hoped I would forgive him, my foreman had charged him with stealing them; he was taken to the Compter, and examined next day; there is no particular mark upon them by which I can swear to them, but I have every reason to believe they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they like those which remained behind? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been talking to her in the street? - A. She did not say any thing till she came into the house, only she asked me to go into the public-house to give her a drop of drink, we had no talk at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110052"/>Q. What was the name of the street? - A.According to what they told me, it was Lisle-street.</p>

               <p>Q. When you left the house, did you agree to go together any where? - A. No, I did not; when we came out of the house, she put her hands in my right hand pocket, and took out my tin box and my discharge, and my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took them? - A. By feeling her hands come out of my pocket, and turning the corner with them; I was hardly able to walk, and I could not follow her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find those things again? - A. Yes, the next day, in Little Wild-street, as they told me the name of the street was; she produced my smart ticket out of her bosom to me, and with her pulling it out of her bosom, a five-pound note dropped upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one of your five-pound notes? - A. I cannot tell; after that mother Malony put her hand down into her bosom, or some part, and pulled out six guineas, and two seven-shilling-pieces; she said, if she had her property again, she would not part with it, and I found one of my combs upon the table by the bed where she slept; it was marked so, that if all the combs in London were brought, I can swear to my own comb; there was Fitz marked upon it with a wire red hot; there was nothing else that I could swear to but my comb and my smart ticket.

               <p>Q. Was it not at the White-lion, in Broad-street, St. Giles's, where there were plenty of men and women? - A. No, in Lisle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not two of your fellow lodgers with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What company were you in when I parted with you? - A. Nobody as I know of but yourself robbing me.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q.Did you make the watch? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you put your name, and Southampton-street, upon every watch you have made there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a watch was it? - A. A metal watch.</p>
               <p>Q. After this lady had been with you, you went to the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, for ought you know, you took it out with you in your pocket? - A. I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where the prisoner lived? - A. Yes; he told me that very day, that he lived in Queen-Ann-street, West.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went to his mistress's house three days after? - A. I went the very next day, to tell her what had happened.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, in a few days after, Mrs. Goring went to Brighton? - A. I do not know any thing about that the prisoner went with her to Brighton; I did not imagine that he had taken it, because, being a gentleman's servant, it would be ruination to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner subsequent to the time of your having lost your watch, and previous to his being taken up? - A. Yes, he came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he had heard such a thing rumoured that was so prejudicial to his character, and he was ready to go with you to Bow-street, or any where else? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not actually put his horses to the carriage, and drive you, and the Bow-street officer, to Bow-street? - A. He did, to take his oath.</p>

On Tuesday the 6th of August, about two or three o'clock in the day; he came in, and said, he would be much obliged to me to look at his watch, for it stopped, it was a metal hunting watch; I looked at it, and saw the watch had had a fall, or a shake; I asked him if he could leave it for two or three hours; he then desired me to lend him another hunting watch instead of that, he left me his watch and took another away with him; the watch remained there till Thursday the 9th, when the Bow-street officer came to me, and produced my watch that I had given to the prisoner, and I carried the other watch to Bow-street. (Produces the watch in question).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You told my Lord you could not swear he was the man, and yet you say you have no doubt he is the man; how do you reconcile that? - A. From circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is from circumstances that have transpired since that you are induced to believe he is the man, and not from a recollection of his person? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name in the watch that you gave the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means do you know that watch? - A.There is the name of Russet in the watch.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you know the number? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If any other person had got into possession of that watch, could the Bow-street officers know, from the watch itself, that it belonged to you? - No, by no means.</p>

            , and told him I was an officer, and searched him; he stedfastly denied that he knew any thing about it, and in searching him I pulled this watch out of his pocket, which I thought had been Mr. Higginson's; I asked him where he got that watch; he said, he bought it of a servant, and gave three guineas for it, but he could not tell where the young man was, at last he told me where he had this watch, and where Mr. Higginson's watch was; I went up to Mr. Young, and ordered him to attend at Bow-street directly; he has the one watch, and I the other.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the watch-maker's watch upon the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was in consequence of the candid disclosure of the prisoner, where he got that watch, that you discovered Mr. Higginson's watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you gave the same account of it at that time? - A. Yes, if I was to tell the story twenty times over, I should not very it I am sure. (The watch was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see what occasioned his tumbling? - A. No, I was not soon enough; I then went up to the deceased, and I saw him get out of the ditch, and there I saw the other man naked behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased naked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that naked man? - A. No, I could tell him if I was to see him again; he came out of the ditch after the other; the deceased got out and made away to the public-house door, and said, I have had enough, I will fight no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might it be from the ditch to the place where he got up? - A. It might be six yards; then the naked man shoved him away from the public-house, I did not know who it was, and struck him many blows in the face with his fist, then a scuffle ensued; the deceased rather returned the blows as well as he could; ne'er a blow that I saw reached so high as his face, it was like pushing him away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that last? - A. I suppose not half a minute scarce before one was down; Giles, the deceased, got the naked man down first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him afterwards? - A. Yes, twice at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the Court, and see if you see the man? - (Looks round the Court.) A. I cannot say I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that man at the bar before? - A. I see him now, I was looking down before, that is the man that I saw naked; Giles got him down, and they both got up again, and Giles said, he would have no more; after that, by pushing and hitting one another about, Giles was thrown into a bit of a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean each pushing the other? - A. Yes, they did, as well as they could; I believe Giles was thrown into a bit of a gutter by the side of the road, after the deceased laid down, and some people round about said, d-n him, kick him, serve him as he served you; then three very heavy kicks across the body were directly given by his antagonist; then Mr. Olive came and took hold of Giles, and said, old brutality through the piece, then he took him to his house, and got him a bowl of water, he washed his face, and then the deceased turned his head round with great sagacity, and said, is nobody here? - Mr. Olive said, yes, I am here.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing more that passed between the prisoner and the deceased? - A. No, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that I followed the deceased to his own door in a chair; I left him at his own door, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw this man kick the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110057"/>Q.Have you not sworn that he had nails in his shoes? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. The battle had begun before you first came up? - A. I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you do not know whether the battle had begun before you came up? - A. I cannot tell that; the first I saw was, Giles, falling into the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you saw one man stripped, and another falling into the ditch, you mean to tell that Jury that you don't know whether the battle was begun or not? - A. How should I know whether it had, when I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are known at this public-house that you speak of? - A. I cannot tell that rightly, I go there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then have you any doubt that they know you? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you doubt whether the battle had begun when you heard the deceased say, I will fight no more? - A. I did not see any blows.</p>

             sworn. - I am a painter and glazier; I live very high the spot where this happened; I was standing at my own door, when the prisoner and the deceased came out of a public-house, about twenty yards from the door of the public-house, it was on Sunday, the 18th of August; about twenty minutes past twelve at night, the deceased came out, and the prisoner and three others, which were the prisoner's acquaintances, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should you suppose they were the friends of one more than the other? - A. I have known the deceased a great many years, living in the neighbourhood, but I never saw these other persons before; when they came out of the public-house, the prisoner went up to the deceased, and said, you kick my a-e, it is not in your power to kick my a-e; upon that the prisoner went and put his hand to the deceased's face, and struck him on the left hand side of his face open handed; he then gave him a push, and sprung back in a position to meet him; then the deceased struck him, and they enclosed together for about half a minute I suppose, they fall down, and the prisoner was undermost, about two yards from the public-house door, in the public street; the deceased struck the prisoner two or three times while he was upon the ground, and they he kicked the prisoner; they got up together again, and they fought togethere again, and fell down again; the prisoner fell undermost the second fall; I believe, after the second round, the prisoner stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Then up to this time, they had both their clothes on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner strip? - A. No, he did not; then they enclosed again, and fell down, I cannot say which was uppermost; the third fall they got up again, and met together again, and they had hold of one another; the prisoner was striking over the head, and the deceased was striking over the body, and as they were fighting, they both fell into the ditch together; the prisoner at the bar came out of the ditch first; the deceased made towards the public-house door, the Northumberland-arms; it is called the White-house, because it is stuccoed; as soon as he came out of the ditch, the deceased said, he had had enough, and would not fight any more; the prisoner at the bar said, keep the door shut, do not let him go in.</p>
               <p>Q.This was immediately upon their getting out of the ditch? - A. Yes, immediately; upon that some man went to put his backside against the door to prevent the deceased going in; upon that the prisoner went up to the deceased as he was standing at the public-house, and he struck him two or three times in the face, or about the head, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that immediately? - A. Yes; then the deceased kicked at the prisoner to keep him off; then they enclosed together again immediately, they did not fall that time, but they were parted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any blows given when they closed? - A. The prisoner gave the deceased blows, but I did not see the deceased strike any blow; they were parted, and then they enclosed again afterwards, and fell down just by the public-house door, and got up again, and closed again, and they tumbled both together again, and the deceased was undermost, and laid across a drain; then the prisoner struck the deceased two or three times over the face while he was lying upon the ground, and the prisoner at the bar kicked him two or three times upon the left side; upon that there was some voice expressed, why do not you kick him, d-n you, kick him, serve him as he served you, kill him if you can.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might there be collected together at that time? - A. There might be fifty or sixty people, I cannot exactly say how many; I then took hold of him by the arms, and lifted him up; he walked about the space of nine or ten yards nearly to my own door, and I went down stairs, and got some water, and washed his face, and he attempted to wash his face as well as he was able; then my wife came up stairs; I asked him into my kitchen, he staid about a quarter of an hour, and while he was there, we washed his temples with vinegar and water; and while he was in my kitchen, he said, oh! that ditch, that ditch! and trying to utter it a third time, he said, dish; I saw such a change in the man's countenance, that I thought he was dying, and I got some assistance, and he was carrying home in a great arm chair to his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110058"/>apartments; I went soon after while the apothe cary was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live afterwards? - A. I suppose he was dead before he got to his own house; the apothecary was trying all means to recover him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say that you saw him at the very moment they came out of the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there were not attempts made to prevent the deceased attacking prisoner; and that he did not tear the man's coat that attempted to prevent it? - A. I did not see any such thing; there was some person said to the prisoner at the bar, don't fight, for God's sake.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say no such thing passed? - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go by the name of Sandman? - A. No, I am a little higher character than a Sandman too.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was a taller man than the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a more powerful man? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Giles the most quarrelsome man in the neighbourhood. - A. I know very little of the man, except living in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not some ribs broke about three weeks ago in a fight? - A. Not that I ever heard, and I live close by him.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you near enough to hear any expressions the deceased made use of? - A. No, I did not hear him make use of any expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to have heard him if he had? - A. I was standing at my own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards was this from your own door? - A. About twenty yards.</p>

             sworn. - This happened about twenty yards from my own house; they had just got out of the ditch when I came up; I saw the deceased go towards the public-house door; he got to the public-house door, and the prisoner called out, don't let him in. Giles received several blows from the prisoner; Giles then kicked at him, but where he hit him, I do not know; after that Giles rushed at him, and then down he was; then they closed, and had one another down, and the prisoner was undermost; then they got up again; Mr. Giles said, he had had enough, and would fight no more.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that after they had fallen and got up again? - A. Yes, then the prisoner had at him again; they closed again, and fell down again; then they got up again, and closed again, and several blows were struck about the body on both sides; then the prisoner threw him down across the kennel; then somebody made answer and said, kick him, d-n him, kick him, serve him as he served you; kill him if you can, but who it was I cannot say; then Mr. Olive said, you will kill the man, and he took him out of the kennel, and took him towards his own door, and fetched a bason of water and washed his face; after that he called me to help him to get him home; he said, O Sam! I am very sick, let me alone a bit; then Olive and I got him into a chair; then Olive washed his temples with vinegar; his countenance changed very much, and I thought he was dying; he was not above three or four minutes in his own house before he died.</p>

             sworn. - I came down just as they had got to the last round; I saw them both fall over the kennel; I saw the prisoner kick the deceased several times while he was down; I was very near them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Elizabeth Giles). Did you see any part of this fight yourself? - A. I know nothing of it till I was informed he was fighting; I got to him just as Mr. Olive was taking him into his house; I saw by his face that he was a dead man, and I came away.</p>
               <p>Mr. BIRCH sworn. - I am a surgeon, I attended the deceased about ten minutes after his death?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his body to ascertain the cause of his death? - A. Yes; I found three ribs fractured on the left side, and one of them had punctured the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suppose, from your examination of the body, was the cause of his death? - A. Two of them were large ribs, and one of them a small rib, at a distance from one another; it must have been occasioned by a violent fall upon some very hard body or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from the appearance of the ribs whether it had been done recently, or any time? - A. It was undoubtedly a recent case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else that could be the occasion of his death, except these fractured ribs? - A. Nothing particular; there was no external appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blows that could occasion his death? - A. Not to any external appearance; there was just a scratch upon the surface, which appeared to me from a brick-bat, or something of that kind, but it was very trifling; if it had been been done by the fist or kicks, there would have been external marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q.There were a number of brick-bats in this ditch, were they fell, perhaps you may know that? - A. Most undoubtedly there are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the deceased in consequence of any injury he had received from fighting previous to this? - A. Yes, about three months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110059"/>Q.What injury did he then receive. - A. A trifling injury on the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know enough of the deceased to know whether he bore the general character of a quarrelsome man? - A. He did by some people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in this public-house with an acquaintance, and the deceased came in with some ducks, and we were talking about the ducks; I said I had one larger, and he said it was a d-d lie, and began to quarrel, and insisted upon fighting; I paid my reckoning, and solicited my friend to do the same to get away from him, but he would follow me out, and then the accident happened.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchmaker in Peartree-court; the prisoner is a watchmaker; I went out with him on Sunday the 18th of August; he complained of being rather ill, and said he would take a walk; we went to the White-house at Battle-bridge, the deceased came in with two live ducks; I said you have got two nice ducks there; the prisoner said they were but small ones; the deceased said the prisoner could not produce better; the prisoner said he had a duck that would weigh eleven or twelve pounds; the deceased said, is it an English duck; the prisoner said a drake you know we call a duck, but it shall not be a Muscovy duck, it shall be an English duck; the deceased then pulled a half-a-guinea out of his pocket, and said, he would lay him half-a-guinea he could not produce a duck of such weight; then the prisoner said, I will lay you a leg of mutton and trimmings that I do; there went on an altercation between them, and I was in conversation with another person, a stranger to me, in the room, till I heard the deceased threaten to kick the prisoner's a-e, and the prisoner laughed at it, and said, it must be a man to do that; the deceased then went away, and took the ducks with him; then he returned again in the course of half an hour, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return apparently in better temper? - A. Yes; when we were going away, the deceased said, now, you sh-n son of a b-b, where is your ten pound duck now? the prisoner said, he could produce him; says he you are a d-d liar, and I will make a liar of you before I leave you; I left the prisoner and the deceased together while I turned the corner; some person said your friend is a fighting, I then ran in between them, and said, for God's sake, don't go to fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had they closed when you interfered? - A. No, they had not closed; they were striking at each other; I did not see who struck the first blow; the deceased then got hold of me by the coat, shoved me against the wall, and told me to go along, or he would serve me the same, and tore my coat as you now see it; then they went to fighting, and had several rounds in their clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. During these rounds, was there any foul play on the part of the prisoner, or on the part of the deceased? - A. After the deceased had got the prisoner down, he knelt upon him, and beat him in the face several times; he was taken off by some people that were standing by; they got up, went to it again, and he served him the same a second time; then I lifted the deceased off the prisoner, and they got up again.</p>
               <p>Q.During all the time of the fight, did you see any unfair conduct on the part of the prisoner towards the deceased? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any unfair conduct of the prisoner, towards the deceased, must you not have seen it? - A. I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swear there was not? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About three years; he is a very peaceable, quiet man.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. - Q. Did you see them when they got out of the ditch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased go towards the public house door saying, he would have no more of it? - A. No; he might say such a thing, but I was too far off to hear that.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons were present? - A.Twenty and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dunn there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a man of the name of Arnold there? - A. Yes; and the prisoner at the bar was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Toombs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a quarrel? - A. Yes; Toombs fetched a watchman up and gave charge of Dunn.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110060"/>Q. What was the name of the watchman? - A.Stephens, and there were two other patroles; upon that several took an active part, I saw Williams strike at somebody; the pots were thrown at the patroles, and they were followed down stairs into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Soon after ten; I then crossed the way to go to my own home; I then observed Williams standing in the road way, with a drab coloured coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they come out; peaceably or otherwise? - A. They came out in a hurry; then they returned towards the Sun public house several of them, and knocked at the door, but I cannot name any one that knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been out of the house before they returned to the Sun public house door? - A. More than a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see of Williams at that time? - A. I did not observe him at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they get into the public house at all? - A. They shoved up the window and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them make use of any expressions at that time? - A. They called out for one Bill, a person, I suppose, they missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Lancaster? - A. Yes; his name was William.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lancaster in the house that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue in the public house? - A. I suppose half a minute; it was a very short space of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out the second time? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of them were together? - A. About 12 or 14; they then went towards the Compasses a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of them? - A. No; I did not; they then returned from the Compasses and went towards the watch house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is the Compasses a public house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the watch-house from the Sun? - A. About ten doors distance; when they returned from the Compasses, I observed Arnold, Dunn, and Williams; Dunn went first with Williams, on one hand, and Arnold on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any more than those three persons? - A. I dare say twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of those who followed? - A. Yes; I knew Parsons and Russel; I stood at the end of Red-lion-alley, about 40 yards from the watch house, on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing what passed at the watch-house door? - A. Yes; I saw a mob at the door, and I saw one man seemingly striking with a stick; I thought it was at somebody that was within; I did not go any nearer; I then lost fight of them by some night carts, and I did not take particular notice where they went to after that, till I saw them return back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any of those you saw return back? - A. I observed Arnold and Dunn, but did not see the prisoner; they went then towards Peter-street, and there I lost sight of them; I saw a watchman standing at the end of Peter-street, of the name of Larcher; about ten minutes afterwards I went down Peter-street, and found Larcher all over blood; he appeared to me to have had a blow on the head with a stick; I saw, as if the skull was driven in, nearly as deep as the bowl of a table spoon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What business are you? - A. A case-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a decent tradesman, and were at this Sun public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a club, perhaps, at which many decent people resorted? - A. If I had not gone with a tradesman I should not have gone myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe every thing passed very peaceably till somebody tore Toombs's coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you said upon the former trial, that you thought it was a frolic, and that Toombs was a very ill-natured fellow, to call the watchman and make that disturbance? - A. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, Dunn, Arnold and Williams, and a considerable number of persons passed towards the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have said it was impossible for you to say who were the persons that stopped at the watch-house and took an active part? - A. I did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a patten-maker; I was a the club when the riot took place; the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what passed about Toombs? - A. Yes; Toombs went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember trying to prevent Toombs going away? - A. Not that I remember; the watchman came into the room and went to the left side of the room where Dunn stood; when they had got there, one of the watchmen said, which is the man that insulted you, Toombs; and he pointed to Dunn; he immediately went to collar Dunn, and Dunn put himself in a posture to strike him, and he did strike him, he knocked him down; then the watchman got hold of his collar and a scuffle ensued, and they were all up in arms directly, the people in the room with sticks and quart pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams one of those that were up in arms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know he was the watchman? - A. Yes; he had his watch coat on; then there was a fight between Ryan and Dunn, and Williams got between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110061"/>Q. Was this before or after the watchman had been knocked down? - A.Before the watchman came in; I then came down stairs and saw the watchman that had been knocked down upon the stairs; I got out of the house as soon as I could, and went opposite the watch house; I was so slurtied I cannot tell who came down before me or after me; I then saw Ryan and Dunn very plainly go into the watch-house; I then saw ten people or more in the road way; then I saw Williams near the door of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so situated that you could see what passed in the watch-house? - A. Yes; from the light of the lamps, and the door being open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brewer, the beadle, that was killed? - A. No; there are folding doors; that door was not open where I suppose he stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body so near the door as Williams? - A. Only Orrell; I saw a knife in Dunn's hand, it was a clasped knife open; I saw Ryan and Dunn go into the watch-house, and I saw them come out again; they pulled off their hats and holloaed huzza; at the time that Ryan and Dunn went in, Arnold stood on the same side of the way that I did, before me; the mob went down towards Peter-street; I saw the prisoner and Orrel, and Dunn and Ryan, and a good many more, I followed them to the corner of Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the Compasses? - A. About the middle of Cow-cross; I saw the watchman that stood with one hand across the other, and I believe a lanthorn, and Dunn with the knife he had in his hand, cut him under the chin; his name is Charles Englefield; he then presented a knife to his body; upon that I holloaed out why do not you take the knife out of that man's hand, he has cut that man; upon which Dunn made use of the expression, you b-r, I will cut you, and put the knife at me; after that, finding he was cut, they went away down Peter-street, to Bull-head-court, about half way down the street; there, either the watchman, or the superintendant of the watch, sprung a rattle, and passed me again; when they came up, Williams, Orrell, Ryan and Dunn, and others sell a beating the watchman, a man of the name of Larcher, he is dead since; there was a boy under the shelter of a window said, for God's sake don't kill the man; after that, they turned down Peter-street again, and left a man there, and turning down Peter-street again, they turned up Saffron-hill, where there is a turnstile, and there was a gentleman in black coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams one of the party? - A. Yes; Williams, Ryan, Dunn, Orrell, and a vast many more; Dunn presented his knife at the gentleman's body, but I do not know that he received any hurt; I said, Williams, why do not you take the knife out of that man's hand; upon which, Williams said, who is that calls my name; I again repeated, why do not you take the knife out of the man's hand, where is the use of cutting people that do not meddle with you; he turned round to me as if he was going to strike me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you then? - A. No; then they went through Turnstile, Saffron hill; I observed Williams put his arm round Dunn, and whether he shut the knife, or whether Dunn shut it, I cannot tell, but it was shut, and no more mischief was done; they proceeded along Hatton-garden, and when they got to Holborn, they parted in threes and fours; Berry, Ostand, and Dunn, and a great many more, went down the hill, and others went up the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation before they parted? - A. Yes; they said that was the roller stick.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? - A. The patrol's stick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were a witness at the time Arnold, Ryan, and Dunn were tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, to-day, sworn that Ryan, who was then indicted, went into the watch-house-Did you not also swear, upon the last trial, that he went into the watch-house? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Ryan was acquitted, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been accused yourself of going into the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not taken up as one of the three men that went into the watch-house? - A. No; I was taken up to support the evidence of

               <p>Q. You told me, at first, that you were taken up, and that the impression upon your mind was, that you were to be a witness; upon your oath, did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110062"/>you not believe, at that very time, that you were taken up for the purpose of being prosecuted? - A. I never was taken up, I went voluntarily to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the office the next day after the affair, I suppose? - A. No; I was in my business, and when I found that I was inquired after, I was told some people had been there, and I went to the office, where Mr. Blamire was sitting, and that was in the evening, at Hatton-garden; I went by myself, and there was another that was at the club as well, one Howell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the transaction did you go to the Magistrate's? - A. Three days.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go then the next day and give information of what you had seen? - A. No; I was about my business, in the bone business, such as they collect at butcher's, and cook's shops, for the grease.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you now? - A. A patten-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the bone business? - A. I was indicted for a nuisance; but I served my time as a patten-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in any other business? - A. In the coal trade.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been in prison, perhaps, upon this occasion? - A. Yes, before the trial, without seeing any Magistrate at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many times have you been in prison? - A. I cannot recollect; I never had a charge of felony against me of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what the meaning of felony is? - A. I should suppose it is for a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. For stealing any thing - now, you understand it, upon your oath, were you never apprehended upon a charge of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you cannot tell whether you were ever apprehended upon a charge of stealing any thing; have you never been in the custoday of one Joslin, a City constable? - A. Not upon a just thing, that was upon suspicion of stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you swear you had never been in custody but upon this charge? - A. Never to have a proof of any felony against me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a reward advertised of two hundred pounds for apprehending one of those persons? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a very large reward offered? - A. Yes, there was a reward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You have seen advertisements struck up about the town, for a year and a half together, for the apprehension of this man a well as of others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked about some charge of felony; what was it, and what became of it? - A.Nothing came of it; I was discharged before the Alderman, at Guildhall, I was never committed upon it; I have been tried before Lord Kenyon, for taking a man's head-stall off, many times, when I was collecting the tolls, for things that I distrained, but I never was tried for any thing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you or did you not, for the purpose of being accurate as far as you could in giving your evidence, buy the printed account of the trial a few days ago; have you not been reading it over and over again? - A. I bought it for Mr. Jeffs, of Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Jeffs gave you the money then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not said, that you pawned your own handkerchief for the purpose of buying it? - A. Yes; I did pawn my own handkerchief, and I bought those papers for myself, as well as for Mr. Jeffs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you do with them? - A. I delivered them to Mr. Jeffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read them first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason? - A. I have been threatened to be shut, people have been nights and nights after me; people have met me in the streets, and swore they would set me aside if this man was convicted; I said, it is not my evidence that will do it, to satisfy you, says I, here is the paper to look at; the two numbers came to one shilling, and Mr. Jeffs paid me a shilling again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you surrendered yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard that the officers were out looking for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the Magistrate before the officers found you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is what you mean by saying you surendered yourself, and was not taken up? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a dustman: I was at the club at the Sun public-house; the prisoner was there, and Dunn, Ryan, and a great many more, to the number of thirty or forty, the greatest part of them I knew; there was a man there appeared to me to be a stranger, he wanted to sing a song, and his singing of it did not please the company, upon which, Ryan and Dunn shoved him about, till they note the skirts of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams there? - A. Yes, sitting still at that time; after Toombs's coat was tore, he was going away, and Williams said, d-n your eyes, stop, you shall not go out, and cried out, where is the poker; Toombs then got out, and fetched a watchman; two watchmen came up, either watchmen or patrols, and upon their coming up, there was a general scuffle among the society belonging to the club, beating the watchmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110063"/>Q. Was Williams concerned in that fighting? - A. I cannot tell; I was shoved from the top of the stairs to pretty near the bottom; before I could get to the door, I heard either a pot or a poker rattling down stairs, and a great number of them coming down stairs; I went and stood in the middle of the road, in the centre of the door; I saw some patrols come running down; they proceeded towards the watch-house; I saw a great number of the society, that was at the club, come out afterwards; I saw Ryan, Williams, and Dunn, particularly, come out; they came out all of a shutter and confusion, they got into the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Williams dressed? - A. He had a light coloured jacket on; then they missed one of the society, whose name was Goldsmith; the landlord had shut the door, and there was an outcry among the mob, where is Goldsmith; somebody cried out, they had fastened him in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that said so from the mob? - A. No; then I saw Ryan, Williams, and Dunn, go and lift the window up next the door; I saw them get in at the window, and come out again at the door; one of them said, he was not in the house, but I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else go into the house besides these three? - A. No; then one of the mob said, that Goldsmith was taken to the watch-house; then I saw Ryan, Williams, and Dunn, crying out, d-n their eyes, we will have him out again, if he is at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Who was it that made use of that expression? - A. I cannot tell; but it was one of the society belonging to the club; I then left the middle of the road and went on to the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them then? - A. They went towards the watch-house, Williams was one of them; I went to the watch-house, and stood opposite the watch-house door, as near the pavement as; could get; I did not see any body go into the watch house, but I saw three men come our of the watch-house, Williams, Ryan, and Dunn; Dunn had a knife in his hand, he appeared to be wiping blood off it, as it seemed to me; Williams was quite close along-side of him, and Ryan too; when they first came out of the watch-house, they pursued a man up White-horse-court, but whether they caught him or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Before they pursued the man up Whitehorse-court, did Dunn make use of any expression? - A. Yes; he said, d-n my eyes, I have done it, I have done it, and whiped the knife on his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular noise at this time? - A. After they came out of White-horse-court, they gave three huzzas, and the greatest part of the society joined them in hazzas, three times, as they went down Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see Williams there? - A. Yes, but with no weapon that I saw, Dunn had a knife in his hand; then they went as far as the corner of Peter-street, where there was a watchman ringing his rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams with them at that time? - A. He was; then Ryan and Dunn knocked down the watchman, and Ryan took his stick from him, beat him with his own weapon, and then took it away; Williams was there at that time; they then went down Peter-street, and up Turnstile, and there Samuel Russel called out Thomas Williams by name; then Williams called out, d-n your eyes, what do you mention names for; then Russel said, I will not call you by your name any more; then they went up to Hatton-garden, and down Hatton garden, till they got into Holborn, and then they turned different ways, and I went up Hatton-garden home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were a witness upon the trials of Dunn, Arnold, and Ryan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the same evidence against Ryan then that you have done now? - A. Yes, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. And, notwithstanding that, Ryan was acquitted, was he not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn before Mr. Floud? - A. Yes, and I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was that? - A.Between twelve and one in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from Williams when you were examined by Mr. Floud? - A.Nearer to him then I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Floud reading over to you the printed trial? - A.Without a doubt it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it was? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not read it to you as your evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In which you had sworn positively you had seen Williams? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you not positively swear that you did not know Williams? - A. No, I did not; if I did, I was in liquor; I said it might be the man, but I could not call him to my recollection, being in liquor; but I had since perfectly recollected that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you did not tell the Justice you could not recollect, because you were in liquor? - A. I told him I did not know whether it was the man or not, till I recollected myself, and got sober; I was quite in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you were so much in liquor that you did not know what was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110064"/>on? - A. I did not know what was going on; I have recollected myself since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember swearing that you did not know that he was the man? - A. I swore he might be the man, but I could not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him since? - A. No, only riding in the coach with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have been in prison then? - A. Yes, nineteen weeks in all, before and now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the trial read to you since you have been in jail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Rittson the constable? - A. No.(Rittson called into Court.)</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No, that is not the man that read the trial to me; he asked me if he should read it over to me again, and I said, no, I don't want to hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Williams was in a jacket, you are sure? - A. Yes, to the best of my rememberance.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in a rough drab great coat? - A. No, it was a jacket, not so long as my coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.From the time of this affair, till he was taken up, had you ever seen Williams? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - A. Yes, perfectly well before that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any other person of the name of Thomas Williams belonging to the club? - A. Not that I ever heard of; I had often seen him at the Compasses where I resorted; when I was apprehended, I gave a description of him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you sober the whole of that evening at the Sun? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your name in November 1796? - A.Cooke; I lived at Mr. Daniel's, the Red-lion, White-horse Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Sun public-house in Cow-cross? - A. About forty yards; about eight or nine, on the 10th of November, 1796, the first that I saw of it, was loomb's coming up Whitehorse Alley; he said he had been robbed at the Sun public-house; I went in again; I had not been in two minutes before I heard the cry of the murder; I went our again, and went to go down he alley, and the mob pushed me before them right into the watch-house; inside the door of the watch-house, there were six or seven in the watch-house, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; I have some knowledge of his face, being in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe in the watch-house? - A. I did not see any thing in the prisoners hand in the watch-house; the first that I saw was Deputy, with a knife in his hand, he said, d-n his eyes, he had done him; Deputy and I came out of the watch-house together, and he took the skin off my ancle.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by taking the skin of your ancle? - A. He crossed his legs to throw me down; somebody called out in the street, mind the woman; he said he did not want the woman, he wanted the man; when, I went home, I met the watchman, Joseph Hobart, I asked him to turn back, and he would not; he had not gone many yards before he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe who it was that knocked Hobart down. - A. I think it was Ryan; I lodged at Mr. Daniel's; I went to Mrs. Lewis's and found Mr. Brewer all in blood there; I said, Mr. Brewer, I am afraid you are killed; he said, I am afraid I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing farther? - A. No. farther than the mob giving three cheers in the street when they had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the persons of those who gave the three cheers? - A. No; there were so many of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What line of life might you have been in at that time? - A. A widow woman; I went out washing for my living at gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem pretty well acquainted with the names of these men? - A. Only from the names they gave themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you had no other knowledge of their names than while you were in the watch-house? - A. No; I never saw them till I saw them in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a considerable confusion in the watch-house, was there not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark night, was it not? - A. No; it was a moonlight night, and plenty of light.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into the watch-house, curiosity, I suppose? - A. No; curiosity brought me out, but I was forced by the mob into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, for granted, you went next day and told the magistrate their names? - A. No; not for a week after, and then I was fetched, and obliged to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own regard for public justice did not lead you to do it? - A. There was too bad an ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110065"/>cident in the house for me to go out and leave the house; my master got cut the same night, by my going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you gave evidence upon the former trial say, you knew Williams? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know what the oath was, that you took, to tell the whole truth? - A. Yes; and I have told the truth; I was not asked any thing about Williams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach. Q. You were asked only about those at the bar? - A. No, I was not asked any questions about Williams, nor Ryan, only about Deputy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say you are quite sure that he is the person that was in the watch-house, or only believe it? - A. I believe he is the person, I am most sure of it, I am sure of his face, his face is not altered the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to repeat that to me, that you are quite sure of it? - A. Yes; I can say that I am quite sure of it, with a safe conscience.</p>
               <p>Q. After being cautioned? - A. Yes, I was very cautious before I came here.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have you ever seen him before? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Nor you have not seen him since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only opportunity you had of observing him was in the watch-house? - A. Yes, and there was plenty of light there.</p>

            , sworn. - I lived at No. 15, Cow-cross, in Nov. 1796, next door but one to the watch-house. On the 10th of Nov. I was in my own house, shut up, I heard a great noise, and I went out into the middle of the road and saw a man at the tap of the Sun public house; I went to the watch-house door; Mr. Brewer was leaning over the half-hatch, and I told him of it; I then saw three men come up to the door, I thought it had been two patroles coming to bring a charge, but when they came nigher, I saw one of them had a knife in his hand; upon that they all three rushed into the watch-house; I heard a noise, but saw nothing, one of my friends then took me away home; I afterwards went out again, in about a minute, and said I must go and see what they have done; when I came to the watch-house door, I saw Mr. Brewer, standing by the watch-house door, covered with blood running down him, but before I had time to speak to him, twenty or more came up; I heard one of them say d-n my eyes, we will have him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the three joined them at that time, or were they separate? - A. I cannot say upon that, they all rushed into the watch-house; then I went into my own home and saw nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish any one person, I believe? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. RAMSDEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a surgeon; I saw Mr. Brewer at St. Baribolomew's-hospital; he had received some wounds, one on the sore part of the top of his head, a second on the left side of his face, and a third wound, which I cannot, at this distance of time, describe exactly, but I believe it was somewhere about the shoulder-blade.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you attend him? - A. We had a consultation on the case on the Saturday, and I think he died in the course of that night or Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. From his appearance, what do you suppose to be the cause of his death? - A.Those wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. He died in the Hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the City of London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any personal knowledge that St. Bartholomew's-hospital is in the City of London? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. With what kind of instrument did this wound appear to have been given? - A. Some sharp cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they such, as a knife would occasion? - A. They were.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Leach.

               <p>Q. You took him, at length, to the Public-office, Worship-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. A gentleman charged him with the assault, upon which you had him taken up, and the next morning the same gentleman said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110066"/>had been punished enough by being confined all night, and he was dismissed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was discovered that he stood indicted? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. In November, 1796, I was a watchman of St. Sepulchre's, I was called into the Sun public-house.</p>

               <p>Q. The riot commenced by your endeavouring to take Dunn into custody? - A. Toombs came down first, and said, he had been ill used; I said to Dunn, have you done any thing with the man's property; and I had not said half a word, before Dunn knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no warrant? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. Eight or nine years; he is a good-natured, friendly man, and I have seen instances of his forbearance; I never had any reason to suppose him a man of a blood-thirsty or revengeful disposition.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine other witnesses, who gave, him the character of a humane, peaceable man, and several of whom deposed that he had worked on his mother's premises from the time of the accident till he was apprehended.</p>

               <p>It appeared in evidence that the watch had been left by the prosecutor in a returned post-chaise drove by the prisoner; that the prosecutor had offered a reward of two guineas for the return of it, which was paid to the prisoner, and the watch delivered up; that the prosecutor afterwards applied to the prisoner to get back his two guineas, but finding he could not, he preferred this bill of indictment. The Court were therefore of opinion, that, under these circumstances, the prosecutor had, by his own conduct, assented that it was no felony, and therefore directed the Jury to find a verdict of</p>

               <p>Q. Did the situation, in which he was, command a view of the shop? - A. Yes; I delivered the sixpence into the hands of Jones in the shop; he remained in the shop while I fetched it; I did not see Powell at that time; then he went out, and in two or three minutes both of them returned; there was then nobody in the shop but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they able, from the outside, to observe whether there were more persons in the shop than one? - A. I do not think they could; Jones asked to look at some gold rings, the smallest we had; then I pulled out the fancy-ring drawer; they said, they were not the kind they wanted; then I put in the drawer immediately, and shewed them the other plain gold wedding-rings, which I shewed them on the block; then Jones bought one of them for 4s. and paid for it; he then asked to look at some gold seals, which we kept in a drawer; I shewed them some gold seals; they did not like them; and then they enquired after silver seals, and we had not any; then they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were serving these people, was there any other person in the shop but yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you served any body before with rings? - A. No, never with these kind of rings; my bro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110068"/>ther John came down in about two or three minutes, and missed the rings.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not accustomed to serve in the shop? - A. No. On Saturday, the 13th, they came again; Jones came in about half past seven in the morning, and asked me if I would take some halfpence for silver; he then stepped to the door, and called Powell in; there was nobody in the shop but me; he asked for gold seals.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you take any halfpence? - A. No; Powell was looking at some gold seals, and Jones was counting out the halfpence; afterwards Powell went all round the shop, and looked towards the parlour, as if he wanted to see if there was any body there; then presently my brother came out, and shut the street-door, so that they could not get away, and they were taken; we never found the rings or seals again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Powell.) Q.Jones came on one of the days, the 10th, by himself? - A. He came in first, and called Powell in; he was in the shop about two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Webb? - A. At the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been present either when you or your brother, or any body else, had taken an account of the goods in the shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know how many rings there were in the shew-glass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who served in the shop the whole of the 9th of July? - A. I served nobody but them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many customers came in that day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not shew any body else any rings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served in the shop besides yourself that day? - A. Mr. Essex; my brother was very ill in bed that day; Mr. Essex served in the shop on the 10th.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On the 10th of July, about a quarter before eight, or thereabout, I came into the shop, and saw some money lie upon the back counter, it was 4s.; he told me what had passed, and I immediately looked at the block of gold rings; I had not seen it for two or three days, for I had been confined to my bed; I compared the rings with the entry-book, which is here; we enter them in the book, and tick them off when they are sold; I missed eight rings, one sold, and seven that were stolen; and then looked at the seal drawer, and I examined the entry-book, and compared them, and found two missing; I had not taken any particular notice of the seal drawer before; the block of rings was full two or three days before, excepting four; it holds forty-eight; I communicated this to Mr. Essex, and, in consequence of his directions, I watched for these people again three mornings successively. On Saturday, the 13th, they did return again between seven and eight in the morning; my brother was in the shop; I was in the parlour; I rung the bell for Mr. Webb to come down and assist me; I saw Powell come round and look into the parlour; he looked over the curtain at the parlour window; I did not think he saw me, but he appeared very uneasy; then I went out to the passage door, and went round and shut the street door, and secured them within; I locked the street door, and I had provided myself with a pistol in case of resistance; I came up immediately, and laid hold of Jones, with a pistol in my hand; he wanted to know what I was about; I told him I knew perfectly well what I was about, and he knew perfectly well too; Jones made no resistance at all; he did not attempt to go away; Powell did resist; Mr. Webb was with me, and had a pistol also, and I told him, if he made any further resistance, I should certainly be under the necessity of discharging my pistol; he had endeavoured to wrench the pistol out of Mr. Webb's hand; I threatened him, and then he submitted.</p>

               <p>Q. You never found the seals nor the rings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is your's a shop of considerable business? - A. Pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been ill at this time? - A. Yes; I believe I was three days that I had not been in the shop; I had been in the parlour by the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the custody of the things in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were ill, were you present when an account was taken of the things in the shop? - A.Within a month before I had made an inventory of all the articles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a time when the town is pretty full? - A. No; it is a time when the town is pretty thin.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, in the course of that month, a great number of customers must have been in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose half a dozen, upon the average, per day? - A. Yes; I dare say there were that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you satisfy the Jury, whether the articles might not have be sold or lost from your shop in the course of that month? - A. The rings were there three days prior; the seals I am not so positive of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you speak of the number of rings that were on the block three days before from recollection of the number, or do you compare them with any entry? - A. From recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you number the vacancies upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110069"/>block, occasioned by so many being off the block? - A. The vacancies are always left at one corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that that is the practice of every body else? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect whether you were in the shop on the 9th? - A. Yes, I might, just to see that things were right; I examined, and found deficient eight rings and two seals; one of the rings was accounted for as being sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one accounted for in the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the practice of your shop to enter these articles as they are sold? - A. Yes, in the entrybook, when they are sold; and in the course of time, when we can get an opportunity, we tick them off in the stock-book; I directed that these people should he watched, and I actually watched myself two mornings; I went up every day as much as I could, while

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your wife and the prisoner have been on good terms, I believe? - A. I believe they have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe your wife might have given her property? - A. How is it possible for me to believe what I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you not really suspect that your wife gave it to her? - A. I should have a very indifferent opinion of my wife if I thought so; she was a good woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen her with these things that you have charged her with taking; how many times has she shewn it you? - A. She has not shewn it to me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not spoke to you about the persons that she should employ to make it up into a gown? - A. No; nothing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You have visited her frequently, have not you? - A. No, I did not know where to find her.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there has been a little bit of cookery in this business; do you know any one of the witnesses, who has been prompting the others what to say; have they not been instructing each other what to say? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. You and this lady at the bar were not upon very sociable good terms; did you never endeavour to win the lady over to become Mrs. Henbethel the second? - A. I have been a dying man these four years.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know if you have not been a dying swain, as well as a dying man? - A. I have had the asthma four years, the yellow jaundice twice, and the dropsy once.</p>
               <p>Q. I fancy you wanted to get this lady's yellow coin; have you not now been endeavouring to win over this lady's affections? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor her sister's, in case she should not consent? - A. Her sister I have a respect for, and had before my wife died; she is about my own age; I felt myself very awkward as a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. So do I; and you wished to change your condition? - A. Not with her; she had the yellow jaundice too.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I think there could not be a better couple come together; you would be a better match for each other? - </p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you robbed after your wife's death? - A. I missed it the very same night; I had seen the silk in the box after she died.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it your wife died? - A. I think it was the 16th; I told the prisoner I wished she would go with me to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. For what? - A. To be searched.</p>

             sworn. I lodge in the prosecutor's house; I take in washing; the prisoner at the bar washed some silk, and asked me to take it to be mangled; it was a raven grey, or a black, I am not sure which; she said she would go with me, and turn the mangle for me, and I did; it was on a Saturday morning; I cannot tell what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after the death of the prosecutor's wife? - A. Yes; she said it was some silk that she had given her by a lady she lived with; I cannot tell whether it was this silk that she said she had given her, or whether it was some silk that she had to make up a gown; after it was mangled, she said, Mrs. Badham, I believe I have not got all my silk; she counted it, and, I think, there were either twelve or thirteen breadths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had you known her before? - A. I have seen her once or twice; Mrs. Henbethel always told me she was her niece.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you she had it from a lady that she had lived with; had it not the appearance of having been part of a court dress? - A. No, I did not take any notice of it; she told me she had given the silk to her aunt to take care of for her, and that she was to have a petticoat off of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner lived in the prosecutor's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she gave it to you, publicly, in the prosecutor's house, for the purpose of being mangled? - A. Yes, but not in the presence of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make any secret at all of it? - A. Not the least in life.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I lodge at the prosecutor's house; all I know about the silk is, Mr. Henbethel came to me with a bundle of silk, and said -</p>

             sworn. I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; on Saturday, the 20th of July, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to me, at the Marlborough's Head, in Malborough-street, and gave me charge of her for robbing him of silk and watch chains; the prisoner had a large bundle in her custody, tied up in an apron; I took the bundle from her, and searched it, and found this piece of silk (producing it); the prosecutor said it was his property; I asked her where she got the silk; and she said, she got it from the silkdyer's; I said it would be material for her to send for the silk-dyer, as that would be of great use to her before the Magistrate; then she said she had the silk from some place in the country; I then searched her pocket, and found two steel watch-chains; the prosecutor said they were both his; she said, no, only the small one; I then asked her where she lodged; and she said she had had no lodging for two or three nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you recollect her saying she had it from her mistress, in a place that she lived in the country? - A. I do not recollect that; I know she said she had it from some county in England, I forgot what.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner before? - A. No; nor the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever present when any conversation has been had with the prosecutor, or any friends of his, to endeavour to settle this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear, either from the prosecutor or the prisoner, that the prosecutor had sent friends to settle it? - A. I heard the prosecutor say, he had got a letter to compound it; indeed I have seen the letter myself; that was, I think, on Friday last, since we have been at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether that is the same silk that belonged to your wife? - A. She had a great deal of silk in her box; but I can swear that this is the silk, I saw it three times in the box after my wife's death.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be the silk that was in your wife's box; - suppose I had produced that piece of silk at York, could you have sworn that that was the piece of silk that came out of your wife's box? - A. No, by no means; it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that this is the same silk? - A.Because I saw it three times in my wife's box.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the chains? - A. These chains were in the same box; one of them I know perfectly well, for I had worn it fourteen years; I had put it by because it was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these seals upon them at the time you lost them? - A. They were not on them, but they were in the same box, lying in the same paper, I had put them by; I am not such a buck as I was fourteen years ago, I wear a piece of ribbon now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did your wife keep her box locked up? - A. Yes, to a certainty, for I myself tried that.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before your wife's death had you seen the chains? - A. A very short time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110071"/>Q. Where was the key of the box kept? - A. In a private place, where my wife and I knew where to find it.</p>

I observed one particular blow, which did not seem to affect the man much, it made him stagger; Lyne was first down; Lyne said, do not strike me when I am down; Houghton answered, I will not; Lyne then got up again, and they had another round; Lyne was driven into a corner, in a leaning position, that he could not well move, rather inclining to fall; he said, Bruce, I have got the rheumatism, I cannot strike; Bruce went to part them, and said, come, come, here is enough of this, put on your coat again; they parted, and the man went to the bench, and statted the heads of some nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they part friendly then? - A. Yes, quite so; I thought the deceased had the best of it; he took the nails and went into the next house, where his work lay; about five or six minutes after that, it could not exceed ten minutes, some person came to me, and said, your partner is very ill; I went to him, and spoke to him, but he made no answer, he seemed to be quite ill; and I took him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after that? - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>

I live in the house with Mr. Gunnell, as part of his family; there was one servant at home with me; I had been up stairs about one o'clock in the day, on coming down, I heard some glass shake on the side-board, in the front parlour; I then went to examine the parlour and saw a man looking over the rails; there were blinds to the window, and they were open; I went into the parlour and saw a man standing in the parlour; I had never seen him before, but I am sure I should know him again; the prisoner Hill, is the man; I asked him what he wanted there; he said, is the gentleman of the house at home; I asked him what he wanted with the gentleman; I do not recollect that he made me any answer; I turned round to look at the side-board and missed some spoons; I had put the spoons there myself in the morning; two table spoons, and two salt spoons, and the servant had put one tea spoon, which I saw there; the sash was opened, and the man at the rails called to the man in the room, and told him to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash open before, do you know? - A. I rather think it was; I then let him pass me, and I let him out at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not offer any violence to you? - A. No; there was a butcher just by the window; I desired him to stop the man; he was brought back again in about a quarter of an hour; two men were brought back, but I only knew one of them, that was the man that was in the parlour, Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - A. Not in my presence; I saw all the spoons at the Magistrates about a week after</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Hill.) Q. This man was a perfect stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been in the parlour; about a minute perhaps? - A. I should think it must be more.</p>
               <p>Q. And from this momentary observation will you venture to swear that he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>

            , sworn. - I am a butcher; as I sat in my own counting-house, I saw a man get in at Mr. Gunnell's window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the window before? - A. No; I live facing the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of railing was there before the window? - A. A wooden railing; plain at the top, without any spikes; after the man was gone in at the window, I immediately saw Champness cross the street; I have known him many years before; he leaned with his arm upon the rails, while the other got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know enough of the room, to say, whether a person standing at the window could see into the room? - A. Yes; all over the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Champness or the other man, before he got in at the window? - A. I saw Champness (it might be eight or ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before, I believe) with the other man, for there had been an alarm before; in consequence of that, knowing Champness, I looked out, and saw Hill get in at the window, and Champness standing against a wall opposite, belonging to Doctor Swaby; I then ordered my man to go and assist, that my neighbours might not be robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not know any thing of Hill before this day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long might you have seen him on that day? - A. I never saw him in my life, to my knowledge; I did not see his face then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of either of them before? - A. I had seen Hill before, I did not know Champness; he was then standing at the rails; that is the man (pointing to him); Hill came out at the door just as I got to the house, he was in a snuff coloured coat, that is the man; Champness moved from the rails when Hill came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How near together did they walk down the street? - A.Within a few yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they speak to each other? - A. That I cannot say; I followed them; Mr. Wilkinson took hold of Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body take hold of Champness? - A. Yes, Mr. Wilkinson, and let Hill go in consequence of a blow he received from Champness; I took hold of Hill, and held him till I got some assistance, and brought him back to Mr. Gunnell's house; in running after Hill, I left them taking care of Champness; as I was going after Hill, I saw him throw some property away; I was within a few yards of him in Bennet's-yard, going out of Tuston-street; he chucked it over some palings; I did not see what it was that he threw away; I went back to look after the property, and could not find it; in about half an hour, or less, Mrs. Sherry brought some property to Queen-square; I cannot say what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have told my Lord, that you saw Hill throw away something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the same story? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the prosecutor's house? - A. About a quarter of a mile, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not lose fight of him? - A. Yes, just where he turned the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. She was not out of your fight at all before she brought in? - A. No, she was not; she gave it to me, and I gave it to her again; I looked to the top of the yard, and heard a man cry out, help; I thought it was but a joke; I went up the yard, and met Finch, coming down; he had left the prisoner, Hill, at the top of the yard, with the constable, and asked my wife for the spoon, and gave it to Finch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken such notice of the spoon as to say, that the spoon your wife gave you, was the same you had given her? - A. I dare say it was, but I took no particular notice of it.</p>

             sworn. - I live next door to Mr. Gunnell's; I was coming up College-street, about one o'clock, and saw Champness waiting at the rails before Mr. Gunnell's house; I am certain he is the man; I never saw him before; then I saw Hill come out, and they came down the street together, and past me; I never saw either of them before; I am sure Hill is the same man; as soon as Hill came out, he joined Champness, and they walked down the street together; I saw them afterwards brought back and put into a coach; I am certain they were the same persons.</p>
               <p>Mrs. SHERRY sworn. - I am a widow, and carry on the business of a carpenter, in Marsham-street, Westminster; my back door opens into Bennett's-yard; my people knocked at that door to come in after they had dined; I shut the gate immediately, and, as I shut the gate, I saw a man in the yard; he had got over the pales; that was Finch, looking for something; I assisted him in looking, but we could see nothing; I let him out at the door, and, as I returned back again, at the corner of the saw-pit, there was a piece of quartering laid; and between that and the fill of the door, I saw two spoons lay; there is a paling in Bennet's yard on the other side of my yard; I picked up the spoons, and gave them to my son; I sent him with them to Mr. Gunnell's; he is not here, but I shall know the spoons again when I see them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stone-mason; about one o'clock, on the last day of last month, I saw the two prisoners running, and Finch after them; I laid hold of Hill; as soon as I laid hold of Hill, Champness came up, and gave me a violent blow on the mouth; upon that I was obliged to let him go; as soon as I had recovered myself, I turned round to Champness, and secured him, and delivered him up to a person of the name of Lussman; I then went after Hill again, and took him; while I had hold of him, Finch gave me these two spoons.(Produces a tea spoon and a salt spoon).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Finch gave you these spoons? - A. I am positive of it; I took Hill to Mr. Gunnell's and from there to Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Finch). Did you give the last witness the spoons? - A. I cannot say whether I did or not in my slurry; I recollect seeing a small salt spoon under Hill's feet; I believe I picked it up, but I cannot recollect; I had two spoons that the carpenter picked up, and I gave them to him again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gennell. I came home about one o'clock, just before the prisoners were brought back; they were brought back to my house, and I think five spoons shewn me, I knew them to be mine; Mrs. Sherry has two table-spoons to produce.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sherry. I received them at the Police-office, I am sure they are the same spoons that I found in my yard. (The property was all produced and deposed to by Mr. Gunnell and Miss Crucifix).</p>
               <p>Champness's defence. I had been very ill treated by some watermen; I ran away from them, and made down College-street, when these people laid hold of me, and said, I was concerned in robbing the house.</p>
               <p>Hill's defence. I was coming through College-street, and saw a number of people, and enquired what was the matter; they told me, there had been a house robbed; when I heard that, I went away about my business, and they followed me, and took me and Champness to Queen-square office.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the yard was it in? - A. Not nigh where the other was; I told him, I lost two last week, and you are likely enough to be the man; he offered to pay me for it; I told him that would not do; he had got plenty of money in his pocket; he had got gold and silver, but I would not take any. Mr. Mason, the officer, happened to come by, and I gave him charge of him; he took him to the office; the prisoner told me he lived in Hackney-road, but we found out that he lived in Castle-street, at the back of Shoreditch church.</p>

                        targets="t17990911-40-off206 t17990911-40-crimeloc208"/>, there was a great bustle about the Grey-hound door or the King's-head, I am not certain which; the prosecutor saw me, and pointed out the prisoner to me; I took him into the house and searched him; I found upon him these two pocket-books, or purses; the prosecutor then claimed this property in the presence of the prisoner; when I opened it, there was nothing at all in it, but just as it is now; I searched him again, and in his breeches-pocket I found a half-guinea, five shillings and sixpence in silver, and three halfpence; the prosecutor gave me a strict charge of him as the man that had robbed him, and I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTUS RONI sworn. - I am the son of a merchant: On Friday, the last day of the fair, I was walking with a friend in the fair, and in a little time we happened to be in a very great croud; I perceived that the man at the bar was facing me, and squeezing me very hard in the croud.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. A Frenchman; I felt at the same instant a very great rubbing against my waistcoat, which made me, as soon as I came out of the croud, put my hand directly in my pocket, and I perceived that it had been picked, and I immediately told my friend of it; I met with some constables, related how it was, and begged of them to watch the man; I saw Lawrence take the man up, I pointed him out; and then we all went into a public-house, my friend, myself, the constable, and the prisoner; I then said to the constable, if this is the man that has robbed me, you will find a little red purse, containing a half-guinea, a shilling, and a sixpence, the prisoner was present; Lawrence then searched him, and found in his pocket a leather purse, and opened it directly, but no money was found in it; then he searched in another pocket and found some money; among the money was half-a-guinea, a shilling, and a sixpence, and there were two or three shillings besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular mark about the half-guinea, or the shilling, or the sixpence, by which you can particularly speak to it? - A.Not any; the purse I am as positive of as I am that I now stand here, but there being no particular mark to it I cannot swear to it; at the same time, I have every reason to believe, and have not the smallest doubt in my own mind, that it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the same man that pressed you so much? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you been in this country? - A.This voyage, three months.</p>
               <p>Q.How many times have you have been in England. - A. Only twice.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you have been in England, you have seen purses of the same sort? - A. I have, in the shops.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, there is no mark at all upon this purse by which you are able to identify it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was not found in the purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And none of the money had any mark by which you could speak to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that squeezed you was parted from you for five minutes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is possible that, in the course of that five minutes, any body might have given him that purse? - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you carry your purse? - A.In my waistcoat-pocket.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Lawrence.) Where was it you found the money? - A. In the breeches-pocket; I cannot recollect whether the purse was taken from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110078"/>breeches or the waistcoat-pocket, I rather think it was the waistcoat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Roni.) You have sworn to the person of the prisoner; was it pretty light? - A. Yes; I know him by his size, his face, and his clothes; I am sure the prisoner is the man that squeezed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that that windows was safe when you went to bed? - A. I am very sensible of it.</p>


               <p>Q. Would that enable any persons who were so disposed to get into the house? - A. Yes; I immediately went in and looked at the bar; the first thing I missed from the bar was a breast of veal, and next my till, containing half-pence, penny-pieces and farthings; I suppose there might be pounds worth in it; I then missed two kegs of liquor, marked Booth, (meaning Mr. Booth of Cowcross) branded upon the keg, and my name in chalk; they contained three gallons of anniseed and three gallons of peppermint, and I missed a case bottle of rum; I saw the kegs and the case bottle at Shadwell-office; here is one of the screws that fastened the shutter, which I found in the morning broke.

               <p>Q. Therefore for any thing you know to the contrary, Robus might not have been one of the persons who were originally at your house? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been certain to the person of Robus? - A. I did not recollect him at first, but when I saw him again I recollected him.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first before the Justice? - A. It is about six weeks ago, I believe, now.</p>
               <p>Q.This offence happened in May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the first time you were at the Justice's you did not recollect the person of Robus? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Robus did not go up stairs with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But having transacted up stairs what they thought sit, they came down, and he went away with them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. You have known Mellish formerly, and known his character? - A. I have known him ever since he was a baby; we were children at play together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his way of life was? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he has been tried here for a felony? - A. No; he was taken up, I know.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever heard him make any declaration with respect to the prisoner Robertson? - A.Robertson is the father of my child. The witness had a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever heard Mellish say what he would do to Robertson? - A. I have known him to owe him a spite and a malice; I have heard him say, that he would do any thing to him almost that he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Have you any reason to believe that your sister or your brother bore him any spite? - A. No.</p>
               <p>BARBARA STAR sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Robertson? - A. I know the person that came with Mellish.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the Court, and see it you can see him? - A.(Points to him.) That is him, I had seen Mellish five or six times before. Some time about the middle of May, at the end of the week, Mellish came in, and Robertson very soon after him; in about three or four minutes, he said he had some cordial to dispose of, and wanted to know if I would have it for my own use; Robertson was then present; it was in two small kegs, the one contained anniseed, and the other peppermint; each of the kegs was about half full; Mellish had passed himself upon me for a cloathsman; I bought an apron of him, and some other things. Some Police officers came to my house, and I delivered to them one of the same kegs; I believe the other had sell to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of George Pauling? - A. Yes; he is here; he was present at the time; he lives in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Robus upon that occasion? - A. I did not see any other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.What sort of a shop do you keep? - A. A sale shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Cloaths are the only articles, I take it for granted, that you deal in? - A.In respect to wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q.Spirituous liquors are rather out of your line? - A. Yes, but knowing the man, I did not scruple to buy them; I had known him six months.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him, when he was convicted here? - A. No, I never heard of it in all my life; I wish I had.</p>

I know the tall one, Robertson, and I know Mellish; they both came to Mrs. Star's house on the Sunday, the day after Bow-fair; they had got some anniseed and peppermint to dispose of, in two small kegs, marked Booth; I was there when the officers came; I had one of the kegs at my house at Hoxton, and I took it down to the office, according to their desire, the next day; I don't know what became of the other; when they asked me about it, at first, I did not recollect the circumstance.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Recollect, that the life of one or both of these prisoners may depend upon the positiveness with which you speak? - A. I am sure it is my bottle; I know it by the dent at the bottom, and another mark near the top; and it has such a remarkable small neck, that a phial cork sits it, which you will seldom find in a case bottle; I had had it eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, have you any doubt that this is your bottle? - A. I have not; I have many a time cursed the bottle when I have been mixing liquor, that it did not run fast enough, the neck was so small; I cannot swear to the keg; they had both of them the same mark that this has.(Mr. Fitzpatrick produced the file of the Sessions of February, 1797).</p>

             sworn. - I live in Church-street, St. Leonard, Shoreditch; I keep a broker's shop, I know the prisoner Jennings, she came to me in June, I cannot tell the day, it was in the afternoon; she came to me with a swing-glass, a feather-bolster, and a pillow-bier, with a very few feathers in it; she brought them to me for sale; I have known her many years, living in the neighbourhood; I have furnished rooms for her mother; she came to sell these things; I asked her if they were her own, she said they were; she desired I would give her as much as I could for them as she was in a great deal of distress; I bought them all of her at the same time; I gave her a separate price for each article, altogether nine shillings; she seemed dissatisfied with the price, and I told her, I had rather she would take them some where else, for I had offered her more than they were worth; she went away a few yards from the door, and in three or four minutes came back, and asked me to give her six-pence more for them; I told her, I could not, and then she took the nine shillings; I had them nigh upon a week for sale at the door; I sold the bolster some days after; Mr. Harper came to our house and enquired after these articles, I delivered them to Mr. Harper; after that I recollected that I had bought a pillow-case of the same person, and I went up stairs to look for it and found it in the feather-room; I believe it is the same, but I am not sure, for my man carried it up, and he has had the care of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the Police-office in Worship-street.(Produces a glass and pillow.) On the 18th of June, of a Tuesday, in consequence of an information, I took the prisoner York, into custody in Saunders's gardens, Kingsland-road; I took him in custody, and I took him to the office, the prosecutrix appeared against him, and he was committed for further examination. Some few days afterwards he was brought up and committed again for further examination, the goods not being then found; when he came up for the third examination, I found out where the father of the prisoner Jennings lived, and I found her near Gun-street; and in consequence of her directions I found some property at Mr. Cotton's, a pawnbroker, in Shoreditch, and at Mr. Francis's a pawnbroker in Shoreditch; Armstrong and I went to Mitchell's first with a search-warrant; I saw Armstrong find this pillow, and this glass (produces them); they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

            , on the 14th of June for ten shillings; I had served her many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner York? - A. He was not with her.(The property was deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>York's defence. I have used the sea the greatest part of my life, and upon my return home last September in the Glatton, I came on shore among my friends, at the Three Neats Tongues, in Shoreditch; a man that draws beer there asked me if I wanted a girl, and he brought me this young woman; she took me to this room, and I staid there with her a day or two, till my money was expended, and I was backwards and forwards with this young woman several times, and then I left her; the prosecutor wanted me to give her three guineas, and Harper said I had better give her the three guineas, or it would be worse for me, and I should be in jail so long.</p>
               <p>Jennings's defence. I have lived with this man above twelve months; I was on board a ship with him and he used me very ill and I left him, and he came back and said, if I would live with him he would not use me so any more, and he used me very ill indeed; he took out a knife and swore he would stab me if I did not take these things away; I told him they were not ours, and he must not, but he wrapped the sheets round his body and took them away with him.</p>
               <p>Harper. As to making up the business with the prosecutor, I deny it upon my oath.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jennings, called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I was in the hayfield at labour for Mr. King, between two and three o'clock in the day, about half a mile from Mr. Miller's; Mr. King was upon his horse in the field, and he called out to me, the two women were following him, one of them had a bag, I cannot positively say, whether the two prisoners are the women; the bag contained four chickens, and a little duck; I took them out, and my master stood by me at the time, the other woman had a hay fork in her hand; my master sent me down to Bowes-farm, and several other places, to see if they had lost any.</p>

             sworn. - On the 5th of August, I was in the hay-field, and I saw the two prisoners come along the road; I heard a noise of chickens, and I thought it was a very odd place to hear that noise; I rode up to the gate by the side of the road, and said, good women, what have you got there; they said, nothing at all; I told them, they had; they said they had not; I told them, I insisted upon seeing, for I knew they had; Charlesworth then opened the bag, it was covered up in her apron, and I saw the heads of some chickens; I went into the hay-field and they followed me; I called to Seymour to look what there was in the bag, and he saw the chickens and the duck; I sent them to my house by Seymour, and when he had got a little way he called out, Master, here is a dead hen; I told the women, I would keep them till somebody owned them; I sent Seymour to Bowes'farm; one of them, I think Pritchard, said, she gave three-pence half-penny for them, and that a man chucked the bag into her apron as she sat at breakfast under a hedge, and told her, there was some dinner for her; but I do not remember whether it was at the Justices', or where it was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110085"/>that she said that; that is all I know about the matter.</p>

               <p>Pritchard's defence. We were coming to London between twelve and one in the night, and a man sold them to us for three-pence half-penny; Mrs. Charlesworth gave him the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Charlesworth, called two witnesses, who gave her an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he searched any where else? - A.Not that I know of; he was taken to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q.What time did you arrive in the market? - A.About six o'clock; I supposed I had sold them all; the prisoner asked me if I would have all the geese up; and he told me I had got every thing up when the cart was unloaded; between seven and eight in the morning, the prisoner asked whether I had done with him; he said, if I had done, he would fetch his horse and cart and go home; I told him he might go; then he took hold of a basket that was in the shop, and took it out to the door with him; I asked him what he was going to do with that basket; he said, to carry it to Lime-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any directions to go to Lime-street for any purpose? - A. No; I desired him to leave his basket behind, or it would get lost, while he went for his horse and cart; it was the same basket in which I had brought the sixteen; I then ordered a person to look into the basket, Mr. Clark the poulterer, at Islington, and he searched the basket, it was then outside the door, in Leadenhall-market; when I opened it, I saw two dead geese lying at the bottom of the basket, but I did not touch them.</p>
               <p>Q.Looking at those two geese, will you venture to swear they were your husband's property, and part of the geese you had brought to London? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You opened the basket? - A. Yes; they are baskets made on purpose; it was a square basket, with a lid to it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mr. Clark fasten the basket? - A. No; I went and called another gentleman to see the geese, Mr.

               <p>Q. Had you any geese in your shop that did not belong to your husband? - A.No, I had not; I then ordered a person, of the name of Gregory Seally, to watch him and follow him; he took strait down the passage from Leadenhall-market, to go into Lime-street; I am sure that the geese I saw in the basket, were two of the geese that I had brought from Stratford that morning.</p>

             sworn. - I am fellow-servant with the last witness, at Mr. Seton's, in Parliament-street; I never saw the prisoner before that day; I am certain he is the man. On Monday, the 22d of July last past, about a quarter after nine, I am certain within two minutes, I had been out; on coming to the area, I met a very decent country young man coming up the area steps from my mistress' house; he had a large check bundle under his arm; he came up to the area gate; he had closed it; I pushed the area gate to open it, and he pulled it towards him; it was a sort of bundle that had been very familiar to me, as it always hung up in the pantry that I used, over my box; he asked me if he should shut the area door; I told him, if he pleased; he had pulled the nail out of the wall, and I saw the aprons coming out; I went down the area steps immediately into the kitchen; I had seen it not ten minutes before; I called out to the last witness up stairs, and ran out immediately; I was in the house four or five minutes, I think not more than four; I came out, and ran towards the Horse-guards; I saw nobody; I returned through King-street, and up Little Charles-street into Parliament-street again; I looked up Bridge-street, but saw nobody there; I went on to Palace-yard, and there I saw a man in a grey coat, with just such a bundle; I then gave chace, and overtook him in Parliament-place, by the gate where his Majesty goes in at, which is no thoroughfare; it goes to the water, and then there is nothing but a railing; I stopped him before he got half way down the passage; he said, are these your's, young man? I said, I dare say I could find somebody to own them, and he seemed to be in great agitation, and took him into custody; he had the bundle in his arm at the time I overtook him; they brought him home into the kitchen, at Mrs. Seton's; she opened them before him, and counted them on the dresser; I then sent for a constable, and took him before a Magistrate; I have had them ever since. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, that the man you overtook, was the man you saw coming up the area steps? - A. I cannot say that it was the same person; he was in a different dress, and I certainly cannot say he was the same. (The property was deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was hired by a man to carry them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Agar before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light night? - A. Yes; they hustled me, and Staunton put his hand in my pocket, and upon that Agar knocked off my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the face of the man you call Agar, so plain, at eleven o'clock at night, as to be able to swear to his person? - A. Yes, it was very light, and he was close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps there? - A. I cannot say; then one of the party picked up my hat, and I called out watch; upon that one of the party came up to me, and said, d-n you, if you call out watch again, I will cut your throat from ear to ear; upon the watchman coming up, I put my hand in my waistcoat pocket, and missed the half guinea directly; I am sure I had it within five minutes before I was attacked; the watchman came up, and I pointed out Agar, and told him that was the man that knocked off my hat; I did not see any of the rest then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your half guinea again? - No, as soon as the watchman came they all ran away; there were two of them taken that night, Lewis and Agar; I had seen Staunton the Saturday night before, at the corner of Fleet-market, as I was standing there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out of place? - A. From the 21st of June; I left Mr. Parish, of Ludgate-street, mercer, and I had put into two offices, and attended every day; I lived with Mr. Parish three months; I had not been in any place before that; I had been to the East Indies in the William Pitt, as the surgeon's servant; and, after I came home, I lived with my father at Ramsgate.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to lodge at Mr. Cadwell's? - A. I had lodged there before I went to my place; I had seen Staunton the Saturday night before, at about half past nine, as I was standing talking with a woman that I knew; he came up to me, and said, b-st your eyes, you b-r, what business have you with that woman? it was a person that my father knew when he lived in the Minories; her name is Peggy Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to meet her there? - A. No, I asked her how she did; I met her accidentally; I had not seen her before since I left the Minories, which is about twelve months ago, very nigh, I cannot be quite sure; she was standing at the corner, and another woman at a little distance from her that I did not know; when I asked her how she did, Staunton came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you again, when you asked her how she did? - A. Yes, she said she was very well; I have seen her since that, about five weeks ago in the Strand; I do not know where she lives, I met her accidentally at that time, and have not seen her since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then ask her where she lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you were robbed, and yet you did not ask her where she lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you had been robbed? - A. No; she spoke to me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you did not ask where you could find her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Staunton besides the night you were robbed, and that Saturday night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When Staunton said, b-st your eyes, you b-r, what have you to do with this woman, what did you say? - A.Nothing, but he struck me a violent blow upon the breast; and, when I came to myself, he repeated the blow again.</p>

             see both these blows? - A. Yes, then I got away; when I met her afterwards in the Strand, she said, she hoped I would not hurt Staunton, that was about five weeks after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Staunton had been in custody then about five weeks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you did not ask her where she lived? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Agar or Lewis before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. - Q. You are a servant out of place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you footman at Mr. Parish's? - A. In the morning, I used to open the shop, and clean it out; I did up the breakfast things, attended dinner, and shut up shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your master warning, or he you? - A. I did not like my mistress, Miss Parish, and I gave them warning myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you were so good a servant, that there were no complaints of you? - A. They asked me, whether I liked to stay or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there was a complaint, when you took an hour to go to Fleet-market? - A.There were no complaints of any thing else that I know of; my master used to mention that to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you went to Mr. Parish's, how long was it that you had been returned from India? - A. A twelvemonth last February; my father then kept the Fountain in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is your father in now? - A. I cannot say; my mother keeps a boarding-school; my father has left the Fountain nearly a twelvemonth, as nearly as I can guess; I then went on board the Taunton Castle, and was discharged in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110090"/>the Hope, because I was too slight; I was going before the mast; I was on board her seven or eight days; I then went to my father's, in Queen's-head-lane, Islington, till I went on board the Manship East Indiaman, from December to February; I went in her as far as the Nore, and was discharged because I was too slight; my father was then gone to Ramsgate, and I went to lodge at Mr. Cadwell's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were on board the William Pitt? - A.Three years come April.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - A.Twenty-three next May.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lodged at Mr. Cadwell's from that time to this? - A. No, I am now very badly situated, I am in the workhouse in Gray's-inn-lane, and have been ever since I came out of the hospital, about a fortnight ago; I lodged at Mr. Caldwell's about three weeks after I was robbed, and then I went to lodge at the house of a young fellow that I had known on board the Pitt; from thence I went to the workhouse, from the workhouse to the hospital, and then back to the workhouse again; I went there because I was in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Being in distress, you know there are different ways of relieving one's self; you have perhaps heard of a 40l. reward. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, of course, you have learned arithmetic enough to know, that three forties make 120l.? - A. I don't do it for that-God forbid.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by this half guinea? - A. I had fifteen shillings, a half guinea was lent me by the maid-servant that lives at Mr. Parish's; her name is

               <p>Q. Then you got in for nothing? - A. No, I paid for going in at half price, and I came back with my aunt and my cousin, and one of the performers; I parted with my aunt and my cousin, at their house in Oakley-street, Blackfriars-road, and the other performer left me in Fleet-street, to go to Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went along through Field-lane? - A. Yes, there were two girls behind me.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor you were not in company with them? - A. No further than they spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not answer them? - A. Yes, I spoke to them; they asked me where I was going, and I said I was going home; they asked me if I would go home with them, and I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going from the Circus to the corner of Charles-street, by what strange fatality did you get into Field-lane? - A. I went that for the nighest way.</p>
               <p>Q.Hatton-garden is a pleasant street enough to walk in at eleven o'clock at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not a very dark night, the moon being but two days old? - A. It was quite that starlight, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure it was not after eight in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had those clothes? - A. I pawned my coat to get some tea and sugar, when I was in the Hospital; this is a coat I had from the workhouse, the waistcoat was given me by my young master, and the breeches I bought with my own money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You came away from the Circus with your aunt, your cousin, and one of the performers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell them of the robbery? - A. I believe my brother has; I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>- M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman. On the 1st of July, I heard watch cried; the prosecutor was at the corner of Field-lane, and Chick-lane; I came to his assistance, and he told me, he was robbed of his hat, and half-a-guinea; he pointed out that middle-man (Agar) as the man that took his hat; and he said, he felt one of their hands in his pocket, and he missed half a guinea; then my partner came up, and we both attacked them; there were five or six, if not seven in the gang; Lewis was at a distance, I did not suspect him to be one of the party; they all ran away, I ran after them, but lost sight of them; two of them were stopped and taken to St. Sepulchre's watch house, and from there we took them to Hatton-garden watch-house; when they ran away, they went off in a cluster, with a great laugh.</p>

             sworn. - After calling the hour of eleven at night, on the 1st of July, I saw Gray at the bottom of Chick-lane; he said, he had been robbed of half-a-guinea; there were a number of them standing there, and then they all took to their heels and ran away; two of them, Agar and Lewis, were stopped and taken to St. Sepulchre's watch-house; I went there, and we hand-cuffed them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110091"/>and brought them to our own watch-house; I did not see either the hat or half-guinea, and I really believe, in my heart, that Lewis is as innocent of the affair as the child that is unborn in the womb; I took Staunton the next day at the Castle, facing of Chick-lane.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live with Mr. Parish; I hired Gray for Mr. Parish; he lived with us about three months; I believe he was perfectly honest, but if we sent him out of an errand, it was a matter of great uncertainty when he would come back; he would be half an hour frequently going to Fleet-market, and for that reason he left our house; once he staid out all night without leave; he said he was intoxicated and would not come home, and Mr. Parish forgave him.</p>

Agar and Lewis were brought to our watch-house; Gray charged them with robbing him; I told him to be very particular in what he said; he looked at them a second time and said, he could not swear to them; I did not know that they were to come before this Court till within these few minutes.</p>

No; they number them as they make them, as I understand; I never Knew an instance of two pieces of cloth of the same number; the other things I can swear to, conscientiously, if I cannot legally; I missed them, and was in the constant habit of using them. From the extreme compunction of the prisoner, at the time he was taken (for he was agitated extremely), I have reason to believe it was his first offence; so much so, that it very much hurt me; he has came of a very respectable family, and therefore I wish to recommend him to mercy; he belongs to the most respecable family in the country that he came from.</p>

I said, I belonged to nothing, but I saw what he belonged to; then he began throwing hay over me; he asked me what countryman I was; I said, suppose I came from Newcastle; he kept throwing hay over me, and cried out to the other man, Tom, bring me some more hay.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. I was born at Limerick; he kept throwing the hay over my head, and was like to smother me; I got up and told him to be quiet, I was not disturbing them, and I did not know what right they had to disturb me; then the prisoner knocked me down with his fist; he struck me on the side of my head; I was a little stunned; he then took the handkerchief from my neck, and said, d-n you Tom, take that; I did not resist, because I was afraid they would kill me; the prisoner threw the handkerchief to the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110093"/>man; he then told me to take off my coat; he took hold of the cuff of the right sleeve, and tore it across; he got both my coat and waistcoat off; then he went a yard or two from me to the other man; he took the coat and waistcoat with him, and took every thing that was in the coat out of it, except a small button that was left in the corner of the pocket; there was a pocket-handkerchief, a pair of scissars, and a silver watch; I had put my watch in my coat pocket, because I thought it was safer there than any where else; he also took three shillings, two thimbles, and some half-pence out of my right hand waistcoat pocket; they took also a woman's huslif, that had the duplicate of a watch in it, which I had brought of a man of the name of Downer, who worked at the same place with me; it was pawned at Hill's in Brewer-street; one of them, I cannot say which, threw my coat and waistcoat back to me; the prisoner laughed at me, and said, that would learn me not to come out so soon in the morning again, and then they went away with the property. (Produces the coat torn across the sleve.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively that it was the prisoner who tore that coat? - A. I do. On the 12th of August, I made an affidaved at Marlborough-street, and took out the watch, that the duplicate related to, which I lost. On the Wednesday morning after I had been robbed, I met with the prisoner upon the parade at St. James's, they were both soldiers, and were dressed in the uniform of the light company, the first regiment of Guards; I had been in the Park that same Sunday and Monday morning; on the Wednesday morning, the soldiers passed me once, and when they came up again, I saw the prisoner and knew him immediately; I had two officers with me, Treadway and Mumford; he was taken to Bow-street and searched, but nothing found upon him belonging to me; I first applied to Bow-street, on the Sunday morning, and from there I went to the Park; I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was with you at the Robin-hood? - A. Mr. Johnson, he is here, and the foreman of the shop is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Who do you work for? - A.Messrs. Sitlers and Mathews, in Little Vine-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your pay-table? - A. The Blackhorse, in Swallow-street; I was there about an hour before I got paid.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the other public-house, and leave your comrades? - A. I did not leave them, they went when I did; I drink at the other public-house every night; I left the Robinhood about twelve o'clock, and I did not leave the Black-horse till night eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other lodged in this house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever locked out before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to rap at the door a second time? - A. I had lodged there but a week, and it was a very fine morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You were robbed of three shillings; what money did you receive at the pay-table? - A. One pound five shillings: I had a one pound note, but I cannot swear that I was robbed of it, because I did not see it; and I only speak to that I am certain they did take.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no stile, or ditch to get over, in the fields? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought your watch safer in your coat-pocket than any where else? - A. Yes; I had often done so before.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch you lost was a silver watch with two cases? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of watch was it you got out of pawn? - A. A silver watch with two cases.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not swear before the Magistrate that watch was your own? - A. I swore that I had lost the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Downer here? - A. No; he was an apprentice at the shop I worked at, but he is gone away; he lives at No. 44, Cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it necessary to bring him here to-day? - A. I did not know whether it was or not; and I could not afford to see Council to know what was right.</p>
               <p>Q. These men came up to you when you were upon the ground, and began to throw hay over you? - A. Yes; and they felt all over me to see whether I had any thing in my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you run away? - A. They could run after than me; and I had no thought that they meant to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Not when they felt about your breeches? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, what did you think they meant? - A. I did not take much thought about it till they took my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light? - A. Yes; and they were both dressed in their uniforms.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, was only from the clothes that you knew the man again? - A. Yes, by his face and his speech.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you did not know him till you heard him speak? - A. Yes, I did; but that made me the more certain; I went to the Orderly-room on the Sunday, and they told me to come on Wednesday, for the men would be all out that morning, and if I could see him I was to take him; I went on the Wednesday, and they were marching up to the Queen's guard, at Buckingham-house; he was apprehended in the ranks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110094"/>Q.How many shillings did you receive at the pay-table? - A.Five shillings and four-pence, and I paid my beer score for the week; I had about two shillings in my pocket before I received my pay.</p>
               <p>Q.Court. Q.Perhaps you have heard of such a thing as a reward of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you heard of it before you were robbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When they took away your coat and waistcoat, did you see the things that they took out? A. No; I know I had the watch in my coat-pocket when I came past the Queen and Artichoke to go into the fields.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the name of your friend? - A. One Reeves; I left her about ten minutes before eleven, I believe; I was stooping down to tie my patten tight, it had been a wet night, when somebody came up to me, and gave me a push, and said, what are you doing here; I made no answer, and my bonnet was gone in an instant, I could see no more of her; I could see that she had on a black gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that that woman was the woman at the bar? - A.She lisped, and I saw her afterwards with the bonnet on her head; the watchman advised me to go to the watch house, which I did; and in less than ten minutes afterward, the prisoner was brought in with my bonnet on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the woman that took your bonnet any thing on her head at the time? - A. I cannot say whether she had or not; I know the bonnet by my own work in it, I altered it from what it was when I first bought it; the constable took it into his charge, and has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your bonnet pinned on? - A. No, it was quite loose upon my head, it was gone in a minute; when she came into the watch-house, I said, young woman, that is my bonnet; then she made use of a bad expression, and said d-n your eyes, how came you to say it is your bonnet; I bought it half an hour ago, and gave a shilling for it. I never saw her before; I told her I did not want her locked up, nor to do any thing to her but to have my bonnet; and she said, if she could get me out of the watch-house, she would not leave me while there was a rag to my back.</p>

             sworn. - I was the officer of the night: About half past eleven o'clock the last witness came into the watch-house, and said she had been robbed her bonnet; she told me the woman that robbed her had a black gown on; she said she should know her again if she was to see her; she sat down, and in a few minutes the prisoner came and made a noise at the watch-house door, damning and swearing, and breeding a riot; I desired the patrol to open the door and let her in; I asked her if that was the person that had robbed her, and if that was the bonnet upon her head; she said it was; I asked her if she had known her before; she said she had not; the prisoner said, she had given a woman a shilling for it; I asked her where the woman was, and she did not know any thing about her; in consequence of that, I thought it necessary to take charge of her; I kept her in the watch-house, took her before the Magistrate, and she was committed. (Produces a bonnet).</p>
               <p>Wright. This is my bonnet, I know it by my own work.</p>
               <p>Hadley. This is the bonnet that was upon the prisoner's head; she had a black gown on when she came into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met a woman on the 19th of August, she said she was very much distressed, and I gave her a shilling for this bonnet.</p>

             sworn. - I have been in the public line, but am now in no employ; I lost my watch between eleven and twelve at night, on the 14th of July; I had been at one Mr. Meane's, in Bedfordbury, and was going home to Sommerstown alone; I did not see any body, nor enter into conversation with any body at all; the prisoner stopped me at the top of Drury-lane, and asked me if I would give her any thing to drink; I went with her to a public-house, and gave her a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house was it? - A. I do not know; I never was in it before or since; it was very near Drury-lane; I do not know that I staid there one minute scarce, no longer than to pay for the beer and come away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with her then? - A. It was very imprudent in me so to do; when I left the public-house, and was going home, she followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch when you went into the public-house? - A. Yes, that I am sure of, because I had occasion to look just before what it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110096"/>o'clock; she followed me from the public-house into <placeName id="t17990911-60-crimeloc315">Short's Gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. How old are you? - A. I am in the 57th year of my age.</p>
               <p>PATRICK M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman; I apprehended the prisoner on the 14th of July; I heard somebody cry stop thief; I stopped her, I searched her. and found the watch upon her; Dalton and I always help one another; he came up just after I had found the watch. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>- DALTON sworn. - I am a watchman, I watch on one side of the street, and M'Carty on the other, I came up just as M'Carty had taken the prisoner; he had taken the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty.) - Upon what part of her person did you find the watch? - A. Folded up in her gown tail, under her apron, and she gave me two or three pinches, I suppose to try whether I could keep a secret.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Between nine and ten I met this man, and he insisted upon my going with him to the public-house; he gave me his watch till he got change for a guinea; and, when he had had satisfaction with me, he wanted the watch back again, and I was not going to prostitute my carcase for nothing.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty). What did she say when you took her? - A. She denied having the watch at the Justice's, and before the constable of the night, she said, he had given her the watch to get a bed for herself, and he pulled out either a seven shilling piece or a half guinea, I cannot tell which, and said, I should sooner have given you this than my watch.</p>

On the 23d of last month, I saw the prisoner, about five o'clock, on the outside of my door, where my boots hang, with a pair of boots in his hand; he then went about two yards from where I first saw him, and then I saw him take another pair of boots off the rail; he put them both into one hand, paused a bit, and then walked away; I followed him about as far again as the end of this Court, and overtook him; I took the boots out of his hand, and took him to Marlborough-street; when I stopped him, I told him one pair of boots might do, and he smiled.</p>

             sworn. - On the 30th of August, I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Webb's house with something which I took to be a child; a woman came out and asked a child if she had seen any body come out; I said, I had seen a man come out, and I immediately ran up the passage; he was then out of sight; when I got into White-horse-yard, I observed the prisoner walking very leisurely; I asked him, what he had got there; he said, nothing but my own; I told him, if he had nothing but his own he would not object to my seeing; I immediately collared him, I took him back to the light, and he said, he would go with me very willingly any where, and so he did a second time; he went with me thirty or forty yards out of White-horse-yard into Stanhope-street; he then said, he would be d-d if he would go with me, and immediately a scuffle ensued; in the scuffle I threw him down, and the things all sell from him; I suppose, upon the alarm of the scuffle, a number of the neighbours came out; among the rest, I saw Mrs. Jolley, I desired her to pick these things up, and give them to me, which she did; I took them under my arm, and collared him with the other, and took them to Mrs. Webb's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the things Mrs. Jolley picked up, were the same that dropped from the prisoner? - A. Yes, I saw her pick them up; the prisoner begged my pardon, said it was his first offence, and that if I appeared against him he should be transported for house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any promise if he would confess? - A. No, I had not; I took him to the watch-house, and the next day I went to Bow-street; he was committed.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 54, Stanhope-street. On the 30th of August I heard a noise at the window; I looked out, and thought it was going to be a fight, till Mr. Pring called out, you are the thief; I then ran out, and trod upon something that was very soft, and Mr. Pring immediately called out to me, Mrs. Jolley, pick up the things; I picked them up all in a lump, and put them under his arm; I went with Pring, and saw him deliver to Mrs. Webb, two gowns, and two cloaks, and an umbrella; the prisoner begged for mercy, and said exactly what Mr. Pring has related. (The property was deposed to by Mrs. Webb.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the things, and that man came up and apprehended me; I told him, they were my own; I thought they were my own when I had picked them up.</p>

On the 6th of March, when I employed her, she came at seven in the morning, and washed the things; I told her, if she was out of employ, it would be much better to have a servitude; I agreed to give her two shillings a week; on the 9th of March, I went to market, and left her in the house; I was gone about three quarters of an hour; I came home, and found my door locked; I then went down to the people in the shop; I lodge in the one-pair of stairs; after making enquiries, I went up stairs, and saw the glitter of a key in a little slit upon the second-floor stairs; I then opened the door and went in; I had occasion to go into the bed-room, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, and others which are not found; I found my property at the pawnbroker's, his name is Hewitt, the corner of Queen-street, about seven weeks ago; the pawnbroker has them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up? - A. At the time that I was told that my things were at Mr. Hewitt's, about two months after the robbery; I was yesterday obliged to take up the evidence, and had her bound over at Bow-street, because the prisoner had threatened her life; her name is Mary Simpson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where do you lodge? - A. No. 32, Peter-street, Soho, I have lived there two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you taken in that time? - A. I never employ a servant, only I took this one out of mere charity.</p>
               <p>Q. She was the first servant you ever had? - A. No; I have had servants before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. More than three or four, or five or six? - A. In all probability I might.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately had you seen the things that you have stated yourself to have lost? - A. I don't understand what it means.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen the counterpane and other things? - A. At Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before you had seen them at Bow-street? - Not after I had lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before that? - A. The very night the prisoner was ironing the things, when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons lodge in the same house with you? - A.Nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that you went to market? - A. Between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your door? - A. No; I left the prisoner in care of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on terms of intimacy and visited the other persons in the house? - A. No; only saying, how do you do, not intimate by any means.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the things for seven weeks afterwards? - A. No, till they were brought to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. It now and then happens that persons get into distressed circumstances; have you never pawned these things? - A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not pawn any thing during these seven weeks? - A. I did not pawn any one single article.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business yourself? - A. Yes; I officiate in making these little straw-bonnets.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your mode of livelihood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the only mode of livelihood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never pawned any single article either by yourself, or directing any other person? - A. No; I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. If I wanted to pawn any thing, supposing it was this tambour cloak, I should take it to the shop of a person, and desire him to let me have the use of some money; then, when I carry him back the money, he lets me have the cloak; - do you understand me? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever do any such thing as that with any of these articles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor did you know that your servant did any such thing till after she had left you? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Queen-square: I was sent by the Magistrate's orders to search the prisoner's room, at Mrs. Wood's; here is a list of the articles that I found in that room, with my name signed to it.</p>

               <p>Q.How did you open the door? - A. It was opened in my presence, I don't think I ever had the key at all; I found the prisoner's boxes locked, there were two of them, I broke open one of them, I opened the other with a key that I found in the box that I broke open; I found a duplicate in the first box, (produces a duplicate of a gold thimble for twelve shillings); I apprehended the prisoner the next day, in the road leading to Chelsea; before I searched her, she gave me this ticket. (Producing it).</p>
               <p>Q.Before that, had you told her upon whose charge you were apprehending her? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Wood.) In what street did you live? - A. In Queen's row, Plimlico; it is likewise called Queen's-row Terrace.</p>
               <p>Court. This duplicate is in the name of Mrs. Mason, King-street.</p>
               <p>Mansden. When she gave me the ticket, I accused her with other things of her mistress's; she said she would take me to the place where they were in pledge, and that she had pledged them by her mistress's consent, and gave her the tickets. I went with her to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this after, or before you had searched her box? - A. The next day. After I had found the duplicates in her box, I went to the pawnbroker with her, and she called for the articles; I think there was a spencer and three linen gowns, a tambour cloak, and a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then asked her whether she had any duplicates? - A. Yes, before that; she said she had given them to her mistress: I took her to Queen-square Office, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were any other duplicates found, to your knowledge, besides those for the thimble and the cloak? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any ring upon her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The very first time you questioned her about it, she said she had done it at the request of her mistress? - A. Yes, that is the account she always gave.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what she was going about when you arrested her? - A. She said she was going to Bow-street, to see her attorney.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she tell you who her attorney was? - A. Mr. Combes; she was coming towards the Park.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were present when the duplicate was found in the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Wood in the room at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she appear to understand what it was? - A. Not at that time, she did not; I explained to her that it was a duplicate of a thimble, and that it was in pawn; she told me that in a bill she received from the prisoner, there was something like a duplicate, and she supposed that was it. I understand the duplicate is of two articles, one belonging to the mistress, and the other to the servant.</p>

               <p>Q.In the character of his agent, were you commissioned to supply Mrs. Wood with money, while he was upon his voyage? - A. Yes, without limitation.</p>
               <p>Q.Whenever Mrs. Wood applied to you for supplies of money, had she them? - A. Yes; this is an extract from my ledger,</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110102"/>Q.Between the 30th of March and the 30th of June, had she any supply from you? - A. The 24th March, she had ten guineas; April 4th, ten guineas; May 16th, eighteen pounds, three shillings; July 8th, twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mrs. Wood had applied for twenty pounds when she applied for ten pounds, would she have had it? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever refuse to let her have money? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you have now a great deal more money in your hands than you have paid? - A. A great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mrs. Wood being arrested, you were sent for? - A. Yes; but I was out of town, and Mr. Luard was sent for.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS LUARD sworn - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an attorney in Gray's-inn; on the 12th of July last, I was sent for by Mrs. Wood, I found her at the private house of a sheriff's officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any bill delivered to you by the prisoner? - A.Yes, the next morning; I had heard of it the day of the arrest, for balance of account for wages, and money laid out in small articles of housekeeping.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the arrest? - A. No, the arrest was for the clothes of the prisoner, of the value of ten pounds and upwards, which she swore in the affidavit she refused to deliver. I desired Mrs. Wood to pay every thing that was justly due to her. I went the next morning; Mr. Armitage met me, and said the attorney was there with the bill; he was here just now: he calls himself Combes, but he is not upon the list. The bill that was delivered to me my agent has lost, since we have attended this Court; the last words of that account were, part of a pledge, half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else about pledges in any part of that bill? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mrs. Wood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from that conversation, that Mrs. Wood understood what a pledge meant? - A. She did not; I had the greatest difficulty in the world to make her understand it; I spoke to her in the English language, and I spoke to her in the French; I put it in every possible shape before I could make her understand it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. A part of that bill was for part of a pledge, half-a-crown, that she had pawned, somehow or other, on account of some pledge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was before Mrs. Wood had made any charge of felony against her? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was drawing Mrs. Wood's attention to the subject of pledges? - A. Not to my knowledge, or in my judgment; it drew her attention to something which turned out to be very bad.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This hill was delivered to you with the article, part of a pledge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it in consequence of that article, that you advised any step to be taken? - A. To go to Queen-square, and get a search-warrant; she did so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had heard of a demand of wages? - A. Yes, pending the arrest; before she was bailed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard from Mrs. Wood that there had been such a demand of wages? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mrs. Wood had been apprized of a demand of wages by her, before she was taken up? - A. I believe so, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt of it? - A. No; and when I say demand of wages, I mean a demand of the balance of a general account of money laid out, and wages together.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. Do you mean the demand of the bill, then? - A. Yes, the balance stated at the foot of this paper.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Mrs. Wood signed that bill at that time? - A.</p>
               <p>Q. In answer to Mr. Knowlys's question, you said you had heard from Mrs. Wood, that this woman had made a demand of wages upon her: now are you correct in that? - A. To the best of my recollection, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was in consequence of your advice that Mrs. Wood went to Queen-square? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Wood shew any reluctance to follow your advice? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime of which my mistress wrongfully accuses me; my mistress went with me to Jermyn-street, and stood just by the pawnbroker's till I came out again, to receive the duplicate and the money for the thimble; I gave her the duplicate and twelve shillings; she went to a fishmonger's shop in St. James's-market, and laid out two shillings of it in some salmon for Sunday's dinner; then she went to the poulterer's shop opposite, and bought a fowl at four shillings and sixpence, for the same dinner; the remainder of the money was to pay a grocer's bill that was at home, one pound, two shillings, and threepence-halfpenny. A lace cloak was pledged for one pound, in the beginning of last winter, my mistress gave it me from her drawers, to pledge; the lace is on her handkerchief that she has now round her neck; the money was not enough to pay the baker's bill, and she asked me to lend her my gown and petticoat, because there was not enough to pay the baker; his name is Drake. I pledged them for seven shillings and sixpence: the man brought a note from his master, saying, that he should summons Mrs. Wood if she did, not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110103"/>pay it. Another time I pledged, a shawl for two shillings; the shawl will be produced that was pledged at the same time as the gown, petticoat, and ring were pledged: two shillings went for an ounce of tea and a pound of sugar: before I fetched the shawl home, I pledged a gown and a shawl for four shillings and sixpence, and that was to buy two shilling's-worth of oysters, and a pennyworth of cheese: she gave me one shilling of the money to fetch the shawl home, and I pledged a dirty handkerchief from my own neck, for one shilling, for some green tea, when she was going to have company; and a gold necklace she gave to a French gentleman to pledge at Mr. Turner's, in Panton-street: she gave me the duplicates to keep, as it would hurt her very much if any ladies should see them in her apartment: she went to this French gentleman's for a duplicate, he lived at No. 62, Swallow-street, a stationer's shop, and I brought it home, and put it in my box: she gave this French gentleman a silver tea-pot and stand, and five guineas and a half out of her own pocket, in gold, because the French gentleman was going to be arrested; she left herself without a farthing of money; at that time I bought her a quarter of a pound of bees-sausages, with three halfpence that I had in my pocket; this was somewhere about January: when I came away, my month was up and three days over, and she pushed me out of her apartments, and said I should not stay another moment in her house, nor I should not have my clothes nor my wages, and I now make a demand of my wages, four pounds, ten shillings, and sixpence, and a bundle of asparagus, four shillings and sixpence, which I did not put down in my bill, and I wish to have that, and my clothes. Before I got out of the house I turned back to ask my mistress if all the duplicates were safe; and she told me she had got them safe: all the things that are pledged now was to buy dinners and things when she had company: my mistress gave me two long-sleeve gowns to pledge, and I have got a witness here who was in the house at the time my mistress made me go out with them; she told me if I did leave her it should be the worst day's work I ever did, for she would ruin me and my family; I said, as to my family, she could not hurt them, and as to the duplicates, they were in my name, and I was very sorry for it; she might ruin me, but she could not touch my family. Miss O'Hara was in the room when I asked her if she had got her duplicates safe; I got to the door, and Miss O'Hara was in the room, with the door open: I hope Miss O'Hara will speak the truth between the prisoner and the prosecutor, as her evidence will be of great service to me.</p>

            's? - A. I cannot say I did, not to the best of my knowledge; I might have stopped talking to the guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never call upon the prisoner at Mrs. Wood's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen Mrs. Wood? - A. At her own house; when she lived in Five-field-row, she lived at a little house, up in Five-fields, and there was a young man there; I cannot say what he might be, but he appeared to me to be something of a tradesman, and she was chucking his hat out at the window; he was running up stairs again, and they seemed very merry.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after you saw her, in Jermyn-street? - A. Long before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Esther live with her then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you had seen Mrs. Wood? - A. I had seen her walking at times before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it that the hat was chucked out? - A. In the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of year? - A. This present summer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what month it was in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before you saw Mrs. Wood in Jermyn-street? - A. I cannot say, for I took little or no notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you often go to Colonel Phipps's to get a frank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. Do you know what your sister carried into the shop that night? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear from your sister what it was she pawned that night? - A. No; I never asked her.</p>
               <p>Q.And she never told you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this fishmonger's-shop in Jermyn-street, or St. James's-market? - A. In Jermyn-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. READ sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner came into my service, and Mrs. Wood came to lodge with me, just about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was the prisoner in your service? - A. Three months and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her conduct and character during the time she lived with you? - A. I never had any reason to suspect her in any respect; she gave me a month's warning; I complained she did not do her business as she ought to do, and she gave me warning; the prisoner at the bar and Mrs. Wood quitted the house together in August, 1798; I think, when Mrs. Wood went away, she asked me to come to see her, and I think, to the best of my recollection, it was No. 5, in the Five-fields.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you a blue apron on? - A. Yes; the moment the Lord's-Mayor's, and some other coaches were gone past, I was going up towards Smithfield to see them go round.</p>
               <p>Q.In what situation was the coach? - A. The coach was standing at the corner of Newgate-street, with the horses heads towards Cheapside, and the back of the coach towards Snow-hill, close against the pavement on the left-hand side of the road next Newgate; I was looking towards Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you nearest the kirb-stone, or nearest the street? - A. Nearest the kirb-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you about you? - A. You go beyond me to say what I had; I had in one pocket a half-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and a French half-crown; a person followed me when I left the carriage, of the name of Sansum; he stopped me when I was sitting upon the coach; I had my hand upon my thigh where my money was; I am sure it was there then; I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are talking of a transaction that took place a twelve month ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not more likely to be correct now than you were then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two or three hundred people there for what you know, as nigh as you can guess? - A. I did not make any guess at them; my intention was to shew my brother and the other man what they could not see in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Your friend got beyond you, you could not tell him what money you had? - A. No; I had received money from several gentlemen to transact business for them at Barnet-fair.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen all your money? - A. At Hayes, in Kent, on the Friday before, at a quarter before eleven; the money was concealed in a parcel and put by itself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How came the gentlemen's money by itself? - A. I always do; and just put enough in my pocket for spending on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never in Newgate, were you? - A. Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there to see the prisoner? - A. Yes; I went with my wife to see the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q.And you saw the present prisoner, did not you? - A. Yes; but I did not know the man, only what people told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. Either Friday or Saturday.</p>

               <p>Q. You know Sansum? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go in with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor he did not desire you to go in? - A. He did not say thee nor thou about it; my wife was with me, and I took her to see all the sights I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this reward for apprehension? - A. I know nothing about the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never had any reward for the other? - A. I was paid my expences.</p>
               <p>Q.You went before the Grand Jury a year ago, and charged Coleman and Taylor with this robbery? - A. I charge them; I did not charge them, I did not know them.</p>
               <p>Q.You went before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That bill was thrown out by the Grand Jury, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at this Sessions, at such a distance of time, another bill of indictment is preferred? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was first a bill preferred against Taylor and Coleman, for privately stealing, which was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q. There was no bill found against Taylor before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You know of no other reward than having received your expences, which were ordered by the Court? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I was on duty on the 3d of September last year, in Bartholomew-fair; I saw Cork, and two more, there was a great crowd round them; there were a great number of thieves, particularly Coleman, Anderson, and the prisoner, Taylor, I had known him about ten years; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110109"/>Cork, and two other, behind a coach; I heard a person, that I knew to be a thief, say to the coachman, cut behind; I saw Anderson go right before Cork, in front of him, Coleman was next to Cork, and he pressed against Cork so as to squeeze him against the arms of the coach; Taylor was along side of Coleman at that time; the state coach at that moment went by, I was then on the opposite side, and I lost sight of them for it might be a minute, or perhaps a little longer; I then crossed over to the same side of the way that they were on, I was along side of the horses of another coach, the horses' heads of one coach was towards Snow-hill, and the other towards Cheapside; I observed that they were then robbing the butcher; I called out, butcher, take care of your pockets; I then saw Taylor stoop down, I stooped down underneath the horses' bellies of the coach that I stood along side of, and I observed Taylor leaning towards the butcher's right hand pocket; Taylor stooped, I do not know whether he was on his knee or not, I saw his hand in the breeches-pocket, I think it was of Cork, and take out a bag, which he gave to Coleman, and then they all three ran away together; it looked like a dirty canvas bag; as soon as I could I pursued after the butcher, to ask him what he had lost; I then took Anderson, and took him to the Compter; I am perfectly positive that Taylor was the man that did it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This transaction took place so long ago as Bartholomew-fair was twelvemonth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The fair had not been proclaimed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other officers with you? - A. Yes, but they were separated from me; there was Backrow there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A.About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take this man into custody at that time? - A. No; I could not catch him, or else I should.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there between you and this transaction? - A. A pair of horses.</p>
               <p>Q. There were as many people upon that coach as could croud? - A. There were three behind, or there might be more.</p>

               <p>Q. You called out, butcher, take care of your pockets? - A. Yes; he had a blue apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that it was that the prisoner took the bag out of his pocket, as you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you spoke loud enough for every body to hear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, after that, you mean to tell us this robbery was committed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have been taken up for this? - A. One was taken up and acquitted; and one taken up and convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the same story before that you have done now with respect to Anderson, that he was one of the persons pushing down Cork? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they did not believe you, and he was discharged? - A. He was never tried; he was discharged before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Anderson's father? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him and his son? - A. Not upon this subject; I know what you mean, and I will explain it at once.</p>
               <p>Q. You have drank with his father? - A. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean between the first examination, upon which he was committed, and the examination upon which he was dismissed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw some of his money, I believe? - A. Yes, a guinea; after Anderson was discharged from the Magistrate's upon suspicion of committing this robbery, in taking him into custody he fought, and used me very ill, and likewise another person whom I charged to assist me; as the Alderman had discharged him, I detained him for assaulting me in the execution of my duty; his father had interceded, and promised me he should go to sea, and begged I would not commence a prosecution against him, but would be glad if I would relinquish it; then he told me he would make me a present of a guinea; before I took the guinea, I went back to the Magistrate, and told him what his father had said; the Magistrate said, if I chose to settle the assault before it came to be heard I might do as I liked; I took the guinea, and his father agreed to send him to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not drink with Anderson? - A. In passing through Newgate-street, in the coach, he called for some gin, and I might drink some with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you or not, before Sir William Staines, exhibit a complaint against him for having assaulted you? - A. I did all the way through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not make a complaint to the Magistrate upon the first examination, with respect to the assault? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.How often were you before the Grand Jury? - A. Once now, and once in last November Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Both times against Taylor? - A. Yes; the first time I did it he was indicted for stealing privately from the person, and I having seen it, the Grand Jury thought it could not be privately, and they threw out the bill.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you or not tell the prosecutor he had lost his watch? - A. I might have mentioned his watch, for I did not know but they might have had his watch as well.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you or not say any thing about his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110110"/>watch? - A. I believe I did ask him if he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Q.There was a reward offered for Taylor, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the author of that bill? - A. I cannot tell who drew it up, I carried it to the printer's; it was drawn out while I was gone to the Compter with Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know a man of the name of Pollock? - A. Yes; I know several Pollocks.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember a man of the name of Pollock being taken up about stealing some coffee? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a man of that name being charged with felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On suspicion of felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Moses Pollock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a man of the name of English? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you take him up for? - A. For being discharged.</p>
               <p>Q.What did the Magistrate say to you upon his being discharged? - A. The prosecutor appeared, and I attended myself, and filed the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never reprimanded for your conduct in that case? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q.You were not the apprehender of Taylor? - A. No; Sharp and Armstrong apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Saturday afternoon the prosecutor came into the jail to me, and drank part of a pot of beer with me; he said, is this Taylor; I said, yes; he said, he was robbed; I told him I did not know any thing about it; he asked if I had any money to bear his expences going backwards and forwards to town, if I had he would not find a bill, as he did not believe any thing that Sansum had told him; I told him I would not give him any money, that I was innocent of the charge laid against me, and I would abide by the laws of my country; he immediately replied, that Anderson, who was discharged, he thought in his own mind, was guilty of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor.) Q. Was it after, or before the bill was found, that you went into the jail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you thought Anderson was guilty? - A. No; I told him I did not know any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to stop this prosecution, and not appear, if he would give you some money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you offer to go back into the country if he would give you some money? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a waterman: On the 23d of July, I was looking in at a picture-shop just by Union-stairs, when the prisoner came up to me; I never saw him before, but I am sure he is the same person; he asked me to carry a letter to a friend of his, Mr. Dunn, No. 7, Bell-alley, Wapping; he went with me as far as Wapping Church, very near the top of Bell-alley; he shewed me the alley, and desired me to tell Mr. Dunn that I came from Mr. Broad, and I was to bring an answer; he told me to tell Mr. Dunn, if he asked whether I worked at Mr. Broad's, to say, no, that I worked just by; he said he would wait till I brought him an answer, as he did not chuse to see his friend; I carried the letter, and delivered it to Mrs. Dunn; I told her I brought it from Mr. Broad, and was to wait for an answer; she asked me how Mr. Broad did; I said, they were all well as far as I knew; she said, you don't work there; I said, no, I work just by there.</p>

               <p>Q. And you told them what the prisoner desired you, though you knew it to be false? - A. I did tell her so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it a right thing to tell that which is false, because another man bids you? - A. I acknowledge it is not right; but I did not know that there was any harm in it, because he said, he did not wish to see his friend; I waited about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and then, either Mr. or Mrs. Dunn gave me a letter, sealed up, directed to Mr. Broad, and I delivered it to Mr. Broad, as I thought, I delivered it to the prisoner at the bar; I found him within twenty yards of where I had left him, he walked a-head of me about five or six yards; I did not see him open the letter, but when he had walked a little way before me, the letter came all in little bits behind him, he tore it and threw it away; then he said, we will have something to drink; we went into a public-house and had a pot of ale, and some bread and cheese, we stopped a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; he wanted the landlord to give him change for a two pound note, and he could not, and then he pulled out a one pound note; then he put four shillings into my hand; I looked at the four shillings, and I looked at him, and said, I did not know that I ever earned four shillings so easy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110111"/>in my life; he said, I was very welcome; we walked together as far as Tower-hill, and there we parted. On a Monday morning afterwards, between ten and eleven o'clock, Mr. Dunn stopped me in Wapping, and there was a man came up, that passed his word that he should find me whenever he wanted me; about an hour afterwards Mr. Dunn met me, and I went to the office, and was there till six o'clock, and then I saw the prisoner there; I had described him to Mr. Dunn, and I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When you went with this letter, you pretended to come from Mr. Broad? - A. I did not know that it was not Mr. Broad.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you had no idea that you were assisting to cheat Mr. Dunn of his money? - A. I had not the least idea of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it not strike you as very extraordinary, that he should desire you to say that which was not true? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I then took half a sheet of paper, and put up a one-pound and a two-pound Bank-note, put a wafer in it, and directed it to Mr. Broad, at Hackney; I gave it to my husband, and saw him give it to Dale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose the letter came from the prisoner? - A. No; I thought the letter came from Mr. Broad.</p>
               <p>William Dunn called again. I stood by while my wife put the notes up in a letter; there was a one-pound and a two-pound note; then she sealed up the letter and gave it to me, and I gave it to Dale. In two or three days time I began to suspect it was wrong, and in about five weeks after I met Dale accidentally, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, did not you bring a letter to me? and he said he did; he described the person of the prisoner as the person who gave him the letter, and I found him at a house in Whitcomb-street. I told him I wished him to go before a Magistrate to clear himself; he walked with me to Charing-cross, and then we took a coach, and brought him to the Shadwell Office: Mr. Broad was with me; he told the prisoner that we had taken him in regard to a forged letter that was brought to Mr. Dunn some time back; he seemed to deny it at first, but after a little time he said, to say he knew nothing about it would be wrong, for he did know about it; he then proposed giving us the three pounds, and pay all expences; I told him I could not, for I had got the young man that brought the letter in custody, and then we brought him to the Shadwell Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar? - A. Between three and four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever employed him at all? - A. Never; he was engaged in a piece of business that I was involved in, but not by my employment, nor by my directions; there was a note got from me in a wrong way, and I told him if he could by any possible means get the note returned, I would pay him for his trouble; but he never got the note. A fellow that is in the Fleet obtained it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Provided he had got it back, what were you to pay him? - A. About a guinea and a half, I think he said he had paid to counsel.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gardener at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter; did you write that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authorize any person to write it? - A. Never any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of its being written? - A. I did not; I had seen the prisoner twice, I saw him at a house in Fleet-lane, during the last Sessions here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a one-pound and a two-pound note from Mr. Dunn, in consequence of that letter? - A. No, from no person whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart took an objection that the evidence amounted to no more than a fraud; that it was obtaining the notes under false pretences, but could not be a felony.</p>
               <p>Court. The circumstances under which this case stands, distinguishes it from the case of a false pretence; it may be a question to be submitted to the Jury, whether they are of opinion that this man, at the time he wrote and sent this letter, had or had not the felonious intent of obtaining from Dunn these notes for his own use, he, in the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110112"/>of William Broad, without any authority from him, writes this letter, which he sends, by Dale, to Dunn, the prosecutor; in consequence of this letter, Dunn parts with these notes to Dale, never intending to part with them to the prisoner at the bar; but thinking that he parts with them to Broad, the person in whose name the letter is written; so that he never parted with them to the prisoner at all, but to the messenger, under the idea that he was sending them to Broad. If therefore this man has made use of this letter as a trick and a device to procure possession of this property from the prosecutor Dunn, and afterwards converted it to his own use, I apprehend it will fall within the principle of the different cases that have already been determinded, where chalking under the hat, finding a ring, and a variety of devices of that sort, have induced a man to part with his property, thinking that he parted with it to a person who was to give him a share of the booty, which afterwards turned out to be worth nothing; so, in this case, Dunn has parted with these notes to the prisoner, under the idea that he was parting with them to Broad; I am, therefore, of opinion, that it ought to go the Jury. I will save the point certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 20th of June I received the note of the Rev. Mr. Footman, in the Fleet, drawn by him, and accepted by

            ; this note was given to me to be discounted for the use of his nephew, to buy him out of the guards; I had the note in my possession fourteen days; I then gave it to Mr. Abrahams, a builder; I afterwards learned that it was rather doubtful whether it would be applied to the use it was meant for; I went to Mr. Dunn, and acquainted him that I thought they were playing tricks with him, and told him where the note was; I went with him to Howland-street, and a number of other places; it took up a great deal of my time, and I had been at two pounds three shillings expence; he gave me half-a-guinea on account, and told me he would pay me all the expences I had been at, and also for my trouble, provided he could get the note back undiscounted, he got it back in about eight days; Dunn and his wife both told me I might depend upon being paid every demand I might have; and Mr. Broad assured me he would see me paid; as I had acted like an honest man; when I found he had got the note back, I went to Mr. Dunn, and he told me, that those who employed me might pay me; says I, surely you don't mean to trick me in this way; he said, he thought it no tricking at all, he had been at too much expence already to be at any more. I cannot deny what the witnesses have said respecting the letter; when they took me along in the coach, Dunn said, I dare say my nephew is in this, and you had better own it; I said, he had no knowledge of it at all, and I acknowledged it myself; I offered to pay him the three pounds, and all expences; Mr. Dunn said, he would freely forgive me, and would not hurt me, only they wanted to know the truth of it, and as I had told them the truth, they would not hurt me; but, as the matter was before the Magistrate, it must be decided there. <rs id="t17990911-70-verdict375" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mr. Mann. I cannot swear that it is mine: I had the same pattern; there is no private mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you stop her? - A. She was too quick for me and she knew the stairs better than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes; I only took a share of a couple of pots of beer with another.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own lodging was in Buckridge-street? - A. Yes; I went home and they were gone to bed, and I had rather pay for my lodging than disturb them; I had lodged in that house going on five years.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a common lodging house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they always go to bed so early? - A. Yes; the pawnbroker has got my handkerchief, but the watch was never found.</p>
               <p>Q.Was she not to sleep with you? - A. Yes; I agreed at last to give her a shilling in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not agree to give her the handkerchief? - A. No, nothing but the shilling; I found her out the next day and took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure you did not give her the handkerchief? - A. Yes; I would not give it her, any more than I would cut my head off.</p>
               <p>The pawnbroker produced the handkerchief, stating, that he took it in of the prisoner on the 8th of July, and which was deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You call that a skeleton key; it is such a skeleton key as I never saw before? - A. It is a skeleton key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of these two keys open the cellar where the rabbits were? - A. No, the other key opened Mr. Blackburn's premises, and it is a very common key, it opened the door where the prisoner lodged.</p>
               <p>ANN LAMBERT sworn. - I take in washing, and live at No. 22, in Holiday-yard: The prisoner asked me, one day, for the key of my coal-cellar; the prisoner lodged at No. 28, he hired a cellar belonging to my house to keep rabbits in, and had it locked up to himself; he asked me for the key of the coal cellar; I told him I would not let him have it; then I went with him down into the cellar, and he set down a sack of something there; I asked what that was; he said it was clover chaff, and he locked it up there; I told him I believed he could get into my house whenever he pleased; he told me it was a lie.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same sack he put in, that Hall, the officer, took away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had any body access to the cellar where his rabbits were? - A. No; he always kept it locked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he ever give you any of the rabbits? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not very well pleased at having so many rabbits about the house? - A. Some of the lodgers complained very much.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you would have been pleased with him for having a key to let himself in and out? - A. No; it was necessary if the lodgers wanted a key that they should ask my leave.</p>
               <p>Q.This sack being in your cellar might have brought you into a scrape, if he had not directly said it was his? - A. He could not say otherwise.</p>

             sworn. - Q.Look at this sack? - A. I know nothing at all about this sack, and this other, I could not swear to; it is a twelvemonth since I lived with Mr. Blackburn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know this sack to be mine; it is a four bushel sack; it is darned with double twine near the bottom, and it is mended near the top with yarn, such as they make mops of; I would swear to it if I found it at Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He, perhaps, had been stealing some of your flour, and borrowed the sacks to carry it home? - A. I missed it last Christmas, and he said he had given it to the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he had brought the sack from Worcestershire? - A. No, he said he brought it from Peterborough, in Northampronshire.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave him a good character. (<rs id="t17990911-88-verdict481" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know how she got into the room? - A. No, (produces them); I brought seven cotton shirts from Bengal in the East Indies, and this is all I have got left of them; I am sure the stockings are mine, but they have no particular mark upon them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol: On the 14th of August, about half past three, I met this man with a sack upon his shoulder, at the corner of West-street and Graston-street, in the parish of St. Ann's, Soho; I asked him where he had it from; and he said he had a brother lived near Uxbridge, and he had sent a pig as a present among three of them; I took him to the watch-house, and the next day to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Legge. I saw the pig at Marlborough-street; it was just the same as it was, except the life gone out of it, for the hair was on, and the entrails in it; I can swear to this sack, it was upon my premises the same time that the pig was.</p>

             sworn. - I was constable of the night: The patrol brought the prisoner into the watch-house, with a sack and a pig in it, it was warm; he said it was sent from Uxbridge, and he had brought it in a cart to go to Clare-market; he said he was a shoe-maker in Clement's lane; I searched him, and found a knife; he said it was his property; I looked at it by the candle. and it was all over blood, (produced it); I locked him up, and in the morning, as I was going with him to the justice's, he said, what he told me last night was all lies; now, says he, I will tell you the truth; I found the sack in a ditch on the other side of Tyburn-turnpike; but, says I, what will you say about the knife; and he said he found the knife sticking in the pig's throat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been working at Oxford, but finding work getting slack I came to London; I had no money when I got to Uxbridge, so that I was obliged to walk to London; about three o'clock in the morning, I saw something lying in the road, I found it was a sack, and a man came up to me, and asked me what I had picked up; I said I did not know; I opened it, and there was a pig in the sack, and this knife; it was my full intention to have had it advertised; my friend, that saw me find it, has been attending here several days.</p>

             sworn. - I am a labourer, I live at No. 2, Norfolk-row, Lambeth: On the 15th of August, I was going to Uxbridge, a little before three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.What business do you follow? - A.Barge work; I was at coal work last.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I never saw him till that morning; I saw the prisoner coming towards me, a little before three o'clock, between Bayswater and Tyburn-turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from London? - A. It might be half a mile from Tyburn-turnpike, very near; I saw him pick up something in the road, I saw it was a sack, it seemed very heavy; he opened it, and there was a pig in it, and a knife, which he took out before me, and put in his pocket; I asked him where he was going; he said he lived at the White-hart, in Clement's-lane; I was going to Uxbridge to work.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110126"/>Q. How long did you stay together? - A. About six minutes; I went on, and the prisoner went the other way; a cart had drove by very fast just before, and I told him I thought it fell out of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there was nothing else passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him your name? - A. No; after I came to town again, I went to the White-hart, and enquired for him, and they called his wife up, and wanted to know my business; I told her I saw him pick up a pig; and she told me he was confined for that same thing, and begged I would appear in his behalf, to declare what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was by mere accident you called there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you want of him? - A. To see whether he lodged there or not.</p>
               <p>Q.What was it to you whether he lodged there or not? - A. It came into my mind as I was going that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 15th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How do you know it was the 15th? - A.Because I took notice of it, and the woman desired me to attend here.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Solomons.) Did you see any other man near him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pearson.) You are sure it was not the Hammersmith road.? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you have known the prisoner some years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q.And, in consequence of the good character he has maintained, you took him to be an honest man? - A. He has certainly bore a very good character; he has been an unfortunate, but I believe an honest man.</p>
               <p>- ABBOTT sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Seal: I did not see the tobacco taken from the prisoner; Mr. Seal gave it to me. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you had it ever since in your possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was left at the office was it not? - A. Yes, and I went for it; it was sealed up, and I know it to be the same.</p>

               <p>Seal. The tobacco delivered to Abbott, I am sure, was my property.</p>
               <p>Abbott. This is the tobacco I received from Mr. Seal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was tobacco that I had saved up from what was given me of an evening, to make a present of.</p>
               <p>Seal. The tobacco we give them is perfectly finished, and cold; the tobacco I took from him was warm, and the same description of tobacco he had been at work upon; and there is a particular smell that betrays it at once, whether it is just took off the stove or not.</p>
               <p>Q. A man being at work near the stove, with tobacco in his waistcoat-pocket, it might produce nearly the same smell, I should think? - A. It might in some degree.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who had known him from twenty to thirty years, and who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess; did you hold out any threat or any favour, if he did or did not make any discovery? - A.Neither one nor the other.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110128"/>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. I never saw him but once, but I am sure he is the same man; he pledged with me four yards of cloth, on the 16th of July, sometime in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Warberton). When was it you found the duplicate? - A. On Thursday the 3d of August, about eleven o'clock, probably.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty). Look at that duplicate, is that the one you gave the prisoner? - A. It is the same, it was pledged for two guineas; I asked him if it was his own property, he told me, yes; he pledged it in the name of John Jackson.</p>
               <p>Warberton. I have no doubt but they are the same, but I cannot very well tell by candle-light; I have patterns in my pocket of both (produces them), that quantity was just deficient, and I have the same cloth now in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it the same maker will make two pieces exactly like? - A. So I suppose, very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q.Both in colour and cut, and every thing else? - A. I agree with you perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then supposing you had not found any deficiency in your stock, but had been shewn these two pieces of cloth, could you have stated that this cloth came out of your shop? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost two pieces which corresponded with the quantity you missed? - A. Yes, both in list and colour, and every thing else.</p>
               <p>Q.This young man comes from Cumberland, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did the prisoner come to live with you? - A. On the 18th of February last.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called Mr. Edward Sutherland, a wine-merchant, who had known him from his infancy, and deposed that no man could have a better character.</p>

             sworn. - I have no friends in London, I do what I can for a livelihood; the prisoner lodged in the room over me; my landlord and landlady were in confinement, and she came to help me; I had the care of the children; I am subject to fits, and instead of helping me, she took the money out of my pocket and ran up stairs, and locked herself in; it was on a Friday, I think, in the afternoon; when I asked her for the money, she called me every thing that was bad, and would not give it me; I had seen my money about ten minutes before, and there might be about four shillings in silver, besides halfpence; when my sit was over, I went to get something to relieve me; I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had no money left; I went up stairs to her to ask her for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge her with stealing but half-a-crown? - A.Because that was all the money that I could swear to that was marked; there was an infirm man in the place at the time, but he could not help me; the constable has got the money; he found the money upon her; one shilling has got an E upon it, and another an N, and the sixpence has a B upon it; I had saved this money to buy me something, I had had it about three days.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MESSENGER sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square-office: On Friday, the 28th of last June, a person came to the office for a constable to go to No. 28, Dartmouth-row, and the prosecutrix gave me charge of the prisoner; I searched her, and found some money upon her; I kept two shillings and a sixpence, which the prosecutrix swore to; the rest I gave back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can swear to this money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The money was my own, and it is only spite, because I refused to fetch a gown and petticoat out of pawn for her; and there was a little boy she brought before the Justice, and told him she would give him a penny if he would say what she bid him, that he saw me take the money out of her pocket, and if he did not, she would beat him and turn him out of doors.</p>

            's; at the World's End, Little Chelsea. On Thursday, the 18th of July, I went to Turnham-Green, about two o'clock, and returned at seven in the evening, with a young man, who is here, that drove the Chiswick stage; we got to <placeName id="t17990911-109-crimeloc595">the Three Kings in Piccadilly</placeName>

When I got down I went under the gateway to make water, the prisoner came up to me, and said, lend me your bundle and umbrella, I will hold it for you; I gave it to him, supposing him to belong to the yard; he went up and sat down upon a bench under the Three Kings tap, I lost sight of him for a minute, I came up to the bench, and saw that the prisoner had no bundle or umbrella, he told me it was safe; I asked him what he would like to drink for his civility, in taking care of them; we had part of a pot of porter together, which I paid for: I pulled out my watch, and said, now it is time for me to go home, and asked him for the bundle and umbrella; he said he would see me d-d and blasted before I should go home, and he would not give it me. He then appeared to be drunk; I did not observe it before. I asked him what he meant, and made my way towards the gateway; he followed me, and just under the gateway, he laid hold of me side-ways, and slammed me right up against the gateway; he then forced my watch out first, and then pinned me against the gateway, and ran away up Piccadilly. As soon as I recovered from the alarm, I ran out and called watch! stop thief! I lost sight of him among some postillions or coachmen, and I did not see him till the Saturday morning, when he was taken up. I was in pursuit of him all the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Where did you live last, as a stay-maker? - A. At Mr. Button's, Paradise-row, Chelsea; I left his service about four months ago.</p>

               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The gateway of the Three Kings must have been as public a place as any in London, at that time in the evening? - A. Yes; it was not dark, it was dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. You went back to the house, I suppose, and told them you had been robbed? - A. No, I went strait home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see plenty of people in the house? - A. There were some.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there not twenty? - A. I suppose they were all such sort as himself; I did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In the judgment of charity you supposed them to be all thieves? - A. I did not know; I thought it was best not to go back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose the landlord a thief? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose your comrade, the coachman, a thief? - A. No; he was gone home with his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other coach there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the Three Kings on the Friday? - A. No; I was in the neighbourhood enquiring for him. I took him just by there, on the Saturday; he was attending the coaches at the Gloucester Coffee-house, next door to the Three Kings.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken to Bow-street on the Saturday and discharged by the Magistrate, was he not? - A. Yes, I was to get another witness; and I took him again, on the Monday, before Sir

             sworn. - I live near Stepney. On the 12th of May, I had been at my grocer's and coming down Whitechapel-road, the prisoner, Lycett, came up and talked with me about country affairs; and, just as we got to Mile-end turnpike, there was a little red book lay, and he said, we had better go into the public-house, and see what it is; he opened it, and said, here is a pin for lady Spencer, with a receipt; I think it was for one hundred and fifty guineas; and then another man came in, and that was the other prisoner, James; says he, what, was that lady with you when you picked it up, he said; yes; then, says he, she is entitled to half of it: no, says the other, I don't know that; but, says the other, I insist upon it, and she shall have it; then Lycett went, and pretended to take a bill; and, when he came back, he said the gentleman was just gone out; the other said his name was Pratt; I said I had got a son, whose wife was lying-in with the twelfth child; and he said it would be a good thing for me; and I thought he was taking my part, and I thanked him; then Pratt said, have you got any money about you; I said, oh! yes; I happened to have a guinea in my pocket in silver, a seven-shilling-piece, and some half-crowns, and I gave it to him; he then asked me how much more money I had got; says I, I have got about twenty pounds by me, that is to serve me till July, till I receive some more money; so, he said, go and fetch that, and we will go to my house and settle it; I went and fetched him a ten pound and two five pound notes; and, when he had got it, now says he, we will go to my house, and he gave me a direction in the name of Pratt, facing Whitechapel church, an ironmonger; I went there, and found one Mr. Pratt, poor old soul, but I saw it was not the same Mr. Pratt, and then it struck me directly that I was cheated.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have got the pin for your twenty pounds? - A. Yes, (produces it); I am sure the prisoners are the same men; I looked at the pin, and my eyes were rather dim; but I thought it only looked like a bit of Bristol stone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your eyes are rather dim? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you may be mistaken in their persons? - A.No; I know them perfectly, as well as if it was yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q.The shops were all open were they not? - A. Yes; I went to get some raisin wine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain it was the 12th of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The 12th of May was Whitsunday? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was on a Monday.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - I apprehended the prisoners: I found upon Lycett this small pocket-book, and upon James this large one, (producing them); I apprehended James first; Lycett went into a public-house; when he saw me following James, he went into the privy; after I had secured them both, I went to the privy, got a light, and found part of a receipt purporting to be a receipt from Lady Spencer; James said he knew the man that had done the trick, but it was not him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, James, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>For Lycett.</p>
               <p>- LEONARD sworn. - I have known Lycett five or six years, he has bore a very good character; he married a woman with fourteen hundred pounds property; I have put him in possession a great many times, and always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are a man that is well known - do you mean to say, that you have put Lycett into possession of effects? - A. Yes, a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, that he has been sent abroad by this Court? - A. I believe he was innocent of that, and the people at Bow-street think so too.</p>
               <p>Court. But knowing that he had been sent out of the country by this Court, how did you dare to come here to give him a good character; for shame, you disgrace yourself very much.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Whether there was a deficiency of stock, or not, you cannot say, without having resort to your books? - A. Not to a certainty, we cannot.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got your books here to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the officers of Shadwell-office: I took up Mellish, the accomplice, on Sunday the 16th of June, in the evening; and, in consequence of his information, on the 24th, I went to Mr. Welsford, and received this stick, with a hook at the end of it, (produces it); on Monday the 17th, I went to the house of Mrs. Hayes, in Golden-lane, and there a piece of calico was delivered by Mrs. Hayes, to Haynes the officer, in my presence; I apprehended the two prisoners at St. Catherine's, on Monday the 17th, Haynes, Holebrook, and Brown were with me; we secured them, and Brown searched them. As we were conveying them to the office, we found, upon Robertson, a hook, similar to that which has been produced.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CULLEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Messrs. Welsford; This is the stick that I found in our warehouse, about a fortnight or three weeks before the officers came to our house, it laid upon the calicos in the warehouse; the square of glass had been broke some weeks before the robbery.</p>
               <p>JAMES MELLISH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. About the beginning of June last, me, Robertson, and Smith, agreed to go to a house in Lad-lane; we went, and tied a handkerchief round a stick, to break the window without making a noise, that was between nine and ten o'clock; we then went away from the house to the Wilkes's Head, in Wilkes's-court, without doing any thing further, and there we remained till half past eleven; then we returned to Lad-lane, and concealed ourselves in an alley, till the watchman went past one o'clock; then we fetched the stick which we had concealed in the alley, and went to the house of Mr. Welsford, where we had broke the square of glass; we took the said stick, and hauled up two pieces of calico, while the watchman was going his rounds; I put the calico into a bag, took it to Honey-lane-market, and concealed it there; we returned to Mr. Welsford, and the watchman was sitting at the door; we walked a little way up and down Cheapside, till the watchman went off at four o'clock; then we returned to the said house again, and hauled up another piece of calico, with a hook and a stick; I am not positively sure whether we hauled up any more or no; we immediately went to the concealment, and took the goods away; Robertson and Smith took them to one Mrs. Hayes, in Golden-lane, to dispose of, between five and six o'clock in the morning, and they told me that Mrs. Hayes had given them ten-pence a yard; they said Mrs. Hayes opened the back door and let them in with it; they said there were twenty-one yards in each piece; they brought some money, and were to call for the remainder in the course of the day; we went to the same house three or four times afterwards, and we lost the stick, it was dropped down into the area, through the same square of glass that was broke; this is the said stick, and the said hook, and no other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What trade are you? - A. No trade particular; I used to get my livelihood by the sea, two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How have you got your livelihood since that? - A. I have been two years in confinement for that that I was never guilty of; people swore against me, and said I had stole a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a sad charge against an honest man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But twelve honest gentlemen thought otherwise and convicted you? - A. Yes; but I was green at that time, or I could have proved an alibi.</p>
               <p>Q. You got your back flogged, I believe, besides two years confinement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you returned to your old trade again? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.And you will get discharged if you hang these men? - A. It is not my wish to hang them; I wished to retrieve my character to the Magistrates, and go to sea again.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer of Shadwell-office: I apprehended the two prisoners at St. Catherine's, on Monday the 17th of June, at a house where girls of the town, and people of that description resort, it is not a public-house, they were sitting together; we handcuffed them in the room, and in bringing them to the office, I perceived Robertson trying to pull something out of his right-hand waistcoat-pocket; I immediately stepped round him, put my hand in his pocket, and found this hook, which he was endeavouring to get out of his pocket; it had a cork at the end of it. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be too sharp to carry in the pocket without a cork? - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAYNES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office: On Sunday the 16th of June, I apprehended Mellish, in company with Cook and Holebrook; the next day, in the morning, I went to Mrs. Hayes's, in Golden-lane, in search of some calicos; I found one piece with a bit taken out of it by some sharp instrument or other. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>MARY HAYES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the wife of Henry Hayes, No. 6, Golden-lane: I delivered that piece of calico to Haynes, the officer; I bought it of the prisoner, Smith, I believe I had seen him before; I bought it, with more calicos, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; there was another man with him, but I don't think I should know him again; there were three pieces in the whole; I gave them one shilling a yard for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted you are married? - A. Yes; and have been near ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept a shop all that time? - A. No, about nine months; I deal in old and new clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if an odd piece of calico is brought before your shop-hours you will buy it? - A. I did then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not taken up as a receiver? - A. No; they sent me a note, and I went to the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body has said you gave but ten-pence a yard, it is false? - A. I gave a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth? - A. I leave that to your judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, what is it worth? - A. I should suppose about twenty-pence.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been threatened to be prosecuted for receiving stolen goods, unless you appeared here to-day? - A. Yes, I am sensible of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walsford. There is no mark upon the calico; we generally mark them in this part which is cut off; it appears to be of the exact quality of that which we missed; it is worth about twenty-one pence per yard.</p>
               <p>Robertson's defence. I am quite innocent of what I am charged with.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. I am as innocent of it as the child unborn; I never saw the man in my life.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On Sunday, the 16th of June, the two prisoners and I went to Mr. Rothwell's, in King-street, Cheapside, about four in the morning, just after the watchmen had gone off their duty; it was then day-light; we showed a window back belonging to a warehouse underneath the house, where we saw some calico lie; we immediately fastened a book on a stick, and drew up one piece of calico first, and put it into a bag which Robertson had in his hand, and then we were disturbed, a man came by, and we thought it was a watchman; I and Smith went up Trump-street into Honey-lane Market, and Robertson went down the said alley, where the man came up; and in turning back, I saw a watchman and some more along with him at the top of Cateaton-street; they pursued after us as far as the end of Coleman-street, and there they left us: me and Smith went up to my place in Whitecross-street, where I used to live, and he lent me his coat and I lent him mine, and I pulled off my blue apron and put on a white one, and returned back to Honey-lane Market, where we used to conceal our things, and I found Robertson had been there, and left one piece of calico; a few minutes afterwards, me, Smith and Robertson met again where the guines were concealed; while Robertson was absent, me and Smith got up three more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110137"/>pieces of calico, and took them to the place where Robertson had concealed the first, When we all met together, we agreed to go and shut the window the same as we found it, which we immediately did: then Robertson and Smith went and concealed the goods in another place that we had on the other side of Cheapside; then we went and got it all out of the concealment, and put it into a bag; there were four pieces of coarse calico, one the first time, and three the last: then we returned to the place where I lived; I took the goods up into a room where I used to keep company with a girl; we all three agreed that I should go out and look after somebody to buy it. I went to Mrs. Starr's, between seven and eight o'clock, and

               <p>Q. And they have not been able to find you? - A. Yes, they did once, I was taken to the Savoy, and made my escape.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a dark night, was it not? - A. No, it was day-light.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am in partnership with Mr. Aylwin; we received seventy-two casks of oil from Hamburgh (produces a book); these are the gauges which I took on the 14th of July, in our values under the Coal-exchange, the numbers were progressive from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110138"/>one to seventy-two; there was a spade mark upon all the casks; the cask No. 66, was marked one hundred and forty-four gallons, and there was the mark of sixty-six on the opposite side of the bung; there was a brand-mark of C.K. with a C. underneath, and a large P on the other end; we received some information from Mr. Hubbock, upon which I missed the cask No. 66, it was an ullage cask, we only take the contents gauge, and not the ullage gauge; that cask is here, the mark is totally out, the spade mark is obliterated at both ends, and the middle remains, and the sixty-six and one hundred and forty four still remain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time you gauged these casks, was the prisoner in the warehouse? - A. No; his partner Thomas Cooke, was; he called me over the numbers and gauges.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sold any of that oil since? - A. No; we have sent one cask into the country, to our correspondents at Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since examined how much oil remains in your cellar? - A. No; the quantity of casks are not yet filled up, they are not all delivered; we fill the casks up as they go away.</p>
               <p>Q. That operation is performed either by the prisoner or his partner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of oil has been sent out you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner and his two partners are answerable for any deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, by way of securing yourselves, you hold a balance in your favour in your hands? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not at this time in your hands one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty pounds, belonging to the prisoners and his partners in your hands? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not a very considerable balance in your hands now? - A. I don't know as to the exact sum, we have some money of theirs.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is it not upwards of one hundred pounds? - A. I supposed it may.</p>
               <p>Q. The value of the oil supposed to be lost, is thirty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not upon every occasion, regularly and honestly, paid every deficiency? - A. They have.</p>
               <p>Q. If even an umbrella was lost have you not made them pay for it? - A. My predecessor I believe did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, even now upon your oath, undertake to say that there is a single gallon of oil missing, out of the seventy-two casks? - A. We cannot say; the parcel is not filled up.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you prefer this bill of indictment against the prisoner? - A. I don't know the date, it was this sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not after you had found the bill take the man out of his business by a bench-warrant at mid-day? - A. I did not like to see the man lie long in jail before trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not suffer him to continue and carry on your business for six-weeks, after you had meditated a prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When accidents happen in the cellar, has it not been usual for the poor men to collect together, or wipe up with a fox's tail, the oil that is spilt? - A. Not Gallipoli oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, yourself, sold oil so collected for the benefit of the prisoner and his partners? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a jar of forty-four gallons being broke? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the prisoner and his partners paid fifteen pounds to Mr. Sheriff Price, for an accident that happened to the oil? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Patterson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. It is my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a bill making a charge upon you for nine guineas for a jar of oil, supposed to be missed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, is that your hand-writing? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that twenty-two pounds two-shillings and nine-pence, part of a loss of sixty odd pounds? - A. Yes; he had the care of the warehouse, and we never could trace it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before a Magistrate you know the prisoner would have been heard in his own defence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before a Grand Jury the poor man could not be heard in his defence you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of pure mercy that you did not take him before a Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was also out of pure mercy that you went behind his back before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since it was proposed to take your partner's brother into the business of the prisoner? - A. I know nothing of that transaction at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Accidents frequently happen in carrying out oil? - A. Yes, with jars of oil; but I never knew an accident with a cask of oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner informed you of his having had any accident, with any of these seventy-two casks? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Aylwin re-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Has there ever been any proposal, or plan, for putting your brother into the business of the prisoner? - A. Never; I never intended my brother as any thing else but un assistant, to superintend the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110139"/>landing of the goods at the water-side, as well as to overlook those men that I might place as warehouse-men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you intend by that to supersede the prisoner and his partner's as oil-porters? - A. No such thing; it was my intention about two years ago, to have taken the oil-porters away, but upon some friends of theirs interceding for them, I continued them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Aylwin cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these people were not to be partially deprived of this business, but were completely to be turned away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this brother of your's, in the character of assistant, was to derive the profits which they derive? - A. By no means; I was to derive the profits to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. That of course begot no very great good will between you and the porters; did they not apply to your employers about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this scheme of yours for turning them away was rejected by the merchants? - A. No such thing; the oil-men spoke to us that they might continue.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you join with your partner in saying you cannot ascertain that you have lost a single gallon out of those seventy-two casks? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you agree with your partner that you call upon them to make up every deficiency in the warehouse? - A. No; I agree with him that if there were five jars in a hundred missing, I should charge them with it; but as to quantities, we never did charge them with it, because of the liability to leak.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that you have lost a single gallon of oil? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call upon this man to explain this business before you indicted him? - A. I never spoke to him about it; had it been any other oil but Gallipoli oil I should not have done as I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I ask you, upon your oath, what was your reason for not taking him before a Magistrate? - A. For no other reason in the world but that he should not lie longer in prison than necessary, it was so clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you not sold some oil for them? - A. I have: when they have had accidents, I have sold several jars.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you ever made them pay for the cask, as well as the oil? - A. No; nor for any cask-oil, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When there was an accident with a jar of oil, did you make them pay for the jar, as well as the oil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUBBOCK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. - I am an oil and colour-man in Re-lio n-street, Wapping. The prisoner called upon me on the 1st of August, for payment of a cask of Gallipoli oil which my brother had bought; I gauged the cask and settled his bill; he was satisfied with the contents, as I computed it. (Produces the bill.) It is read,"Messrs. Wm. and Thos. Hubbock,"Bought of Oil-Porters,"Gallipoli Oil, at 70 per ton, £31 9 0"</p>
               <p>Q. What was the market price of Gallipoli oil at that time? - A. Upwards of 90l. per ton; my brother acquainted Mr. Aylwin with the business, he is now in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was done regularly in the course of trade, and the bill made out "Bought of Oil-Porters"? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew perfectly well that he worked at Aylwin and Chapman's warehouses? - A. Yes, I have received oil from him there.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no secret at all made of it? - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons also work on the quays, do they not? - A. Yes, in Mr. Aylwin's service.</p>
               <p>Q. They purchase, do they not? - A. I never knew that they did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have, I believe, a sample of the oil? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you suppose, when you were buying oil of the oil-porters, that they had a right to sell oil? - A. They have perquisites; the drainings of the casks, and the fox-tailings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Mr. Aylwin. Q. Are there such things as perquisites to the oil-porters from the draining of the casks? - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You missed a cask; do you not hold the porters responsible for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This was oil that we had collected at various times and various periods, by misfortunes with jars of oil, with the fox-tailings, and likewise a quantity of Gallipoli oil, part of a cargo that was stranded at Dice-quay, which we put into two casks; it leaked and refined itself, and we sold it to Mr. Hubbock.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I had sent out forty-five of these casks; there was one cask gone which I did not put down, because it was posted No. 73, and there was no such number.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent out No. 66? - A. No, I had not. I had sent all the forty-five casks to Bristol.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Myself, Lawrence, and the prisoner at the bar, are the only oil-porters in London; we are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110140"/>responsible for every deficiency: if a cask or a jar was lost, or any spilt, we should be called upon to make it good; when oil is spilt, we always take an empty cask to put it in; we wipe it up with a fox's tail; we always take it for our own advantage, and whatever the gentlemen please to charge us for the article, we have always paid it. When it is put into a cask, it refines itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, some time ago, a ship being tranded? - A. Yes, it might be six months ago; I cannot say to a month: the oil that was on board was bought by different persons in the oil trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the oil that was sold to Mr. Hubbock? - A. Yes; it was accidents from jars, and the leakage of casks. It stood in the warehouse open to Mr. Aylwin or his partner, or any other person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether you were ever allowed by Mr. Aylwin or Mr. Chapman, the privilege of leakage? - A. No, I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever know of your taking any such perquisite? - A. I don't know that they ever knew of it; I never concealed it from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever allow it you? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You shared, with Gooden, the amount of the money that was received from Mr. Hubbock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that any part of that was from the ship that was stranded? - A. Yes, the oil was landed at Dice-quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pay Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman a farthing towards that oil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the whole of the oil landed from that ship perfectly congealed? - A. Some little of it was not; a part of the oil sold to Mr. Hubbock was oil that had been concealed, and melted again, which we had gathered off the ground; it was not fit to put in again: the cask entirely fell from the oil.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it did you take for yourselves, one gallon or ten? - A. It might be more than one or ten either; some part of that oil we had collected from accidents with jars; we had been two years and upwards collecting it.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion of it came from the jars, one gallon or twenty? - A. More than twenty, or twice twenty, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the rest come from? - A. From leakages, by fox's tails, from casks.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you venture to swear that a drop of Gallipoli oil came from the jars? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that sample; is that Gallipoli oil? - A. I am not judge enough of oils to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is worth most, Gallipoli oil, or jar oil? - A. I believe there are some in jars that are as bad as Gallipoli oil.</p>
               <p>Q. The jar oil is for eating, is it not, for sallads? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Gallipoli oil is sent round Wiltshire and Bristol, for the use of the clothiers? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send out this cask? - A. I helped to get it out of Mr. Aylwin's vaults.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever called upon by Mr. Aylwin to pay any sum of money for deficiency of oil by regular leakage? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you pay them for is for accidents, not for leakage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swear that the oil sold to Mr. Hubbock, was a mixture of jar and Gallipoli oil? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Gooden had sold oils to Mr. Hubbock before this? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not receive a share of fifteen pounds in February last, for a parcel of oils sold to Mr. Hubbock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You have not paid any thing to Messrs. Aylwin's on account of this oil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not called upon Mr. Aylwin to make up their accounts, and have they not refused to furnish you with their accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this place? - A. Four years and a half.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight other witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>MARY FAIRFAX sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to the shop of Mrs. Oliver, in Fleet-street, in August last? - A. Yes; it is a kind of a toy-shop and silversmith's-shop; a lady came in to buy a pair of scissars, they came to one shilling and sixpence, and she put down a guinea; I went to Mrs. Else's to get change, I got a half-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, a half-crown, and one shilling; I laid down the half-guinea before her, and it rung very well at first, but when she rung it again, it rung like a farthing; a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bad half-guinea? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ELSE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Fleet-street: I gave the last witness change for a guinea, I gave her a half guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the half-guinea was a good one? - A. Yes, all the money was good; the half-guinea was brought back to me as a bad one; I went back with it, and said it was not the half-guinea I had given, and gave charge of the prisoner to a constable.</p>
