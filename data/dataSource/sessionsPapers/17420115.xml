               <p>Crowther. I mention'd that Mr. Crew had lost 15 Brace of Pheasants from Farnham-Royal , and he then owned that himself and Brown took them out of the Pens, and that he held the Bag while Brown put them into it. He likewise said, that he went that Way some Time ago, and heard the Cock Pheasants crow, which brought him to the Pens now. That he brought 9 only out of the 30 alive to Town, and had fed them with Bread and Meat at the Cart and Horse in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Thomas Green. On the 16th of Dec. the two Prisoners came to my Master, Mr. Lipscomb's Shop in St. James's Market, and offer'd 6 Pheasants for Sale. I had before this seen an Advertisement of some Pheasants that had been lost, upon which I charg'd a Constable with them, and carried them before Mr. Deveil, who committed them to the Gatehouse for farther Examination.</p>

I imagined at first that these were the Earl of Essex's Pheasants, therefore I went to his Lordship's House, but he not being at Home, we took the Pheasant-Keeper with us, and went directly before Mr. Deveil, and before we got there, Brown contradicted what he had told me, and said he bought the Pheasants on the Road.</p>

A Day or two afterwards there came full Evidence of both Robberies, and I then had the Prisoners again before me. Davis then confessed Mr. Crew's Robbery, and describ'd the Place in such a manner, that it was known to be Farnham Royal, and discover'd the Poulterers where the Pheasants were sold.</p>

I asked him how he came by it, and he said he had sav'd it out of his Labour. I told him, if it was so, he had no Reason for making me come after him so often for Money for the Watch. I look'd upon the Money, and found a very remarkable half Crown, which I told him I would keep and shew to the Justice: I happen'd at that Time to be busie , and sent for two of my Headboroughs, and gave the Money to Mr. Edwards, who has kept it in his Custody ever since.</p>

I took them before the Justice, but there being no body that could swear to the Fowls, the Prisoners were discharg'd. The Justice took an Inventory of the Things, and the Tuesday following, the old Man (Simmonds) came to Town and swore to the Money. The Prisoners then absconded for eight Days, and when they came up to Town again I took them. This is the half Crown that Mr. Haine deliver'd to me.</p>

            . I am Cook to my Lord Fitzwalter; on the 26th, of Dec. the Prisoner came to my Lord's House to see a Relation of his who was employ'd to Work there, and on the Monday following we miss'd the Dish. We had very great Reason to suspect that he had taken it; upon which Mr. Longmore and Mr. Jervis went to Gravesend after him, and when the Prisoner was brought to my Lord's House, I ask'd him how he could do such Things? he reply'd, he was very sorry, and wish'd the Dish had been in the House an hundred Times after he had taken it out. He likewise own'd that he himself scrap'd the Coat of Arms out of the Dish, but denied that he cut it into Pieces.</p>
               <p>Pris. I did not take the Arms out of the Dish, nor cut it to Pieces; one of my Shipmates did.</p>

            . On the first of this Month, at the Desire of my Lord Fitzwalter, I went down to Gravesend with Mr. Longmore, in Pursuit of the Prisoner. It seems he had told somebody that he belonged to the Defence, Capt. Coates, upon which we examined there, and could not find him; but we were directed to go on board the Augustus , Capt. Townshend Accordingly I went on Board the Augustus , and told the Mate that I came to enquire for a Silver Dish that had been lost, therefore desir'd to have the Prisoner's Chest upon the Quarter-deck, that I might search for it; but instead of that, the Mate brought up the Dish, cut into four Pieces as it is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Conversation with the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Jervis. On the Quarter-deck I asked him, how he could rob my Lord, where his Aunt lived, and he said, his Aunt at Knightsbridge gave him the Dish, and as I was going over the Gangway, I told him, if he could prove it was not my Lord's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150005"/> Dish, he should have it again. I never had any Discourse with him afterwards, but left him on board the Ship , and the Butler and I brought the Dish to London .</p>
               <p>Wm Saunders . I was sent down to Gravesend with my Lord Fitzwalter's Butler to fetch the Prisoner. He was brought ashore to us , and we put him into Gravesend Goal , and as we were putting on his Hand-cuffs, he cried, and wished the Dish was as safe in the House, as it was when he took it out</p>

I attempted to get from her into the Middle of the Highway, and some Fellows jostled me, and kept me close to her. Immediately I felt a Hand in my Pocket; I can't say I could tell whose it was, but she stuck so close to me, that I can't think it was any but her's</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any Thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. Yes: I lost a green silk Purse, with a Steel Seal in it, and about 16 s. in Silver, and perceiving my Purse go, I cry'd out Murder or three Times, and then the Prisoner loosed her Hold.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that, can you take upon you to say, you had your Purse in your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. About a Quarter of an Hour before I came from Newgate street: I had just received ten Shillings and put it into my Purse.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. How far did she walk that Night before this besel her?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. From the Place that is called Blowbladder street, which is about a Quarter of a Mile I believe.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Might you not have had the Money taken privately from you before you met with me?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols No, I felt it go at this Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the Woman ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. Yes, it was not quite dark, but very Moon-light , and there was not a shop shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. As the Prisoner was behind you, how could you take Notice of her Face?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. With my struggling, I turn'd about with my Face to her's .</p>

            . On the 4th, of January, about 6 in the Evening, I was going down the Poultry , and a little beyond the Compter I met the Prisoner and this Gentlewoman (Mrs. Nichols) as near together as it is possible for two Women to be, and both of them surrounded by a parcel of Men. I knowing Mrs. Nichols, and hearing her cry out Murder, I stepp'd up to her, but before I could get up to her, the Prisoner had made her way through the other part of the Mob. I can't say that I saw her run, but I think she went off in the usual Manner.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the Woman that you saw so near Mrs. Nichols?</p>
               <p>Offley. Yes, I am certain she is the Person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain of being robbed at that Time?</p>
               <p>Offley. Yes, about three Minutes after the Woman was gone, she stepped into the Entry at the Compter, and said she had been robb'd.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. You say there was a great Croud of People; were not a great many as near to the Gentlewoman as I?</p>
               <p>Offley. To the best of my Knowledge there was no Person so near Mrs. Nichols as the Prisoner.</p>

            . On Monday about the fourth of this Instant , about 6 o'Clock, I was coming from King Street, Cheapside, and when I came within a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150006"/> few Yards of the Poultry, I saw six or seven Men hauling the Gentlewoman, and pushing her to and fro'. She cryed out, but I can't be certain what the Words were : I believe it was Murder , but I can't be certain. It being pretty near the Compter Passage; I apprehended they were taking her into the Compter , upon which I went up to them , and just as I came even with them, they all separated and left the Gentlewoman to herself . I then observed her clap her Hand to her Side, and thought I heard her say, her Watch! her Watch! Then the Prisoner crossed the Way on the other Side of the Poultry. She went an exceeding Pace, sometimes walked, and sometimes ran, so that I could not keep Pace with her without sometimes running myself , and upon her coming from them, and making such Haste , I believed her to be a Person concerned. When she came to the Corner of Walbrook , she turned down, and I believe might be a dozen Yards before me. I followed her to see where she went, and when I turn'd the Corner, I saw her take off her Cloak, and put it under her Arm, and run with full Speed. I then thought she certainly had the Watch about her, upon which I ran and grasp'd hold of her, and told her, she had stolen a Watch. It was just by the Poulterer's Shop that I first seized her, and a Man came out of the Shop to my Assistance, and took hold of her likewise. Immediately I heard two Blows behind me, and the Person that had got hold of the Prisoner's Arm reel'd a little on one Side . Soon afterwards I received a Blow myself on the Side of my Head, and turning about to see from whence it came, the Prisoner sprang out of my Arms . I pursued her, crying out Stop Thief! up Buckler's Bury, I overtook her again, and stopped her a second Time, and call'd for Assistance. Upon which, I heard the Person that followed her, strike about very smartly with his Stick, and I desired the Person , at whose Door I seized her, to let me bring her in, but he held the Door against me. I then took her into the House of one Mr. Bingham, a Silk-Dyer, and told her, she had stole a Watch, upon which, she was very willing to be searched, and turned a Purse and other Things out of her Pocket. She pretended that she was entirely innocent of the Matter , and that she was going to the Bottom of Walbrook to see a Friend who was going out of Town . After we had staid some Time at Mr. Bingham's, the Person was brought in that follow'd us, striking those that endeavoured to take the Prisoner, and we carried them both to the Watch-house, where the Man pull'd out a Purse and shook some Silver out of it into his Hand. They were been carried next Day before the Alderman at Guildhall , and ordered to be search'd; and the Woman then produc'd a green Purse, and the Man a light blue one , which I can take my Oath was not the same that he pull'd out at the Watch-house</p>

            . I was not present when the Fact was committed , but I was going from Walbrook towards Cheapside, and by the Poulterer's Shop, facing the Mantron-house, I saw this Man (Garnal ) holding that Woman at the Bar. He said , she had stole a Watch, and desired me to assist him. I was at a Loss whether I should stop or go past, and just as I came up to them , a Man rush'd from Cheapside, and struck me over the Head. I asked him, why he struck me ? and he said , she was his Wife, and he knew she was innocent . While he was repeating these Words, he redoubled his Blows, and struck me again , and likewise the Man that had hold of the Prisoner. She then ran with the Man that struck us, up Buckler's Bury, and so we pursued them, crying Stop Thief! The other People ran faster than I, so that I was a little distanc'd, and saw no more of them 'till I came to the upper End of Buckler's-Bury, and perceiving the Man using his Stick as smartly as before, I seized him; the Woman was taken by somebody else at the same Time, and when they came together they denied that they had ever seen each other before.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the Prisoner to that Man when they ran off together?</p>
               <p>Lesley. They were so near that I can't fix any Distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to be acquainted with each other?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner in hearing then?</p>
               <p>Lesley. She was near enough to hear, and did not contradict it; but whether her struggling with this Man might not prevent her hearing it , I can't say.</p>

            . On Monday the fourth of this Instant, I was standing at my Door in Buckler's-Bury , and heard a Cry of stop Thief; and seeing the Prisoner run very fast up the Street, I took hold of her. She struggled with me very much, and in the mean Time

He got me into a House, and I was searched, and I had neither Gold nor Money, but half a Guinea and a Shilling in my Pocket .</p>

            . Last Monday was seven-night, a little before Night, the Prisoner call'd at my House , and said, she was going down to Wapping, to enquire after some Country People, and desired me to go with her. She hurt her Foot going along, and we went Arm in Arm down the City; and just by the Poultry-Compter, (I think they call it ) a Croud of People came by, and shov'd me down, and so we parted.</p>
               <p>C. Did you hear any Out-cry in the Street then?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, but there was a whole Heap of People came along and parted us, and tumbled me down.</p>
               <p>C. When you fell down, what Distance was the Prisoner from you?</p>
               <p>Smith. I can't tell; she was shov'd away from me as I suppose.</p>
               <p>C. Why did not you ask for your Companion when you got up?</p>
               <p>Smith. Who should I ask among Strangers? I turn'd about to look for her, but could not see her.</p>
               <p>C Were you at any Time near the Poultry-Compter Door?</p>

               <p>Smith I think this was against the Church.</p>
               <p>C. Was there nothing said of the Loss of a Watch in your hearing?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Smith. I was going to my Mother's in East-Smithfield, and the Prisoner having some Business at Wapping, I was to go Part of the Way with her. I live in Shoe lane; my Husband is a Journeyman Brasier, and I have known the Prisoner about half a Year.</p>

            . I am Daughter to the last Witness. On the 23d of Dec. I went to the Prisoner's House, and while Lumley and I were at Dinner, the other Prisoner came in. When we had din'd we went to our House, and when I had put on a clean Apron, we went out to go as far as the Fleet: there were the two Prisoners, my Sister, and I together, and when the Man (Burgess) came as far as St. Andrew's Church in Holborn, he swore he would go no farther. She (Lumley) would have gone on with us, but he made her go back with him, and so I and my Sister parted from them. We went then as far as the Fleet, and as we came along from thence, we called at another Place, so that it was near six o'Clock when we got Home.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Condition did you find the House then?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. We found the Street Door and the Parlour Window both open, and we directly missed all the Goods that are in the Indictment. My Father advertised them on the Thursday, and on the Friday, which was Christmas-Day, this Gold Ring was brought to our House by Mr. Manners , a Goldsmith in the Strand. After this I went to the Swan Tavern the Corner of Newport Market , where I receiv'd Instructions from several of our Relations, how I should go to find the Prisoners. Accordingly the Goldsmith's Maid and I went to the Prisoner's Lodging, and took them both out of Bed, and carry'd them to the Tavern. We then went before the Justice, and there the Woman confessed she had the Things, and where they were, but the Man denied that he knew any Thing of the Matter. She own'd that she had the Things, and that they were at her Lodging in May-Fair , and said that he (Burgess) had the Key in his Pocket, and that he had baited her to do it. Burgess afterwards took the Key out of his Pocket himself, and deliver'd it to her, and we open'd the Room Door with it, and found all the Things that are in this Sack. She likewise told us, that the Gown and Petticoat, and the Ring with 6 Diamonds , were in pawn in Marlborough-Meuse , and she went with us to the Pawnbroker's, and we found them accordingly. At another of the Prisoner's Lodgings in Newport Market we found my

            , jun. I went with my Uncle and Cousin to Mr. Manner's, and they describing the Woman Prisoner, we agreed that Mr. Manners's Girl and my Sister should go to their Room. Accordingly they did, and Manners's Servant knowing her to be the Person that had been at their Shop, the Prisoners were both brought to the Tavern. From thence we carried them before Justice Fraser, and we went into the Entry with the Woman Prisoner, where she confessed that she pick'd open the Locks of the Drawers with a Knife, and took the Things away in a Sheet: that she carried them into Russel-street , and ty'd them up, and then gave a Man 3 d to carry them into Hanover Yard, where her Husband was waiting for her, and that he (Burgess) carry'd them to May-Fair . When the Justice had examin'd the Prisoners, we took Burgess to the Round-house till next Morning, and when we left him there, Lumley desired him to give her the Key of the Room: he at first denied that he had it, but afterwards gave it to her, and then she told me, if I would go with her she would shew us where the Things were. Upon this we took a couple of Coaches, and went to May-Fair , and open'd the Room Door, and found all the Things that are in this Sack, after which she herself pull'd a Tile out of the Hearth, and took out 2 Gold Rings, a pair of Ear Bobs, and a pair of Gold Buttons. We afterwards carried her to the Gatehouse, where she told us she had pawn'd the Petticoat, Gown, and Diamond Rings at Marlborough-Meuse , and a pair of Sheets in West street, and we found them accordingly.</p>

            , Constable. On Christmas Day at Night, I was sent for to the Swan Tavern , and charg'd with the 2 Prisoners. I took them before Justice Fraser , who examin'd them, but they both denied the Fact. After they had been there some Time, the Woman Prisoner went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150009"/> into the Passage with this Gentleman, that Gentlewoman and myself, and she own'd to us that she had taken the Things and wrapp'd them up in a Sheet, and going along, she dropp'd the Cup or the Mug, and kick'd it before her, and pick'd it up again: that when she came into Russel-street , she ty'd the Things up tight, and gave a Man 3 d. to carry them to Hanover-Yard . Upon this I told the Justice if he discharg'd the Man Prisoner, he would go and secure the Goods; but the Justice refusing to detain him, I order'd him to aid and assist me. He refused, upon which I again insisted on his being confin'd, and then he was sent to St. Ann's Round-house. When we came there, the Woman said to him, Burgess! you have got the Key of the Room! No, (said he) I have it not: Why (said I) when I search'd you just now, you had it in your Pocket. He then deliver'd the Key to her, and that very Key unlock'd the Door in May Fair where these Goods were. After this, Lumley went with us to Mr. Young's a Pawnbroker in Marlborough-Meuse , where the Gown, Petticoat, and Rings were pawn'd; and the Sheets we found by her Direction pawn'd at a Neighbours. When we came to the Gatehouse , she told me she had sold some Things to Mr. Manners's, upon which I went there, and found some Silver Tea Spoons, and Part of a large Spoon broken, and one that the Silversmith said he had melted down. It was near 11 o'Clock that Night before we got her to the Gatehouse , and this Gentleman, (Simmonds, jun.) and I went with her to her Room in Newport-Market, to fetch her Pockets and other Things, that she was to take with her to Prison. We asked her if there was any Things concealed there, and at first she said there was not, but afterwards she said she had often heard her Husband talk of hiding Things under the Bricks and Tiles, and she went directly to the Hearth, and took up a Tile, and found 2 Rings and these Buttons.</p>

            . I happen'd to be in the Neighbourhood where my Brother Simmonds lives , and being inform'd he had been robb'd, I went to him, and we agreed to draw up an Advertisement , and go to Goldsmith's Hall. On Christmas-Day this Ring was produc'd, upon which we went to Mrs. Manners and were told by her Maid that she should know the Woman Prisoner again. Upon this we agreed, that as my Neice was pretty well acquainted with the Prisoner, she and Manners's Maid should go together to see if she knew her. When they came there, she said she would swear to her, and then we went up Stairs, and took them out of Bed, and carry'd them before the Justice, where the Woman Prisoner confessed the Robbery in the same manner as has been told before. We took the Man to St. Ann's Round-house, and just as we were going away, his Wife (Lumley) said, Burgess! you have got the Key! and he said, I have it not: but the Constable telling him that he had got it in his Side Pocket, he gave the Key directly to his Wife. After we had secured him, we took a couple of Coaches and went away, and found all the Things that are in this Sack.</p>

            , jun. was present when the Prisoners were apprehended, and heard some Part of Lumley's Confession before the Justice. He confirm'd the above Depositions, so far as they related to the Goods found at the Prisoner's Lodgings in May-Fair .</p>
               <p>Lumley's Defence. This Man (Burgess) is innocent of the Matter. My two Cousins din'd at our House that Day the Robbery was committed, and when he came Home he was drunk. We were going to the Fleet to see Mr. Jones , and he came along with us as far as St. Andrew's Church, and then he would go no farther, but took hold of me, and said I should go back with him into Newport-Market . Accordingly I did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150010"/> and he laid down on the Bed for a Quarter of an Hour, and then went out. My Cousin charg'd me that very Night to come to their House, and when I came there, the Street Door was open, and in I went, and took these Things. I hired a Man in Plumbtree-Court to carry them to May-Fair, and was to give him 6 d. for his Trouble ; and in May Fair I found this Man (Burgess) and he carry'd them Home for me, and I concealed several of the Things under my own Cloaths because he should not see them.</p>

            . The Prisoner and one Carpenter ask'd me to go out with them, and when we came a little way, they told me they were going to break open a wholesale Shop at Harlingston ; but meeting Pig's Mother by the way, we were forc'd to seperate, and he went Home with her. About ten the same Night we went from Pig's House with a Sack in order to break open this Shop; but being disappointed in that and some other Designs, we were not willing to go Home without something , and at last we agreed to have a couple of Sheep out of a Fold that we had gone past that Afternoon. Pig caught one and put it into the Sack , and I caught another and tied the Legs of it, and then we carried them both to Mr. Pig's House. The next Morning we stead the Sheep , and then I sent him out for some Bread and Beer, and when he came back again, he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150011"/> his Wife some Men were coming to search; upon which I put the Sheep into a little Closet; the Guts and the Skins I put into the Chimney, and cover'd them with a Rug, after which I walk'd out pretty leisurely, 'till I got some distance from the House, and then I began to run. I had not gone far before I met with Pig, and we agreed to cross the Thames, and make our Escape to East-Ham : Accordingly we went to one Will. Clement's at Shugg's-Hill , and after we had been there some time the Prisoner was taken.</p>

On the 13th of December, we both went to a Brandy-shop, the Corner of Gravel-lane , and got almost fuddled, and then, we resolved to do it. I help'd him over the Wall, and then he open'd the Back-gate to me that leads into Bell-Alley, and as soon as I came in, he broke open the Place, and we took away a Stew-pan, 2 Sauce-pans, a Pair of new Shoes, a Pewter Dish, and a Cloak and Riding hood.</p>

            . Last Monday was sevennight, at almost Twelve at Night, I met the Prisoner in Long-lane. He was asking Charity, and begg'd for God's Sake that I would relieve him. I told him it was not in my Power to relieve him, but I was going to the Red-lion in Aldersgate street, and if he would accept of Part of a Tankard of Beer, he should be welcome. We went into the Golden-horse Alehouse, and called for Beer, and when we were coming out, I told him, I was as destitute of a Lodging as he; upon which he said, he could help me to one. He then took me up Barbican into Golden-Lane , and then into Hartshorn-Court, where he said, he had got a Sw eetheart, and he would make her get up, and I should go to Bed. I did not like the Looks of the House, therefore would not go in; and he then shewed me another Place, where there was a Light; but I did not care to go in there neither, and so I determined to go to my own Lodging; and just as I came back to the House where he would have had me gone in first, he knock'd me down; I can't tell whether it was with his Fist or a Weapon, but my Face was very black. When he had got me down, he took off my Hat and Wig, and a Guinea in Gold, 4 s. in Silver, and a silk Hankerchief out of my Pocket. As soon as I recovered myself, I ran down some Alleys and call'd Watch! and I told the Watchman I had been robb'd, and that I believed the Prisoner was gone down some of those Alleys, but not being able to find him , I went to the Watch-house, and shewed the Beadle the Place where I was robb'd. I afterwards went with one of the Watchmen to the Golden Horse to see if they knew the Prisoner, but they denied that they knew any Thing of him, upon which I went back to the Watch-house, and after I had got a Handkerchief to tie about my Head, I went Home. The next Morning about ten o'Clock, the Watchmen came to my Lodging, and inform'd me they had found a Wig, and when I saw it, I knew it to be mine. They said, they would go to a Place where they suspected the Prisoner was, and would help me to the sight of him. Accordingly they went into a House, and I follow'd them, but the Place was so dark, that I came out again; and one of the Watchmen told me, the Person whom they suspected was there, and he was going to a Cook's Shop, and if I would set down on the Bench, I might have a full View of him. Presently he came out, and as soon as I saw his Face, I knew him to be the Man that robbed me. We went back to the Watch-house, and three Men were dispatch'd to take him, and when he was brought into the Room, he immediately came up to me, fell on his Knees, and desired me not to prosecute him, for so sure as I did, he should be hang'd; and this he repeated several Times.</p>

               <p>Pris. Where did you carry me to?</p>

            . I am a Watchman in the Liberty of Golden-Lane. Last Tuesday Morning at Two o'Clock, I was beating my Rounds in Hartshorn-Court, and heard a Man call Watch! Just by the Pump I saw the Prosecutor; he had a Blow on the Right Side of his Face, and he told me he had been knock'd down and robb'd. I bid him come along with me and I'd see if I could find the Prisoner. We went down some Alleys to no Purpose and then the Prosecutor went to the Watch-house, and we parted. When the Prisoner was taken and brought to the Watch-house, he fell on his Knees once or twice, and begg'd of the Prosecutor not to send him to Goal, for if he did, he was sure to be hang'd. He likewise did the same when he was before Justice Poulson.</p>

We went down to the Watch-House, and told the Beadle of this, upon which he desired the Prosecutor not to take the Man up if he was not sure he was the Person, but he still insisted that he was the Man, and he should know him from ten Thousand. We then went, and apprehended him, and brought him to the Watch-House, and he directly went up to the Prosecutor, and said, for God's Sake don't prosecute me, for I shall be hang'd.</p>

            . I live next Door to the Prisoner: Last Monday was 7-night , at Night, my Mistress desired the Prisoner to let me lie with him, and as I was going to Bed the Prisoner desired me to stay and sup with him; accordingly I did, and before twelve o'Clock, the Prisoner and all of us were a-bed .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you remember that Day?</p>
               <p>Hodges. Because the Prisoner was taken up next Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business do you follow?</p>
               <p>Hodges. I am a Frame Maker by Trade, but now Business is dead, I run on Errands.</p>
               <p>Q. What House is this in Hartshorn-Court ?</p>
               <p>Hodges. It is a sort of a Brandy-shop kept by one Mrs. Bagley.</p>

            . I have nothing to say on Account of the Prisoner, only this, that he is not the Person that came into the Golden Horse Alehouse with the Prosecutor, last Monday 7-night at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Beversley. Because I let them in, and took particular Notice of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of Night was the Prosecutor there?</p>
               <p>Beversley. He came in about Twelve, and staid a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there at that Time of Night.</p>
               <p>Beversley. I assisted the People of the House, because it was Club Night, and the Gentleman of the House was angry, because I let Strangers in.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take on you to say the Prisoner is not the Man, that came in with the Prosecutor.</p>

            . I live in the lower Room under the Prisoner: There was a Sort of a Bit of a Supper that Night, and the Prisoner went up to Bed between Twelve and One , and the Door was bolted. I sat by the Fire-side when the Scuffle of the Robbery was done, and I heard some-body cry, Aye Boy! I can't tell who it was; presently one ran up the Alley, and then the Watchman came almost Two. I heard a Man call Watch! and the Watchman cryed, Aye Boy! What's the matter now? My Wife went out at Three o'Clock to visit a Woman who was dying; and I went down and bolted the Door after her and no-body went out afterwards.</p>

            . I was at Dinner at the Black-Horse in Golden-Lane at the same Time that the Prisoner was taken up. The Prosecutor said the Prisoner had pick'd him up in Long-Lane, and took him to the Golden Horse in Aldersgate street and treated him with a Pint of Two-penny Purl, after which he knock'd him down and robb'd him under Pretence of getting him a Lodging: I hearing this went to the House, and asked them what Sort of a Man was there last Night: They told me he was a swarthy Man, thin visag'd, and with brown Cloaths on. I desired them to go down to New-Prison to see the Prisoner, and Mr. Bradford and some others went, and said he was not the Man.</p>

               <p>It was farther urg'd by the Councel on the same Side, that although the Articles with which the Defendant stood charg'd might seem to be but inconsiderable, yet that where some Things were conceal'd, there was great Reason to apprehend that others had been conceal'd; and that a Man who would be guilty of Perjury in one Instance would in others: That it appeared from the Face of the Indictment that the Prisoner stood charg'd with 4 Instances of Perjury; and that if one of them should be prov'd, that would be sufficient to convict the Defendant. That although he had taken a general Oath to reveal all his Effects according to Act of Parliament, yet notwithstanding that he was actually possess'd of a Copper of which he made no mention at all in his Account deliver'd to the Commissioners; likewise 2 Stove Grates, and a Shop Book, which would appear to be very material; and besides these he had conceal'd a large quantity of Brasiery Goods:</p>

               <p>Cardel. For Money; I can't say any of them asked me for Money, but I knew they were Creditors: By one Person I was ask'd for Money, and I judg'd them all to come a dunning for Money, for I had seen them several Times before on the same Errand .</p>

               <p>Mr. Hambleton. Within these 2 Months I have several Times missed Money out of my Pockets while I have been abed, and never could detect the Person that robb'd me, and therefore I was resolv'd to be patient till I could fix on somebody. I generally missed 2 Guineas every other Morning, therefore used to keep myself awake as long as I possibly could , not knowing at what Hour he might come in. On Thursday Morning the 24th of last Month, the Prisoner came into my Room: He came to the Bed Side to listen whether I was a sleep, and I breath'd hard as if I had been asleep He then went from the Bed Side, upon which I raised myself up, and look'd through the Curtain, and I saw him take my Breeches off the Window, and go off with them into an opposite Chamber. I immediately got out of Bed, and look'd at him, and I saw my Breeches on the Chest. He had taken my Purse out of my Pocket, and I saw him take something out of the Purse and put into his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150019"/> Pocket, and then he put the Purse into the Breeches in order I suppose to return them into my Chamber . I imagined that he had taken some Money, and I thought it was then a proper Time to go out and seize him, accordingly I went in upon him, and took him by the Collar. He was very much surprized , and while the Servants were in the Room, he denied that he knew any Thing of the Matter; but when they were withdrawn, he fell on his Knees and begg'd that I would not take away his Life. The Night before this I counted my Money when I went to Bed, and put 10 Guineas in my Purse, and when I examined it next Morning, there were but 8 remaining. When I went before Mr. Deveil, I desired to have a Search Warrant, and I sent for the Prisoner's Box. He then fell on his Knees and said he had taken but 10 Guineas, but I think we found in the Box 18 Guineas and some Silver, and 3 Guineas he had in his Pocket, all which he said was mine, and desired it might be given to me.</p>
               <p>John Brown. I have known the Prisoner about 3 Quarters of a Year, and never heard any Thing against his Character before .</p>

Then they said, if I would not have any more, I should pay for what had been call'd in, and they began to swear and threaten me, therefore I pulled out my Money to pay for it, and they seeing my Money, that Woman at the Bar laid hold of my Hand and took it from me. There were three Guineas in Gold, a Moidore, a French Crown, some Silver, and a few Halfpence; the whole I believe was about 5 l. 6 s or thereabouts. The Prisoner wrench'd my Money out of my Hands, some of which she got, and the rest fell on the Floor, and I then cryed out Murder! upon which she called for a Knife, and swore she would stop my cackling presently. Seeing some of my Money on the Floor, I attempted to take it up, and then they sent to the Sign of the Porto-Bello, and six or seven Fellows came with Sticks, and began to beat me, and the Persons who came to my Assistance in a very violent Manner.</p>

I was in the House when the Prisoner was taken up, which was on Christmass Eve, and that Man in the white Coat and white Wig, (Sugden) came in with the Constable , and said he had lost so much Money, and right or wrong he would swear to the Prisoner. I was there when the Man came in first and the Prisoner was not then in the House, but came in a Quarter of an Hour afterwards. He might as well charged me as her. I did not see him pull out any Money, neither did I hear any Cry of Murder, but there was something of a Noise above-Stairs, and then I went out.</p>
