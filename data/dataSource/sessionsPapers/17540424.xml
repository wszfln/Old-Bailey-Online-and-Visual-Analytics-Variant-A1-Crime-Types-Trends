I went to a scale-beam maker, and desired him to stamp five shillings in halfpence with a cypher, which he did; I put it in the till in the morning; I missed some; I sent for a constable and took him up and searched him, and found twenty-pence of the halfpence that was marked, and five shillings in halfpence, which he had taken from out of another place, with the paper with the letter G on it, that they came in to me.

               <p>I have this to say for myself : This woman that they call my first wife, she gave out that she was not married to me; it was a drunken frolick at Welch's house, and he must be a very bad man to let the last wife be with me two hours in his house before we were married, and have a wedding dinner there, if he knew I had another wife living. This old woman gave it out that she was dead, and Welch told me if I would give him 5 l. I should hear no more of it. I own my selling some of my wife's goods in order to pay Welch for what I had expended in beer. The old woman said after this that if I would go to any remote part of the world with her she would go with me, for she was ashamed to live with me where she was known, she being so old, and myself a young man. This Welch will forswear himself presently, I hope, my Lord, you will not take his part.</p>

I said I did not, but they hurried me away to the Gatehouse directly.</p>

            . The prosecutrix lived servant with a son of mine. She was paid her wages, and going away missed her things; the prisoner was at our house, and I charged her with taking them. She denied it, and said she would go to all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240006"/> the pawnbrokers to clear herself. I then went to, I believe, 40 of them, and found the goods at a pawnbroker's in Bow-Street. I shewed the man a paper of the things, which were produced, and then went to take up the prisoner, and brought her; she then confessed that she had pawned them there We took her before Justice St. Lawrence, and there she confessed the same.</p>

I took it and went to Mr. Brown's at the Three Balls, on Snow-Hill; he asked me what I was to have upon it, and I said a guinea; he asked who was the master of it, and I saying it was not mine, he desired me to bring the master of it, and he might have the money.

            . On Christmas eve last the prisoner came and asked me to walk with him to Chelsea to his usurer whose name is Cammel. I went with him, and we had two pints of beer. Coming back I asked him if he had received his money, and he pulled out five or six guineas. When we came to his house his wife was a little disguised in liquor, and they began to quarrel. Presently after that a gentleman's servant knocked at the door, (I had seen him before at the Red-Cross in Tothil-Street) and said, Dick, I have brought the things. He had a looking-glass in a cloth in his hand, and there were two men with him, one of whom had a bed, and the other had the other things in a case. I saw the prisoner give the gentleman's servant 5 l. 10 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's business?</p>
               <p>Borroughs. I never knew him trade in any thing before; but he told me that he was going to take a larger house, and he wanted these goods to furnish it.</p>

I lodge at Mr. Watts's; I met the prisoner with the things in a bundle coming down stairs; I asked him what he had there, knowing he did not belong to the house? he answered, they did not belong to me. I laid hold of him, but he gave me a shove and ran away with the things; I called out stop him, and ran after him, and he was stopped near Russel-Court. I heard him own he took them.</p>

The watchman knocked at the door and ordered me to carry two full pots of beer to a neighbour, I sent them by my girl; she left the door on a jar to let herself in. She came in in about ten minutes, and then I missed the bason and halfpence. I, by enquiring, found the two prisoners had been in my house. I took them up that night on suspicion, and they confessed they took the bason and money, and that there were seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny of it; and they had about them both six shillings and eightpence in halfpence; they said, they had broke the bason in Aldersgate-street and thrown it away.</p>

            . Not the prisoner. I pursued after him that had the hat, and the prisoner and another ran after me; when I was within about twenty yards of the person that had my hat he turned again into the market-house: then the prisoner took hold of me and said, this is he. I was pretty near the Harrow alehouse; there stood a watchman; I called him to my assistance, and we took him and another person (knowing them to be of the company that took my hat) to the watch-house, and they were committed: I do not pretend to say the prisoner was a confederate; I never got my hat again.</p>

               <p>James Purchase. On the 25th of March I was sitting minding my master's shop, and saw the ox's head lying on the stall, but presently missed it, and going behind the shop saw two lads walking up the back of the market, the prisoner being one of them; he had the head in his apron, and I took him. He told me the other was concerned with him, and desired I would run after him; but having no assistance I secured the prisoner only. He afterwards owned that they were both together, and that the other lad took the head and put it into his apron, and he was going to sell it.</p>

            . I am mother to the child. [ She had it in her arms.] On the 28th of March last the prisoner was in my room, and the child was going wriggling about in a strange manner. I asked her what was the matter with her? I thought her petticoats were not tied tight enough, so I tied them tighter; but still she went the same. Then I took her down into the kitchen, and setting her in my lap looked at her, and found her shift was spotted as though a person had spit upon it who had a consumption; she was as raw about the private parts as if she had been skinned. I then sent a porter for my husband, and after that we took her to Mr. Hawkins's, a surgeon in Pallmall. He was not at home, but his servant was. I told him I suspected that the prisoner had used her ill, for he had but the day before confessed he had the foul disease, and also where he got it. It was his opinion the child had the foul disease. After this I went to Mr. Pinkstone in St. Alban's-Street; he examined the child, and said she had been very ill used by some man.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child?</p>
               <p>M. Holmes. She was born Jan. 3, 1750. My husband is a <rs id="t17540424-29-deflabel141" type="occupation">tailor</rs>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240011"/>Q. Is the child cured now?</p>
               <p>M. Holmes. She is not. Mr. Pinkstone gave me an unction to anoint her, and ordered me to wash the part with warm milk, which I still continue to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the surgeon here ?</p>
               <p>M. Holmes. No, he is not. He is gone to-day to set a person's leg, I think.</p>

            . I am aunt to the child. My sister came to me on the 28th of March, and told me she feared her child had been used ill by some man, and she suspected the prisoner. I went with her to Mr. Hawkins's, whose servant said she had been used ill by some man, and gave us a letter to go with her to the hospital. I saw the child's private parts were as raw as a piece of beef, and her thighs as hard as a stone; she ran like a tap, and her shift was black and yellow with the filth.</p>

On the 28th of this month I went to put in an advertisement at Mr. Jenour's, the printer of the Daily Advertiser, near St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-Street, about half an hour after eight at night. After I had been there I went in at an auction of books in Fleet-Street, and staid there about ten minutes; there I saw the prisoner at the bar, who asked me what it was o'clock, I pulled out my watch and told him it was about half an hour after nine; my watch was then too fast. We came out and walked together, I was going to Lombard-Street to put in letters at the post-office, we there wished each other a good night, and he left me. Having done my business there I went to St. Miles's-Lane to inquire at a coffee-house when the ship Phillis would go to Jamaica, and did not stay there a minute. From thence I came directly homewards, and when I came into <placeName id="t17540424-31-crimeloc154">Fetter-Lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did he strike you with?</p>
               <p>Stent. I can't tell what it was. As he struck me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240012"/> he spoke, and I understood hi m, You dog, deliver, or such like words. I was surprized, and taking out my watch gave it to him; he took it and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before told him where you lived?</p>
               <p>Stent. No; he asked me how far I was going, and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand when you were walking together ?</p>
               <p>Stent. He had a little switch in his hand, but I do not apprehend the blow was given with that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Stent. I am; after he struck me he stood before me, holding his hands out towards me, as in a posture of defence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Stent. It was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps near you ?</p>
               <p>Stent. There were none.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern his face ?</p>
               <p>Stent. I could see him standing before me in the same dress he had on when he walked with me before, and I recollected him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at the time you walked together, where he was going ?</p>
               <p>Stent. He said, he was going to Fenchurch-street; after he had got my watch he ran away across Fleetstreet: I called out, stop thief, and followed him, but he ran down Mitre Court, and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see any watchman ?</p>
               <p>Stent. No; I did not. Then I went home, and it was advertised to this purport: [That whereas a young gentleman in a laced hat was assaulted by a fellow, and robbed of his watch; he, by applying to justice Fielding, might hear of it.] As soon as I heard of it I went to justice Fielding, and he examined me; I was ordered to come again, which I did, and then saw the watch; [the watch produced in court by Mr. Hine, and deposed to by the prosecutor.] The prisoner was at this time in custody; he was brought to the justice's house; I knew him to be the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the exact time you was robbed ?</p>
               <p>Stent. I believe it was about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, he would not take upon him to swear to me.</p>
               <p>Stent. At first when he was brought in I said, I would not take upon me to swear directly that he was the person; but when I had heard him speak, and seen him a very litle time, I was positive he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought in amongst others, or singly ?</p>
               <p>Stent. He was brought in single.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. How came you to know me when I stood before you in the dark?</p>
               <p>Stent. I knew him to be the same person that had been with me before, by his voice and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Were they the same I have on now?</p>
               <p>Stent No; he then had on a sort of a white fustian</p>

               <p>Hine. Nokes said, he had put him off for that night, and ordered him to come again the next morning at eight o'clock. I went along with him in order to apprehend the man; going along we called upon Mr. Norden to take him with us. I said to Nokes, you had better go on, and we will follow you; Nokes described the man and left us: as we were going along we saw Nokes and the prisoner together, going towards the New Church in the Strand; we secured the prisoner, and in searching him there, found this silver watch; he was so terrified that his water came from him. We took him into the Barley-Mow, near justice Fielding's, there he was very uneasy, and desired we would go and sell him or any thing we thought proper, and he would go and sign any thing; justice Fielding not being at home, we carried him before Barwell Smith, there he confessed what sized young man he had robbed of the watch, and that he had a laced hat on. The advertisement was put in the paper according to the description he gave before the justice; he also owned he struck him with a little stick, and that he had seen him before at an auction of books that night, but said nothing of his going with him to the post-office.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Harding. I am a paviour, and work for Mr. Matthews, in Butcherhall-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay at your house that night?</p>
               <p>Harding. He staid there and slept in a chair all night; when I went out to work next morning he was then asleep; that was at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business at your house?</p>
               <p>Harding. We were just removed from one room to another; my wife washes for gentlemens servants, and they said they would have a sort of an house-warming; he came in with one we wash for; the prisoner had no business there, but came with the other man who had told him he was going to mother Harding's house, that other man is gone into the country now.</p>
               <p>Here the court ordered the evidence's wife out of court while he was examined.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to drink?</p>
               <p>Harding. Beer; about twelve or thirteen full-pots.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you?</p>
               <p>Harding. Five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Harding. I cannot say I was very sober, for I never went to bed at all; I only sat down upon it; I did not sleep at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you your beer ?</p>
               <p>Harding. We drank from about half an hour after seven o'clock; in the first place we had half a gallon of beer, and when that was out we had another, and drank successively 'till near four in the morning; we pour'd it out into full pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the company stay 'till that time?</p>
               <p>Harding. There were three went home; the prisoner and a young woman that was going into a service (and is now at the Red-Cross in Newgate-market, she is a Scotch girl) sat and slept 'till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the names of the persons?</p>
               <p>Harding. One was a man that lives at the Saracen's-Head, in Friday-street, he went away; the other was a woman, and the third a boy-like person that went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else stay besides the prisoner and the Scotch girl?</p>
               <p>Harding. Yes; there was another man staid.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms have you?</p>
               <p>Harding. We have but one; I was all the time in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the young man's name that brought the prisoner to your house?</p>
               <p>Harding. I do not know, he was an utter stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider what you say.</p>
               <p>Harding. I am upon my oath, I speak the truth, I came here on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has your wife washed for that man that brought him?</p>
               <p>Harding. About twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed?</p>
               <p>Harding. He had on a fustian frock, I believe with mohair buttons on it of the same colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what colour was the frock?</p>
               <p>Harding. It was of a lightish brown or drab colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a cape ?</p>
               <p>Harding. I believe it had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that place?</p>
               <p>Harding. I have lived there about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stent. What cloaths had the prisoner on when he walked with you?</p>
               <p>Stent. It was a white fustian, a little dirtyish, I think it was trimmed with black.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a cape?</p>
               <p>Stent. I think it had.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hines. What cloaths had the prisoner on when you took him?</p>
               <p>Hines. He had on a fustian frock that had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240014"/> white, but it was dirtyish, and I believe buttons of the same colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a cape to it?</p>
               <p>Hines. I cannot swear whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>Q to Harding. Was your wife with you all the time?</p>
               <p>Harding. She was, excepting the time she fetched a pot or two of beer</p>
               <p>Q Who fetched the rest of the beer ?</p>
               <p>Harding. No body fetched any but my wife.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner four or five years. On the 4th of March, about ten at night, I was drinking at the Cock alehouse, and hearing a noise in the street, went out; I saw there the deceased, whom I knew very well, the prisoner and he went for man and wife. I saw him use her very ill; he struck her two or three times, and knocked her up against a window shutter by striking her on the side of the head, I be-believe, as hard as he could, as it seemed to me by her falling about. After that she said, If you strike me again I'll stab you. He made another blow at her, and immediately cried out, I am a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them at this time?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I was very near them. He went into the Cock alehouse, I followed him, and clapped my hand over the wound till the surgeon came to dress it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and dressed the deceased after he was in the infirmary at Westminster. The next morning after he had received the wound he bled a good deal, and the wound seemed to be deep. We opened it farther, and it bled more; we tied it up, and he did not bleed till the next day, when he bled through all his dressings, and then ceased bleeding for about ten days. After that time he bled often during two days, and as we could not stop the bleeding he died, I believe, on the 21st day of that month.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death ?</p>
               <p>Curtise. To be sure this wound was. He was in a very bad habit of body before; for he did not look well at all.</p>

             and I, went all to Chelsea to take a walk, I am a shoemaker, Kelley was a runner at the Gatehouse. and the others I know to be common thieves, for I have been with them many a time.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went out, had you formed any scheme of going a robbing?</p>
               <p>Maddox. No, we went only for a walk; we went to a publick-house, facing the bunn-house, and drank five or six pots of beer and two half pints of gin; we then went away, and agreed to stop the first man we met; we walked all round Brumpton, but met no body that we thought proper to stop; but Knight seeing a window open in Brumpton said, there was a house that would do for us, and if I would give him a leg-up, he would get in; he got in, and threw out a bible, a pair of spectacles, and other things, and was just going to throw out the bed, had not the maid come up. We then came to Knightsbridge, and from thence were coming to St. Giles's, where we lodged; and as we came by Mrs. Trevill's house, Knight stopped and said to me, James, give me a leg-up, and I will get into the window; I took hold of one of his legs, and Barrat of the other, and we lifted him up into the window; he, being in liquor, fell down into the room; after he was in the flung out about six yards of cloth, fit for sheeting, a patelair and petticoat, a pair of stays and three bed-gowns, one was a cotton, the other two linnen.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the bed-gown; is that one of them? (he looks at it, and says) yes, my lord, I am sure it is. He afterwards flung out two or three old table-cloths, three or four old towels, and an apron</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the four men prisoners with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Maddox. Yes, they were; and when they were sold, they all took share of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they all assisted in this robbery?</p>
               <p>Maddox. They did, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods after they were delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Maddox. I tied them up in a table-cloth, and bade Barrat come along with me; I walked with the bundle upon my back as far as Hide-Park turnpike-gate, this was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark at that time?</p>
               <p>Maddox. It was. I then said to Barrat, do you carry them; he did, and carried them to Monmouth-street; then I took them again, and carried them to St. Giles's; as soon as we came home we looked over the things, which we commonly do, for fear we should cheat one another. The next morning we went to see if we could sell them, we went with them to Bloomsbury-square, they would not buy them. Then the prisoner

They shewed the things about and wanted to dispose of some of them, I don't know whether the landlady bought any or no, she is gone out of the way. Knight's wife happened to see this bedgown, and Knight asked him what he would have for it? He said he would give him 6 s. for it, ( if he came by it honestly) which was enough.</p>

I suspected the prisoner, and going to Justice Fielding's took out two search warrants, one against Mr. Pain of Golden-Lane, the other against Mr. Warner of St. John's-street. I went to Golden-lane and found some part of the goods, the buckles, which I miss'd the night before, and several other things which I had missed, but could not charge upon any particular person before. There was a ring, three pair of studs, one hat-buckle, and a shoe and knee-buckle, which I miss'd the night before. The others I found at Mr. Warner's, the other pawnbroker; there were five silver seal stocks, a pair of garnet earrings set in gold, a stone stock-buckle set in silver, and a silver hairpiece. The constable took them in his possession, and has had them ever since. The buckles were in possession of the prisoner the day before I missed them, and when I found the goods his name was upon all the tickets.</p>

My master had some intelligence that the prisoner had pawned the goods. As I was going along in order to see after them, I met him; he told me of the two pawnbrokers. Barnes (who is since dead, and whose widow is married to one Pain) was one, and Warner the other. He said the shoe-buckles were at Barnes's, but did not mention what was at Warner's.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, I know the prisoner very well: On the 30th of August, 1751, he brought to my house one stock-buckle, I lent him three shillings upon it; on the 4th of December he brought me five seal-stocks, I lent him two shillings upon them; on the 21st of December the search-warrant came from justice Fielding, brought by Mr. Maynard and the constable; I told them whatever their demands were I would give them without trouble; they demanded the five seal-stocks and the stock-buckle; I told them I thought I had something more in my house that they should have; I found a pair of garnet ear-rings, which came on the 10th of August, I lent him two shillings upon them; there was also one single hair-piece, which is here present, worth about fourteen-pence, that was pawned the 20th of December, I lent him six-pence upon that; I shewed them to Mr. Maynard, he said they were his property; then said I, take them, for I desire to have no man's property in my house: he swore to them before justice Fielding, and they were delivered to the constable; am sure they are the goods that were brought to my house.</p>

               <p>I had an execution out against me at the Court of Conscience for missing payment, and I never was before a justice. When I met Musgrave he told me, my master was going to have a warrant for me, I said, for what? he said, for such and such things; I was frightened, and went into the country; I came back about six weeks ago, and surrendered myself to my master, knowing myself innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maynard. Did he surrender himself voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Maynard. Five or six weeks ago I believe he came to surrender himself; he had worked for me six years before, and always was a very honest servant, and was able to get his twenty-seven and thirty shillings, I have paid him thirty-six shillings a week very often; I am very sorry I must appear against him now; I have intrusted him to melt gold for me to a considerable sum, and never missed one grain of it.</p>

On the 5th of March I lost a gold watch, six table spoons, four tea spoons, a silk camblet coat, and a waistcoat with 24 gold buttons; there were so many things that I could not put them all down in the indictment. I had given the prisoner warning, and gave her leave to go out on the Sunday; she said she was going to the Hermitage to see for a place. I went that day to my Lord Peterborough's, and staid there from Sunday to Tuesday. On the Tuesdays she came to me there and said, Madam, I have got a place. She desired me to give her the key of the dining room, which I delivered to her, and the key of my drawers, desiring her to bring me some things I wanted, for I was going out with the lady. When she returned I asked her if every thing was safe, and she said yes. At my return on Tuesday night I found the prisoner in the passage, as I believe going out. I asked her what she did there, and she made a frivolous excuse, saying, Nothing at all. She went up stairs with me, and the moment I came into the dining room there was all the sugar strewed over the table. She then asked me if I had taken the silver sugar dish away, I said no. On my going into the closet the spoons were missing, and looking at the bedside the watch was gone. I then called up a man and woman who lived in the house. They said they had lived there twelve years, and never lost any thing in their lives.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Lord Peterborough's to your house?</p>
               <p>Bulley. Not a quarter of a mile; she might go in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with being the person who took these things away, when you was out so long?</p>
               <p>Bulley. My Lord, if any body had opened the outer door they could not have opened the locks without breaking them; but there were no locks broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Bulley. I found nothing but the handkerchief, which was in the prisoner's box. [ The handkerchief produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that box?</p>
               <p>Bulley. It was left in my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her that handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Bulley. No. I never gave her any such thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her confess any thing relating to it?</p>
               <p>Bulley. She always said she knew nothing of it. I have sent to several pawnbrokers, but could not find any thing out. She is a Danish woman, and I believe the watch is gone to Denmark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing of your spoons?</p>
               <p>Bulley. No, I never did, nor of any thing else but the handkerchief. There was a boar's head upon four of the spoons.</p>

I asked the prisoner several questions, whether she knew any thing of these goods; she told me no. I desired her to tell me whether they were pawned any where; she said no, and that she knew nothing of them. She said she had no money but a penny. But two women searching her found this box, [which he produced in court ] with three guineas and half a crown. They were delivered to me, and have been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Smith. No, they do not; I paid for them myself; and she is an impudent saucy jade for saying any such thing, for she never saw me in these cloaths I have now got on; I would not take a false oath for the value of all the cloaths.</p>

               <p>Cuthbert. I believe she keeps a disorderly house, and I going my rounds have taken people from the door when there has been any noise.</p>

In about a fortnight after this he brought another parcel corded up in the same manner, and left them also. Last Wednesday he sent a messenger to me from the Compter desiring me to come there to him; I went; he told me he was put in there on suspicion of robbing his master of some thread to the value of 10 d. he desired me to call upon two of his masters that he had lived with formerly, near St. Martin's-lane, to appear for him on his trial as yesterday, and desired me also to come; upon this I suspected the things he had left at my house to be dishonestly come by, and then carried the two parcels to Mr. Blackbourne's, and they owned them as their property.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>

               <p>Dawson. No, the prisoner is much about the size of him, but I cannot say he is the man, from what I saw of him, for it was pretty dark; but he was taken up on the Saturday following and owned he had pawned my watch to Mr. Scriven, who is here.</p>

            . On the 22d of April a little after seven o'clock at night I called at the house of Mr. Troy by the Horse Guards; he said, will you please to walk in here, here is nobody here but a gentlewoman of my acquaintance, when I went in there was a pint of wine, and the prisoner at the bar was the woman that was there: she said, I must have a little punch for I cannot drink two-penny; I staid till I cannot tell whether it had struck 8<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240031"/> or not; she drank punch with Mr. Troy, but I drank none: I believe a little before eight I went out to go home; Mr. Troy said, Mr. Adams, as you are going to Westminster I should be obliged to you, if you would conduct this lady towards her lodgings; I asked her whether she would go the park or street way; she said the street way, and then took me by the arm; I never saw her before in my life. We walked very softly together, with her arm under mine; we went on till we came to Abington Buildings, on the other side of the Abbey; she then asked me what o'clock it was; I pulled my watch out, there were two lamps at a door, but I could not see exactly; but said, I believed it was much about nine: I put my watch in my pocket again. I was not got three doors from that place, but she took me round the waste, and said, sir, you shall not go any farther, I am going to College-Court; and she kist me, and I her. I just went from her, a very moment, five or six steps homewards, but happening to put my hand to my breeches I mist my watch; I turned round and ran after her to the end of College-Street, but could not see her; I ran down College-Court, but saw nothing of her. I then went past my own door and through the park to the house of Mr. Troy: I said to him, for God's sake tell me where this gentlewoman lives, for she has got my watch; he said, he did not know where she lodged, but he would see where she lodged; he said, there was one person went home with her he believed could tell me where she lived, his name is Coningham, in Long-ditch; we then went with his son-in-law through the park: when Coningham came down stairs he was to shew us the way to where she lived; and I got a warrant and constable, and we all went to her lodgings. If she had gone there at first, I must have heard her knock at the door, for I went by it after I had lost my watch. We knockt at the door, and it was opened; we asked for her, but was told she was gone to bed; the woman went to shut the door, but I clapt my foot to it and insisted on seeing her; she came out then, and said, Mr. Adams what is the matter? I said to her, you have got my watch; she denied it three or four times; I then served the warrant on her, upon which she burst into tears, and said, don't expose me, and asked me the price of the watch; I said it cost me 7 l. but now it was not worth high so much; she said, I will give you any thing for it. The gentleman who goes for her husband came in, in a great flurry, and calling me aside, asked me what it was worth; he proffered me money; I told him I could not take money. She was taken to the constable's house, the justice being gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day?</p>
               <p>Adams. I had been with Mr. Troy doing business for him that day, we dined in St. Martin's-lane; he took me to appraise some goods for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Adams. I drank only two glasses of wine at Mr. Troy's, that is all, at seven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the prisoner is the wife of an officer in the army?</p>
               <p>Adams. I never saw her before; when I went to have the indictment drawn up, I was asked her husband's name; I said, I did not know that; he said, then I will put her down widow.</p>
               <p>Q. You know since that she is wife of an officer in the army, don't you?</p>
               <p>Adams. I have been told so.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what it was o'clock, when you pulled out your watch?</p>
               <p>Adams. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think she had your watch ?</p>
               <p>Adams. When we parted she put her hands round my waste.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for this woman to take the watch out at that time?</p>
               <p>Adams. I don't know how it was; I mist it presently, I don't know how she did it?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her hand at your fob?</p>
               <p>Adams. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible this watch might have slipt down putting it into your fob?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240032"/>Adams. I am quite sure it did not. She took hold on me all the way, except there was a post, then she would come up to me again and take me by the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any where?</p>
               <p>Adams. We never stopt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to her husband next morning?</p>
               <p>Adams. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then ask him to pay you the value of the watch and you would trouble him no more about it ?</p>
               <p>Adams. No, he proposed to pay me; the gentleman proffered to give me any money, I said, I did not care to do it; he said, I will indemnify you; this he said several times in his own room. I went to my attorney, who was not at home, but his partner was; he told me not to do it, saying, it was a felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink where you went to appraise the goods?</p>
               <p>Adams. Mr. Troy was in the room almost all the time, we drank none there, after that we went to dine; there were five or six more with us.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink then?</p>
               <p>Adams. There were three or four full pots of beer and some punch, it stood us in no more than 6 d. each.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you drinking there?</p>
               <p>Adams. About two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober at that time?</p>
               <p>Adams. I was as sober as I am this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Troy?</p>
               <p>Adams. Eight or ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon him to be an honest man?</p>
               <p>Adams. I believe he is a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he would send you home with any body that would pick your pocket if he knew it?</p>
               <p>Adams. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how that kissing was?</p>
               <p>Adams. She turned herself round three or four doors after I had looked at my watch, and said, you shall go no farther, and clasped me round the waste.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch at that time?</p>
               <p>Adams. Was I dying this moment I am sure it was then in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man that produced the watch?</p>
               <p>Adams. I never saw it till to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in Parliament-street that night ?</p>
               <p>Adams. I was not.</p>

            . I am the constable that took the lady up on the 22d of this month. Between nine and ten at night Mr. Adams came to me, and I went with him and Mr. Troy to College-street, Westminster, to her lodgings. Mr. Adams went and knocked at the door, I was about two doors off at that time: when the door was opened, they said, she was gone to bed; then he asked if the captain was at home, they said, he was gone to bed; then I heard a gentlewoman at the door, who said to Mr. Adams, what would you have? he said to her, madam, you have robbed me of my watch; she said, I don't know any thing of it; he told her he had a constable there to take her up, and if she did not let him see it he would serve a warrant upon her; she said, she knew nothing of it: he then charged me with her. I took her and brought her to my house: we afterwards put her in the Round-house for that night. Mr. Adams said the same the next morning as he did over night.</p>

            . I keep the sutling house by the horse-guards : I believe between six and seven that night the lady came into my house; she staid a little while, I asked her what she would drink; she said, she liked a little warm punch; I ordered the boy to make 18 d. worth, and we sate and drank it out : whether Mr. Adams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240033"/> drank any or not I cannot say; I had drunk too much. They both talked of going home about nine; I said to Mr. Adams, this lady lives somewhere about College-street, I should be obliged to you if you would see her home; he said, with all my heart: they went out together, and in about twenty five minutes he was back again, and said, who did you send me home with, she has picked my pocket of my watch? He was in a violent passion, and wanted me to go and get it; I said, this can never be; he said, it is so. I went with him to the constable's house, and told him that one Coningham knew where she lived, and that he lived in Long-ditch; we went there, and he told us he would go and shew us the door, for I had sent him home once before with her. They went and got a warrant; and then he went along with us to the woman's house in College-street; he shewed us the door; I desired him to stand a little back and let me talk to her: I knocked, and a woman came to the door, I asked her for Mrs. Hudson; the woman said, she was gone to bed; then Mr. Adams put his foot in at the door to keep it open, and said, I must and will see her to night: after that the prisoner came out of a room into the passage to the door, and said, what is the matter Mr. Adams? he then challenged her with having his watch; she then came out at the door, I believe she was in the very same habit she is now; then the warrant was served, and they took her to the constable's.</p>

            . Last Sunday was three weeks I was desired to go home with the prisoner from Mr. Troy's about nine o' clock; by which reason these people came to me to enquire where she lived ?</p>

               <p>Conningham. I was not.

Mr. Adams, is it you? he challenged her with having the watch; she denied it utterly; he said, I have a warrant against you, if you don't give it me again I'll serve it; she said, I know nothing of the watch, help me God, were the words she said; then the warrant was executed; and we all went to the constable's house, where a valuable consideration was offered several times, but he refused it, and said, give me my watch, give me my watch.</p>

On the 12th of this instant, about half an hour after nine at night, Lee and I went into the ground, we heard a rustling among the greens or colworts, we got nearer and nearer the person: then Lee pushed on and took the man by the collar, it was the prisoner. We took him, and told our master we had caught a man in the colworts; he desired us to carry him to the constable's house, and our master ordered the deceased to assist, so we three took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it you took him?</p>
               <p>Parker. It was after ten: the constable was out of town, and his wife sent us to the head-borough, named Longslow, there we asked for the lock and key of the cage; Longslow said he did not know where they were: then I went to the beadle for them, he sent me to Mr. Strickney's for them, I went; he told me the cage was not in a condition to put any body in; then I came back to the headborough's house, and met Mr. Anderson, the high constable, coming out at the door; I told him Mr. Strickney had said the cage was not fit to hold the man; then he said, you must continue at the headborough's all night. Then Lee, the deceased, I and the prisoner sat down round the fire: the deceased said to me, now is a proper time to take our rounds, to see if any body else is in the fields; I said to the deceased, are you able to take care of the prisoner? he agreed so to do. I bade him, when Lee and I were out, to lock the door, and put the key in his pocket, and if the prisoner was troublesome, to call the head-borough up, who lay over-head. We went out into the field; in about two or three minutes we heard a rustling amongst the greens again and saw a man, but could not take him; he escaped from us: we returned to the headborough's house, this was about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240037"/> o'clock in the morning of the 13th: we found the door just a-jar; I ran in and saw the deceased laying stone dead on the hearth, in a gore of blood running about: I called up the headborough and went and fetched the constable, and

The bread in quantity of about a quarter loaf, in four, five, or six pieces; and three quarters of a gallon of water, or a little more, in a pitcher as she supposed: on which, and a penny minced pye which she had in her pocket, she subsisted till she got away; which was on the 29th of January, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon; and then made the best of her way to London, to her mother's at the bottom of Aldermanbury. She also said, that she had had no stool, only made water all the time; and that there were in that room an old stool or two, an old table, and an old picture over the chimney, two windows in the room, one fastened up with boards, and the other part ditto and glass. At the latter she made a hole by removing a pane of glass, forced a part open, and got out upon a shed of boards or penthouse; and so slid down and jumped upon the side of a bank on the back side of the house and so got into the road, and reached her mother's that night about ten o'clock: her mother being there, said, she got her some wine and water, but she could not swallow it, and then sent for the apothecary for advice. Her master Lion and Mr. Wintlebury gave her a good character. That she apprehended it was the woman of the house that had done her this injury. And he granted her a warrant for the apprehending mother Wells upon her swearing all this to be truth.</p>
               <p>Gawen Nash deposed, that he was with Canning before Alderman Chitty; that there she was asked what sort of a room it was that she was confined in; that there she said it was a little square darkish room; that there were boards nailed up at the window; and that thro' the cracks she could see the Hertford stage coach which used to carry her mistress. And he likewise deposed, that she said, there were and old broken stool or a chair, an iron grate in the chimney, and a few old pictures hung over the chimney; and that she lay upon boards. He said, he was much affected with this melancholy affair, being there during the whole examination. He likewise deposed, that after the warrant was granted, that he, Lions, her master, Aldridge, and Hague, went down to mother Wells's, in order to execute the warrant on the next morning, which was the 1st of Feb. that as they were going down they were met by people, who told them that they had seized them all: that they went on, and when they came to mother Wells's house they went up into several rooms; and after that he saw a man there, and asked him if there were not other rooms in the house; that the man shewed him up into this room and went with him; that when he got into this room, he wondered where the room was which Canning had described she had been confined in; for says he, this did not in any part answer the description she gave, for it was a very long room: that he then came down to his companions and they all went into the room together; that then somebody said, this must be the room; that he then said, it answered not the description she had given of it, For, he says, he observed in the room near half a load of hay, a nest of drawers, about 4 f. by 3 high, and a tub in which some pollard was, three old saddles, two of which were women's saddles; and a parcel of hay made in the form of a bed, that over the bed were a jack-line and pullies, and that there was a hole where the jack line had gone thro', which was stuffed with hay; that it was a thin clay and lath wall which separated that and the kitchen, and that if the hay had been removed, any one might see very plain in the kitchen, and across the kitchen into the road, that there was a little chimney in the room which seemed to be a little place for the warming a glue-pot; and that he observed an old dusty casement which seemed to have stood over the chimney for some years; that there was no grate nor the appearance of a grate in the chimney;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240040"/> that he observed the window out of which she said she made her escape; that within nine or ten feet of that window there is a watering pond; that the other window of the room never had been boarded up, and that was large enough for him to get out at, and that it was so low he shook hands with his wife out of it, that the casement opened and shut extremely easy, and that there were trees grew so very near it that they were almost within his reach, and the room was very light, nor saw he any pitcher there; but after the people were all secured they went over the way, and was impatient that

Being asked if he saw any signs of her being an impostor, he answered, no, he did not: he found she was costive to a very great degree, and appeared to him to be in very great danger for seven or eight days, but on the 4th of March she was well enough to go abroad in the neighbourhood: being asked, whether there were any symptoms of her being lately under a salivation? he answered, Nothing like it, nothing like it, I'll assure you; but that she appeared as one almost starved.</p>

               <p>On his cross-examination he could not undertake to say her being in that low condition was by loss of appetite occasioned by a fever or other distemper, or whether it was from being confined from victuals.

I had got about an hundred yards, I saw my door open; I came back again and found the prisoner behind the door; I asked her what she did there? she said, she came in there to warm herself; says I, there is no fire here, how came you to come here? I asked her what she had in her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240054"/> pocket, she said, it was a plate she had borrowed at the two fighting-cocks, in Fleet-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that plate your's?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I believe it belonged to the publick house down Fleet-lane. I said, What have you got in your apron? She shivered and said she had got nothing, and that she folded up her apron only to keep her warm. I said, Let me see; she then said she had got only two or three plates, but when I look'd there were five, to three of which I can swear. I asked her what was the reason she took them, and she said she was almost starved, and did not know how to get a livelihood unless by these means. There was a man coming by, whom I desired to take care of her, and went myself for a constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say, nor any witnesses to call.</p>

I went, there was the prosecutrix, the prisoner at the bar, and more that were strangers to me; they accused the prisoner, who said the little boy took it; the boy being called up, he came crying and said he had no hand in it at all. They then had the prisoner down in the kitchen, where he confessed to me that the boy was innocent, and that he took the money out of the box himself. We found the two guineas where he said they were put. On my asking him where the other guinea was, he said he had changed it, but would sell his coat and make it up; I told him to return the remainder. We went into the room where he lodged; he put his hand into the bed and pulled out a box, in which were eighteen shillings, and a pair of buttons.</p>

On Tuesday, at nine at night, they were lying in wait for him, at which time he came up into my workshop; the dog barked, from which my servants had intelligence; they went and took him, and brought him to me. He immediately owned the taking the long cramp and sash saw. We took him before the Alderman at Guildhall, where he said he was afraid of being arrested, and he did it to make up a little money. He owned he pawned them, and confessed the taking one other saw, and no more. We went to the pawnbroker's where he directed us, and found them; we have since found the great cramp which he would not confess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I don't deny taking what I confessed, being afraid of an arrest, which was the cause of my taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. How has he behaved before this ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never heard any thing ill of him before this. He has two children, and if he had asked me for money to support them I would have let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the two saws worth that are found again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are worth 15 s.</p>

During the time he was my servant I was robbed of a shirt, two neckcloths, a great coat, and two silver table spoons. There was a shirt and neckcloth delivered to him, which he acknowledged he had received, but he never produced them. On his losing these things I had great complaints of him. I taxed him with taking the shirt and neckcloth, but he said he had put them in a drawer in the kitchen. I discharged him for his bad behaviour, and he has been lurking about my stable almost ever since. About a fortnight or three weeks ago my stables were broke open and stripped of bridles and saddles, with some more furniture; having intelligence of the prisoner being seen about my stables, I got a search warrant to search his lodgings, and in searching found one of the neckcloths I had lost. Upon that he was taken up the same evening.</p>

               <p>Cox. It seems to have been worn very much since he used to ride with me in the country, and this is the linen we carried into the country with us.</p>

            . I get my living by washing and scowering, and live next yard to the prisoner. Having been at a day's work on the 1st of April, when I came home at night between seven and eight o'clock I found the deceased in a publick house over-against the yard where she lived; she was a little in liquor, but not a great deal. She eat a bit of beef with me, and we drank a pot of beer; she then went home and went up stairs to sleep. Her husband coming in about an hour afterwards, asked for her, I told him she was gone to lie down, and he said he supposed she had knocked out her link (meaning she was drunk.)</p>
               <p>Q. from a juryman. Why do you imagine he meant so? Did you ever hear him use that term before?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, I have often heard him say so.</p>
               <p>She goes on and says,</p>
               <p>I would have gone up and awaked her for him, and he would not let me. I bid him not go and play the devil above.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, he was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by playing the devil?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I meant to strike her, because I have often known him to strike her, and was afraid he should. He went up to her, and was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but not longer. When he came down he asked if I was gone; upon my inquiring what was the matter, he said he believed he should be hanged as his fellow servant was that day, and wished I would go up to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was his fellow servant?</p>

            , who was hang'd that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for that?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. He said he had cut his wife on the head, and he believed she would bleed to death. I went up stairs to her and found her sitting on the side of the bed bleeding sadly. The blood came from a wound on the right side of the head. I then took a tea cup and went down to the publick house where her husband was, asking for some gin to wash the blood from her head. When I washed it off I had some loaf-sugar, some of which I went to put into the wound to stop the bleeding; but the gash was so large, and the blood gushed out so, that I could not do it. Upon my asking her how he did it, she said he had beat her with a broomstick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she name her husband's name?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, she did not mention his name; she only told me that he had struck her with a broomstick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that wound was given by that blow?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, Sir; she told me he had knocked her down with it. I went down to him again to the alehouse, and told him he must get somebody to stop the blood, for I could not; he said he could not fetch a surgeon, for he had no money, and then he went up to her himself. I went over to Mr. Bristow's the apothecary, and brought over Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bristow's nephew, who is a surgeon. The prisoner was with her when he came in; he searched the wound, and said it was very tedious, if not dangerous; he ordered me to wrap up her head and get her to the hospital. The prisoner then went and borrowed a shilling, and we got a coach. I went with her to the hospital, and left her in

               <p>Q. How did you get her in?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. They let her in; it was about eleven at night, we knocked at the door and they opened it.</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. Bethlehem hospital.</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, once or twice; but she never said any thing to me afterwards. I saw her the Saturday se'nnight before she died.</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. I never staid there long. The last time I saw her her head was swelled very much; she said when she swelled she was much easier; these were the last words she said to me, or in my hearing, for I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this conversation?</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, he did for me to take the bloody things out to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you come to me the next day and say my wife wanted support, that she wanted money?</p>
               <p>Court. What day do you mean?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Tuesday, the second of April.</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. I did go to him and told him she desired him to send her some money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she want it for?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I don't know what she wanted it for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave that woman (meaning Brockhouse) sixpence to carry to her, and she never carried it.</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I left it upon the things by the side of his wife, and said I would speak to the sister to let her have half a pint of beer when she would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell his wife that you brought it?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I did, and never went home till I had carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you take a hat out of my room?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Twould be very hard for her to accuse herself of robbing your room. This is not a proper question to ask her, because it would charge herself with a felony, which is a thing not to be done. Ask her any question concerning the murder; but this is not a fair question.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did you ever tell any body that if it lay in your power you would hang me?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, I never said any such thing, but that I would speak the truth as much as I knew.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came home from my labour and enquired for my wife, my neighbour told me she was at the Coach and Horses; I went there, and Brockhouse told me she was gone up stairs; I went up; she was there asleep: I awaked her as well as I could: she got up; there was never a candle a light; but there was a fire, and she felt about the chimney-piece for a match to light the candle: I put my hand in my pocket and found a piece of paper, and was going to light it: I pushed her with my elbow and she fell against a cullender; she got up again and lighted the candle. I found her bleed prodigiously; I then called up the first witness and sent for Mr. Roberts; he said it would be a charge for me, and that I had better send her to the hospital at once: I went and borrowed a shilling of a neighbour and sent for a coach to carry her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brockhouse. Did he come down to you, or you go up to him?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. He came down to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever a stick in his hand?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, I saw none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But three nights before this happened, when I came home the woman of the house, where she was that night, told me, she tumbled off from a bench and lay for dead a quarter of an hour; and she told me she wondered she never died in her liquor; another time I went to go up stairs, she sate upon the stairs very much in liquor; I persuaded her to go up, she did not, but fell down stairs and there she lay all night.</p>

Upon the 27th of March a woman came into our shop and bought a pair of stockings; it was between eight and nine at night; after she had bought them and paid for them, I lighted her down the steps. There were none in the house but I and the maid; I was shutting the door which would hardly catch: the two prisoners pushed in upon me, they beat me, and drove my head through the glass door that goes into the back parlour; I screamed out and the maid came, they knocked her down, and one of them stamped upon her; when they had done that, they came and laid hold on me again and gave me a push against the counter, I hit him with the candlestick and called out murder they bursted open the door into the parlour, and opened the other door, and met my husband coming down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they going?</p>
               <p>Ridge. They were going up stairs; in the mean time the maid run for a constable, then he came they shewed a Marshalsea's-court-writ; then the constable said he had no business with it. They brought my husband down and tore his night gown all to tatters, beat him terribly, and tore him about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they arrest him?</p>
               <p>Ridge. They did: I said, give me leave to send for ba</p>
               <p>Q. Did they shew the writ before the constable came</p>

               <p>Q. What buttons were they?</p>
               <p>Ridge. They were what my husband pulled out of his shirt sleeves, they lay upon the table; he put them in his right hand pocket, either coat or waistcoat; I said, you have got my husband's buttons: he said, d - n you, and away he went out; then he came in again, and I said, you have got my husband's buttons; he said then you may search me you b - h.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the buttons lay?</p>
               <p>Ridge. They lay upon a table, I saw him take them up, and put his hand down to his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge them both?</p>
               <p>Ridge. Because they both beat me and were present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know where they both lived?</p>

            . On the 27th of March, between eight and nine o'clock at night, there was a woman came in and bought a pair of child's stockings; my mistress took the candle and lighted her down the steps; as soon as she had shut the door there came two men who pushed against it and threw her down backwards; they came behind the counter, threw me down and trod upon me: the glass sash-door was locked, they took my mistress by the shoulders and beat her head through it; then they forced open the parlour door. We screamed out murder! I saw my master pull out a pair of gold buttons out of his sleeves and put them down upon a table after the men had been in; he was putting on his shirt to go out with the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this after they had arrested him?</p>
               <p>Young. It was. I heard my master ask the men for the buttons; then one of them went out of the house and staid about five minutes, and came in again.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you all the time with the prisoners and your mistress?</p>
               <p>Young. No. When they knocked me down I fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the buttons?</p>
               <p>Young. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the two men stoop down and give them to her directly?</p>
               <p>Young. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure those buttons were gold?</p>
               <p>Young. I always took them to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the buttons for both hands, or one?</p>
               <p>Young. They were for each.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of March we had got an action against Mr. Ridge, at the suit of Mr. Radish, a linnen-draper in Cheapside; we had been after him two or three days, and finding him very shy, we sent this woman in to buy stockings; we told her to leave the street door open that we might get in; she did so, and we went in and made the arrest; Mr. Ridge desired to put on a clean shirt; we granted it: after that he said he had lost his sleeve button: Mr. Mitchell stooped down and took it up, and said, here it is; it was then in his hand: after this he got a warrant, thinking to redress himself, and swore this felony. I went and surrendered myself up. I never saw the buttons.</p>

I have known the prisoner three months almost, he had been at my house some time before with some sea-faring men, and last Tuesday he brought a silver watch and desired me to lend him five shillings upon it 'till he went home to his lodgings; I lent him five shillings; about two hours after he came in and asked me for more money; I said, if he had a mind to pawn it, there was a pawnbroker near he said it was an old family watch, and he would not lose it for ten guineas. Then he desired I would go with him, so we went together to Mr. Longarth's, he lent him a guinea upon it, and he payed me what he owed me for liquor, and what he borrowed, in the whole nine shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the watch?</p>

In the morning the man of the house and I had a tankard of purl, I staid there to breakfast; then we all three went down to a house where I had been well used; I staid a little and came up again; the watch was in my pocket; I believe I was a little disguised in liquor; Mrs. Matthew saw me put it in my pocket when we were at breakfast.</p>

               <p>Drummond. I saw the prisoner in June last at Mr. Keith's, at May-Fair-Chapel; he was married there to one M'Coomb, [pointing to her;] I have been clerk to doctor Keith several years.</p>

               <p>I lodged in her father's house; he and his daughter used to dine at his distiller's at Lambeth; he had this warrant granted; I had pawned my watch and every thing to support her, expecting a little money to maintain her in a short time, and having no money I lay a-bed pretty long in the morning. Accordingly, she tied up some things in a handkerchief, and I went and pawned them for twenty-five shillings. I do not deny that I married her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you there before the body was taken out of the water, and after her husband had been there?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she swelled when you saw her?</p>
               <p>Nichols. She was not swelled much, but when I saw her face I did not know it; being shewn the cloak I knew that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the appearance of a drowned person ?</p>
               <p>Nichols. She had; and she had a colour in her face and looked very beautiful.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her face swelled?</p>
               <p>Nichols. It was a little swelled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he says is very true.</p>

            . I am a bargeman, but cannot say I know the prisoner. Upon Sunday the 18th of November, as I, my wife, and child, were coming from Chiswick to Hammersmith we heard of a drowned woman; I was determined to walk down to see her, and walked as far as the mud and water would let me go, and believe I went within four inches of my knees in mud, for I garter below knee and believe my garters touched the mud; she lay in mud and water, but over-hawling her very strictly I lifted up her head, and then came to her hands, and lifting up her left hand, as they both lay upon her breast, they both came up together; there was a cord came round her wrists and they were tied together.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the shore was this?</p>
               <p>Gold. 'Twas about twenty yards off the shore; I took out my knife and cut it, it was about as big as the lower end of a pipe, it was three stranded; she had two black hats on, her knees lay bare and laid up, I covered them; afterwards two burgemen taking her up, asked me, if I had made her fast; I said no; being afraid of coming into trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she lay before she was taken up ?</p>
               <p>Gold. From the Sunday to the Monday. I staid upon the wharf at Chiswick and saw the bargemen carry her to the Black Lion; I saw her there afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Catchley. 'Twas on the Thursday at the Black-Lion at Hammersmith; there were several more neighbours of us went at that time.</p>

               <p>Webb. I felt in her pocket but found none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any when you left her?</p>
               <p>Webb. She might have 6 d. or 1 s. she was to pay the prisoner, she had likewise a large brass snuff box about four or five inches over, and a crooked King Charles's halfpenny, but she had nothing at all when I searched her: I went with these people on the Thursday.</p>

               <p>Webb. 'Twas on the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Webb. I did not; I was informed the man that first saw her cut the cord; she tied a handkerchief over her hat when I left her?</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of her clothes taken from her?</p>
               <p>Webb. No, they were not; I saw the handkerchief (which was a very old thing) and the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gold. What did you do with the cord; is it here?</p>
               <p>Gold. I threw it away with my left hand, so I have it not here: there are two men that heard the prisoner say her hands were tied, he was subpoena'd in the prisoner's behalf.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was this after they came in ?</p>
               <p>Dent. I believe they might have been in five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>Dent. I don't directly remember.</p>

               <p>Dent. I knew Sharp before, but I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Dent. I believe it might be about seven o'clock, but I cannot justly say what o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Dent. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What accident did they say they had?</p>
               <p>Dent. They said they had lost a woman out of the boat; I asked them in what manner they lost her? they both of them said, they did not know how she was lost; I said, is it possible you can make me believe that? then they both said, they knew nothing at all how she did go out: Sharp said, he was looking another way and did not see her go. 'Twas a very windy boisterous night.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Sharp?</p>
               <p>Dent. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Sharp belongs to any ship ?</p>
               <p>Dent. I do not know. I asked the prisoner why he did not go back to Wandsworth again, he said the wind blew so he could not; but he rowed about and felt with his hands in the water about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Sharp since?</p>
               <p>Dent. No, I never saw him afterwards; he said, he came from Wandsworth that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is Sharp?</p>
               <p>Dent. He used to work upon the water, but I cannot say whether he had a boat of his own or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known him?</p>
               <p>Dent. I don't think I had known him above two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a boisterous night?</p>
               <p>Dent. It was very boisterous; I don't know there has been such a night since. We had them both down to the watch-house that night, and they both set their names down there in a book. I would have had the constable take charge of them; but he said he saw no reason to take charge of them without I would give him charge. I left them there, but they were not stopped.</p>
