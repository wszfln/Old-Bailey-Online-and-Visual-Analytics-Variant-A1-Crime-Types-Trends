I live at 92, Wellington Street, Woolwichâ€”about 12.30 on Sunday morning, 14th June, I was going down Beresford Street and saw four men opposite Barnard's Music Hallâ€”the prisoner is one, I am quite confidentâ€”they were standing speaking, and I watched themâ€”they went very slowly and made a haltâ€”I saw the prisoner a little way ahead, he joined a soldier, and they stoppedâ€”when I got by the Guild-hall the prisoner crossed to my side of the road; I went into a dark corner, and one of the men, McBride, went up to the prosecutor and said, "God blind me, why do you want to fight? "and the prisoner put his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and I saw him breaking his chainâ€”I shouted out, and they ran away down by the side of the music-hallâ€”I called the soldier and we took the prosecutor to the stationâ€”on Wednesday, July 1st, I saw the prisoner in the Essex Arms, and pointed him out to the policeâ€”I had been looking out for him for sixteen nights every nightâ€”I have known him since last December.</p>

"â€”I took them both in custody, and they were charged before a Magistrate at Woolwichâ€”I found a knife on each, and on Hitchcock's knife there was some tar and threads of hemp rope very minute, which have worn off, but here is a little bit of tar hereâ€”they were in a barge boatâ€”I was on duty from two to eight a.m.â€”I went down the opposite side to Silvertown, and I was abreast of that place at 3.30, and went down a little further, and got back to where I arrested the prisoners at 5.30â€”I had not seen them before that morning, but they might have passed me plying aboutâ€”I made some measurements on the barge by the Magistrate's request: the height of the cabin is six feet, and from the floor to the top of the lockers is twenty-two inches, and from the top of the lockers to the ceiling four feet two inches; from the top of the locker to the top of the skylight is four feet six and a half inchesâ€”the opening of the skylight is nine inches long fore and aft, and seven inches athwartâ€”I put my head through, and got it out again.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner of 33, Bermondsey Squareâ€”about twenty minutes past two on the after<lb/>noon of 4th July I was called to 24, Smith's Buildingsâ€”I there saw the body of a woman lying on her back on the ground in the first floor front room, used as a bedroom; she was deadâ€”I saw that she had several large cuts in the throatâ€”I made a post-mortem examination the next dayâ€”on the right side of the throat I found a large cut about seven inches long and an inch and a half deep, extending from two and a half inches behind, and one or half below the right ear to the middle of the chin, three-quarters of an inch below the lip; the bone was exposed from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the chinâ€”the jugular vein had been cut into, but not the carotid artery, it had cut open the pharynx and through the posterior half of the sterno musclesâ€”the direction of the wound was from before, backwards, and downwards; it had cut into the bone, showing consider<lb/>able forceâ€”on the left lower part of the chin were four superficial wounds about an inch and a half long and 1-16th of an inch deep, three deeper wounds on the left side, one immediately below the angle of the jaw; on the back of the left arm was a cut two and a half inches above the wrist, an inch and a quarter long and about an inch deepâ€”all these wounds were such as could be inflicted by such a razor as the one producedâ€”the immediate cause of death was the hemorrhage from the wound on the right side of the throat; that was a very grave wound, and must have been inflicted with considerable forceâ€”the other wounds were severe enough to cause deathâ€”I also observed some punctured wounds, two of them above and to the left of the navel, both penetrating the wall and coats of the stomachâ€”there were also fourteen other punctured wounds, slight in character, on the trunk, arms, and legsâ€”the two near the navel were serious enough to have caused death in a day or two, they perforated not only the abdominal wall, but the posterior parts, and had gone right through the stomach; such a weapon as this file would have caused themâ€”my opinion was that the punctured wounds were inflicted first; they had gone through the clothes and the stays.</p>
