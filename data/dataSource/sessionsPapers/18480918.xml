                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer On Friday evening, 28th July I was at a meeting, in the Theatre, in Milton-street, City—I got there about a quarter to eight o'clock—the defendant was appointed chairman of the meeting—there were then about 500 persons present—they increased to upwards of 1000 in the course of the evening—they were composed princi<lb/>pally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180014"/>
               <p>of the poorer classes, mechanics, principally Irish—the chairman and speakers addressed the meeting from the stage—I took notes of the defend ant's speech—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Friends, you have placed me in rather a responsible situation to-night; however, I obey the call with alacrity, and with pleasure to myself, and I trust any despotic conduct of mine, or on my part to-night ill be excused by you, because I believe you have all assembled here for the same good and religious purpose that I have been induced to attend here for I will just read you the bill calling this meeting. I believe the meeting was only agreed on to-day; I was not privy to any of the arrangements, and therefore, however I may express my ignorance of the arrangements that are made by the conductors, I trust you will excuse it on the score of ignorance. It is as follows, 'Is Ireland up <hi rend="italic">V</hi> That is a most important question to me, 'A great public meeting will be held to-night, Friday, July 28th, at the Milton-street Theatre, Cripplegate, to take into consideration the momeatous crisis in Ireland. Chair taken at eight o'clock. Several talented patriots will address the meeting. Englishmen, Irishmen, attend! attend Admis-sion, pit and gallery, one penny; platform and boxes, twopence.' I believe it is not the intention of the conveners of this meeting to shut any poor man out, be he Englishman or Irishman, for want of the means; therefore if there are any of those persons outside, I trust, as your chairman here to-night, that the managers of this meeting will announce the same to them, and give free admission to every poor man. (Applause.) My friends, let the police all com in—let the walking telegraphs come in if they please—let the living telegraphs, that are placed over you to watch over your every act, come—make room for them all if you can convert them, if there is the slightest probability of making honest men of them at all, let them all in: however, I despair of any great utility arising from any such task as that. My friends, I was about to say, I rejoice to think, and I verily believe it, that Ireland is up! (Cheers.) Not-withstanding the garbled reports that we receive continually day by day, and every express that arrives, in order to delude and deceive the people of this country, I believe sincerely that Ireland is up, (cheers,) and I believe that Ireland will do its duty to itself. The time has now arrived when it is too late to mince the matter; the time has now arrived that both Englishmen and Irishmen should be up to do their duty. (Cheers.) I will tell you a little bit of intelligence that was conveyed to me about half an hour ago, intelligence that I deeply deplore; our worthy, patriotic, straightforward, indomitable friend Patrick O'Higgins, is apprehended on a charge of high treason, (Groans). Now, there is no question in my mind, that every other honest and patriotic fellow, both in England and in Ireland, will be pounced upon by the same ruthless hands, as soon as there is an opportunity. My friends, Patrick O'Higgins is in durance vile, I have every reason to believe; and as soon as ever the government are prepared to arrest your indomitable cham<lb/>pion, Smith O'Brien, they will serve him precisely the same. However, I am glad to think they have not got him yet; (cheers;) and I do hope they will have something to do to take him too. While Smith O'Brien is sur<lb/>rounded by 100,000 brave Irish hearts, the government will have something to do to shop him. They say that he carries a brace of pistols with him Now, these things perhaps ought not to be indulged in by a public meet<lb/>ing like this; but I sincerely hope to God that such is the fact, and the first dirty fingers, be it a policeman in his own uniform or otherwise, that lays a hand upon Smith O'Brien, or any other man who dares to viadicate the rights of his country, I trust that—(cheers)—I dare scarcely trust myself for our respected friends here, on my right and on my left, are sent here for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180015"/>
               <p>the purpose of performing a professional duty; and I do hope and trust you will excuse them in the performance of their duty;"—that alluded to myself and Mr. Bennett, who accompanied me—" they are but men, and they must perform that duty for which they are sent here, faithfully, and in accordance with the employ under which they labour. Is Ireland up? (Cries of 'Yes.') I should like to answer that in a very Irish method practised by this country, by patting another question—Is England up? (' No, no; it soon will.') I trust we are up; at all events, my friends, we are up this night, to listen and be advised by those gentlemen who will presently address you. This is a very critical period of our history, both for England and for Ireland. I believe, and I do hope and trust, that we are up in this way, that we shall calmly discuss the subjects that may from time to time be brought before us, and that when this meeting concludes, that we will give no possible pretext to the common foe to pounce upon any man; no processions, no <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, or any<lb/>thing of that sort publicly made, so as to enable them to lay hold of you and your friends to-night; but every one will leave this Theatre, and he will pur<lb/>sue his own quiet and calm way on again, and reflect on what he has heard. I hope, nevertheless, that you will agree with the sentiments that will be uttered here to-night. I do not believe that there is one man that will address you to-night, but are your best friends; consequently, they will give you no bad advice: but, at the same time, I think it is the duty of every man here to register a vow in heaven, that he will never rest contented till both England and Ireland are in possession of their rights. (Cheers.) I think, my friends, that it is a duty incumbent upon all; and it is of no use for Mr. John O'Connell, or any other sham patriot, threatening me, or Irishmen, or Englishmen either; that if the people do not agree with his advice, and will not act upon it, he will walk his body away, and take his father's bones with, him. (Cries of, 'Let him go, in God's name.') If he should, my friends, carry his threats into execution, I do not think it will be any great loss to his country at all. (Cheers.) My friends, I shall presently introduce Mr. Dwaine to your notice, to move the first resolution. (Cries of,' Let the dead rest!') In reply to that, I am sure I have not the slightest disposition to disturb the bones of Daniel O'Connell, or any other dead man; but I think when we are threatened by the man who has taken that illustrious man's place in the affections of Ireland, when he threatens to deprive us of such a valuable blessing as that, namely, the bones of the late Daniel O'Connell, I think we ought to pass ouropinions on his advice and conduct. I will not ad<lb/>dress you at any further length to-night, my friends; but I have this request to make, that those gentlemen who are inconvenienced towards the entrance of the pit, will be allowed to move on here." Dwaine, Collins, and Wad-dington spoke subsequently; and directly after Waddington, the defendant spoke—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Friends, the veteran Waddington has alluded to petition<lb/>ing I believe; and I merely mention this fact to put this meeting to rights, that it is not the intention to petition that House any more—I believe so. The next petition (and this is open and advised speaking, recollect) I hope and trust that you will present, every man will be prepared with his own petition. (Great applause.) I hare no patience with these set of <hi rend="italic">rapscal<lb/>lions.</hi> See how the Irish nation was treated last Saturday, when Lord John Russell, in reply to one of the noble and bold fellows; (and there are very few of them indeed that dare stand before that House, and advocate the rights of the poor man;) mark how significantly and how derisively Lord John Russell handed over to Feargus O'Connor the oath of allegiance. I can have no allegiance for any such abuses. I am no M. P. I never took the oath of alleginance, and I declare to you, (and it is in the presence of the reporters,)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180016"/>
               <p>now, if I was to be sacrificed this very night, I am an alien to any such damas. able abuse. (Cheers.) I hold no allegiance to either Queen, Lords, a Commons that would do these things. I cannot owe allegiance to any such damnable doings as these! When I recollect that there are upwards of a million of my fellow-beings, called Irish, that have been treated worse then the pigs that they fatten for English eating—I say, when this comes to my knowledge, and I have no reason to doubt it, because, according to the very best statisticians, there are upwards of a million who, in sixteen months, <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> been sent to untimely graves by such misery, I can hold no allegiance to such damnable doings! We have no intention to petition; it is our intention to make known our wishes to that government, and if they are still regardless of our feelings and wishes with reference to the Irish nation and people, let them drive the Irish people to rebellion, as they are doing; let the blood fall upon their own heads. The English people are not accountable for this The English Chartists have been, from time to time, warning well the govern-ment, all the time that they have been trampling upon the liberties, of what the ultimate consequences must be; and I do hope and trust—(and here is open and advised speaking again)—I hope and trust that Irishmen will at: be satisfied, and that Englishmen will also fraternize with them; not going for a simple repeal of the union, but that they will never rest satisfied until they cry out with one thundering voice, 'Republic for ever!' (Great applause and waiving of hats.) Gentlemen, I am not one of the maudlin royal loyal repealers. I do not wish the Queen to visit Ireland, and yet I would not wish to see a hair of her head injured. I have no personal animosity to the Queen; but I declare myself now, and in tit presence of this meeting that—would to God the noble and valiant field-marshal, her husband, was here to hear me, I should to his teeth, and to Lord John Russell's too, express my unqualified opinion in this way—that the sooner we throw off these trammels the better; I am a Republics (Cheers.) My friends, we can bear this no longer; and would to God that every Englishman and Irishman would shake hands, as has been recom<lb/>mended—(cries of 'We will')—every man be armed to the teeth, I say, sooner than submit to this abominable oppression and misrule. I am not recommending you to arm, decidedly not; I want you to arm morally, and be prepared to combat and battle your own opinions against their abuses; and depend upon it, as was very justly observed by Mr. Dwaine, as soon as ever they see you prepared, they will grant you both the Repeal and the Charter, and they cannot help themselves. (Cheers.) My friends, I will just read you the resolution that is expressive of the opinions of this meeting"—(there was a slight disturbance, and a person was turned out of the meeting)—"I conjure you all, both Englishmen and Irishmen, for your own sates, for the sake of the noble and glorious cause in which you are all engages, that no tumult will take place. I tell you that there are spies amongst you, and you must expect to meet with them. Let them alone, treat them with that disdain which they deserve for their filthy and their abominable em<lb/>ployment; treat them with that scorn that their servile, degrading services deserve at your hands. Be as temperate and as calm as you can under the circumstances; because, I can assure you, that the Government have taken such precautions; the City authorities, also, they are in constant communi-cation; and I alluded before to the living telegraphs, the working telegraphs, that are at the corner of this street, and perhaps at the corner of every street and are taking to the proper quarter every sentence that may be uttered from time to time; but do not lay yourselves open to any such charge as creating?. riot; you will involve yourselves, depend upon it, and every man him</p>

               <p>upon this platform, if you unwisely come in contact with the police; tolerate their presence, for they are prepared for you. I have been informed to-night that they have got a new sort of sword, and these are the means, depend upon it, that they will put you, a defenceless, unarmed people, down with, if you unwisely come in contact with them. My friends, I will just read you the resolution; it is as follows:—'Resolved—That the alarming state of Ireland, at the present crisis, demands the strictest investigation of all true philanthropists and well—wishers to the British empire; and this meeting comes to the conclusion, that continuous misrule on the part of Great Britain has produced these disastrous results.' My friends, all of you, who are of that opinion, signify the same by holding up both hands.—Carried unani<lb/>mously."</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the defendant Chairman when Willses spoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is what Wilson said—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Mr. Chairman and brother Chartists, I rise to support the present resolution, that we do assist the Irish in Ireland to the best of our abilities as far as we possibly can-at the same time I hope and trust that the Chartists of England will not lav so lose idle as the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> anticipates that they will do so; that is for five as six weeks. In the event of Englishmen standing idle and looking on for five or six weeks, I believe that there would scarce be an Irishman or a Repealer left in Ireland. I hope and trust, Mr. Chairman and brother Chartists that it they really are up in Ireland, that we really too will be up in England—(chess)—I hope and trust that if to-morrow's news brings it authentic that they are up in Ireland, I hope and trust that there will be something like 50,000 to 100,003 meet on Sunday in some part of London—mind when I say I hope we will be up, I do not mean physically up, but I mean to say I hope we shall be morally up and doing, to assist our brethren in Ireland, so that we can keep the soldiers away from there. (Cheers.) Let us agitate, but let as keep good agitation up in England, and that is sufficient for us to do; if any thing suggest itself further, you will be best able to judge what is the new step to do. We know very well that on the 10th April we had no blows struck, and yet how panic-stricken the Government were; they wanted the whole of their disposable force in London: that was only a moral agitation, and that is all that we want now. You assembled 50,000 or 100,000 strong in Trafalgar-square, or in some other part near the House of Commons morally they are determined to sympathize and to assist your brethren in Ireland; then I say that Lord John Russell and the Whigs will not be able to spare one single soldier from England to go to Ireland. (Cheers.) You must show yourselves determinedly resolutely to assist the Irish in any struggle by any or every means at your command. It will not do, as I said before, to let the thing go on week after week, and waiting for this day's paper or the next day's paper, and to know whether this report is true or false; but as soon as you can ascertain the authenticity of the fact that they are up in In land, I say that we must be up in England. (Loud cheers.) I hope you will not lose sight of it, and that we shall not meet day after day merely to hear long speeches made, and to end in that, I hope not. I hope as Mr. Meagher and Mr. Smith O'Brien stated, that in Ireland speech-making now is all over; now is the time for action—now is the time to be up and doing, and if we are not up and doing now you may rest assured that our chains will be fixed far more tighter than ever they were. With these few observations I bid you a very good night, hoping and trusting you will look out for the earliest new when it makes its appearance to<lb/>morrow, and if there is anything of the kind in Ireland, that you will not forget on every man's holiday to have a grand holiday too."</p>

I asked him for some hammers which we bad given instruc<lb/>tion to be made, and also for a ratchet-brace—he said he would get them presently—about two o'clock the same day I went to the nail-room—he came to me, and said he was very sorry, but he had taken part of the ratchet-brace home—I asked why he did so—he said, "I thought to ask you to give it me several times, but I neglected to do so; the reason I took it home was, it would be a very useful article to me, as I intended to set up in business for myself"—I went back into the smiths" shop—I again asked him for the hammers and tools—he did not produce them—he had opportunity to go home if he liked—I then asked him for the key of the box, and looked in the box, and found several things, but not the hammers—I then fetched a police-man, went with him to the prisoner's lodging, and found a number of tools in a tool-box, worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 5th Sept., before going to bed, I placed my gold watch on a watch-stand, on a little bracket, in my study—I had in a cupboard a deed-box, containing a cash-box, and an empty bill-case—I must have left my keys on my table, for I found them there next morning—in a money-box, on the cheffoneer I left three sovereigns, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about sixteen sixpences, and about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—the box was locked—I came down next morning, between five and six o'clock, and my watch was gone, and the gold and silver from the box; nothing but the pence remained—the box was locked, apparently as it had been the previous evening—the cash-box was gone—I found the outer-door unbolted inside—the prisoners were in the habit of coming to my chambers to see my housekeeper, who is their aunt, and has been with me twelve years—they have had an opportunity of seeing where I kept my money; they have seen me take money out to give to one of them.</p>

My friend William Chubb went down last week to spend a month with his father, who is a Magistrate, and solicitor to the Corporation of Malmsbury, and he wrote to me on Thursday, inviting me down, and requesting me to fix the day. Previous to my receiving his letter the events which I wrote of to John, occurred. On Friday evening 1 was informed that the secretary of the Felon-club was arrested, and I knew immediately that my turn was next; I accordingly resolved not to return home till late, and to start for Malmsbury next night. I spent the night in bidding farewell to some quiet English friends, who abominate Chartism, and where I was obliged to act the hypocrite, which I am pretty well used to now; and after midnight I made for home, reconnoitering cautiously as! went along. As I drew near to my own street, I perceived a figure watching me sideways, I strove to avoid him, but he walked up to me, it was a friend; he gave me a sign to keep quiet, and we proceeded quickly in another direction, when he told me he had discovered, through a friend is the police, that there was a warrant out for me, and that there were two policemen, in plain clothes, waiting opposite my own door, he and another friend had posted themselves at either end of the street, outside the police, so as to prevent my falling into their hands at either side; it was, however a very narrow escape; for the, police had noticed their movements. I went with my friends to the private residence of one of the foreign ambassadors, where I supped, slept, and breakfasted next morning; not with his excelled, however, for he was not in town; but with his landlord, a <hi rend="italic">jolly old brick</hi> who seemed quite pleased with the mystery. I was introduced to his wife and daughter, as a Mr. Robinson, and I was near getting into a little hobble by forgetting my new name" (<hi rend="italic">an erasure was here made</hi>) "I scratch this out for fear of this letter being opened. When I went out I learnt that two of my friends went to my lodging, and burned or carried away every paper that had any allusion to political matters before four o'clock on Saturday; they were scarce gone when the police arrived, and carried away everything they could find, and among the rest Wm. Chubb's letter, which gave them a club to my intended route, and of course compels me to forego all my connections and wander somewhere where I have no friends; I am now an outlaw, and there's no use in <hi rend="italic">bilking</hi> the question, my neck is in danger if I am canght—however, I am in excellent spirits, and the only thing in the world that frees me is the bad opinion that will be formed of me by Wm. Chubb and a few other English friends, whose good opinion I valued. However, my consciences is quite at rest: I calculated the risk before I entered upon this business, and I am content to abide the consequences. I must write very little to and-you for a while, and that little will come to you with the London post-mark As long as I am silent you may be sure I am safe, as I will write the moment I am arrested, if I am so unfortunate. My friends are all astonished that am so little uneasy, but I only laugh at them; it is, however, most strange for it has always happened with me that even trifling misfortunes have preyes upon my spirits; but this utter wreck of my prospects has produced a kind to reckless levity, that seems almost unnatural. I have met with the greates. kindness from parties from whom I could not have expected it, but it is only in adversity that you can know who arc your friends. Whenever an of you)."</p>

Rose, Mullins, Brewster, Payne, and Bassett were elected, and were called the ulterior committee—a resolution was passed that there should be a president, and that the one who had the lowest post on the committee was to retire when the pre-sidcntcame in—this was a visionary president—he was not named—there was some remark made by persons present that he was somebody and nobody—he was somebody to be talked about, and nothing more—a resolution was then passed that the sum of three-farthings should be levied on every member of evey locality for the purpose of paying this president, to supply him with a salary—no time was specified for the payment—every delegate was to make the statement to the members in his locality—a letter was read by Mr. Payne, which I can only explain in this way, as he read it, that trade, was very good, and we should soon have a good order—he stated that the letter came from Mr. Lacey, who had been sent to Manchester—there was some degree of satisfaction expressed by many of the delegates present—they were glad to hear Lacey was going on well—a resolution was passed that they should meet on Wednesday, Aug. 9th, at the Lord Denman beer-shop, in Suffolk-street, Blackfriar's-road—Messrs. Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Doffling, myself, Gurrney, Donovan, Bassett, and others, twenty-eight in all, were present—reports were given in by the new delegates of the feeling of their localities, and the number of fighting men, and the state of preparation they were in—I do not think anything was said about ball-cartridges, or anything of that sort; merely about preparation—Payne was in the chair, but Mullins acted as chief speaker—he was vice-chairman, and sat at the other end of the table—he called on all the delegates to declare their allegi-ance and determination to abide by the decision of the committee for the good of the people—they did not swear, but some declared solemnly, and some said they were determined to risk their lives, and abide by the deci-sion of the committee—Payne read another letter from Lacey, stating that all was going on well, that he was still at Manchester or some other part of the country, and there was a question asked how long he was to con-tinue there, and Payne said he was to remain there as long as necessary—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry's coffee-house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, or Shoreditch, on the following Friday, 11th, at eight o'clock—I went, but found no meeting—I was informed that the police had been to Rose's bouse, and had seized his papers, and that all was up—I then went borne—I heard on the following Sunday that there was to be a meeting on the following Monday night, 14th, at the Orange Tree beer-shop, Orange-street, Red Lion-square—I attended it, and I was asked why I was not at the other two meetings that bad taken place since Wednesday—I found, I should say, twenty-five there—I have not got their names, but I think I can tell them—there was Cuffey, Brewster, Payne, Mullins, Gurney, Fay, Ritchie, Scurry, myself and others—Dowling was not there, at least I did not see him there—wumey asked me how it was I did not go to the meeting at Perry's coffee house—I said I did go, and there was none held—he said there was, and then he told me where it was held—Payne was in the chair at the Orange Tree, but Mullins was the spokesman, and he was chief spokesman on all occasions—he called on us to give a return of the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate and his members had prepared—each delegate gave in his return of half-cartridges that he had prepared, and also what the members of his parti-cular district had prepared—I did not take any note of the number—I think it was somewhere about 500 or 600—there was a return given in of the number</p>

               <p>of fighting men—Mullins stated that there were nearly 5000 fighting men of the Chartists alone—a return was also given in from the Confederates—I can not remember the number of them for a certainty, but I think it was something bordering upon the same number—it was a considerable number—✗ said the time was near at hand—he said, "Gentlemen, the next business is that I want every delegate to select four or six men, or more, as many as the can select iron; his locality"—there was a question asked what they were for-J do not know by whom—Cuffy answered, "To fire houses, railway premises trains, or anything"—I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not put anything down at the meeting—I was obliged to be cautious not to put any thing down—Mullias looked up at the gas which goes along the ceiling, and said "If I look up at the gas, you will at know what I mean"—I was asked how many men 1 thought I could select and I said two, and the other delegates right round gave in a return also—it was said they were to be men who could be depended on, who would do any-thing and everything—in the course of the evening there was a propositives made and carried, to send a deputation of two persons to have an interview with some of the North-Western Railway engineers, and ascertain what then feelings were, and whether they were willing <hi rend="italic">to come</hi> over and assist the Chartists—Ritchie and Scurry were proposed and unanimously carried the purpose—I was not aware till that evening that there had been a def-erence between the engineers and the company—it was mentioned then because it was requested to know what they were going for—is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was voted to defray their expenses for refreshment—they left forthwith on lie: mission—they were not present when the other resolutions were passed-! did not see any more of them that evening—there was a resolution passed that we should meet at half-past seven at the Lord Denman on the following Tues-day evening—I went—Payne, Brewster, Mullins, Cuffey, Dowling, Allnutt, Fey Gurney, Lacey, Ritchie, Ferdinando, and others, in all about forty, were there-Lacey was there when I got there—he entered into conversation with several of us, and told us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, but am not certain, were up and were doing, or would be doing that night, and he had been watched all day by the police, and as he was coming out of his street-door, a boy came up and told him that he was watched by the police—I had never seen Lacey before, I had only heard of him—he said he had been to Birmingham and Manchester, and other places, but I do not re-member for a certainty what those places were, and he had also been watched for two hours, and he gave the police the <hi rend="italic">double</hi>, and had reached the place safety—about three quarters of an hour after that, there was a distributee colours by Brewster—they were twisted plaited ribbons, and were gives a the delegates so that they might be recognised as the leaders of the people—Brewster stated so—they were to be put on the left arm—they were three colours, red, white, and some other—I received one—Mullins was prcsent as their distribution, and after that some of the committee came in—they were not-all present, at least I did not see them, but one or two of them spoke, are told Lacey they had better retire and consult—the room up-stairs was ✗ pied by a <hi rend="italic">sing-song</hi>, and we had the lower room—Lacey said, "If yes will wait a while I will go and see at a neighbour's coffee-house, whether we cannot have a room"—he went out, returned, and said "All right, or some such word-, and the committee <hi rend="italic">went</hi> out with him—I did not go—they were gone about three quarters of an hour, or it might have been an hour—the delegates remained till they returned—they went away, to consult to gather-when they retured, Cuffey said, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you has better give the; instructions as quick as possible"—Mullins was acting-as</p>

               <p>chairman—Laccy went with them when they went out—I did not see him return with them, and was surprised at it—Cuffey was secretary; I was informed he was chosen secretary by the committee—Mullins said, "Gentle-men, as you are aware, the committee have retired, and come to certain reso-lutions and decisions; they have directed me to give you the following instructions; and as our friend, Mr. Lacey, has informed us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up, and will be doing to-night, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, therefore, gentlemen, to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow; and it is necessary, gentlemen, that you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey stood by the fireplace, and said, "You had better put it round, Mr. Chairman, to every one present; let them answer, 'Yes' or 'No'"—Mullins on that appealed to a delegate sitting by me, and said, "Will you come out to fight?"—he said, "Yes"—he said to me," Will you?" and I said, "Yes"—then he said, "Will you?" addressing each in turn, one by one, round the room, till he came to Mr. Ferdenando, who made a bit of a speech, and explained his reasons that he could not conscien-tiously say "Yes" to coming out—he objected, he was not agreeable; in fact, he said, "No"—he gave his reason, and then said, "No," and sat down—there was one more of the same opinion—I do not know his name—he was companion delegate, I understood, to Allnutt, who sat by his side—with the exception of those two, the answer from the rest was, "Yes"—after that Mullins said, "Gentlemen, you must understand we shall take up four posi<lb/>tions: Clerkenwell-green will be taken by Mr. Brewster; the Tower Hamlets will be taken by Mr. Payne;" and the Seven Dials, and the Broadway, Westminster, were the other two positions—Basset and Mullins were to take those two—I do not know which was to take each—Mullins said, after giving the instructions in that manner, "Gentlemen," every delegate must assemble the members of his locality, for them to communicate to their locality at eight o'clock precisely"—it was to be the next night—there was a question asked by a delegate, I do not know who, how they were to get there with their pikes and poles?—Mullins said, "I can only say they must get them there the best way they can," (some of the poles were ten feet long), "and at twenty minates past nine, to a second, every delegate must be with his men at their respective positions"—the delegates were to come armed—Mullins proposed, and it was carried unanimously, that Ritchie was to superintend and direct those men that were to be selected for the purpose of firing houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Ritchie undertook it—the Orange Tree was to be the place of meeting—a question was asked, how Ritchie was to know these men, and some person said, "I propose the password to be, 'Frost and Mitchell'"—Allnutt proposed the word "Justice"—it was put, and carried unanimously; so that when these men entered the room Ritchie might ask them, "What do you want? who do you want?" and they would make reply, "Justice;" and then he would know them—Mullins said to Payne, "Just take a list of the number of men;" and he put them down; but he made a mistake, and there was some little confusion with the delegates—he went round the room again, and the number was reckoned forty-six—he applied to the person who sat next to me first, and then to me, and I said, "Two," but I could only depend on one—he went round to every delegate, and in that way forty-six was made up—Gurney was there at the time, and when—I said I could select two, he said, "Oh, nonsense, you can select more than that, half a dozen, I know" I Was rather put out at his taking on himself to judge upon it; in fact, there Was but one man that I could depend on for the purpose—Gurney</p>

               <p>was one of the wardens before I was elected on the council—each warden has 100 men under him, according to the rules of the Society—after the number of men was taken, the last words Mullins uttered were, "May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of that man that shall betray any one of us"—it was such a colour as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that was to be tied round the arm—nothing more took place that I remember—I came away—the prisoner was there that night, and sat nearly opposite me—I attended a meeting on the following day, 15th—it had been arranged on the Tuesday evening at the Lord Denman, that our locality, the Finsbury, City, and Clerkenwell loca<lb/>lities, were to meet Brewster at twelve o'clock, at the Crispin, in Milton-street, Cripplegate, to receive the delegates from each locality—I went, but did not arrive till a quarter to one—I found Brewster, Gill, Gurney, and I believe Fay, and others, eight or nine altogether—I have not made a note—Brewster said it was his intention to attack the Artillery-ground, and, if possible, to take it, and he should have to fight b——y hard, and that we should know by four o'clock in the afternoon whether the Government had received any intimation of what was going on—there was another person with him at the time; in fact, it was the man who told me at Perry's coffee-shop that there was no meeting there, and that it was all up with Rose—Brewster pointed to this person, and said, "Wait on me at Clerkenwcil-green when you are all there"—Brewster said, "Don't be afraid because you do not see the signals for a little while; you might not see the signals for half an hour, but wait a bit"—it had been arranged at the Orange Tree that there were to be bonfires—the men who were selected, were spoken to on that same evening, for I spoke to my men—Brewster also said, "Ritchie swears, so help his God, he will shost the first person dead that flinches from his duty."</p>

               <p>meeting that King was at, that I know of—I did not get up meetings for the-purpose of getting money together—Mr. Owen Jones was one that got them up—I never got a farthing of the money at the meeting on 30th July, at Cartwright's coffee-shop—I do not recollect any money at all being paid that evening—Payne was in the chair; I believe it was Payne—it was very seldom that Mullins took the chair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first begin to communicate this affair to the Govern<lb/>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Soon after 10th April—the Secret Committee sat the very next day after I attended the first meeting—that was on 20th July—I was not in communication with the Government before that—I first put myself in com<lb/>munication with these parties very soon after 10th April, very soon after I joined the Chartists—I communicated every movement that I knew of, from time to time; they knew everything—I saw something illegal in the council when I first joined them—I knew that there was a rising; that was before I put myself in communication with the Government—the parties with whom I communicated did not persuade me to continue among the delegates—they did not tell me not to do so; I did it of my own accord—I saw them, often, I did not see them regularly once a week—I do not know what has become of the man I wanted to fire the houses—I went to none but the two, I never spoke to a soul besides—I did not tell him anything about firing railways—I said it was for firing houses and premises—there was not a word said about killing the police on that occasion—if I bad received orders from the delegates to get any one to kill the police, I should not have considered myself bound to carry them out; I merely did what I was desired, with reference to firing houses; I merely spoke to him—I never said they were not to consider whether there were people in the houses—this is the only occasion on which I have got people to fire houses; the only occasion on which I was asked to go—if I had been asked on other occasions I should have done so—I should not have fired any houses—I only heard the men talk about a Republic once—Dowling was present then—when Payne spoke of destroying the power of the Queen I said nothing, I was not on the Committee, and was surprised that they allowed me to be present—Rose spoke about assassinating the police—I was in communication with the police then—I offered no remarks on the subject, as I had no right to be there while they were sitting—it was business which ought to have been transacted by the committee alone—as delegate ought to have been present—I was present on one or two other occasions—they generally met before the general body of delegates, and before the delegates left they consulted together—that was the meeting where they produced plans, and talked about barricades—it did not occur to me that it was a curious thing that such important things should be communicated at a meeting at which I had no right to be present—nothing was said about my presence—there is no doubt there were many propositions made that were not made known to the general body of the delegates—I saw a plan; to the best of my knowledge this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on my solemn oath the word "fighting men" was used—the very first night Mullins asked us to give in out returns of the number of fighting men, those were his words—it was proposed, I think, by Donovan, to send a delegate over to Limerick or Cork to know how things were, in consequence of the difficulty of getting in<lb/>formation at the time the excitement was going on—I do not remember Dublin being mentioned—I never heard of any communication between the delegates and the people of Cork or Limerick—when Mullins said, "May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of the first man who betrays any one of us," I did not think he meant me, because he did not know I was in communication—I have been a carpenter for the last ten years—I was a bed-pillar carver before that—I have made more by carpententry</p>

                  </hi>. I have known Dowling about fifteen months—I am a member of the Repeal club of which he was the secretary—that club never appointed a delegate to the Chartists—I was a member of the Davis Club—the rules of that club were settled by two eminent lawyers, Sir Colman O'Loughlin and Sir Robert Holmes, and revised by Mr. Anstey, M. P. for Youghal, who was a member of the club—that club was dissolved for the purpose of being incorporated with the Irish League on the motion of Dowling—I can swear that body was for moral force—Dowling introduced a resolution approving of the principles of the Irish League—that club was bound to legal agitation.</p>

On 17th Sept., between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, Errington came up to me in King-street, Westminster—Wesley followed about a hundred yards behind—when I got to St. Ann-street, Errington said, "Now you have brought me all this way, I am determined you shall give me something"—I said, "You came of your own accord"—she said, "If you don't, I will knock your brains out"—two men popped from a court, and stood on each side of me—I gave Errington 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to let me go—I then felt 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—she asked Wesley to see if it was a good one, and said, "That won't do for me, I must have more"—I said, "I can't give you more; if you do not let me go I shall call the police"—she collared me, rent my coat open, put her hand into my pocket, took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they all ran away—I called a policeman, and described them—I afterwards found them at the station—I am sure of them—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plane-maker, of Wood-street, Westminster. On 18th July, about two o'clock in the morning, I was going up Dean-street—I met two females, and went with them to a house in St. Ann's-court—one of them, named Flynn, went out for some gin—I was left in the room with Jones—she took my watch, and snapped the silk guard—I laid hold of her—a man named Mulloy, and Flynn, came and knocked me down—Jones escaped—I rushed to the door, and Mulloy stopped me—the two women got away—I held Mulloy, and struggled with him down to a room on the first-floor, and burst the door open—I cried "Murder!" and "Police!'—the prisoners came in, knocked me down on the bed, and rushed down stair; but Doyle being the last I caught hold of him—he dragged me down to the bottom—he got away—I got up. and pursued him—he went down St. John s-buildings, and was going into 20, St. Ann-street—I seized him—Haycock and Mulloy came up again—Doyle knew Mulloy; he had been with him to the theatre that night.</p>

               <p>go on with them as regards moral force, but not to have any movement in the physical force, because I thought it was not a right thing—I should think the gunpowder cartridges and ginger-beer bottles were for physical force—I did not fill any of the ginger-beer bottles—I reminded Cuffey of them, because another man told me of them; it was not Powell, it was a man named Peter Cashel—I merely told Cuffey about it to see what he would say, I whether there were any fresh orders coming—he might not have told me without—it led him on to think I was sincere—I was not sincere in the phy<lb/>sical force movement—I meant to stop the progress of it, if any attempt was made—I did not mention to Cuffey the way in which the ginger-beer bottles were to be used—Cuffey said they were very good things for their wives to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> out of the windows on the police—I did offer to sharpen the pike—head—I did that from the same motive—it was not to lead him on, and then to betray him; that was not leading him on—I meant to stop the physical force movement, that was why I offered to sharpen the pike—head—I was in com<lb/>munication with the officers of the Government—I was not employed by them—I first communicated with them about a month after I joined the Chartists, some time in June—it was after that that I offered to sharpen the pike—head—it was said, merely to see what I could get out of him, to see what movements were on—it was not to see how far I could get him to go—I could not get him to go at all myself—he had orders from the wardens who were above him—from time to time during June I communicated what was going on—I was not associated with Powell—I did not know him till I saw him on this trial—I did not know he was employed—there was nobody associated with me—I do not expect to get anything for this—I do it for the good of the public, and likewise of myself—if they succeeded in burning houses they would stop trade and put me out of work, and I have a wife and family—they were to set fire to people's houses, and if anybody opposed them they were to knock them on the head—that would of course stop trade, and cause me to loose my work—that was the good I contemplated to myself by turn<lb/>ing spy and informer—I swear that—I was not examined before the Magi<lb/>strate—I was not examined at all till Saturday, on Dowling's trial—I heard of Cuffey's being taken into custody when I went to his house, about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not know he was to be taken—he was taken on the evening I went to his house—I had been before he was taken, and I went after—I went alone the first time—I did not go into his room, I might if I liked—he lives in a garret—I never noticed that there was a cock<lb/>loft there, or a loft at all—I now know there is one from what I have heard—I did not know it before—I have been into his room several times—about twenty-four times—I never noticed a trap-door there—I did not know there was one—I did not put the pole into it—I merely went to the house to get information from Cuffey—I did not know he was apprehended till I went the second time—I did not get the information I wanted—I knew he was taken, because I saw his son at the door of his house—I believe it to be his son—he is about twenty-seven years of age—I ascertained from him that he was taken—I was not in communication with West, the policeman, at that time, I did not know him then—I am now living by my work; that is the only mode I have no other means—I am in regular work with Mr. Martin, of 18, Grezert-street—I get 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, sometimes less sometimes more—I have been working for him off and on thirteen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. Shortly after the 10th of April I joined the Cripplegate locality of the Chartist Confederation—I was appointed one of the Council—our place of meeting was the front long-room, at Cart<lb/>wright's coffee-shop, Redcross-street, Cripplegate—I was a member down to Aug.—I attended meetings of the same body at other places, and made notes of what occurred, sometimes the next day, and sometimes the day after, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180105"/>
               <p>on one or two occasions, if not three, immediately I got home—they are very short—I speak principally from my memory (<hi rend="italic">looking at his notes</hi>)—the first meeting Fay was at, was on Friday, July 28th, at Hopkinson's coffee-shop, Saffron-hill—(it was held by adjournment from a former meeting at the same place—I was present at the adjournment)—on 28th, fourteen persons were present—Ferdinando, Mr. Page, from Tothill-street, Westminster locality; Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Payne, myself, Hopkinson, an Irish Confederate,: Mr. Home, (his first appearance,) Flannagan, Fay, and others—a return was given in of the number of fighting men, and the feeling of the members of the respective localities, by the new delegates that came there on that evening from localities in the metropolis—I was then acting as a delegate for Cripplegate locality—I cannot say bow many fighting men they returned—Mr. Payne was chairman, but Mullins was spokesman—a resolution was passed that each member should bring 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as soon as possible, to defray the expenses incurred by the committee—the meeting was adjourned to meet at Cart-wright's, on Sunday afternoon, July 30th—Payne, Dowling, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, (his first appearance,) Stevenson, myself, Ferdinando, Fay, and others, were present, twenty-eight in all—I got there between three and half-past three o'clock—returns were given in, the same as before, by the new delegates, and the ulterior committee resigned—that consisted of five—there was some conversation about increasing them to the number of nine, and some charge was brought against Mullins and Rose, two of the five, as being spies—Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Dowling, were elected—it was confined to five, but a resolution was passed that four others should be elected at the next meeting—I never was proposed—I said I bad heard that some charge had been brought against Rose and Mullins, and I thought it was better to set aside such trash, and have nothing more to do with it; and they were elected—I also made some remark that it was impossible for them to do anything in our movement, unless they could produce a spirit of subordination among the members—I believe that was after the allegation made against the two men as spies—it was resolved that they should meet at Cartwright's, at six on the following Monday evening, if necessary, but there was no meeting—they met next at the Dispatch coffee-house, Bride-lane. Fleet-street, on 1st Aug.—Rose, Mullins, Brewster, Dowling, Thompson, Donovan, Lynch, Warry, and others, thirty-four in all, were present—Payne was in the chair—Fay was there—I do not remember seeing the other prisoners—Bezer was there, it was his first appearance—he gave in a report of fifty fighting men from Cartwright's, for which locality he was secretary—he was not a delegate—there were other returns made—Fay, Thompson, Lynch, and Donovan, four Irishmen, were elected on the committee—their club belonged to the Irish Confederates at one time, but they altered the name to the Irish Felon-club—I am not certain which it was called at this time—Fay was secretary—they used to meet at Cartwright's—the reason given for adding four Irishmen to the committee was, that a feeling of jealousy existed—the whole of the four spoke that evening, and stated that they thought there was not a sufficient number of Irishmen on the committee, and in consequence of that they were added—there was some discussion on the propriety of dis<lb/>patching a party to Limerick or Cork—I forget who brought that forward; it was discussed, and lost, at the voting—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here requested that every witness subpoenaed to speak against his character might be ordered out of Court</hi>)—during the discussion it was said that it would be a waste of money, and there would be no possibility of getting a correct account of the state of affairs in Ireland; that was said by both sides—a report was given in from the</p>

               <p>delegates the same as before—nothing more was said about the Irish mes<lb/>senger—Dowling moved that there should be a demonstration on the following Sunday, 6th Aug., at two o'clock, on Primrose-hill, of Chartists and Confederates, to ascertain their number and strength; that was lost by a majority of five—a resolution was passed that every delegate should return to his locality, and ascertain how the members were prepared for regularity of preparation, and ready to be called out at an hour's notice, and to bring friends to the committee on Friday, Aug. 4th—Mullins stated that he had seen Mr. Kydd that day, and that Mr. Kydd, if the people came out for physical force, would not be backward in heading them; but that Mr. Kydd had entered on the executive only as a moral force man, and that he took the office on that ground—Kydd was one of the executive of the National Convention—the executive had to pay attention to the localities, to look after them, and receive names from them—they were in connection with the localities—that communication was received with a degree of satisfaction and surprise by the delegates—the meeting then adjourned to meet at Cartwright's on Aug. 4th—I attended—there were thirty-two present—Payne was in the chair on all occasions—Cuffey was there for the first tide, and Rose, Brewster, Gurney, Mullins, Bassett, (his second time,) Donovan, Lynch, Dowling, myself, Thompson, and others—I have not Fay's name-there were new delegates present; they gave in a report of the number of fight<lb/>ing men; I have no numbers—money was paid by the new delegates, and by some of the old, to Rose, as secretary—there was a discussion about what scarfs were to be worn, as signs of leadership, and it was decided that they should be red calico sashes—there was a conversation in committee between Payne, Bassett, and Mullins, about a communication that had been received from Kydd, and of a circular he had received, desiring to know how far the dele<lb/>gates then sitting in London, were desirous of sending a delegate to Manchester—I believe Bassett communicated that to the meeting—Payne made some remarks about his sleeping two or three nights at Lacey's house, and Lacey was proposed as a proper person to go to Manchester as a delegate, and it was agreed to—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey, who was not present, on the subject, and Mullins gave him money for the purpose—he went off, and I saw no more of him that evening—a resolution was passed by the general body of delegates that they should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee, the committee of nine—it was resolved that the delegates should call on their respective members to meet at half-past two on the following Sunday, at their localities, and they were not, by any means, to leave there, or visit Kennington-common that day—there had been a meeting at Kennington-common advertised in the newspapers, which was not called by any of the Chartist or Confederate bodies, and they were not to go for fear of coming into collision with the police and the authorities—a resolution was passed that every delegate should select four men, or more, for the purpose of placing them as telegraphs from the Dispatch coffee-house, Bride-lane, to Kennington-common, to communicate information to the delegates sittings the Dispatch coffee-house—it was resolved that they should meet at the Dispatch coffee-house, at half-past two o'clock on the following Sunday—I attended there, and was appointed as one to see the persons stationed as tele<lb/>graphs—I returned to the meeting of delegates just at its close, and found Payne, Brewster, Mullins, and others, there—I have no names—Cuffey was there when I returned, and 1 saw him there before the business commenced—the resolution as to stationing persons was carried out—I saw every man placed—the meeting separated about a quarter of an hour after I returned—I</p>

               <p>have no note of what took place, but my memory furnishes me—when I returned, Page, of Tothill-street, Westminster, was speaking on the subject of giving Mr. Bund Hughes, the Government reporter, a sound thrashing for what he had been doing—Page was a delegate—they met again on Monday night, 7th Aug., at Dennis's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials—there were thirty persons present; Cuffey, myself, Brewster, Mullins, Rose, Allnutt, Donovan, Dowling, Fay. Lynch, Thompson, Bassett, Ritchie, and others—the Ulterior Committee resigned that night, in consequence of the rumours of Smith O'Brien's arrest, and partly from a want of confidence that five of the committee had in the new four that had been added, and the four new ones complained that they had not seen the plans of the other five, and the five gave a similar explanation of not seeing the plans of the others—a new committee was appointed, consisting of five only, Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Brewster—it was arranged, after some discussion, that there should be a visionary president, and that one of the committee who had the lowest votes should withdraw to make room for him when he entered on the seat of presidentship, some one asked who this person was, and one of the delegates said he was neither in London, nor out of London, and that was my meaning in saying a "visionary president"—Bassett had the lowest amount of votes—it was resolved that each member of every locality was to pay three farthings a head, as a salary for the president—each delegate was to make that known, and was to collect it—Payne, who was in the chair, read a letter, which he said he had received from Lacey, and part of it was in these words, "Trade is very good, and you will soon receive a very good order"—that was received by the meeting with satisfaction—we then adjourned, to meet on the following Wednesday, Aug. 9th, at the Lord Denman beer-shop, Suffolk-street, Borough—I attended—there were Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, myself, Gurney, Donovan, Bassett, and others, in all twenty-eight present—as I was going in, I met Cuffey in the passage, going away—the meeting had begun before I got there—I shook hands with Cuffey, and asked him bow be was—after I arrived reports were given in of the feeling of the members of the loca<lb/>lities, and also a return of fighting men—Gurney gave in his return, either 100 or 120, but I think it was 100, from our locality—Gurney was formerly in the Artillery—his duty, as wardsman, was to look after his 100 men—each wardsman had 100 men under him, and each class-leader had nine under him, I often heard that said at Cartwright's—I do not remember the numbers mentioned by anybody else that night—a resolution was passed that each delegate should be called on to declare his allegiance, and determination to abide by the decision of the Ulterior Committee, and they stated, all except one, that they would abide by the determination of the committee—I am not sure who that one was—I think his name was Horne—he gave a reason for it, but I forget it—he came in nearly at the close of the business—Payne read an<lb/>other Utter from Lacey, and, in answer to some questions, he stated that Lacey was still at Manchester—some of the delegates present asked how long he was going to continue there, and Payne replied, as long as was necessary—I think, but am not sure, that there was a return given in at that meeting of the number of cartridges that were prepared—I have no note of it, I go from memory—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry's coffee-house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, on Friday, Aug. 11th, at eight o'clock—I went, and found no meeting—when I entered the coffee-room, I saw a person busy in packing up some chairs—he knew me, and said there was no meeting; that it was all <hi rend="italic">up;</hi> that the police had been to Rose's house, and seized his papers—</p>

               <p>the same person who told me that had been stationed on the Sunday as one of the telegraphs—the next meeting 1 attended was at the Orange Tree Orange-street, Red Lion-square, on Monday night, 14th—I went up stairs—I have not kept a memorandum of the persons who attended, but, to the best of my belief, there were twenty-five persons there—they were Mullins Brewster, Payne, Gurney, Fay, Ritchie, Scurry, Cuffey, and others, whose faces I knew, but not their names—a report was given in from some new delegates of the state of their localities, and of the number of fighting men the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate himself had prepared, and also the members of his locality—the number was 5000 fighting men of Chartists alone, and the number of cartridges was between 500 and 600—a question was asked about the number of Irish Confederates, and Mullins said they were about the same number as the Chartists—a resolution was proposed, I think by Mullins, and carried, that a deputation of two, Ritchie and Scurry, should wait on the North-western Railway engineers, to ascertain what were their feelings, and how far they were disposed to come over ad join the Chartists in their movement—they were to ascertain that if pos<lb/>sible, and they were requested by no means to give them the least ides what was their purpose in going there to wait on them—it was men<lb/>tioned that there was a dispute between the company and the men—I did not know of that till that evening—Mullins proposed, and it was resolved, that each delegate should select four or six men, or as many as he could get, men whom he could depend on, that would do anything and every<lb/>thing—some one asked what purpose they were for; and Cuffey said, to fire houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Mullins then looked up as the gas. which was burning at the time, and said, "If I look up at the gas you will all know what I mean"—neither Ritchie or Scurry were present when that was resolved—they had left on their deputation, and the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been voted to defray their expenses in the way of refreshments—I am not certain it was put to the vote, but I know 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid—they were not present when the last part of this occurred—Cuffey was secretary to the Ulterior Committee at this time—he stated so himself that evening—Brew<lb/>ster's conduct was not altogether becoming, and Cuffey said, "As secretary I have a right to rebuke you," or something to that effect—the meets; adjourned to the Lord Denman on the next evening—I went about eight or a little before, accompanied by Gurney—Payne, Mullins, Brewster, Cuffey, Dowling, Allnut, Fay, Gurney, Lacey, Ritchie, Page, Ferdinando, and others in all about forty were present—I saw some new faces, and I believe tier were delegates, and there were one or two that I knew were not delegates—Lacey stood with others near a window, and he began to tell us about the people in the country—he said that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, were up and doing, or would be doing that night—that he had been watched all day by the police, and that on coming out of the door a boy came up to him and told him that he had been watched by the police for two or three hours, and he said he had given them the <hi rend="italic">double</hi> and reached the place in safety—I had never seen him before—I asked him his name, and he said Lacey—about half an hour afterwards Brewster distri-buted coloured wristbands, exactly such a one as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me—Mullins was present, and I also think he distributed some—Brewster—said they were for the delegates to wear on their left wrists that their members might know them—about half an hour after the distribution, as far as my memory furnishes me, Fay came in and brought a person of the name of</p>

               <p>Donaldson, a member of our locality, who had no right to be there—I believe Fay had not been there before on that evening—Donaldson not being a dele<lb/>gate, had no right to be present—he went by the name of Donaldson—he bad not been long seated before they called for a pint of porter—some of the ulterior Committee, I believe Cuffey and Payne, came in shortly after—I had not seen them before—before Fay came in there was a question asked where the Committee should retire to, as the room up stairs was occupied by singing—that was after the distribution of colours—there was a talk of the Com<lb/>mittee going somewhere else, and Lacey said, "There is a neighbouring coffee-shop, kept by a person I know; I will go and see if we can have the room"—he left for that purpose—he came back directly, and said he had engaged the room—Payne, Brewster, Mullins, Cuffey, and Lacey then went—they were away half or three-quarters of an hour—Lacey did not return with them—I did not see him again that evening—they returned after Fay had come into the room—Mullins acted as chairman and spokesman—Cuffey said to him, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you had better give the instructions"—Mullins then said, "Gentlemen, as you are aware the Committee have retired and come to certain resolutions and decisions; they have requested me to give you the following instructions. Our friend Mr. Lacey has informed us that the men of Birming<lb/>ham and Manchester are up and doing, or will be doing to-night, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, therefore, Gentlemen, to-mor<lb/>row night you must come out to fight, and strike the blow: it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey said, "My time is short, my men are waiting; I take the western division; you had better put it round the room one by one, and let them answer yes or no"—Mullins then asked the man on ray right, "Will you come out to fight?"—he said, "Yes"—he-appealed to me, and I said, "Yes"—he then went round and put the question to every delegate till he came to Ferdinando, who stood up and spoke, and gave some reason why he would not come out—he said, "No"—the companion delegate to Allnutt, whose name I do not know, also answered, "No"—he did not give any reason—those were the only two exceptions—at this time all those I have named were present except Lacey—Mullins then said, "We shall take up four positions: Clerkenwell-green; the Tower Hamlets; Broadway, Westminster; and the Seven Dials"—Brewster was to take Clerkenwell-green, Payne the Tower Hamlets, and Mullins and Bassett the Broadway and Seven Dials, but which each was to take of the two I cannot say—Mullins then said, "Gentlemen, every delegate must assemble the members of his locality armed at their localities at eight o'clock to-morrow night precisely"—some delegate asked how they were to get there with their pikes—Mullins said, "I can only say get them there the best way you can, and every delegate must be with his members at their respective positions at twenty minutes past nine to a second"—he then went on to say that the different localities that were divided into different districts were to meet each of the four leaders, who were to have charge of the four districts—Brewster was to have Clerkenwell; and the City, Cripplegate, and Finsbury localities were to meet Brewster at Clerkenwell-green—there were different districts assigned to the four positions—Mullins, I believe, proposed Ritchie to be the man to superintend and direct the four or six men for firing that I have spoken of before—that was carried—I think Mullins mentioned firing that evening, because there were some new delegates came in, that did not understand—they were to meet at the Orange Tree, at five o'clock the next evening—the number of firing-men amounted to forty-six altogether, and they were to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree—a question was asked how they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180110"/>
               <p>would know Ritchie without a pass-word, and some delegate proposed the words "Frost and Mitchell," as a pass-word—Allnutt proposed the word, "Justice" instead—that was carried; and when each man went and opened the door at the Orange Tree, Ritchie was to ask him, "Who do you want? what do you want?" and the answer was to be the word "Justice," and by that Ritchie would know them—I was asked among the others how many firing-men I could bring, and I said I had spoken to two, one of those was included in the number forty-six—Gurney said, "Oh, nonsense, you can find six or eight, I can find more."—I was rather struck with his taking me up so soon and I said, "I know best"—I knew I can only speak to these two men—I did not mention their names—the others were asked the same question—the delegates had put the colours in their pockets I suppose, there might have been colours given to those who came in subsequently, but I did not see any—I received one that night—I kept it till I gave it up to the party I was in communication with—I showed it to a person in authority about two hours after I left the Lord Denman—I remember attending a meeting on 20th July last, at the Black Last or Jack, I am not certain which, in sow street in Lincoln's-inn-square—I do not know the name of the street—it is a house that lies rather in the corner of some street—I can hardly describe it—I do not think I have been in the neighbourhood before or since—when I attended on the 20th, there were fourteen people present, Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, a delegate from Greenwich, myself, Battice, another confederate, Allnutt, and one or two strangers—I do not know the name of the delegate from Greenwich—his name was mentioned, but it has escaped my memory, it was his first time of attendance—the meeting commenced about nine o'clock in the evening, or it might be a little later—it lasted until twelve, or ten minutes past—it was in a longish room, with a very high ceiling ornamented at both ends with a sort of canopy—it had the appear-ance of a club-room—that was the first meeting of delegates I attended—I was asked for credentials, and produced the leaf of a book which Bezer had given me—when he gave it me he made a statement—I gave the leaf to Payne, who was chairman—he compared it with his book, and then said, "That will do "—there was no writing on it—it appeared to match with what was left in the book—at that meeting a Committee of five was ap<lb/>pointed, to draw up five plans of action; Fay, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, and Dowling—I attended a meeting on 23rd July at Dennis's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials—Dowling, Brewster, Rose, and Mullins, were there, and Payne accompanied me there—there was on that day a meeting of the Committee before the meeting of the general body of delegates—some plans were produced—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the very identical plan that Mullins produced—Dowling said he thought he should not be able to under<lb/>take the management of the Seven Dials—the Seven Dials is shown in this plan—I afterwards saw Mullins put this plan into his pocket-book, and put it into his pocket—before that it was handed to three or four of them—I noticed there was something spoken about barricades—these lines where the crosses are were pointed out as barricades—Brewster said that to buss barricades you must build them halfway down the street—this was matter of conversation among us—there was no decision come to—a map of London was produced—they each had papers in their hands, but I did not see what they were—this is the one that was discussed and talked about—after the meeting of the Committee the delegates were admitted—there were ten per<lb/>sons present—Payne took the chair—he made a statement previous to the delegates coming in.—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you went by the name of Johnson at these meetings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—that was the only name I went by, but there was a person that called me Robinson one evening at Cartwright's—I said, "Call me anything you like; it is all the same"—that was the only night I went by the name of Robinson; that is the only name I have ever gone by, except my own—I am thirty-three years of age—I do not remember going by any other name; I cannot at this moment say positively—I never went by any name but Johnson among the Chartists—I have gone by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Welch Novice</hi>, but not by any other surname—I joined this Association soon after April—I did not take notes of the meetings at Cartwright's locality—I made notes of the meeting of 20th July, about two days after, in this book—it did not exceed two days—I did not take those notes by the desire of anybody; I took them of my own accord—I did not show them to any<lb/>body after I had taken them; I am certain about that—I do not think I took notes of the meeting on 23rd; I cannot remember—I have not destroyed any of the notes I made—I know these notes were taken either the next day after the meeting or the day after—these are the only notes I took (<hi rend="italic">handing them to the Counsel</hi>)—all I put down on July 23rd was the names of the persons present—what I have stated is partly from recollection and partly from the book—what is down I put down, and I have remembered the rest—I did not put it all down at the same time—the memorandum of 23rd July was all put down at the same time, and with the same pen—sometimes I wrote it at different periods of the same day—I may have put down a part on 23rd, and forgotten a part, and put that down next day—that was not the case on each of the occasions; it may have happened on other occasions—I communicated to the police from time to time what was going on—I never showed them my notes; they never asked me—I never showed my notes till I went before some of the authorities—I think that was before the prisoners were taken—I do not remember showing my notes to any one as early as 5th Aug.; I will not swear I did not—I have never altered them since they have been shown to the authorities; I forget when they were shown to the authorities—by the authorities I do not mean the Magistrate, but another party; I am not bound to state his name—I did not show that person my notes—I joined this Asso ciation for the purpose of gaining information and giving information to the authorities—I am a carpenter—I have always had plenty of work to do—I make about 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I have a wife and family, and have a little property coming in—I was not driven by poverty to join these people; I did it from a desire to communicate their proceedings—I did not communicate that desire to anybody before I joined them—I entered of my own accord—I was not desirous of having the name of "spy," but I was determined to acquaint the authorities with what was going on—I went in for that purpose; not to betray them, but to communicate what was going on—I do not like the word "betray" any more than I do the word "spy"—I considered that there were parties there that were not scrupulous of what they would do—I did it for the public benefit, and nothing else—I did it for the good of my country—I did not expect to get anything by it; I was not in a position to be necessi<lb/>tated—I have received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week since I have been obliged to be kept out of the way from personal danger—there is nothing else to come; I do not expect a farthing—it is not as good as carpentering—I have been a carpenter</p>

               <p>for the last eleven years—before that I was a bed-pillar carver—I have been connected with the turf, and been rather a sporting man, as a pedestrian—it was then I was called the <hi rend="italic">Welch Novice</hi>—I am a descendant of Welchmen—I ran a race; I did not lose it or win it—I did not get persons to back me—I went out for my own amusement to the place, and I was asked to run to amuse the party; it was merely for a <hi rend="italic">draw</hi> to a public-house—that was not the only sporting matter in which I have been concerned—it was announced in the paper by a party who I knew nothing of, that there was to be a cele<lb/>brated runner—I went there out of curiosity; it was only done to draw custom to the house—I professed then to be a bit of a runner, and I profess to be so now—I was not a celebrated runner—I was also at Wimbledon once for the same purpose—the other was at Hounslow—I have also run at Croydon, still as the <hi rend="italic">Welch Novice</hi>—that was merely for a day's amusement, and for which I was well remunerated—I believe those are all the sporting matters in which I have been engaged—I know what <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> means—I was never in that line; I swear that—I was never with a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> table at races; I have looked on at a table—I do not exactly know what a <hi rend="italic">decoy</hi> is—I have played at a table—I neither won nor lost—I was paid so much a day for playing at the table; it was not at a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> table, but a marquee-table, where they play with balls—I expected you would ask me about this, and I am willing to state everything, and all I know of the affair—that was the only time I was ever at such a place—I received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was on account of my master that I went there—it was to stand at the table, take the money, and pretend to bet—I was young, and quite ignorant of the nature of these proceedings—it was just before I was out of my time; I was nearly twenty-one—I went more for a holiday—my master had a relation named Durdon, and my master's brother was in the habit of attending the races with Durdon, and my master said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, how would you like a holiday?"—I said, "Very well, master"—he said, "Well, I can get you one if you like to go, you must not let the old man know anything of it; if you like to go with Durdon to the races, you can, and you shall be paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your time, and your expenses," and with that I went with my master's brother, who was a door-keeper; and that was the only time in my life that I ever did anything of the sort—I knew that I was not in reality betting—I did not consider myself a cheat—of course I was pretending to bet, in order to deceive people—I do not deny that—I never swindled persons—I never had a farthing—I do not know who did—I do not know whether there was any money won or lost—I swear that—I do not think I was in there the whole three days—it was a three day's race—it was at Ascot races—I kept running in and out of the marquee to see the races more than to stop there, and there was a great disturbance with one of the parties about my going out—I was never at any other <hi rend="italic">rovlette-table</hi> than that—I never played at a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig-</hi> table, and never associated with those sort of men—I know Richard Pennell—I never told him that I had walked a match against Townsend, the peder<lb/>trian, and <hi rend="italic">sold</hi> the parties who backed me, because I could get more money on the other side—I never walked for any money, I am certain of that, merely to draw custom to the house—I was once a witness at this Court, about eight years ago, in the case of a party for picking a gentleman's pocket.—I happened to see it—I never said to any one on that occasion, that I Was frightened about being asked about my <hi rend="italic">thimble-rigging</hi>—my father is dead—I have been in the employment of my brother-in-law, Mr. Smith—I have only been engaged a week for another party within the last eleven years—Smith keeps many men—I do not think those men knew that 1 was at all connected with this matter—I never persuaded a man to join it—they are quite capable</p>

               <p>of joining it without my persuasion—James Paris is Mr. Smith's foreman—I never told him that I was employed by <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> men, nor anything of the kind, nor that I was employed by the police against the thieves—I never said to him that I had been a witness at the Old Bailey, and was afraid the Counsel would question me about having communication with a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> man, and I would never appear again—I have occasionally talked to Paris about religions natters—I never expressed my entire unbelief in a God, or in the Scriptures, or in our Saviour, nor anything of the kind; I always have believed, and do believe now—I told Paris that it was likely he would hear something remark<lb/>able—I do not think I told him I expected there would be a rising—he has not taxed me directly with being a spy—he has said something like it—I thought that he threw out hints, but I took no further notice of it—I once got about 1lb. of lead from Mr. Smith, my brother-in-law—that was for the pur<lb/>pose of casting bullets for Gurney our warden—he had asked me on several occasions for bullets—he was casting them himself, and made cartridges him<lb/>self—I got the lead because he wanted to get as many made as possible for him to take care of for the day of rising—I cast the bullets at my own house—one of my boys, about ten years old, was present—he did not know what purpose I had the bullets for—he asked what I was doing them for, and, of course, I made him no answer—I took care of the bullets after I had cast them, and gave them to Gurney—I think those were the only bullets I cast—I received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from our locality for the purpose of buying cartridge-paper and powder, and Gurney had received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that purpose on a previous occasion—he did not employ me to get that—the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth is all that I have bought—I am not aware that I had any nickname among my fellow-shopmen—I do not remember that I was called "<hi rend="italic">Lying Tom"</hi>—I should say it was not likely—I never heard it—I never had it put to my face—if they did call me so, it was unknown to me—this is the first I have heard of it—if they had said such a thing to my face I should have resented it, and that they knew well enough—a person named Thomas Osborne worked for Smith—I never told him that there was to be a Chartist rising, and never urged him to join me; or others of the men in his presence—I do not remember doing such a thing—I will not swear I have not—I may have done it and forgotten it—I cannot remember pointing out to Osborne a man who would make him a pike—I remember being at a meeting at Birdcage-walk, and a person named Hook was there, and there was a person there who was a blacksmith and I. think I did speak about such a thing then—I think I have some recollection of pointing out to Osborne a man that would make him a pike—I believe I did—I do not know what the pike was to be for—I will explain how it was—there was a meeting at Birdcage walk one Sunday morning, and Osborne came up to look on out of curiosity, and he entered into conversation about Pennell having slandered his character, and what a disturbance Pennell bad caused in the Carpenter's Society—we fell into conversation on Chartism, and Hook spoke to this blacksmith to make a pike for him, and I believe I did mention, "If you want such a thing there is a blacksmith can make it"—that was bow it took place—I think it was to Osborne I said this, but I am not cer<lb/>tain—I do not know whether he meant to have one, or if he had one what he would do with it—I had no idea.</p>

               <p>b----guts up with a chisel, nothing of the kind—Carr was in my bro<lb/>ther-in-law's service about six years ago—I believe my father was alive at that time—Carr caused great disturbance in our house through his conduct my father and I have had one or two quarrels; I never struck him, I pushed him—he came and struck me a violent blow, and I was so hurt in my feelings that I of course turned round and put my hand on his collar and struggled with him to kepp him away from me—I never pushed him down—I did not say to him, "You old b----, I will murder you"—no such words ever cars out of my lips—I struggled with him—my brother-in-law came and sepa<lb/>rated us—my father was about sixty-two or sixty-three at that time—he was a strong, able-bodied man—he died about two years and a half after that—I had an uncle; I had had quarrels with him, I have been bound over to keep the peace towards him—I may have spoken to Pennell about my father—I never told him that I hoped my father's soul was in hell, nor anything of lit kind—I do not think I have ever spoken to Pennell about the Government—he is a man that is well known, he has caused a great deal of disturbance in the shop from time to time—he is not in the shop now—my brother-in-law discharged him—I never told Pennell that the Government was a weak and b----y Government, and I would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil in a short time—I never said anything of that kind to him about a fortnight before 10th April—I do not think I saw him anything near that time—I do not believe I have seen him above twice for this six or seven months—he has been discharged a long time—the only time I can remember was, meeting him one night in Pitfield-street, as I was going home—I swear I did not meet him about ten minutes past six one morning, about a for night before 10th April—I do not believe I did, I cannot swear it—I did not stop him, and ask him if he was a member of the Chartists—I do not believe I ever asked him such a question; if I did, it was while he was in mv brother-in-law's service, not since—he never asked me to propose him as a member, nor did I tell him that delegates would be chosen in about a fortnight, to agitate the country—I never told him that I should get from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, which would be far better than working at Smith's—I never asked him to go to Cartwright's—he did not say that the Chartists would never get the Charter in the way they were going on—I did not say to him, "Look at the Queen, with her hundreds of thousands a year, spending in waste and idleness, while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread"—I never spoke to him about the Queen—I may have done so when we were at work, six or seven years ago—I do not believe I ever said such a thing—I never said I would blow her and the b----y foreigner to hell—I never used such words to any person whatever, nor any expressions of that kind—I never asked him to call at my bouse on the Sunday morning, and I would show him materials sufficient to blow London to hell in half an hour—I never saw him to ask him such a question—I do not remember showing him any printed bill—I know James Bennett, a shoemaker, living at Leonard-square, Shoreditch—I do not think I saw him two or three days or a week before 10th April; I might, it is very likely I did; I cannot say whether it was two or three days, it might have been a fortnight before—he was in the habit of mending shoes for me and my children, and very likely I may have seen him about: job to do to my shoes—I do not remember speaking to him about 10th April—I was not intimate with him, and never knew he was a Chartist until 10th April—all I knew of him was, that he used to mend my shoes and my chil<lb/>dren's—I do not think I asked him what he intended to do on 10th April—I cannot swear I did not—I do not think he told me he was going to Kenning<lb/>ton</p>

               <p>never knew his name—I have seen him in and out of Cartwright's, and that is all—I did not tell him to procure arms as soon as possible, and if all working men were prepared as I was they would soon upset the b----Go<lb/>vernment—I swear no such words were ever uttered by me to him—I never spoke to him above twice—I never said anything to him about the b----Government—I never told him, if he wanted gunpowder, I would supply him with it; nor did he say he was a peaceable and quiet man, and would have nothing to do with it—I never had any such conversation with him—he was turned out of one of our meetings at Cartwright's locality—the first time I ever spoke to him was when he impudently came into the secret meeting there, and he said, "Why am I not allowed to be here? I have a much right as that man," pointing to another individual; and there was great confusion at the time, and astonishment at his impudence, in wanting to she there, without being a member of the locality—he came into the secret meeting—anybody could come in, if they liked to have the impudence to come, through Cartwright's back place—he was a man that had impudence enough to come, and he was turned out by force; in fact, it was with some difficulty they got him down stairs—that was not in April—if you will lend me my book I will give you the date—I think I can refer to the very meeting (<hi rend="italic">referring to his book</hi>); it was on Sunday afternoon, 30th July—I swear 1 had no such conversation with him in April as you have referred to—I do not know George Thurston by name—there are many persons whose faces I know, but not their names—I do not know this, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>); I never saw it before, it is not my drawing—I do not know Westmoreland—I never gave such a thing as this to anybody, and never drew a thing like it—I have drawn plans, to ascertain what the plans were which I heard of among the different members of the locality—I heard that there was a secret meeting sitting, and that there was a plan they were going to operate upon, and I drew out a plan for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was plan of the kind—I believe that was about June or July—I drew a plan of one circle—I had heard that there were to be four or five mock meetings and sham demonstrations at Bishop Bonner's-fields; and, hearing of that, and also that there was to be an assassination of the police in the night, I was deter<lb/>mined to try and find out what this secret meeting was, and what plan it was they had got in operation—that was why I drew the plan—I showed it to person named Mayne, and tore it up by his direction—he said, "I would not have you get yourself into danger, you had better tear it up"—he is a person who is frequently at Cartwright's—it was not before the affair in Bishop Bonner's-fields that I showed it him; that was the only one, and that I showed to three or four at Cartwright's, on purpose to ascertain what was going on—I do not remember saying to anybody that I should want him, and that he must bring something with him—I had a pair of pistols—I did have them on 13th Aug.—I exchanged them for another pair in Holborn, or the Strand, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I forget when—(<hi rend="italic">George Thurslon was here called in</hi>)—I do not know that man by name, I know him by sight—I have no recol<lb/>lection of asking him if he was a Chartist—I will not swear I did not—I do not think I ever offered to sell him a pair of pistols for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I will not <hi rend="italic">swear</hi> I did not—I swear I did not offer to do so on 13th Aug.—I do not believe I offered to do so some time in Aug.—I will not swear I did not—I swear not offer them to him after 13th Aug., because I think I had not had then for two months before that time—I did not offer that if he would buy the pistols, I would give him half-a-pound of powder into the bargain—I never offered him any powder, or any one; and never gave or offered any one any</p>

               <p>from Brewster, one for myself and one for a delegate that ought to have attended with me—they were to meet at twenty minutes past nine and to bring what arms they could get—a motion was made as to where the localities should meet on the Wednesday—one was appointed to meet, at the Pea<lb/>cock, Westminster-road; another, at the Crispin, in Milton-street, Cripple<lb/>gate; another, at Breadon's beer-shop, Shouldham-street; and the fourth, I think, at the Buck's Head, somewhere about Bethnal-green-road, or Hackney-road—a motion had been made the night before that the delegates select four men that were willing to risk anything and everything to attend where Ritchie should appoint them; it was merely a conversation—they were appointed to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree, from five to seven—they were called <hi rend="italic">luminaries</hi> by Mullins—there was to be a pass-word—Ritchie was to say to them, when they came in, "Do you want me?" and if they an<lb/>swered "Justice" he would know they were the men sent by the delegates-nothing was said about what Ritchie was to provide, but that he would give instructions to these men; but each man was advised to come armed, if he could—we met at the Orange Tree, Red Lion-square on the 14th—there wert between twenty and thirty present—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Ciiffey, Ritchie, Crookshank, Allnutt, Fay, Johnson, Pearce, Simmons, Fleming, two Granshaws, (brothers,) and a person named Ford; he was not a delegate, but was bail for Ernest Jones, he brought 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from a new localto started at Knightsbridge—I do not know where he lived; I understood th; he came from Knightsbridge-district—at the same time he came, Mr. Reank, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi>, came under the pretence that he was seit the meeting; but there had been reports that he was a Government spy, ana they would not go on with the business till he left the room—he was asked to go down stairs—it was moved by Mullins, at that meeting, that each delegate should go back to his locality and pick four men out, who were willing to do anything that was required of them—some one asked what they meant by it, and be said be would point to the gas, and they might take by his pointing what he meant; and Cuffey said it was no use to mince the matter, they wanted them for firing, or anything that might be required of them; for it was no use to mince the matter now, they knew their necks were in jeopardy; in fact, the halter was round their necks, and it was co use to say it in half words; that they wanted men to fire station-houses, or warehouses, or anything that might be required of them—a motion was made that two delegates should be sent to the meeting of the engine-drivers of tie North Western Railway to know what iheir opinions were; not to compromise themselves too much, by stating their views, and getting them to join the Chartists, but to hear the opinions of the drivers first; and if they found they were agreeable to close with the Chartists, they were to bring them to tie meeting, or delegates from their body, on a future night—Crookshank and Ritchie were appointed to go, and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was allowed them for expenses—a remark was made that they wondered Lacey had not come that night—they waited for him till half-past eight, and then adjourned to the Lord Denman-there was another meeting that night of Confederates, at Nagle's; I did not attend it—Johnson attended both these meetings—I did not, at that time, know that his name was other than Johnson—I did not know he was in communication with the police; in fact, he was the last man I should hm thought of—I have not had any communication with him since, except one word as I stood in Court, now—the meeting before that at the Orange Tree was held, I think, at Breadon's—I remember two or three meetings at Hopkinson's</p>

               <p>coffee-house, Saffron-hill—the last meeting I attended there was on the Sunday morning before the apprehension of the parties—there were not many delegates present—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Fuzzon, Allnutt, Ritchie, and others, were there; I did not see Johnson—I had received a letter from Mullins on the Saturday, calling the meeting—a resolution was moved by Jluliins that the meeting should be adjourned till the afternoon—a few of us had a consultation down stairs, and they invited us up to the locality meeting, which was held every Sunday morning—when I went in there was a motion on, whether the district of Clerkenwell should turn out for physical force or not—it was put to the vote and carried that they should turn out—mention was made that a person of the name of Meriman had made a report that two nen at the head of the movement were in the pay of the Government, and communicated to the police the whole of the proceedings—there was a long discussion upon it, and two delegates were appointed to wait on Meriman, to know the truth or falsehood of the statement; but I understood they could not get an interview with him—the meeting adjourned till three in the after<lb/>noon, and met at Breadon's beer-shop, in Shouldham-street—there were about thirty present—Cuffey was there, and was appointed secretary to the sub<lb/>committee at that meeting—there was a letter read from Lacey. I understood, from Manchester, stating that trade was very brisk there, and he was surprised that he had not received the order that he sent down, which we inferred meant the money that he had written for; trade was very good, and he expected a very large order—an order was wanted to be sent down by the Monday night, by the last train—the letter did not mention when he expected to be in town—a stranger, whose name I do not know, and—who I never saw before, stated that the Irish brigade in St. Giles's had provided themselves with a musket each, and so many rounds of cartridge, and were willing to assist in whatever resolu<lb/>tion the Chartists might come to—the meeting broke up between five and six—I remember going to attend a meeting at Perry's coffee-house, Shoreditch, and no meeting took place, because the police had seized some papers from Rose's at eight the same morning, (Friday); some persons there told me so, I do not know their names, one was Donnovan; a person who was there purposely appointed, told me so—they were playing at cards down stairs—I did not go up—I went away with Pedley, to Rose's house, to ascertain if it was true, I found it was so—the meeting that I attended before that was either at the Lord Denman or the Orange Tree—I think it was on the Tuesday or Wed<lb/>nesday before—Wednesday was the 9th—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Cuffey, Nash, Rose, Pedley, Johnson, Donnovan, Fuzzon, and Allnutt, were there—something was said about M'Douall, but it was a private conversation—Rose is a carrier by trade, and was secretary to the sub-committee—Mullins was treasurer—they in general inquired whether anybody had brought any funds, and the delegates made reports of the state of their localities, and how many men they could depend on that would turn out to fight in case of an outbreak they did not do that at all the meetings, but at three or four of them—I think the number was mentioned as 1500 at one meeting, and above 2000 at another—they reckoned that the aggregate number mustered about 3000, and Mullins remarked that it was not those they depended on; they did not depend on the organised Chartists, but they reckoned there were about 30000 thieves and vagabonds about London who would co-operate with and assist them—on the Sunday morning before that, we met at Dennis's coffee-jouse, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, ttose, and Thompson, were there—I know Lynch; I will not be certain whether</p>

               <p>he was there, and I will not ho certain whether Fay was there—there were not above nine—I do not believe Cuffey was there—it was proposed, I think at that meeting that each delegate should bring up 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to form a fund—I was present at a meeting when the committee resigned, and a fresh committee was appointed—I think that was on Monday evening, the 7th, at Dennis coffee-house—the committee consisted of Fay, Mullins, Bassett, Donnovan Payne, Brewster, Lynch, and Dowling; I do not think Cuffey was a member—there were three Irish on it beside Dowling; Lynch, Fay, and Donnovan—they resigned on account of the news coming from Ireland that the rebels had been defeated, and there was some remark about Smith O'Brien, bull forget it—the Irishmen had been added to the committee in order that the; Confederates should be fairly represented as well as the Chartists—a new committee of four was then formed, with ore prospective, who was to be president—his name was not mentioned, but it was understood from Mullies that it was Churchill, who was then in France—the four were Brewster Mullins, Payne, and I will not be certain about the other; but 1 think it Cuffey—I know Bassett, the president, was to take the command of the whole committee; and it was proposed, by a person named Warry, that a farthing should be paid by each person in each locality to support the president—at the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house, Dowling made a motion that the Confederate's and all the Chartist's localities should meet on Primrose—the Sunday; but when it came to the vote it was not carried: they hthougt it was premature—there was a meeting previous to this at the Dispatch coffee-house, I think, on the Wednesday—the Sunday meeting was at two in it afternoon—I think it was at the latter end of July—there was a meed; proposed to be held on Kennington-common on that same Sunday—we held a meeting that day at the Dispatch coffee-house, and had messengers from there to Kennington-common, to communicate any outbreak that might place—it was to be passed along on a bit of paper, written in pencil—persons were stationed every two hundred yards—it was supposed to be a meeting of Chartists; it was called by advertisement, by a person named Dwaine, of Cartwright's locality—the men were stationed between the common and the coffee-house; that had been agreed on before—I do not know who was employed to superintend them—Johnson was very busy over them-a meeting did take place at Kennington-common, but there was only a politic! sermon preached, I believe—there were reports that everything was quiet, except that two or three policemen in plain clothes were attempting to get up a disturbance—nothing further was done, that I am aware of—I forget at what place we met before that Sunday—I was taken so suddenly in coming forward to give evidence that I cannot recollect, for I did not think of comb; forward to give evidence in this ease up to ten this morning—I have only just come from Greenwich—I attended several other meetings before that—there was one meeting at Hopkinson's coffee-house, and I saw plans, and like weeks a map of London there—I think Payne had possession of them, and Hose, Mullins, Brewster, Thompson, and myself, were there together—I cannottd. when that was; it was before the meetings I have poken of; it was is forepart of the evening when the plans were produced—Johnson was there afterwards—those plans were just marked out, similar to a map on a piece oi paper—they were rather small—Mullins explained it, and pointed out thati. was to erect barricades from Clerkenwell down to Seven Dials, and from Seven Dials down Drury-lane to St. Mary's Church, in the Strand, by Somerset-house, and right along the Strand to Temple-bar; that would form</p>

               <p>a good barricade, and from Temple-bar down Fleet-street, and by the water-side, and they were to make sure of Chaplin and Home's premises—I should know the plan if I were to see it—this is not it (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one identified by Powell</hi>)—there were not so many figures on it; it was very plain indeed V—this is not it (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—they were to make a circle round from Holborn till they got to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and down there till they got to Clerkenwell-green and Aldersgate-street, and they were to take pos<lb/>session of St. Paul's Church—this is not the plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—it was merely in the centre of the paper, scribbled out, a rough plan—I attended a meeting at the Black Jack; that was not my first attendance as a delegate; I first attended as a delegate on Whit-Monday—I attended of my own accord at the Black Jack, for Greenwich—I merely went to get information—Mul<lb/>lins, Payne, Rose, and Dowling, were there—Johnson came in afterwards—Dolling said he attended the meeting, not being elected as a delegate, but at the invitation of Mullins—Dowling was a confederate, and secretary of the Davis-dub—a sub-committee, consisting of Rose, the secretary; Payne, the chairman; Mullins, the Treasurer; Dowling and Brewster were appointed for the purpose of drawing out plans to attack the police and soldiers—it was not said how many plans were to be drawn out—I attended other meetings.</p>

               <p>Westminster-road—we found the class-leaders of the Lambeth district thera—a person named Pedley, a delegate belonging to the council of the Lambeth locality, was there—I was there that evening about two hours and a half—Pedley said there was a delegate coming from Manchester, and that they were up and doing in Manchester and the North of England—Pedley told us all to sit down, and he asked us all if we were prepared to fight—one man smiled, and said, "You don't mean it?" and Pedley said, "We do mean it;" and then he said, "Then we are ready to come out"—he told us to tell our men to come there the next night, at eight o'clock, with arms, and those who had not arms would be put in the way to get them—we were to meet at the Broadway, Westminster, where we should meet the Dean-street locality—we were to come to the Peacock first—he mentioned that the other loca<lb/>lities were to meet at the Seven-dials, Clerkenwell-green, and at the east end of the town—in pursuance of those directions, I went, about one o'clock, next day, and spoke to six of my men, I think—Conway, whowas taken at the Angel, was one, and Prowton another—I told them what Pedley had said—I went to the Peacock by myself, I believe, at eight o'clock, and met Morgan, Pedley, Con<lb/>way, Chester a class-leader, and Winspere, there—Pedley brought a paper, with some coloured ribbons in it, which he said the delegates were to wear, that tie men might know them; and another paper with some powder, with which he filled up some ball-cartridges—I had a pike—head, and I afterwards fetched my pistol—Pedley gave me a ball-cartridge to load the pistol—this is one of the ribbons (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)—in consequence of something that the landlady said, I went to the Angel, in Webber-street—I left Pedley behind, but he came afterwards—he left about three minutes before the police came—I had given information to the police between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Pedley load a pistol at the Angel for a man, whose name I forget—he did not take it away.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever work for Mr. Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was dismissed through shortness of work—that was the only reason—he did not tell me I never should have work there again—I have never required it since—I left I suppose seventeen months ago—I never heard Powell examined on his oath, but I have beard him swear openly in the shop times out of number, so help his God, be would swear anything if he could get paid for it—I do not mean to say he would speak out openly to every one in the shop; he did not like the foreman to know what was going on at all—he has told me of instances when he has been brought to the Old Bailey as a witness, and has said be would swear anything that he could get paid for—I heard him called <hi rend="italic">"Lying Tom"</hi> in presence of Osborne and Goner, a carpenter and joiner, but not of the foreman—I have seen him take the Scriptures in his hand, and when he came to a place where Christ was named, he would break it off, and say, "We will bum that b----r, and put it into the fire"—Carr and me were present—he tore out a leaf—I have seen him break out the name of Christ's disciples—when he came to a certain part, he would say, "Here is Christ, we will burn him," he would break the portion off, and when he came to the disciples, he would say, "Here are villains, here are some of the scoundrels," and would burn them; but when he came to the name of <hi rend="italic">Judah</hi>, he said he was the best fellow of the lot, he did get paid for his job, but he (Powell) would have done it for half the money—I have only seen him burn the paper once—I did not mention this to the attorney who examined me—I did not think of it—it would not have done for me to have told Mr. Smith—I was shocked—I never spent an hour with the man in my life—I continued to work at the next bench to him—I never saw him reading the Scriptures to get any good out of was only to pick out and damage it—I suppose it was his own book—the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in consequence of your knowledge of Powell's character that you were asked to say what you knew of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw the statement which I made reduced to writing by the master shoemaker, and I put my name to it—I afterwards saw it in the <hi rend="italic">Northern star</hi>—that was a statement of all I knew of the character and conduct of Powell except about his being the murderer of his father, but I always thought it was robbery—the conversation about the Scriptures has occurred scores of times. not a day in the week but he would bring it up, but I only saw him burn a portion once—Carr was present once when he said Jesus Christ was a thief and has been there scores of times when he used such expressions—the person who came to me with the card was in Mr. Smith's employ, and a member of the Trades society—I saw by the papers that Powell was a witness—I can not mention half the shopmates that have heard him speak so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the book kept that was torn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was part of the New Testament—it was kept in his chest, in the shop—he was not much in the habit of reading the Scriptures—on rhis occasion lie merely took hold of a leaf and said, "See, here is a history of Christ," and so on—I only saw him do it once, but he broke out several portions on the same occasion but when he came to Judas, that betrayed Christ, he would not bum that—sometimes read the Testament of a Sunday, but generally read the newspaper</p>

               <p>on a working day—he took out several parts of one leaf, or it may be another leaf—I cannot say how many leaves he broke—he broke up a number of pieces but whether all out of one leaf I cannot say.</p>

I am a Chartist—I know Powell—I remember a meeting held on Sunday, 23rd April last, at Birdcage-iralk, Bonner's-fields—I saw Powell there—I was in conversation with two other gentlemen, I believe two weavers, and Powell came and asked me whether I was provided to obtain my rights—I asked what he meant—he asked whether I was possessed of arms—I told him I was not possessed of any except what I had on my body—Powell then said I had no right to speak a word about the Charter, unless I was possessed of arms, and deter<lb/>mined to maintain my rights—he asked me if I had got a pistol first, and then if I had a sword—I said I had not—he then asked where my residence was—I did not tell him—he said, "You are not worth a d----as a Chartist, unless you have got arms"—I told him if he said anything more to me about those sort of arms, I would get out of the society altogether—he then left me—I did not see him go among the crowd—I saw no more of him that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master boot-maker. Davis had a room a my house six or seven years ago, as near as I can recollect—about twelve months ago, he asked me to join a Chartist club—he showed me some guns which he said he had brought from London, and was going to take to the Druids' Arms—he had pistols at one time, and afterwards a gun—is said he was in the habit of going to London, and purchasing arms to supply the Chartists with—I said to him that no sensible man would talk in the way—he advised me to go to the Druids' Arms, where I should hear arguments to convince me—after the birth of Her Majesty's last child, Davis something disrespectful in reference to its birth—about six days before 16th Aug., the 11th as near as 1 can recollect, he said to me, "Now you will soon see what we can do; we shall soon all be ready "—he said he was a Chartist. and asked me to join them—I am not one—I refused, and ridiculed him.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband—I now live at 5, Eden-streef, Holborn. About twelve weeks ago, in May, I came home to where we lived, in Webber-street, between nine and ten o'clock at night—my husband was sitting by the fire—he asked the little boy, who is twelve years old, what the time was—he said, ten minutes to ten, I think—my husband spoke about the impropriety of my not being at home before him, and asked me for money—he accused me of being drunk as usual—I denied it—I was not—he asked for some supper—I said it was out of my power to give it—aggravation took place between us to the extreme—I accused him of being drunk—he had begun to drink at six o'clock in the morning—he asked if I could not furnish him with a sovereign next day—I said it was out of my power—he accused me of many things, family matters—he had the poker in the fire, clearing it—I found him in the act to strike me—he made after me, and struck me on the arm—I believe I put my arm up—I do not know where he struck at—I may have told the Magistrate I put my arm up to guard my head, and got the blow on my arm—I heard a noise, as if a basket was broken—there was no basket there—I afterwards found my arm was broken—I fell—I do not know what made me fall—I was then struck again on my legs with a poker, which my husband had in his hand—I was struck four or five times on the arm—I pulled a chair near me—I cannot say whether that saved me—my husband broke it with the poker—some one came in—I was taken to the hospital, and have been there ever since.</p>

On 31st May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in my back parlour, and heard very loud blows in rapid succession, and screams of "Murder!" and "Save me!"—I went, burst the door open, and found Mrs. Morris weltering in blood, and the prisoner stand<lb/>ing over her with part of a broken poker—I said, "For God's sake, you are not going to kill the woman!"—he said, "She deserves it"—I saw that her arm was broken, and the elbow dislocated—there was blood on the ground—the police came in, and I gave him in charge—he seemed very cool and col<lb/>lected—he put his fingers in his waistcoat-pockets, he gave one of his chil<lb/>dren half-a-crown to pay for something, and took his snuff-box from the shelf and put it in his pocket, as if nothing had occurred.</p>
