She stated that Steel had kept the Cock two years; that she had received a two pound note from Steel about a week ago; that Steel had taken the Horse and Groom public-house from her husband, in St. Martin's-lane; he was to give two hundred pounds. She admitted that she had gone into the shop to purchase spoons. I questioned her how she had been employed for several days previous to the 28th. She stated, that, on the 27th, she had not been out of Steel's house the whole day; that she had been employed in nursing the child, and needlework. That, on the preceding day, the 26th, she did nothing material, but made the beds; but was not out. On the 25th, she could not tell what she was about; that she was reading, but not out on that day. On the 24th, was cleaning the house. On the 23d, could not tell what she was about, but was not out. In short, that she had not been out of Steel's house all the week; that she had received the note in question with several other notes, six I believe, then twelve, afterwards eighteen, and I believe at last, one hundred, from Dighton, in Shoe-lane, who she supposed had manufactured them; that they were not filled up; but a circumstance occurred, her son being in her presence; he was an apprentice to an engraver. Her own son stated, that she had asked him to fill up those blanks, and she would give him a shilling a piece to fill them up; and the boy said, he would sooner suffer death. He said, she had told him she had received these notes from Dighton, and that she was to share in the produce of them. To all which she assented.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went, on the 3d of March, to Newgate, along with Mr. Winter, the solicitor of the Bank, to search a man of the name of Welchman. After searching Welchman, while Mr. Winter was in Mr. Kirby's apartments, Stinson was brought into the room; I immediately asked him what he had got about him; I searched him, and out of one pocket I took this parcel of round blanks of brass, and Townsend, at the same time, took these silver plates out of the other pocket; I then returned the silver and the parcel of brass upon the table, and Stinson put it into his pocket again.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. On Saturday, the 3d of March, I went, in company with Sayers and Mr. Winter, to Newgate, to search the apartments of Welchman there; in the mean time the prisoner at the bar was brought in by Mr. Kirby and Pitt into the front parlour to us; he was searched in my presence, and the things, which Sayers has produced, were taken from him and were given to him again. We took the prisoner, in company with Mrs. Welchman, in a coach, to Bow-street; we left Mrs. Welchman in custody, and then proceeded to the prisoner, Stinson's house, at Sommers-Town; we did not know where Stinson lived, but he took us there himself. When we came there, we went in with the prisoner, he opened a parlour door, where there was kept as a shop, a quantity of stockings and hosiery; then I asked him for the keys of the bureaus, which he gave me; I then opened the bureau drawers, and proceeded to search; and in the front parlour, the articles I shall now produce, I found in the various drawers of that bureau, which keys the prisoner gave to me. (Produces a large quantity of sixpences and shillings, some in a state of perfection, and others in all stages).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are some of them so perfect as to be fit for circulation? - A. There are a great quantity of them finished. We then proceeded to search the bureau in the back room, where, also, the drawers were full of money finished and unfinished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In what state were the prisoner's hands, were they clean? - A. I really did not look.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in a working dress, but was clean? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>PATRICK MACMANUS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went down into the kitchen first; I afterwards went up stairs, and found the door of the two pair of stairs locked; I returned down to Stinson, and asked him for the key, and he directed me to his wife; I asked the wife, and she said it had been lost for some time; I told her, if you do not find the key, I must break the door open; she said, you may.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180006"/>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was he present at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then we must not hear it. - A. I went up stairs and broke the door open; but I first went into the kitchen, and there I saw a cutting-out press in a chest, and behind the chest I found the block, that it had used to be fixed in, made use of as a dresser, or shelf; in a place like a dust-hole, in the kitchen, I found some cecil, (produces it). I then went up stairs, and forced the door open up two pair of stairs, and there was a large press, with a sort of a wheel that they use in rounding the edges of the money close beside it, both fixed to the floor, and the floor, except where these two articles where fixed, was covered all over with straw, and hay, and litter, three or four inches deep. Then Carpmeal and Townsend, and Stinson himself, gave us a hand in taking down the things, and putting them in a cart; we conveyed them to Bow-street, and they are here in the same state in which we found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you happen to know whose room this was, to whom it was let? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was let, do not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The room that was locked up, did he not say it had been shut up for six months? - A. He said it had been a long time, but he directed me to Mrs. Stinson for the key.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of litter about, not as if it had been recently used? - A. That was to drown the noise of working.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you sufficiently conversant in these matters to know, of your own knowledge, that these things would produce that appearance; or is it only from the information of others? - A. From my own knowledge; from my own practice. (Produces a large quantity of half-crowns in an unfinished state).</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Carpmeal.) Q. There was no appearance upon his hands of having been at work? - A. No; they can take it off in two minutes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a cornchandler, in Princes-street, Westminster: On Tuesday the 20th of February last, about a quarter before eight in the evening, Wilmot came to my house, and asked me if I would buy a quarter of oats; I said I was afraid he did not come honestly by them; he said, yes, he did, his two comrades, or two men, or something to that purpose, had picked them up in the street; I told him to go and bring them, and I would look at them, and see what they were; I waited some time, and they did not come; I heard that there were two men with sacks upon their backs going down the street, I went after them, and overtook them; Wilmot was walking before them, the other two had each of them a sack a-piece; 
               <persName id="t17980418-4-person77">

             I can swear to, but Selby I cannot; they brought them to my shop, Wilmot came as far as the step, but I believe did not come in; the other men pitched their sacks in the shop, and I told them they should not take them away, they seemed very much dissatisfied, and wanted to take them away; the sacks were filled with oats; I told them I thought I should have it in my power to find out who they belonged to, and knowing Wilmot, I let the men go; I took a sample to market, and, on the Friday, I found out who it belonged to; the men were taken up on the Friday night, and underwent an examination the Tuesday after; here is another person here, that can swear to Selby; I have kept the oats ever since, except one night that they were left at the Queen-square office, sealed up; I know them to be the same sacks that were brought to me by the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Wilmot). Q. You have known Wilmot before? - A. Yes; two years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he many years lived in the place where he lived at the time he was apprehended? - A. I do not know where he lived; I know where he lodged in Dartmouth-row, but I do not know where he worked; I live in Princes-street, nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years do you think you have known him living there? - A. I dare say ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he, living opposite to you, was unwise and foolish enough to come and ask you to buy these oats? - A.Directly so.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him if they were honestly come by? - A. Yes; and he said that two men, or his two comrades, had picked them up, and applied to him to fell them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you considered him only as the person to fell them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. About a quarter before eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see them, Wilmot had no custody of the things? - A. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no oats upon him? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Wilmot said he had them from the two men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But they were not there to contradict him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You let these three men go away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found them afterwards, at their lodgings, three days afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the sack was opened at the Public-office? - A. One was opened.</p>

               <p>Q.You do not mean to swear to the oats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN LISLE sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Lucas: On Tuesday night, the 20th of February, I went down to the wharf at Millbank, and being too late to get the oats out of the barge that night, I set Wilson on as watch to watch the oats in the barge; it might be about a quarter before seven at night; I saw him on board the craft, and left him. On Wednesday morning I went down, and saw them landed; some soldiers helped to land the oats, neither of them were the prisoners at the bar; they were all shot down, and the sacks were all counted right, and taken back to Putriss and Edwards's warehouse, in Horselydown; they were hired sacks.</p>

             and William Edwards? - A. Yes; and on delivering them, there were three old sacks found, which did not belong to them.</p>
               <p>Q. And there were no other sacks than their's in the barge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take them there yourself? - A. No; one of the sacks is one that has been in our granaries a long time, belonging to Putriss and Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q.Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You put Wilson to watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180008"/>Q. You generally put an honest man to watch? - A. Yes; he had watched for us several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. The sacks were all told right? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The oats were offered for sale on the 20th, and on the 21st you found all your oats right? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, of course, these could not be your oats? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to the sacks, they belonged to Putriss and Edwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lets a great number of sacks, besides those that were in that barge? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was nothing wonderful in sacks having his name being found? - A.Certainly not. I do not say the oats were right, the sacks counted right.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On the 21st, you do not know whether the oats were right or not? - A. The oats were not measured; the sacks counted right when they were shot.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you examine the sacks, to see if they were right, or was it only the number that you counted? - A. We only counted the number.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HAWKINS sworn. - I am a sadler: On the evening of Tuesday the 20th of February, as I was going out, I saw two men under my next door neighbour's window, and in a few minutes after, I saw two men bring two sacks into Mr. Mills's shop, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I can speak to the prisoner Selby being one of the men that brought the sacks into Mr. Mills's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was between seven and eight in the evening in February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was pretty dark at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no occasion to take particular notice of any person that was passing? - A. I did not take particular notice. I mean to swear that Selby is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in Mills's shop? - A. Yes, I was, when they brought the oats in.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of dress had he on? - A. I cannot tell; he had on a kind of smock-frock when he was in Mr. Mills's shop.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lighterman: I took two hundred and fifty-four sacks of oats, and twenty sacks of barley, to Mr. Lucas's wharf, at Westminster; on Tuesday the 20th of February, about four o'clock, I walked up to Mr. Lucas's, to acquaint him that I had brought them there; I waited, and Mr. Lisle came, and said he would get a watchman, and I went about my business; I saw him bring a man to watch, but who he was I do not know.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL BERRIDGE sworn. - I am a lighter-man: When the sacks were discharged, on the 24th, these two sacks were found amongst them, instead of the two that are missing, (producing them), that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say these two were left in the room of two others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on board the barge when they were first taken in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know whether these two were in the barge at the time the others were in, or whether they were put in afterwards? - A. I say these two sacks came in the room of Putriss and Edwards's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these two sacks must have been at first put into the barge, for any thing you know? - A. They might.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police-officer belonging to Queen-square: I apprehended Wilson and Wilmot in Dartmouth-row; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lisle). Look at the sacks? - A.These sacks are marked exactly the same as the other sacks that were in the barge, belonging to Messrs. Putriss and Edwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe there is no more common thing amongst lightermen, than that of lending sacks to each other? - A. I do not know that there is; the sack warehouses lend them out.</p>
               <p>Q. And any other person, having sacks from the same warehouse, they would have the same marks? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. As to these sacks, they are charged to be the property of Messrs. Putriss and Edwards, can you tell me who are the partners in the house of Putriss and Edwards? - A. I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. There may be more partners in the house for any thing you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear to the oats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had chanced to lose any of these sacks, you would have been answerable to Putriss and Edwards for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body here from Putriss and Edwards's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp objected, that there being that which it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180009"/>was indispensably necessary the prosecutor should prove, was not proved, and therefore submitted that it ought not to go to the Jury, upon the ground that the property was not sufficiently identified.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I apprehend, my Lord, that in all cases, it is necessary that where property is charged to lie in A, B, or C, there must be substantial proof that the property is properly so laid. Has it ever been heard, that when a person comes into Court, and says, we cannot say whether it belongs to A, B, or C, that that is sufficient to convict the prisoner, and it is not a sort of proof which cannot be got at. My Lord, there is another objection: This indictment charges the property to be in Putriss and Company, that is very unnecessary, because the regular, short, and clear way, would have been to have laid it to be in the lighterman, but here it is laid to be in Putriss and Company; and it appears in evidence, that the master of the witness hires the sacks of Putriss and Company, why is it not laid to be the property of Burgess and Company, the lightermen; for they are responsible for the loss for every sack that was deficient upon examination; upon the return of the sacks, they were to pay whatever was deficient. In consequence of the loss of sacks, it ought to have been stated to be the property of Burgess and Company, and not as the property of Putriss and Edwards, when there is nothing to shew that it was so; and, with respect to the oats, the man says he cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is another observation, which I forgot to state to your Lordship: That it is necessary to prove the Christian names of Putriss and Edwards.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no doubt at all that this is a case to go to a Jury. The first objection is, that there is no proof of identity; one of the witnesses certainly did state the names of both those parties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I beg your Lordship's pardon.</p>
               <p>Court. I have so taken it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lisle.) Did not you give in the names of the house of Putriss and Edwards? - A. Yes; I said,

             and William Edwards. The sacks were marked B.P. and W. E.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to swear that B.P. does not stand for Bartholomew Pope? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. The property of these sacks may be decided by the marks upon them, which contain that property, and if the Jury are of opinion that the oats in that sack are the oats of Mr. Lucas, whether the sacks are sufficiently proved or not, there is a case to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Wilmot, called two, and Wilson, three witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lamp-lighter: In the morning of the 10th of March, between one and two o'clock, I was lighting the lamps just by Mr. Ashmore's house, and while I was standing upon my ladder, I heard some people talking, I could see by my light that there were three men; when I went to the next lamp, I saw two of them cross the way to Ironmonger-row, which was nearly lacing; the man that was behind, turned up a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180010"/>court, that was the prisoner Ford, I saw him stoop down as though he was easing himself; I went on about my business, and as I came home again, I saw three men in Ironmonger-row, I saw that they were the same men, and then I observed that the prisoner, Reading, was another of them; the other I do not know any thing about. The next morning, between eight and nine, I informed Gass, the constable of it.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Gass.) In consequence of this information, did you make any search? - A. Yes; I went to that court, but it has no thoroughfare, there are a few houses in it, but they are mostly empty, it is called Well-and-bucket-court; there is a small gate-way going in that you can touch the ceiling with your hand, and there I saw two brass candlesticks sticking out from the lath and plaister, and behind the door of the first house in the court I found a copper tea-kettle; it was an empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the silver plate ever found? - A. No, not at all. I went with Peach to apprehend them, and when they were hand-cuffed together, one said to the other, "d-n you, don't split", that was Reading.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it permitted the Custom-house watermen to carry lumpers? - A. It is not, under pain of dismission, and he was upon the sick list besides; in the evening of the same day, I saw him again in his wherry, bringing them on shore again, and Millmett, a Custom-house officer, rowed after them in his boat; when he had landed the lumpers, Millmett took a lump of sugar out of his boat; three lumpers jumped out of his boat, but I did not see them have any thing; then I saw Aaron Baker hand some sugar out of the boat to one Archy Cockburn, who is gone off; he handed them from under the benches of his boat; Cockburn was a lumper.</p>

               <p>Q. They never discharge people for any good deeds, I believe? - A. I was discharged about some bad words with another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What bad words? - A. I detected an officer of the Customs robbing the Custom-house, and I took the goods away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean the Jury to believe, that the Custom-house fools, as they are called, dismissed you for detecting a brother officer in robbing them? - A. It was for bad words.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Excise officer; I was stationed on board the Bushey Park, at the time she was unlading; I was on board all day and all night.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day did you walk the decks? - A.Either on the decks or below.</p>
               <p>Q. How many officers were there on board? - A. Five.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the captain on board at that time? - A. The captain was very seldom on board.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for any body to have taken any thing out of the ship, without the officers observing it, and being stopped? - A. I should think not.</p>

               <p>Q. And are you all upon deck, or where? - A. Sometimes upon deck, and sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, at the time of the lumpers going away, you are sometimes upon the deck, and sometimes below? - A. When they are going, we wish to be upon deck.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know how many hogsheads of sugar there were on board this vessel? - A. I cannot form an idea.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept plenty of watch over all the property on board? - A. As far as I know I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Do you know what became of the mate of that ship? - A. I do not know any thing of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that he ran away? - A. I do not know whether he ran away or walked away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from information, or your own knowledge, or any way, that he ran away from the ship? - A. I never heard any thing at all about him since he quitted the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard from the owners, that the deficiency was very considerable? - A. No; I heard nothing more than it was washed away, and a great deal of it restored.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a Custom-house officer: I was stationed on board the Bushey Park in October.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there at the time she was cleared out? - A. No, I was taken off to go to an Indiaman; I saw part of the delivery of her cargo; I am not sure whether it was the 25th or 26th that I was taken off, I was there twenty-one days; I took the account of the cargo, and delivered the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Morgan there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Loughton there? - A. I do not think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the owner of the ship there? - A. Yes, he was there during the chief part of the delivery of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the name of the owner? - A. Captain Lowry. He is part-owner of the Bushey Park, and gave his attendance on board the chief part of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180012"/>Mr. Knapp. Q. We have heard the last witness talk about washing? - A. When I went in, out of the whole delivery, there were more than fourteen or fifteen hogsheads, the chief part of them washed out, through bad stowage; it frequently happens so.</p>
               <p>Q. If lumpers or other persons came on board for the purpose of taking away this sugar, you, giving your attendance on board twenty-one days, should not you, and the other officers, have seen it? - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did any thing, with your knowledge, go out of the ship? - A. No, it did not, to my knowledge, more than what was put into the craft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say, it is impossible for any person to take a bag of sugar out of the ship without your observing it? - A. No, it is not impossible; but they might take it while I am writing, and taking an account.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that there was great plunderage on board the Bushey Park? - A. There was not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that there was great plunderage on board that ship? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time to this, have you not heard that it was plundered? - A. Not till the last trials.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not present before the Magistrate, when people have been there about it? - A. No; I have been down at Purfleet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it not the duty of the Custom-house officers,upon any person going out of the ship, to examine them? - A. Yes; and we always pay that attention.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you, during that attention, find any sugar? - A. It is the duty of the officers on board.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any lumpers in his boat? - A. I never saw his boat, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Millmott). You said you were alongside Baker's boat, where was Baker's boat at that time? - A. Near the starboard quarter of the Bushey Park, sometime after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe from what ship she came? - A. They came over a lighter that laid between the boat and the Bushey Park. My attendance was chiefly in taking the cargo.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where was your situation principally? - A. On the deck. The cargo was delivered in a very short time; about nineteen or twenty days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to say a few words in my defence. I am innocent of the charge, and I cannot be answerable for what people have secreted round their bodies; these lumpers have large frocks and trowsers on; they had nothing about them but what was secreted about their bodies; they had nothing that I could see, or any body else; it is my duty, as a waterman, to carry them backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it possible, do you think, for any person to take any sugar out of that ship, without either them or the captain observing it? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual, when persons are leaving the ship, to search them? - A. Yes; if they appear any way bulky, we always examine them.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen, that from bad weather, there is what you call washing, and a considerable deficiency? - A. Yes, very common; and that was the case with that ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing remarkable upon the note at the time it was tendered to you? - A. I did not take any particular notice, only from the paleness.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you pay that note? - A. To Mr. Warberton.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you pay him any other note at the same time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. That note I apprehend has been out of your possession ever since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You put no mark upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot undertake to say that that is the note you received from the prisoner? - A. I believe it to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe to you where he lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the description he gave of himself, after you spoke of the paleness of the ink? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did he give of himself? - A. I do not recollect that he told me, at that time, where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you afterwards what he was? - A. He told me he was a serjeant in the guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what regiment he belonged to? - A. I do not recollect that he did, but I knew what regiment he belonged to by the make of his clothes. He said, he lodged in Orchard-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that account to be true upon enquiry? - A. I did, every thing that he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When was it that he gave you this account of who he was? - A.The Sunday morning following, when he was with Mr. Bliss, the officer of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, before that Sunday morning, when he was in the custody of Mr. Bliss, tell you who he was, or where he lived? - A. I do not recollect that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to know where to find him? - A. Knowing he was in the Guards, and of the same name with myself, it was easy to find him out; he told me, while he was talking to me, that he was of the same name with myself. Mr. Warberton and I, on the Saturday, stopped a serjeant, and asked him if he knew where he was; he said, we should find him upon the King's guard, We went there and found him; I asked him if he recollected such a note; he said, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not attempt to deny it? - A. No. He said he took it of serjeant Darlow; he went away about his business, and we left him. I told him, on the Sunday morning, a gentleman from the Bank would call upon me with the note; he said, he should be ready to meet us at a quarter before twelve; we then parted. And the next morning, Mr. Bliss went with me; we found him at the King's guard again, and he acknowledged that he thought it was the same note. The prisoner and I then all went to serjeant Darlow's; the prisoner said, he had the note of serjeant Darlow. Mr. Bliss presented the note to serjeant Darlow, and he said, he had given him a note, but it was not the same note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what valued note he had given him? - A. A two pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after this - when did you see the prisoner again? - A. I think at Cold-Bath-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree, before you parted with the prisoner and serjeant Darlow, to meet again? - A. Yes; the prisoner and Mr. Bliss were to come to my house the next morning, with intent to go to the Bank, to see if they could do any thing in it. They came, but I did not go with them.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I am a serjeant belonging to the 77th regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, John Aikin? - A. I have seen him; I have no great acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, and say, upon your oath, whether you passed that note to the prisoner? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see that note? - A. I saw it with Mr. Bliss, the officer of the Bank, upon the Sunday after I had paid him a two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. You did pay him a two pound note upon the 26th of February? - A. Yes; for bringing a recruit, who was discharged for being under size.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that is not the note? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You belong to a marching regiment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen to you, at any time, to be taken up, and charged with forging this note yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in custody for it? - A. I was, at the Bank, a little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you before my Lord-Mayor, and sent into custody by him? - A. No; never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. And they sent to your house from the Bank, to see if you had any other notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present at the time you gave him the two pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know who the note you gave him was made payable to? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was signed by? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180014"/>No; it was quite a new note, I had fourteen of the same that I had got in change for a forty pound note.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you read that note? - A. I cannot; it mentions two pounds at the top, I cannot read any thing else.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. I protect I cannot entertain a suspicion against this man; so far from there being evidence to convict him, it does not raise even a suspicion in my mind; for, if every man into whose hands a forged note might fall were to be convicted, in a perilous situation are we all. In this case, the man behaves in the most candid manner upon earth, he tells who he is, and does not absent himself, though he finds suspicions increasing from day to day; he does not act as a man who is conscious that he has done wrong. Gentlemen, I will not introduce suspicions obliquely at any body at all, it is enough for me to say, that this man is now called upon to answer to this weighty charge, and the learned Counsel, who, undoubtedly, possesses great abilities, and, in conducting public prosecutions, great candour, tells me he can carry his case no farther. The prisoner has put himself upon his country, but upon this evidence, I should be shocked to suppose, that any man could be called upon to answer for an offence almost out of the reach of pardon, if it is true; I must advise you, therefore, immediately to acquit him. <rs id="t17980418-7-verdict34" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Who lays in the wine? - A. I laid in that quantity; I am accountable for it, as it is drank the money is paid to me.

               <p>Cudd. A gentleman came into my house that afternoon, and opened the door, and came in; he asked if I had not a nurse child, I said, no sir, I have no nurse child, nor there is no nurse child in this Row; he said, it must be there somewhere; I said, no sir, it is not, there is no nurse child here; and he kept the door open a considerable time, and seemed in great trouble about the child; then he went to the next door, and said the child was dressed in a Quaker-coloured bonnet, and he would find the child, if possible; he was much agitated, and seemed in a deal of trouble about the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that gentleman before? - A. No; I had been in bed, and had not been out for two months before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the gentleman, making this enquiry, appear to be cool and collected; or otherwise? - A. He seemed to be like a gentleman out of his mind all of a flutter, and all of a tremble.</p>

               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. This indictment charges the prisoner with the greatest offence that can be committed by a human being, under the aggravated circumstances of the object of it being a poor unprotected child, the fruit of her own body, when it had no power to struggle for the preservation of its own existence.</p>
               <p>Gentleman. This is a case which deserves all your attention. There are circumstances so extraordinary in it, that those who look at it superficially, will hardly, perhaps, be prepared to decide, with satisfaction to their own minds, to what the death of this child was owing. It is an arduous task that is thrown upon you, and you must decide; considering the case with fair mercy and indulgence to the prisoner, taking care at the same time, that false mercy does not supersede that duty which you owe to society, that offences of this mighty magnitude, if they are committed, may not remain un punished.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. That the offence of murder has been committed, there is no doubt upon earth, and the single enquiry here is, to whom that guilt attaches. (Here the noble and learned Judge summed up the evidence to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, Upon this evidence you are to decide by what means this child came by its death; and it is not necessary, in ascertaining the guilt or innocence of a person, that parties should be present seeing the blow inflicted, or the thing done, which produced the death of the child; if there are pregnant convincing circumstances, which work conviction upon your minds, that is the evidence which you will follow, when your aim is to arrive at the truth of the case; and as I said in the outset, I say again, this is a case which calls for all your attention, and all your deliberation: and, with respect to this prisoner, with you are the issues of life or death, for if you impute guilt to her it is impossible that mercy can interpose between the conviction and the consequences of that conviction, the execution of the law upon her. The case against the prisoner leaves the child in possession of the mother, in full health; the child is found dead; there was no other person in the house, and there was no communication with any other person, which could tend to produce the death of the child. Then the evidence brought by the witnesses for the prisoner, is a very extraordinary story, and you are to say whether it is a true history of the transaction, that a man, God knows who not known to the prisoner at the bar, should go to these two houses in the neighbourhood, and enquire, at an early hour, for a child, with no view but to murder it, is a very extraordinary occurrence; that, afterwards he should go to this woman, having no connection with her, and put the child to death. If one stops and considers what should act upon the human mind to produce such consequences, one is lost and bewildered in the enquiry - But how is the child found? Why it is found stripped of its day-clothes, and its day-clothes were folded up and deposited in the place in which the mother used to deposit them:- Well, is all this done suddenly? there is time taken, the petticoats are pinned up, and a brick pinned up in them, in order to produce with more certainly, the death of the child, by sinking it in the water-tub. Could this be done immediately? Where do we hear of her crying out for help? The house is in a row of small house; the next door neighbour hears no outcry, and nobody appears to have called out for help.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. This is the evidence, and these are the observations which my situation extorts from me to make; you are to draw the conclusion; you are to consider the case with all the leanings of humanity that justice will permit, but, remembering always, that you are not to lose sight of justice; that here is an inquisition for blood, a fellow-creature has been deprived of life. and somebody is guilty of it; whether the prisoner is guilty or not, you will answer by your verdict.</p>

I saw the prisoner come out with something in her apron; I went into the room and missed seven cruets; I apprized the waiter of it, and he went after her.</p>
               <p>Moody. I followed her down Holborn; she went into a public-house, and I lost sight of her; she offered the glasses and cruets to sell, with my name upon them, to the mistress of the public-house, but she is not here, she is dangerously ill in bed. She came again in about an hour into the same room, and I laid hold of her; she denied having been there before; she said, she wanted some beer. Her apron had some stains upon it; the cruets had contained different sauces for fish. I asked her what she had done with them, and she said, she did not know any thing of it. There was Cayenne, soy and ketchup, upon her apron, and salt and vinegar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in for some beer; the waiter told me, he did not sell beer; I had put down a shilling; I went away, and forgot my shilling. I had got almost to the bottom of Holborn, and I went back for my shilling; and he laid hold of me, and said, he was glad I was come back again, for he had lost some cruets. He began stripping me and using me very indecently; and the master kicked me so that I shall never be able to get my bread again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the guinea in her hand? - A.No, she threw it away some how, I could not see it; she whipped her hands behind her, and what became of the guinea I cannot say; I accused her with it, and she said she had not got it; I desired her to return the guinea, or I should charge the watch with her; I sent for the landlady up, and she desired her to return it; she said, she had got no such thing, it was only a halfpenny; Mrs. Smith sent for the watchman, and the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no other witness here but yourself? - A. No; I kept her till the watch set, and then she was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your guinea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the room with her? - A. Near three quarters of an hour; by that time the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there before the watch was sent for? - A. Ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you no connection with her? - A. No, no connection at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A.Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He came down to me this morning, and gave me some beer, and said he would not say more than he could help, as I had not the guinea; I was searched twice, and I never had the guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. If one steak was cut off, could you afterwards sell it for a loin of mutton? - A. Yes; if they did not ask me any thing about it, I should sell it for a loin of mutton. I had missed it from the place where I had laid it about a quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't know, of your own knowledge, that the mutton was taken away? - A. No.</p>

(Produces the curtain.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Whose curtains were they? - A.Arnold Harvey's.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, you know, is a broker? - A. No, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. He took his hat off, while he was in the house, did not he? - A. I do not know that he did, till I took it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Brokers play tricks with each other frequently, do they not? - A.Sometimes.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LOWE sworn. - On the 19th of March, the prisoner came into the drawing-room where I was, and asked for a catalogue, he then went out of the sale-room into the back room, from thence he went up stairs; James Legge was up stairs, there was nobody there, I believe, at that time but him and James Legge; he went out, and Legge followed him almost directly; he brought him back, and searched him, he pulled off his hat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180021"/>and there was the curtain. I went and fetched a constable, and he was delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you never see the brokers play tricks with each other? - A. No; I do not know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this can be called a curtain it must be sewed together? - A. It wants tacking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it is not a bad curtain? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ARNOLD HARVEY sworn. - This curtain is mine, I lost the fellow to it from the same house just before; it is a window curtain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you swear it is a window-curtain? - A. Yes, I will; beyond all doubt it is a window-curtain. I have been a broker these twenty years, I ought to know what belongs to a window-curtain.</p>

The prisoner acknowledged them to be his apartments. We searched the room, and found, in a bag in the room, two new saddles, and, in a box which was locked, we found three new saddles. We took the property down stairs; this was between two and three o'clock; and then we remained till the prisoner came in, at near nine o'clock at night; and then we apprehended him, and brought him and the property to the office.(Produces the property.)</p>

             sworn. - I am a milliner; I live with Mrs. Franks, in St. James's street. About six weeks ago, we received some lace from Miss Joachim; we were to make her a cloak, and to put that lace upon it, which we did. A man said he came from Mr. Goldsmid for the cloak, and I delivered it to him. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure he is the man? - A. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM GOLDSMID, Esq. sworn. - On the 23d of February, or thereabouts, I was going down to the Treasury; my niece, Miss Joachim, desired me to call at Mrs. Franks's, and desire them to send her cloak home. Mr. Rose kept me some time at the Treasury, where the prisoner was generally waiting. I had left my carriage, and desired the coachman to call at Mrs. Franks's, for the cloak; and I went down on foot to the Treasury. When I came out, the carriage was at the door, and as the coachman was opening the door, he told me that it was not quite ready, but if I would go back there, I might have it; I said, I had no time. The prisoner at the bar overheard me, and asked me if he should go and fetch it for me; I told him, yes, and gave him a shilling: I told him, if he brought it home safe immediately, he should have another sixpence or a shilling. He was to bring it to No. 18, Alie-street, where my niece lives with me; I found it did not come, and in the evening I went to Bow-street; and on the Monday following it was found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>JOHN DOBREE sworn. - I am servant to Mrs. Rochfort, pawnbroker, in Jermyn-street, (produces the cloak); I took this in of Mrs. Flora, on the 23d February; I think it was on a Friday, in the morning; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Flora. That is the cloak that I had from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. As soon as I had got the cloak from that young lady, it begun to pour with rain, and I stood up; and as I had the direction only by word, and not by card, I forgot it, and did not know where to carry it; I called upon Mrs. Flora, and what happened in her apartment I cannot particularly say, but she pinned the cloak up for me. It is the first offence, and I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you tell this story? - A. Two or three weeks after, I told Mr. Fish of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any enquiry made about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to conceal it so long? - A.Because I was coming from Hounslow, and he lathered me well.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Goddard.) Have you seen the leather since? - A. Yes; Mr. Fish shewed it me.</p>
               <p>- FISH. sworn. - I keep the White Bear, at Hounslow: Mr. Wood's waggon was at my house the same night, Mr. Goddard told me he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180026"/>had been robbed; the prisoner drove Mr. Woods's waggon, belonging to this little boy's father; the boy lives at Bagshot with his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the leather was found? - A. Yes, I found it. This boy being beat, the prisoner was discharged; and the next journey they came, this little boy and his father came up, and while they were at supper, I asked the little boy, if he knew any thing of a saw being taken from the yard, and he said, yes; I asked him if he knew any thing of any halters, he said, yes, they were about the horses heads; then I asked him about the leather; and, in consequence of what the boy said, I went down to Bagshot, and had him taken up. A man came up, and said, if he had bought the stuff of him, he should have been in a pretty mess; that was in the prisoner's presence, his name is James Draper; I asked him, what stuff? and he said, some leather. Upon that I went with the driver, and found the leather; I carried the leather to him, and asked him if he knew any thing of it, and he said, yes, he had it out of Mr. Goddard's waggon, in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promises? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is a troublesome piece of business; you must settle it amongst yourselves.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner's defence was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury. Being destitute of money, and at a great distance from my relations, not being able to see Counsel to defend me, I therefore throw myself upon the mercy of the Court, and crave the indulgence of the Court, to state the following facts: - I came from the North, applied to an office, engaged myself to Mrs. Flowers. It is not my wish or intention to discover what I know of Mrs. Flowers; it is enough for me to say, that I found myself in a situation ill-suited to the virtuous habits in which I had been bred, and I gave her warning; I determined to leave her service, which I had an opportunity of doing one day suddenly, Mrs. Flowers being very much in liquor. In the morning of that day, I found a ring upon the carpet, intending to give it to Mrs. Flowers. The day before I went away, the examined my box, and in the hurry I forgot to take the key with me; when I came the next day for the box, Mrs. Flowers must remember the readiness with which I even invited an examination of my box. Conscious of my own innocence, my astonishment, however, upon the box being opened, was beyond description; those articles were not there the preceding night, nor did I see any of them till after I was in custody; and they must have been put there with a view to my destruction."</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Flowers.) Remember you are upon your oath, who lodged with you? - A.Lady Ophemia Stuart, Lord Grenville's sister; nobody else has lodged there since the has been in the house, nor for ten weeks before.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, that is the defence you have thought proper to make, who wrote that defence for you? - A. A gentleman of the name of Middleton, Mr. Kirby knows him very well.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known Mr. Middleton? - A. No longer than I have been in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180027"/>Court. Q. Who introduced Mr. Middleton to you? - A. He saw me when I first came into the prison.</p>

             Sworn. - I live at Oxford; I keep the Roebuck: The prisoner at the bar, and Glover, came to my house in the evening of the 15th of September. I have known the prisoner five or six years, he was a gentleman's servant, and lived along with one Miss Finch, in Oxford, just opposite me. I did not see them the night they came in; the next day was market day, and they dined at my house, at the ordinary. After dinner, they shewed the horses out to sale; shewed one to Mr. Crook, a fellmonger; they did not agree for price; and Mr. Bulley, at the Angel, had wanted to buy a horse, and I bought the horse for him; I gave eight guineas for it; I paid the money upon the table, and Glover took it up; but the prisoner told me that that was his brother, that his name was Cooper, or else I should not have bought the horse. He told me, that his brother had taken the Turf Tavern, at Shrewsbury, and he was going down to help him; and he said, that his brother must go off that night by the mail-coach, or else he would not have sold the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay at your house? - A. He did not lie at my house. Glover went away that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse since Crouch had it back again? - A. No. The prisoner bore a very good character at Oxford for five or six years.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these the records of the India Company? - A.They are; I have had them under my care these twenty-seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present at the apprehension of the prisoner by the constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place upon that? - A.Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How were these papers kept, under lock and key? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to them? - A. Yes; he wrote in that very office.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount have you missed them? - A. About fifty different books, and some very important ones.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him in the office? - A. I remember him twelve years upon a certainty. He might have got eighty pounds a year, but he would not do it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. First, my Lord, I would recommend myself to you and a merciful Jury; and, in the next place, would recommend myself by six small children to the mercy of the whole Court, and plead not guilty in the cause in which I now stand. First, I have received of this said Matthew Wall, at several different times, by purchase and by gift; and in all probability the same that is laid before the Gentlemen of the Jury and the Counsel; and with respect to the covers of the books, Mr. Wall might bring one hundred to criminate me, as the nature of the business is to have the books cut up, delivered out in sections, and put into forty or fifty different hands, and the covers go to Mr. Wall, by way of emolument, to sell or give away, as seemoth to him best. I have stood unimpeached for eighteen years in the Company's service, and give me leave to say, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is done more out of spite than any thing else; and not only that, the place where I was situated to write, from whence I am charged with feloniously stealing and taking away books, is in as public a place as the Royal Exchange, where there are all comers and goers passing and repassing from six in the morning to nine at night, where hundreds of papers and books are lying, and have been lying about the floor for several years; books of the same kind, that every body can look at as they pass by, and take away as they please; and, because I am a poor unfortunate man, it is laid to my charge. In the public office, they are lying bound and unbound; and not only that, there are men that have keys to the office, that go into the office before any of the clerks come in the morning; and besides, the said Matthew Wall has got a key to go in and out when he pleases; and there are several that are under him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Wall.) Q. Can you swear, in the sight of God, that I took these papers and books? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you recollect, about three months ago, you had like to have brought me into the same disagreeable situation, by selling or giving away some papers or books? - A.There never were any books given away or sold.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever sell or give away, or is it the custom of the office to have the backs of books torn off? - A.Outside papers, but never any books or records that come from India.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Do not you know Norton-Falgate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you recollect the tripe-shop there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. William Thompson bringing news to the house of some written papers, when I had like to have been in this disagreeable situation before, when you yourself confessed you had sold and given them away? - A. I never said such a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you ever had any dispute or animosity of any kind with the prisoner? - A. Never; on the contrary, I have given him several half-guineas.</p>

I waited white he wrote the note, and I went after my master with it to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; I might be gone about an hour and ten or twenty minutes; he was to wait till I came back; when I returned, he was gone; I missed a silver ink-stand, which I put upon the table for him to write the note with, four table spoons, and three desert spoons.

I look upon it about two months afterwards: I was coming up Holles-street, Cavendish-square, behind my master's carriage, and saw the prisoner half way up the street, I knew him directly; I called to the coachman, and told him; I got down, and ran to the top of Holles-street, the prisoner was then out of sight, and I saw no more of him; he ran away instantly upon his seeing me, and I lost him. He was not taken upon our account at all; he was taken for another offence.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Well-street, Oxford-road: I was going on board a ship along with captain Moore, and the prisoner, two years ago, and he told me to come at five o'clock in the morning, and he was gone; he had taken a shirt and a pair of stockings with him; I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find a shirt and stockings upon him? - A. No. I met him last summer in Berner's-street, and he told me, if I called upon him in Castle-street, he would give them me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry them for you, or what? - A. I gave them to Mrs. Moore, and she said she had put them in captain Moore's box; I went to the house that he directed me to, when he said he would give them me; I went, and he did not live there; he said he was captain of the Satisfaction sloop of war, and I made enquiry, and found he never was on the books of the Admiralty; he told me I need nto bring more than one shirt and a pair of stockings, because he had bought me a set of check shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. And you gave him this shirt and stockings to take on board for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180033"/>Q.Where did he say the ship lay, was it in the port of London? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was no such ship as the Satisfaction sloop of war? - A. Yes, but he never was on board her; and I never heard of him again till I took him. I met him last summer; and did not see him again till last Friday, when I saw him at Bow-street; he was taken up for something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. No; I am sure he is the same person that had the stockings and shirt of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor left the shirt and stockings with Mrs. Moore; I had been arrested for debt a few days before; and upon my being liberated; I did not return to my house at Hampstead, but went to sea, leaving the shirt and stockings in the hands of the landlady.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in this till? - A. About three pound's worth of halfpence and farthings, and three shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near the till when you first saw him? - A. Quite close to it.</p>
               <p>Q.How could the boy get there? - A. By opening the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the drawer? - A. Not ten minutes before; he saw me serving a person with a quartern loaf, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure no person had been in after that customer went away? - A. Yes; I then went and sat down to my work in the parlour, till I was disturbed by the noise of the rattling of the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you no servants that might have gone out in the mean time? - A. Every body in the house was in bed but myself, and a little girl about twelve years old, and she was in the room with me all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shut the door when the customer went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180035"/>away, the customer or you? - A. I did; there is a latch to the door, and a bell upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you put down that latch? - A. Yes; I am sure it was latched.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you paid that attention to it, that you can swear the latch was down? - A. Yes; I do; we always do it after every person that comes in after dark; I am sure it was down.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear your latch open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite dark at this time? - A. Yes, past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at this time? - A.in bed. He came down in his shirt when I cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure he is the same boy you saw in the shop? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You say there was a bell at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear the bell go? - A. No. Any body might come in if they opened it gently, without the bell ringing, if they opened it with a steady hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not you think it more probable that he might have slipped in when the customer went out, than that he should have opened the door? - A. No, he did not come in with the customer.</p>

The prisoner had been our porter a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge in the house? - A. No. The suspicion then fell upon the prisoner at the bar; I went, with Mr. Clarence and the watchman, to see if the prisoner was in bed; I knew where the prisoner lodged, we did not know the number of the house, it was in Cable-street, near Wellclose-square; we rapped at the door some little time; the prisoner, in the course of a little time, looked out of the window apparently in his shirt; Mr. Clarence told him, he wished to speak to him, or wished him to come down, I don't know rightly which; he then said he was not up; we waited there a considerable time, but the door was not opened; I waited about half an hour, and then I went away.</p>

               <p>Q. During the half hour that you waited, did you hear any thing in the house? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you go away for? - A. I went to inform Mrs. Clarence where Mr. Clarence was. When I came back, there were several watchman upon the ground floor, Mr. Clarence was up stairs. None of the goods were found in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you said this was between two and three o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he appeared in his shirt like a man; just out of bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Just as you would have done, if you had been called up in the night? - A. Yes; I saw nothing but just his arms and shoulders.</p>

             sworn. - I am a shopman belonging to the prosecutor: About a quarter past one on Wednesday morning, the 7th of March, I was called up by three rings at the door; I asked what was the matter; the watchman told me the warehouse door was open; and, in the warehouse, I found a slat basket filled with five pieces of Irish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180036"/>linen and six pieces of muslin handkerchiefs; I took up the basket, and looked at the Irishes; I immediately found they were of the best make and the highest prices; I suspected it must be somebody that knew the premises; I then went backwards to see if any thing was disturbed, and the handkerchiefs were taken out of the box in the back warehouse, and the lid shut down.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did the person get into the the warehouse? - A. By picking the locks of the street door, there were two locks and a latch; I was then asked to go to Billing's house; I did not go immediately; Mr. Clarence went to the house, I stopped in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you went to the prisoner's house? - A. About three quarters of an hour. On entering the room on the first floor, I saw a constable and Mr. Clarence searching, I saw them take up a muslin shawl from a box which stood by the bedside; Billing's wife was in bed at the same time; the shawl appeared to be our's; there was a girl in bed on the other-side, and the wife said, you need not take that shawl, for it is that young woman's. Mr. Clarence asked me if I thought it was our shawl, I said, I believed it was; we took the shawl, and told the young woman if it was her's, she should have it again; she disowned the shawl being her's afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon examining the shawl, it turned out to he your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed then? - A. Partly dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his appearance? - A. His shirt was all over foot and dirt, and both his hands and face were footy. We then made further search, and found a piece of Corsa muslin, it is an India muslin which goes by the name of Corsa, and some remnants of Irish; afterwards we searched under the bed, and found some remnants of bed-furniture tied up under the bed, in a little bundle, between the sacking and the bed, and some other things, which I do not now recollect; the bed-furniture was printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else besides what you have stated? - A. Some other things, which will be produced. The next morning I got up early, about six o'clock, and found Mr. Clarence there, and Mr. Fox the constable; I then went up stairs, and found some few things, which we had no doubt were our's; we then went down stairs into the cellar, and under the chamber stairs, going down, we found a green vellum-coloured book, a writing-book, lodged on the bearers of the stairs, in which we used to keep an account of the goods we bought; we then went down the cellar, and searched the cellar thoroughly, and found nothing; but, on going up stairs, I found in some dust a shawl, which proved to be our shawl, with my own mark upon it. I then gave it into the custody of Tipper, a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner respecting the articles then found? - A. I told him the things appeared much against him, he said he knew no more about it than a new born child; but he said he never took any of the goods, except the few remnants of cotton that were found under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Is there not some other persons concerned in the firm, besides those gentlemen? - A. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it, of your own knowledge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this man came down stairs, there would have been ample opportunity to remove the things, if he had been so desirous to do? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: My box was close to the door of Mr. Atkinson's warehouse. Just before one o'clock of the 7th of March, I saw two men walking backwards and forwards, and while they were walking, the clock struck one; I went my best as fast as I possibly could, and I ran all the way back as quick as possible; when I came to my box, which is at the corner of the house, I met a man, I said, pray what do you do here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that one of the men that had been walking backwards and forwards? - A. Yes. He made me no answer; I got immediately to the warehouse door, and I found it open; while I was going to the door, he ran off, as fast as possibly he could, across the field; I called stop thief; it being rather dark, he was soon out of my sight; I called to Box, another watchman, that was close by, to stand at the door, while I alarmed Mr. Clarence; and when they got up, we went into the warehouse; there we found a large basket, with those things in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you saw a man, and you asked him what he did there? - A. I did; he made me no answer at all. I went afterwards to the prisoner's house; I saw the prisoner look out of the window, and answer Mr. Clarence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at the prisoner, was he the person that made you no answer, when you said,"what do you do here?" - A. I think he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you right, you believe the prisoner was the person, but you will not swear it positively? - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your observation to Mr. Clarence, that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait at the door? - A. Near three quarters of an hour. I heard people stirring about the house; after we had been there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180037"/>about three quarters of an hour, we saw a cellar window; the door was not opened at all; this cellar window Mr. Clarence found, there was no fastening to it; we opened the window, and got in; we went up stairs, and we searched the house above and below; the constable and Mr. Clarence stood at the door to see that nobody got out; we went backwards, and searched the necessary; we were looking to find the prisoner; at last we were coming into the kitchen, and Harry came in where the pork was, we asked him where he had been, and he made no answer; we suspected he had got over the pales, and on my getting over the pales, they were five or six feet high, I saw something lay upon the Jews necessary-seat; then we searched the necessary on Harry's side with a stick, but could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the first visit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing besides what you found yourself? - A. I saw many of the things found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person find any thing? - A. Yes; Box took hold of many things.</p>
               <p>Q. State what they were like, were they in bundles, or open? - A. Open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said to the prisoner about them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; certainly it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. One man you could positively swear to? - A. There was no man I could positively swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe them both to the prosecutors? - A. Yes; one had a blue coat on.</p>
               <p>- Box sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 7th of March, about one o'clock in the morning, the watchman came to me, and said, for God's take come over the way; I ran as hard as I could, and found the warehouse door open; and when we went in, there was a large basket by the warehouse door. We then went to the prisoner's house, and we knocked a long time; Mr. Clarence called Harry, I want to speak to you; we were there three quarters of an hour, before we got into the house; we got in at the cellar window; we found a muslin shawl on a box in the prisoner's bed room, and a piece of Irish; Mr. Clarence found them; as fast as he found them, he gave them to me. There was some bed furniture found between the the bed and the sacking; I have kept them ever since. There were a great many things; I cannot speak to them particularly; a piece of muslin, a shawl, and bed-furniture. (The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hayward.) How do you know that shawl? - A. If you examine that shawl it is cut crooked from what we generally cut them, and this shawl exactly matches with what we have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, you can swear that to be the property of your masters? - A. I will undertake to do it. This is the bed-furniture that was found between the bed and sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the furniture he said he had taken from his master? - A. These are the pieces that he said he had taken out of the rag-tub.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that book, is that the book he said he had taken? - A. This is the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any of your writing in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any of Mr. Clarence of Mr. Atkinson's writing in it? - A. No. I have seen the book before, and I will undertake to swear to it.(A coloured shawl shewn to the witness). This has my private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say a single muslin shawl was found in the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it cut apart from that piece? - A Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the remainder? - A. It was packed up in a box to go to Barbadoes, but it did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. That has been cut? - A. Yes; from the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any private mark upon that which was found in the prisoner's house? - A. No. I packed those four into the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that has not been fold? - A. I will undertake to say that we never sold but one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you packed it, there were only four? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was never sold? - A. I know it because it was never brought into the retail shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A. By the manner it was cut, for no man in our shop would have cut it off in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that that shawl, which you found in the dust, was never sold? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. These people came to the door and knocked, I jumped out of the bed, and went down immediately; before I got down they were in; I ran down stairs without breeches on; they broke into the cellar window, it was hooked upon a chain; and when I came down, Mr. Box went towards a place that was closed, and he took a piece of print, he said he took it from the necessary; they opened the drawer where I kept my money, and they took out fifteen shillings. I bought some of the things in the fair, and some at the door. If I had meant to be a thief to my master, I could have robbed him of thousands and thousands of pounds; I lived with him about a year and a half before, and then I lived with him again.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180038"/>The watchman said before the Lord-Mayor, the other person was the man, but when he found he could not lay hold of that man, he got hold of me. There was a woman that laid in the same room that night, and that shawl she brought in, but before the Lord-Mayor the said it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses were called, who said they had known the prisoner from three to eight years, and gave him a very good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Ward: On Friday, the 23d of February, I had occasion to shew some mourning rings to a customer, I sent to a ring-maker, and he sent me a case containing fourteen rings; his name is Hopkins; I put them on the end of the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is Mr. Ward liable to pay for those rings? - A. Yes. I put them on the end of the counter, expecting the gentleman to call, but he did not call that day; I saw them in the case about five o'clock, when I returned from dinner; about seven, the prisoner came in with a gold ear-ring, and asked if I could match it; I said, we had some nearly like it; I was seeking for them, with my back to the window, when I suppose he took them. He did not purchase the ear-rings, but went out of the shop. About an hour after the usual time of shutting up shop, I missed the case of rings.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Those fourteen rings you would have sold, if any body had fancied them? - A. Yes; I got them for that purpose. I endeavoured to recollect who had been in the shop from five to eight, and I could not recollect any body coming in but the prisoner. On the Saturday evening, two rings were brought to me. That is all that I know about it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer in Cheap Ward: About seven o'clock, on Saturday evening, the 24th day of February, I was sent for to Messrs. Savory and Pryer's, in the Poultry; I had a ring gave me which was broke in four pieces; I met the prisoner at Mr. Pryer's, he said, his mother lived in Houndsditch; I went down the Poultry, up Throgmorton-street, and through Bishopsgate Church-yard; in going along, he asked me to go and drink; I told him, I would not; there was some silver in his left hand pocket, and it rattled. Coming to Houndsditch, he told me that was not the street where his mother lived, but, that his mother lived in Jerusalem-court; I told him there was no such court, and I took him to the Compter. I searched him at the Compter, and in his sob pocket I found an enamelled ring, one guinea, one half-guinea, five seven-shilling pieces, and some silver. On Monday, he was examined before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180039"/>Court. Q. Was that examination taken down in writing? - A. I believe so. We went where he told us he had sold the rings. After he had been examined before the Lord-Mayor, I went to a silversmith and jeweller's shop in Lombard-street, I think his name is Hill, there I found a ring, that ring was delivered to me; we went from there to Bishopgate-street, to a Mr. Venable's, there was another ring there, I had that; then we went near Norton-falgate, to one Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker, there was a ring there, which was pawned, I got that; then we came to Cornhill, I don't know their names, they kept the rings themselves; the prisoner took me; I saw one in each of the houses in Cornhill; there were three houses. He was committed, on the 5th of March. I have nothing more to say about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the evening of Sunday, the 25th of February, looking at his poultry? - A. No. I fed the rabbit that evening; I left it safe, it was a doe rabbit.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you attend particularly to this rabbit? - A. I fed it every evening; I locked it up, the last thing, about eight o'clock that evening, in the tool-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to the poultry at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the poultry kept? - A. In the same yard, a little further, in a different house. The next morning, about seven o'clock, I found the door of the place, where the poultry was kept, open, I had left it shut the evening before; I missed seven live hens, and one live cock; I then went to the tool-house, and found the rabbit was taken out, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you next see any of your master's property again? - A. The evening of that same day; Monday, I saw this same doe rabbit, and several fowls, taken out of Bedfont river, in two baskets, between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far is the river from Dr. Whitefield's? - A. About a quarter of a mile. I believe some of the fowls were my master's, but the wings and tails were cut. I saw the prisoner Sharp immediately after, and the other two prisoners about half an hour afterwards, or three quarters.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from Dr. Whitefield's? - A. About a quarter of a mile, or hardly so far; they were driving two asses, with baskets on one, and panniers on the other; the next evening, Monday, about half past four, as high as I can guess, I saw Davis and Hindes come down from Staines towards Bedfont, with one ass, and in a quarter of an hour the other prisoner, the old man, came up, with two baskets upon his shoulders; then Sharp came up through the Shot first, and then Davis, went into Mr. Spurnell's Stony-close, and I saw them take the fowls out of the hedge, and put them into the the baskets; Hindes staid at the gate with his ass; I went and alarmed Bedfont, and then pursued them; and I saw Sharp on the top of the river bank, he threw some of the fowls out of the basket into the river, and then they were taken.</p>

When I came back, I saw Sharp upon the river bank, with he basket upon his shoulder, then he took some fowls out of the basket, and threw them into the river, I cannot say, how many; I did not see them taken out afterwards.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutor before this time? - A. No, I did not; I am a chandler, I live in St. John's-court, West Smithfield: On the 1st of this month, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I was at supper with my wife, and a friend, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately went into the court, and when I came to the door I saw the prisoner at the bar, close to my door, and the prosecutor about laying hold of him, and having laid hold of him, accused him of having taken his watch, the prosecutor was very drunk; I immediately assisted the prosecutor, and took hold of the prisoner at the bar, and I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A. There was a light from my own window, and a light from the lamps, I was really astonished; the prosecutor said, this man has stolen my watch, I will swear to it. I said, Jack, as an honest man, are you willing to be searched; the prosecutor took on very much; he said, yes, Mr. Smith, I will be searched by you, or go any where with you to be searched; with that; he said, he had been to Mr. House's, and had staid there half an hour, having a drop of porter; he said, I have been ill for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. House? - A. He works with the prisoner's master, he is a labourer in the carting line.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Knapp. Q. What is Mr. House? - A. Mrs. House, I believe, is a nurse, he had a bottle of stuff, from her that night; he said he was agreeable to go to their house to be searched; when we came there, the prosecutor refused taking him in there, it was a private house; I told him I knew the man, I knew it was safe to he searched there; I thought proper to send for a constable, but he was not in the way; I then took him back to the Cooper's-arms, the end of St. John's-court; when I took him into the public-house, the prosecutor had hold of him, and I left him with the prosecutor in order to go for a patrol; I returned, in about ten minutes, without a patrol; when I got into the Cooper's-arms, Mr. Bull and his nephew came up, they enquired into the matter, and the prisoner was taken into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went into the parlour? - A. The prosecutor, the prisoner, Mr. Bull and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say how long he had been out of Mr. House's house? - A. Not a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Mr. House's house from where you were? - A. About a dozen or fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know the prisoner very well? - A. I know him as a neighbour; I never saw the prosecutor before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you found him, the prosecutor was just in the act of taking hold of him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take him into your house? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180044"/>Court. Q. You took him to the public-house? - A. Yes; and I left him and went for the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. How long wre you gone? - A.About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What they did in the parlour you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was George's-court from where you saw him? - A. About sixty or seventy yards at least.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out of the parlour what passed? - A. The prosecutor offered the prisoner a guinea if he would give him his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out of the parlour what did they do then? - A. I saw no transaction of any kind; the prisoner's master was bound for his appearance, he gave his word, and so did Mr. Dye.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were in the parlour? - A. I was, my Lord, after I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us know who were the persons in the parlour? - A. I mentioned Mr. Bull, his nephew, the landlord, and several other persons, besides the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will you swear there were three besides those people you have mentioned? - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Who searched him? - A. There was nobody searched him while I was there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He was willing to be searched, but was not searched? - A. Not in my presence; the prisoner was there a long while after I went away to supper, I left some in the tap-room, and some in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to say you left them in the parlour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go into the parlour for? - A. For the purpose of hearing him examined; he went in to be searched but was not searched.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left them, and went home to supper, where was the prisoner? - A. To the best of my recollection, he was in the parlour; I can speak pretty clear the prisoner was in the parlour when I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you, not above five minutes ago, to tell me you did not recollect what they said when they came out of the parlour? - A. I don't recollect what was said; there was nothing passed more than I wished them a good night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went into the parlour for the purpose of examining the prisoner, but did not examine him? - A. There was no officer in the way; we did not know we were authorized to search a man without an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to take him to Mr. House's to be examined? - A. I meant to have gone for Mr. Wells to have searched him, I took him there for safety; I did not know it was in my power to search a man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the prisoner in the house, in whose custody did you leave him? - A. In the custody of the prosecutor; the tap-room was nearly full, there was a vast number of people.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am wife to the last witness, I work for the hospital: I never saw the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, till the night this affair happened, the 1st of April. My husband told me in the morning, that this young man had an inward complaint, he spit blood; I gave him some lavender drops; I believe he had not been above a minute and a half out of the house when he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing at all about this watch? - A. When he was brought back, I immediately opened the door, and was very much surprised to see him come back; the prosecutor was very much intoxicated indeed. I said, bring the man in, and search him; the prosecutor objected to having him brought into the house. I asked him if he could tell the number of his watch; the prosecutor said he could not tell. Can you tell any marks upon your watch, and what sort of a chain it was; the prosecutor said, no, the maker's name was on the watch, and he said he should know it if he saw it. I said, can you tell no mark upon your watch; he said he could not, but if he saw the watch he could tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He came to you for this complaint of spitting blood, and you gave him lavender drops? - A. Yes. (Produces the bottle.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the bottle again? - A. He brought it back to the door, and gave it me back, the young man was flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought to be examined? - A. Yes, but the prosecutor objected; he said he would not have him brought into a strange house to be examined; the prisoner was very willing to be searched, but the prosecutor would not let him; he pulled his coat off, and said, search me, I am innocent, I would not rob a man of a pin off his sleeve.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near was your husband then? - A. My husband was close by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Smith? - A. He stood close by the prisoner. I have known Smith above two years.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I keep the Cooper's Arms: I know the prisoner at the bar; I saw him and the prosecutor on the 1st of April, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober at that time? - A. Far from it, very drunk. The first I saw of the business was, the prosecutor and defendant came in, and there was a gentleman of the name of Smith, and a multitude of people rushed into the taproom suddenly; the prosecutor cried, and reeled very much; he said he had lost his watch, and the person he had in hold, he said, had robbed him of it, at the corner of Snow-hill; he said positively that the prisoner was the man that had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did the man say to that? - A. he said he had not got the watch, nor did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all he said, are you sure those were the words? - A.Something similar to that, signifying that he had not got it. The prisoner made no other defence; he said he was willing to he searched. There were a great number of people in the tap-room. My house is in West-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. West-street is not Chick-lane? A. No, it joins Chick-lane. In consequence of my knowing the man's character, I told the prosecutor he certainly must be mistaken in the man; I told him, if he thought that was the man, to withdraw from the public room into the parlour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180046"/>he told me he would not. I could not get any reasonable word out of him, but crying he had lost his watch. After that the prisoner's master was sent for; and before his master came, I wanted the prosecutor to have the prisoner searched, and to give charge of him in the regular way. After that, I offered to he hail for his appearance, provided he was regularly charged; he would not consent to any thing that I said, but would stay in the tap-room. Before the prisoner's master came, he was taken from the tap-room by my maid servant, she laid hold of his arm, as he was pushed about by the prosecutor and anotherperson, his name was M'Carthy. I went directly to the bar, and got the keys of my back doors, and locked my back door, and the passage door, to prevent any body going out backwards. After that, his master came, and another gentlemen, his master's nephew, to answer for the prisoner's character; and then, by a deal of persuasions by Mr. Bulle, they all went into the parlour. Mr. Bulle put several questions to the prosecutor, whether he had lost his watch, and he still persisted that the prisoner was the man that stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went into the parlour? - A. The prisoner, the prosecutor, Mr. M'Carthy, Mr. Bulle, and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - A. I was obliged to attend the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where Smith was at the time? - A. I believe Smith went out for an officer to secure the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. No, it was not shut at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Smith went for an officer, and returned, where did he go then? - A. He went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go into the parlour? - A. As soon as the company went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed? - A. All the conversation was between Mr. Bulle and the prosecutor, concerning the watch, and his vocuhing for the man's character and honesty; he told the prosecutor he was sure he was mistaken in the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why? - A. Because, knowing the man was such an honest character. The prosecutor said, he would give a guinea if any body would produce the watch, and cried, and reeled about; and the woman that gave her evidence was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was M'Carthy drunk? - A. No, I did not perceive he was drunk; for he and his friend had only a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prosecutor and prisoner were in the tap-room, were they jostled about? - A. There were many people there, and it could not be helped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike the prosecutor? - A. I took hold of him gently by the arm to come into the parlour, and take his party with him, and not expose themselves in the public room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who were the party? - A. The party was the prisoner and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him searched? - A. No. I understand he was searched in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the Justice when he was examined? - A. Yes; it was before Mr. Alderman Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not comitted till the second examination? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was House there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about it? - A. He said, he had that minute before he was taken up left his house with a bottle of stuff; he came to me first of all to borrow a bottle to put the stuff in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go into the parlour? - A. I did, as soon as I had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented you? - A. Nothing but my wife's being so poorly; it was but a very few minutes before I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was he not searched in the tap-room? A. I don't know; he was willing to be searched, but nobody stepped forward to search him. I am sure he was searched in the parlour by his master and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had be been out of the house before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present when he was searched? - A.His master and his nephew, M'Carthy, and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that the parlour door was shut? - A. No; it was bolted back all the day long. I am sure it was not shut at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people? - A. I cannot tell; it was a large tap-room. I saw the prosecutor there, when I came up. I desired him to go into the parlour, to search the prisoner; there was a person there, who said there was no occasion to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that M'Carthy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your requiring the prosecutor to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180047"/>into the parlour, did you all immediately go into the parlour? - A. Yes. There were the prisoner, the prosecutor, my nephew and Mr. Smith, and M'Carthy came into the room; I told the prosecutor, it was proper to search the prisoner, to see if there was any property about him; M'Carthy said, there was no occasion for it; I told him, I thought they should be satisfied.</p>

               <p>Q. What other conversation took place? - A. The prosecutor spoke several times, but I could hardly make out any thing he said, only that he had lost his watch; he cried like a child that had been corrected. Nothing particular passed afterwards.</p>

             sworn. - I am the nephew of Mr. Bulle; I have lived in my uncle's service about nine years; I have two or three and twenty men under my care. I have known the prisoner at the bar about five years; and with respect to his character, I believe him to be honest; I have sent him to wine and brandy-merchants, and I never saw him intoxicated in my life. On the 1st of April, about half past nine o'clock at night, I went to the Coopers' Arms, and when I came into the tap-room, I saw a great number of people very inserior characters to my appearance, such as Irish labourers; I saw the prisoner at the bar and the prosecutor, and I took them into the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. Who went into the parlour with you? - A. There was Mr. Dye, an Irishman, a Mr. Smith, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and my uncle. When I first went into the tap-room, I said, if you have any thing to alledge against the prisoner, you had better take him into the parlour; when we went into the parlour, the prosecutor cried, and said he had lost his watch; he was very much intoxicated, in short, he tumbled against me. I think he offered the prisoner a guinea to give him his watch; he said, I have not got your watch, you never saw me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing at all about searching? - A. The man offered to be searched, I did not see any body that wished to do it. My uncle and Mr. Dye become answerable for his appearance the next day. On the Monday, he went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Pray, as you came for the purpose of searching this man, why did you not search him? - A. I did not know that I was authorized to search him.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses were called to the prisoner's character, who had known him from three to four years, and believed him to be a very honest man.</p>

               <p>Q.Should you know either of them again? - A. Yes, the man with the dark hair (Jackson) is the man that took the Bank-notes from me, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean by that, that you certainly believe him to be the man? - A. Yes; the other man I rather suspect to be the person, but I cannot say, there were three five pound notes, eight two pound notes, and I think seven ones; I have the half-guinea that he offered me, it is a counterfiet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the shop altogether? - A. About ten minutes.</p>

             sworn. - On the 9th of February, about half past six in the morning, Seaton and I were going down Gray's-inn-lane, we observed a woman opening the shutters of Mr. Marshall's chambers; I said to Seaton, if you will stop a-while, I dare say there is some property to be got out of that house; and when the woman was gone up stairs, I got in at the window myself; I went into the front parlour, and saw a quantity of wearing apparel, a gown and stays, and two pair of shoes, and a pair of silver buckles, accordingly I took them to the window and gave them to Seaton; after I came out, Seaton went in himself, and fetched some more things out; we took them to his house, and his wife was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that she was his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she married to him? - A. I never heard to the contrary; we went with the property to a Jew's, and he would not give money enough, and we brought them back to Seaton's house, his wife was at home then; we agreed that the property was to be pawned, and she took out the things separately to pawn, I said there while she went with them; she came back with the money and the duplicates, and shewed them to me; she pawned two pair of shoes, and a black silk cloak, and the remainder of the property I pawned myself, and the money was equally divided.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up, you know? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. But you did not think you might chance to be hanged for it? - A. I might.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you think, by swearing against some person or other, you might be able to save yourself? - A. Yes, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, for the first time, you charged the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are one of the clerks in the Discount-office in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of February last, had the prisoner a discount account at the Bank? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill, and tell me whether, on the 22d of February, this bill was discounted? - A. On the 22d of February this bill was discounted by the Bank of England, with others.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the course of the Bank, when bills are presented to them, for persons to leave a list of the bills that they bring to be discounted? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the list which accompanied that bill, when it came for discount? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a bill signed by Mr. Wilkinson? - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Wilkinson? - A. Very well; I have seen it often.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that list, which bears his signature, written by him? - A. I believe it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill, do you believe that to be the writing of the prisoner? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the endorsement, David Wilkinson, at the back? - A. I believe that to be the handwriting of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he paid the value of that bill, abating the discount? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that, and tell me if that is the draft of the prisoner, and whether, upon the credit of that and the other bills, he obtained any money, and what? - A. Yes, 639l. 18s. I have an entry that I made at the time of the transaction, as a warrant for him to go to the Drawing-office, in order to enable him to draw off the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the draft? - A. This draft appears to be the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q.Where do you take that entry from? - A.This is the regular mode of doing business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The bills come to you, you discount them, and in order that he may have the consideration of his discount, you give him a warrant, which goes to another officer, by which he gets credit of the Bank? - A. Yes; it is a warrant made by me in the Discount-office, taken from the bills themselves, which I pass to the Drawing-office, as their warrant to permit him to draw to the amount of those bills. The amount of the bills was 639l. 18s. and the discount for that day 4l. 19s. 10d.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that other paper, and say if that is a draft upon the Bank in consequence of it? - A. Here are two drafts, one for 544l. and the other for 91l. making together 635l. drawn by him on the Bank, and paid to him on the 22d of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. Do you mean to say, that you took these papers from the bills themselves, or from any copy of the bills, or any entry of the bills in any book? - A. That warrant is taken from the bills, and signed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this copy yourself? - A. No; but I sign them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see the bills when you sign those warrants? - A. I must have seen the bills, or else I could not have entered them in my book, for which I sign that warrant, as a voucher.</p>
               <p>Q. Who makes this copy from the bills? - A. One of the clerks in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not sign this paper upon the faith merely of that clerk having made a copy? - A. No; because I signed that paper upon the faith of having seen the bills themselves, and entered them to the amount; and the discount being properly done by another clerk, I then sign it, as a voucher that so much may be carried to the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever examine the bills before you sign them? - A. There is no occasion to examine them; I had made an entry of those bills in my discount book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is there any entry that you have made yourself from the bills themselves? - A. The entry that I have made in my book is the clear amount of the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Wilkinson write? - No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only mean to say, that the handwriting upon that bill is something like the handwriting of Mr. Wilkinson? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself ever transact any business. with Mr. Wilkinson? - A. Yes; in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person of the name of Wilkinson, who has a discount at the Bank? - A. I do not know of any other person of the name of David Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any other person of the name of Wilkinson? - A. There are several Wilkinsons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q.Whatever other discounter there may be of the name of Wilkinson in the Bank, are you sure that you have transacted bu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180051"/>siness with the prisoner upon the subject of discount? - A. Yes; frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. And, from the knowledge you have had from that circumstance of his hand-writing, you believe that to be his hand-writing? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>ISAAC WILSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am clerk to Smith, Payne, and Smith, bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you paid drafts of his? - A. Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his character and hand-writing? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the body of the bill, and the endorsement,

               <p>William Bousfield, sen. called. - Mr. Serjeant Shepherd objected to the competency of Mr. Bousfield's testimony, upon the ground that, thought there was a release to the acceptors, there was still a claim upon the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. The first person they have to resort to, is the acceptor, and if they give up the first person, and admit that he is not liable to pay, they cannot resort to the second.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he confined to his bed? - A.Partly, not wholly.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his disorder? - A. A rheumatic fever.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, consistent with his health and life, it would be fit that he should attend in this Court to give evidence? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. My Lord. There are three partners in this house, all concerned in the business; two of them say it is not their handwriting, but the third partner is said to be in a situation in which he cannot appear as a witness, and on account of whose absence they might have put off the trial; but though it may not be the handwriting even of that third person, it does not follow that it may not be the hand-writing of some person authorized by Mr. Favell to accept bills in the name of the firm of the house; and, in cases of forgery, nothing can be evidence against a prisoner, but the man whose name purports to be forged, swearing that it is not his.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a case in which the prisoner has a very important stake indeed, that of his life, and I know not difference in the application of evidence between a civil and a criminal case. I do not believe that any gentleman at the bar would have made an objection of this kind in a civil case. The rule of law does not require impossibilities; and if the person who could give the best evidence, is prevented either by illness, or even by necessary absence, as in the case of deeds executed in the East-Indies, it has been decided that you need not bring the attesting witness; if you bring a person to prove the hand-writing, it is sufficient: and if that is so in a civil case, I know no difference between that and a criminal case.</p>
               <p>As the very learned Counsel, for whose opinion I have great respect, has made this objection, I know not whether his opinion goes along with it, but I am extremely happy in this case, a criminal case of the greatest importance, that I have the best assistance that can be afforded on the bench, to confirm me in the opinion that I shall give. I am clearly of opinion that there is no ground upon earth for the objection. This objection comes in a very odd fashion, because it is not many minutes ago that the learned Counsel, who now makes this objection, objected to the admissibility of Mr. Bousfield; if that objection had prevailed, the door of Justice must have been for ever shut, and however numerous and aggravated cases might be, taking both these objections together, there would be an indemnity in future in all such cases. It is said, that it is not conclusive, the conclusion is for the Jury to make, but here a person is afflicted by the hand of the Almighty, and it is in the ordinary course of the administration of justice to permit those to give evidence, who have seen the handwriting of the person. I have never heard such an objection before. I am clearly of opinion that the evidence is admissible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Hotham. I perfectly concur in my Lord's opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. So do I.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you not know that for different houses they would only discount to a certain extent, and for others to a different extent? - A. I know of no such general rule, it lies in the breasts of the Directors themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they no rule to guide their discretion? - A. None that I know, it lies entirely in the breasts of the Directors to discount what they think proper; they are guided by; the responsibilty of the discounter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. Painful as is the situation in which I am placed - a few days since a merchant of this city, respected like yourselves, and now standing at this bar to answer a capital charge; incalculable: as my anxiety must be at the reflection that a wife and five children are, at this moment, in the most dreadful suspence human nature can admit of; painful, I say, as this situation is, it admits of no small alleviation from the circumstance, that the verdict, which is to determine, not only on my life, but, on what is still dearer to me, my character and reputation, is to be pronounced by a Jury of merchants and tradesmen: no other class of men could from so just an idea of the grounds of defence I am about to lay before you; for the degree of trust and confidence I have placed in an individual, would, to any other than persons conversant in trade and business, appear improbable, as well as imprudent; whilst to men engaged in commercial concerns, not only its possibility, but its probability will be apparent. You, Gentlemen, as merchants and tradesmen of this city, have been bred in the very bosom of commerce; by your education and habits of life, you must therefore be aware of the wonderful extent of confidence and credit, that not only exists, but which necessarily prevails between man and man, in the various transactions of commercial dealings; and, therefore, will the better comprehend the facts I shall presently state as the ground of my defence. Confidence most extended, trust almost implicit, and unbounded credit in the mutual transactions of each other, is the very basis and foundation of the vast system of commerce, by which our nation is supported; and to such confidence alone (unfortunately misapplied) am I indebted for the situation in which I now stand.</p>
               <p>I would not willingly, Gentlemen of the Jury, trespass unnecessarily on your time, or that of the Court, and shall proceed to lay before you such a state of facts, as will enable you to apply the evidence I shall produce, to the general outline of my defence. I will but just observer on the necessity of my doing this, on account of the law not allowing a man, in my situation, the advantage of a Counsel's abilities in addressing you, or in stating my case in the advantageous manner, which, by art and elocution it might be placed; but I have more than one consolation, which counterbalances all the disadvantage of my being unpracticed in public speaking - the one is, that my case is a plain state of facts, which needs but a simple statement to be understood; and the other is, that the indulgence of our laws gives a man, in my situation, the claim to the assistance of the Judges who preside here, and the urbanity and humanity of those Judges before whom I stand, ensures me the exercise of such right, in applying, and in calling your attention to the application of such parts of the evidence, as through my inadvertence, or inability, I may neglect to place in a proper point of view.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, let me call your attention to this point, that no fort of evidence has been produced, to shew or lead you, for a moment, to suppose that forgery was committed by me. The only charge against me, to which any evidence, on the part of the prosecution can be made to apply, is that of uttering such forged bills; and here let me six your attention to this point, on which my defence will wholely rest, namely, that to constitute any criminality, in the uttering such bills, I must be proved to have known them to be forged at the time of my so uttering them; without establishing this fact, I confidently appeal to my Lord, whether the prosecutors can be said to have made out any case against me. Of my being so apprized of the forgery, at the time of my discounting the bills, no shade of direct positive evidence has been produced. It has been proved. and I admit the last to be so, that I discounted such bills at the Bank, and there the evidence for the Crown rests. No separate independent collateral facts, arising from my conduct at the time of so discounting the bills, or at any subsequent period, have been proved to shew, or to infer, my knowledge of the forgery; on the contrary, as far as any inference may be drawn from my conduct, both at the time, and posterior to my having discounted the bills, it is presumptive evidence of my being wholly ignorant, as I call God to witness I really was, of such bills being forged. However, I cannot but admit, that my appearing, on the face of the bills themselves, the immediate drawer on the person, whose name appears to be forged, does, till that circumstance is explained, afford that fort of implication, that I was privy to the forgery, as calls on me to explain and account for.</p>
               <p>A very few circumstances, which I am about to state, will, I trust satisfy your minds on this head. It is now about two years since a partnership concern, which had previously existed between me and Mr. Joseph Adamson, whose name you have heard in the course of this trial, was dissolved; public notice of such dissolution was inserted in the Gazette. As we parted on good terms, and had ever been in the habits of friendship, our wishes to serve each other (at least I speak for myself) still continued. Sometime after we separated, he being about to go to Manchester, respecting his business, requested me to give an eye to his servants in his absence; and particularly to attend to the payment of such bills as would become due during his absence, and for which he left out checks on his bankers: this I engaged to do, and, for this purpose, part of a desk in his accompting-house was allotted me; and as our friendship for each other continued from that time to the period when this forgery was discovered, I continued in the use of such part of the desk, to the period of his apprehension. But it will be in evidence to you, that such desk was constantly left by me unlocked; and, therefore, no inference of private transaction being carried on by me, at Mr. Adamson's accompting house, can be drawn from the circumstance of my having the use of such desk.</p>
               <p>It was sometime after Mr. Adamson's return from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180054"/>Manchester, that on account of the increasing extent of his business, he stated to me his frequent embarrassments for want of cash, and his consequent want of an encreased discount; and suggested to me, that as on our dissolution of partnership, the discount-account with the Bank of England, which, during our partnership, was only one joint account, by being now separated and divided, might, with my assistance, give him the advantage of a double discount account with the Bank. I need scarcely mention to you, Gentlemen, that the Bank of England, in their discounts, confine the account of each individual, or firm, to a certain extent, which they will for such individual, or firm, on no account exceed. That such is the practice of the Bank is notorious to every commercial man; and it must occur to you, how great an advantage Mr. Adamson would derive, if, by my means, he could have the benefit of such second discount account with the Bank in my name. The mode proposed by him, to which I readily acceded, and which was accordingly afterwards adopted, and for a long time carried on without interruption, will account for the from in which the bills, mentioned in the indictment, are drawn, and will open at once to you, the nature of my defence. It was this -</p>
               <p>I knew that his connections were numerous and extensive; and he stated to me that he had much extended them; and this I believed to be true, from the encreased business I saw going on at his warehouse, He mentioned having a variety of houses, on whom, in the course of business, he had a right to draw to a much greater amount than the extent to which his discount account, at the Bank, was usually limitted; he therefore proposed that I should assist him, by drawing bills on his customers, in my name, though, in reality, on his account; and for debts due to himself, payable to my order; by; which means, his name would not appear on the bills so oftensibly drawn by me, though, in reality, his own; and would, therefore, be received and discounted at the Bank on my discount account; and, by this means, he would have the advantage he wished to gain by a double discount account with the Bank; the one in his own name, the other in mine. This mode was not, however, always adopted, as he sometimes brought me the promissory notes of his customers, payable to my order.</p>
               <p>On a consideration of this proposal, and being convinced that it would of course give Mr. Adamson the advantage he stood in need of, and that without injury to any one, I assented, and transactions, in this form, have been carried on with the Bank to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>You will please to observe, in this transaction, there was nothing bordering on criminality; it was no more than the well known usuage, the avowed practice of merchants of the first respectability, that of accommodating each other by the loan of their names to negociable paper.</p>
               <p>It was evident to me that I was essentially serving Mr. Adamson by this accommodation; and I confess I did not foresee the possibility of any further hazard or risque on my part, than that of the failure of the persons on whom I thus drew; and satisfied as I was of the solvency of Mr. Adamson, that risque I was willing to run in his service.</p>
               <p>The persons on whom I thus from time to time drew on Mr. Adamson's account, being, as I was informed, his customers, some were of course unknown to me, and their signatures of acceptance, consequently, could not be by me suspected. The mode in which I drew on them was by having the names and sums furnished me by Mr. Adamson; and when I had drawn the bills, they were sometimes given, sometimes sent by me to Mr. Adamson, for him to procure the acceptance; and then they were returned to me to be sent into the Bank on my discount account; and when the amount; discounted, thereof, deducting the discount, was sent or given by me to Mr. Adamson, by draft on the Bank of England. In every case, I was furnished with the acceptance by Mr. Adamson; and in no case had any communication with the parties on whom the bills were drawn, and whom I always supposed to be the real customers or friends of Mr. Adamson.</p>

               <p>Circumstances of this nature, being in their principle founded in private confidence, it would not have been very surprizing if I had stood here on this simple statement, and called upon you for a belief of what I am now asserting, without a possibility of bringing any fort of evidence in support of this case. But most fortunately, I can prove, by several witnesses of respectability, that such was the nature of my transactions with Mr. Adamson. Several witnesses will be produced, who were in reality of the description I supposed all the persons to be on whom I drew for Mr. Adamson. These witnesses will tell you, that they dealt with Mr. Adamson, and were in the habit of accepting bills on his account, and for his use, which were drawn on them by me, without the name of Adamson appearing thereon; and that the reason of their so accepting my bill, though they held no connexion with me, was, that it was at Adamson's request, with a view, as they understood, to facilitate and extend his accommodation.</p>
               <p>In addition to this evidence, which establishes the general ground work of my defence, I shall be able to prove, that I paid over to Mr. Adamson, by my drafts on the Bank, the whole sums of money produced by the discount of the bills, which are the subject of the present prosecution; and also, that I was in the habit of paying to Mr. Adamson the amount of all the sums I so discounted at the Bank, in my own name, for him, which must remove all doubt of my guilt, since I can scarcely be supposed weak enough to incur the punishment of a capital offence, without receiving any emolument. The clerks and servants of Mr. Adamson will likewise be called, and will prove, in further corroboration of this case, my being in the habit of receiving bills from Mr. Adamson-sending them to him to procure the acceptance-and receiving them from him, when accepted, to get them discounted at the Bank. One very material circumstance will be proved by them strongly confirmative of the fact, that the produce of such bills, so discounted by me at the Bank, was received by Adamson, and not by me; it is that, in several instances, when I have left bills at the Bank for discount, and I have left town (my residence being at Bethnal-Green), before the time the Bank's answer could be received, I have left a blank draft on the Bank, at Adamson's ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180055"/>compting-house, to be filled up by him, in my absence, according to the amount of the bills, which the Bank might have discounted, and which he received accordingly.</p>
               <p>These general proofs will, under the circumstances of this case (which you, Gentlemen, will bear in your minds, was a case of private confidence), be more than could, in common probability, be expected; and, in themselves, would, I trust, be sufficient to convince you of the true nature of the transaction, and consequently of my being innocent of all knowledge of the bills being forged.</p>
               <p>But fortunately for me, I am possessed of evidence, respecting the very identical bills on which this indictment is founded. A witness will be called, who will prove their being in the hands of Adamson before they were endorsed by me; that Adamson admitted they were drawn by me, at his request; and that I received them from Adamson, for the purpose of getting them discounted for him at the Bank; and that I afterwards gave the amount of such bills, when discounted, to Adamson.</p>
               <p>These facts must convince you, Gentlemen, of my being the ignorant means of procuring the discount of these bills, without any knowledge of the forgery; this is not circumstantial evidence, but positive and direct; and when added to the character of respectability and credit I have ever borne, and which nothing but the situation in which I stand, could induce me to mention, will, I trust, obtain me a verdict of acquittal.</p>
               <p>Conscious as I am of my innocence, and supported as my defence is by positive evidence, I feel a fort of unwillingness to attempt the strengthening my case by the observations I am about to make; but the duty I owe to my family, requires me, perhaps, to leave no circumstance unnoticed, which is worthy your attention. I would therefore, for a moment, draw your attention to my conduct, subsequent to the apprehension of Mr. Adamson on the charge of forgery. That I was shocked and alarmed at the intelligence, I confess; but such alarm arose from the ruinous consequences it was likely to produce on my affairs, if the outstanding bills, which I had discounted for Mr. Adamson, were not genuine, knowing my liberality as the discounter, to make them good; the steps I immediately took must convince you that this, and this alone was the ground of my alarms; for I immediately went to my attorney, and after stating the circumstance, went to the accompting-house of Mr. Adamson (the last place I should have gone to had I been conscious of guilt), where I found he was detained at the Bank on the charged of forgery. An accomplice would have flown, and that I had the opportunity of doing so, is evident, since I that night slept at home, and on the following day returned, with my attorney again to Adamson's accompting-house, with a determination to obtain what I could by way of indemnity, to the responsibility which attached to me on his account. I there, in the presence of his clerks, opened his bill-box, and actually brought away the contents, under the claim of a right so to do, by way of indemnity. What inference can you draw from such conduct, Gentlemen, but that I was acting under the consciousness of innocence, and on the idea that, having accommodated Adamson with my name as drawer, I had a right to seek and secure an indemnity. Among the bills in the box were two that had my endorsement on them, as having been most likely returned from the Bank, and refused discount; and knowing I should he liable, if they got into circulation with my endorsement, for the amounts of those bills, I erased my name, and left the bills in the box. And here I must remark, and press it as a point deserving your particular attention, that if I had had the most distant idea that those bills were forgeries, I should certainly have taken them away, or destroyed them; and not, by leaving them behind, furnish evidence against myself, which might at least subject me to the inconvenience of explaining how my name happened to appear on them.</p>
               <p>I did more, Gentlemen of the Jury, I left word with Adamson's servants, if I was wanted by any one, where I should be, and at which place I accordingly waited sometime, and afterwards went home, where I slept that night as usual. On the following day, I received a letter from Messrs. Winter and Kay, to attend at their office; I did attend accordingly, at that time, and at two subsequent meetings before my actual commitment, was anxious to enter into an explanation of the transaction, and pledged myself, if allowed to inspect my checks an the Bank, and refer to certain books I described, to clear myself to their satisfaction; but, unfortunately for me, my entreaties were not then attended to, or I should have rendered my standing before you unnecessary: for I cannot believe that, if I had been allowed to state and prove to them, what I have now stated, and am about to prove to you, any Magistrate would have thought it right to commit me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall now only observe, that the attention of the commercial world has been a good deal engaged on the subject of the charges brought against myself and Mr. Adamson; and some rumours may have come to your ears, or some statements been seen by you, in the public papers, which may have engendered a prejudice against me. However, Gentlemen, I am confident, that you will, under his Lordship's direction, not forget that it is your duty only to attend to the evidence produced before you, and to discharge your minds from any such prejudice.</p>
               <p>I fully rely upon the candour and impartiality of a Jury of my countrymen; and, conscious of my innocence, have not held back from this public investigative, but voluntarily came forward as soon as I was sent for.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that bill drawn upon Bowles and Beachcroft, is that one of them? - A. This is one of them; he had discount allowed to the amount of 855l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out the warrants upon which the bills were discounted? - A. I did not, but the clerk is here that did make it out; it is signed by himself, which gave him credit to draw to that amount.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hand-writing is that account of the bills which he sent for discount to the Bank? - A. Joseph Adamson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that accompany the bills when they are sent in to be discounted? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the rest, is there an account of this bill upon Bowles, Beachcroft, and Company? - A. There is; "Paid, London, Jan. 27, 1798.

               <p>Q. How do you know that these bills were left at the Bank? - A. I am certain that they were left, because they correspond with the list.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Mr. Adamson write? - A. I cannot take upon me to say that I have.</p>

               <p>Q. It is only from having seen other papers, which you conceive to be his hand-writing, that you suppose this to be his writing? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he ever acknowledge any of those papers that you supposed to be his writing? - A. we have very little conversation with the discounter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever understand, from him, that any of these papers were his hand-writing? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You saw the seal put to this release? - A. Yes. (A release from the Bank to Bowles and Company produced).</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot say you have ever observed his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180058"/>hand while he was writing? - A. I never took particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q.From the comparison of his hand-writing with the drafts that you have paid, you suppose this draft to be his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear from him any acknowledgment that these former drafts of his, were his hand-writing? - A. He would certainly have mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to know is this, you say you believe this to be his hand-writing, because, upon comparison of his name written to other drafts, it resembles it? - A. It does.</p>

               <p>Q. It is the course of your banking-house, (it is not the course of every house), from time to time, to return the drafts which a customer has drawn, with their book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you done so with Mr. Adamson? - A.Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened that you have returned similar signatures to that which is now put into your hand? - A. Yes, always.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever complain that there were any drafts inserted which he knew nothing of? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. How many times in a week has this book been carried backwards and forwards like a shuttlecock? - A. I cannot say how many times.</p>

               <p>Q. And without making any objections to the drafts being cancelled? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did the book last? - A.A. twelve month.</p>

               <p>Q. And made payments in consequence of his supposed signature? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A.(Reads a draft upon the Bank of England, dated the 27th of January, 1798, for £845.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that signature the hand-writing of the prisoner? - A. I believe it is; I should have paid a draft with that signature, if it had come to our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the book, and tell me if the endorsement, which purports to be the endorsement of Mr. Adamson, is his hand-writing? - A. I believe it to be Mr. Adamson's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that acceptance? - A. The letters are R.D.B.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the course of your house, for each partner, when he accepts, to use his own initials? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It went backwards and forwards, as other men's banking-books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that accepted by you? - A. It is not my acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not the course, as in some houses for each partner to use the initials of the whole firm? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that list, whose hand-writing is that? - A. I believe it to be Mr. Adamson's writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you yourself, or any person, said any thing to induced him, or threaten him to give any information that he might? - A. No. I told him that whatever he communicated must be voluntary, and if he chose to give me any, I would receive it; but he must not hope for any thing in consequence of it. I had all the bills, and I shewed him this amongst the rest, and he pointed out this to me as a forgery; I asked him as to the endorser who Mr. Holt was, and he said a correspondent of his at Manchester; I asked him if he knew whose hand-writing it was, he said it was not Mr, Holt's, but he did not know whose it was; he said that was not the hand-writing of Mr. Morrey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs. Q. He gave you all the information he could, and, I believe, has materially assisted you, has he not? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to have troubled the Court with a single word upon the case, but have relied wholly upon that administration of justice which is peculiar to the jurisprudence of this country; but finding, to my utter surprize, that Mr. Wilkinson has thrown the whole of the blame upon me, I think it a duty I owe to God, to my country, and my friends, to declare, that I do not know any thing about his business; and I declare solemnly, as I hope for salvation, that I had nothing to do with his transactions. Every assertion that he has made upon that subject is not true; if I have erred, I have erred through ignorance and misrepresentation. I forbear saying more, not meaning to implicate any body. I leave the rest to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Kaye.) I believe you had reason to think that all the information he gave you was true? - A.Perfectly.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you first any transaction with him respecting advancing money upon securities? The witness referred to a book.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When were those memorandums made? - A.As they happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180060"/>Mr. Giles. You may refresh your memory with them then.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of March, 1796, he applied to me to sell my stock, and hold Scrip-receipts for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to have the use of the money which the stock produced? - A. The prisoner or his principal; and he deposited Scrip-receipts with me to the amount of 300l.</p>
               <p>Q. How many receipts did he deposit? - A. I do not know whether it was two or three receipts, but there was to the amount of 300l. exactly. The next application was the 18th of February, 1797; I advanced him 2240l. in money, he deposited for that, Scrip-receipts to the amount of 4600l. On the 16th of May, he applied to me again, to sell 1000l. of my Consols; I agreed to it, for which I received 1000l. in Scrip-receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and see if that is the receipt you then received? - A. This is the very one, it is marked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it in the same plight that it is now? - A. He brought me a receipt with only one payment upon it; I cannot say exactly whether it was that receipt or another; then I opened the receipt, it was folded up; I said, Mr. Reeves, here is only one payment upon this, I should have one paid in full; he accordingly said, oh, so it is; I will get one paid in full, or, I will make it paid in full, I do not know which was-the expression exactly, but it was to that purport.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the Bank? - A. Yes, in the Three per Cent. office. He then left me, and went, as I thought, to make the payment. In about an hour, he returned, and gave me that very receipt exactly as it is now, and said, there, Mr. Parry, there is one paid in full.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character did he apply to you to make these advances? - A. As a broker, and he appeared to go to his principal always.</p>
               <p>Q. What transaction had you with him afterwards? - A. On the 17th or 18th of July, or thereabouts, I gave him 2000l. Loyalty Loan to sell for me; he told me the same day, he had sold them for 615l. money, and for that money he gave me 1200l. in Scrip-receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Go on to the time when you received a memorandum of him, state when, and upon what occasion? (shewing him a paper) - A. About the 21st of October, 1797, as near as I can guess, I received this from Mr. Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing is that paper? - A. I believe it to be the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - A. Yes; I have seen him write, and I believe that to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>(It is read.)</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his giving you this memorandum? - A. It was an agreement, as he told me, between him and his principal.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these 30l. and 15l. mentioned in the memorandum? - A. That was a continuation from different settlement days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any application to the prisoner for the re-payment of this money, and the delivering up the securities? - A. I applied to him to put them into my name as stock.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the Scrip-receipts to be turned into stock? - A. Yes. He said, I will go and hear what they have to say, meaning, as I supposed, his principals; when he came back again, he used to say, you may as well let it go on for a time, you have got Government security in your hands, and therefore you need not be uneasy about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did permit it to go on? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur, and what, to raise any suspicion that this security was not what you believed it to be? - A. Something excited my suspicion, in consequence of which I enquired at the Bank, and found the securities were not what I expected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If I understand you right, the first time you saw the receipt it was with one payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was returned afterwards, but you do not take upon yourself to swear it was the same that he had given you before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have employed the prisoner to act as a broker for you, in jobbing of Scrip-receipts and stock? - A. I never employed him to buy any but 2000l. Loyalty-loan.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the Scrip-receipts are marketable in their different stages? - A. I have heard so from the prisoner, never from any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that when the payments are made up full upon the Scrip-receipts that they are full as marketable as stock, and are marketable even when the Stocks are shut? - A. I took this as such from the prisoner, but never made any enquiry of anybody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you understood from Mr. Reeves, or from anybody else, that you could convert the Scrip-receipts into stock? - A. I never made any enquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, from having the possession of Scrip-receipts, that you could convert them into stock at any time? - A. Had they been good, I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Reeves ever induce you, or say any thing to prevent your converting them into stock, during the time you had them? - A. He said, I might as well keep them according to the agreement; his agreement tied me from it.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have done so, and broke your agreement? - A.I might have broke it immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that signature Mr. Johnson's writing? - A. I am satisfied it is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe that you have told us that the first payment is made upon that, and that that first payment is genuine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your recollection sufficient to say so, or do you derive your knowledge from any other source? - A. I derive my knowledge from a comparison with the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the book here? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these Scrip-receipts, before the payments are fully made up, pass in the market? - A. They are negociable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by that, they are negociable after the first payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when the payments are fully made up, I should suppose, they are more negociable than at first, because the security is better? - A. They may be kept in that state, but it so happens, that they are mostly converted into stock.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your experience in such transactions, it may, and does happen, that receipts, with payments partly made up, are convertable into stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are made up, and the stock is shut, are they not marketable, not withstanding the stock is shut? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in point of fact, they are better security, are they not, during the time the stock is shut, than so much stock? - A. The security at that time could not be given in stock when the books are shut; therefore, if receipts of this kind had been made into stock, prior to their shutting, there would have been no opportunity of negociating that stock.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, in fact, when the payments are fully made up, and a person has the possession of them, during the time the stock is shut up, it is more convenient to those persons who with to job? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. If the time had elapsed, and the payments were not made up, they would not have been negociable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have any instances come within your knowledge, where the Act of Parliament forfeits the payment, that they have come into the Alley, and are marketable? - A.Those omissions do sometimes happen, but I did not, myself, know of any being negociated in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the Bank themselves advance money upon it? - A. Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. And what security have they? - A.They take the receipts as a collateral security.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the Bank keep them after the payments are made? - A. There have been instances of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. And after they remain with the Bank, have they been issued out again, and returned to the parties, upon paying the installments? - A.They are always returned to the parties depositing them.</p>
               <p>Q. They may go back again floating into the market? - A. They may.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do not the Bank regularly make the payments when the installment-day comes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, what the gentleman calls getting back floating into the market, is not in blank, but with the payments filled in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes, when there has been an accidental omission, they have been permitted to make it after the day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where it has been made out to be a clear omission? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know an instance in your life, of five different installments being permitted to be made up, after the whole ought to have been made up? - A. Such a thing might have happened before the time of the report being made to the Treasury of the defaulters; but after that, there are no such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180062"/>payments, certainly, for any part, or the whole would have been taken.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing the last to be paid the 26th of October, might the drawer of it have gone and received a year's dividend? - A. He could have received his year's dividend on the 5th of January, 1797.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, supposing it converted into stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When these receipts are paid up in full, is it not optional for the persons who pay them up, to keep them out as long as they please? - A. I know no limitation.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not very often in circulation for a twelvemonth, or two years, after the whole of the payments are made up, before they are made stock of? - A. I believe it may have happened so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I need hardly ask you whether, if the first payment is genuine, that does not give credit to the paper, and to the payments made? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JOHNSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. You were one of the entering clerks of the Bank in the year 1797? - A. I was; I am now one of the cashiers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. As entering clerk of the Bank, do you give security for your situation? - A. All the Bank clerks give security.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Look at the name of Johnson signed to the second receipt of that paper, and tell me if it is your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know to what extent the circulation of Scrip-receipts, in the market, extends-nearly as much as Banknotes? - A. It depends upon the quantity in the market; there are a great number of them circulated in the market.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know Mr. Mullens's handwriting? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is the signature to that his handwriting? - A. I think not; it appears to me not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mullens called. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I propose to ask Mr. Mullens whether it is his signature; he was rejected upon the former trial; I only offer him that the Jury may see we keep nothing back; if he is objected to we shall not call him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I certainly object to him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Did you, after Mr. Reeves was in custody, go to his house, with any of the Bow-street officers, and search it? - A. I did; and found these Scrip receipts in a bureau. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the amount of them is? - A.Something more than 28 or 29000l. all of them have the first payments only made up genuine, the rest are all blank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Aslee.) Q.Look at these Scrip-receipts? - A. They are all genuine, and are receipts for the first payment only.</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. I found them in October 1797.</p>
               <p>Q. Then those payments, which were not made, were all forfeited? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. KAYE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I attended on the 30th of October, 1797, when Mr. Reeves was examined upon the subject of those receipts that had been passed to Mr. Parry, there were two receipts produced, the one stated in this indictment, and another, I pressed him very much to know from whom he had received them; his answer was, he did not know, he had got no entry, or account of it; he stated his having paid a continuation interest to Mr. Parry, from the November preceding, up to October, about eleven months, amounting to from twenty to thirty per cent. according to the different settlements that had been made.</p>
               <p>Q.Did that statement, that he had paid a continuation interest, lead you to put any question to him? - A. I said, you being a clerk in the Bank, and a Stock-broker, must know, that in 1797, you could have carried these Scrip-receipts and paid them into the Bank as stock, at any hour; he said, he knew that; I said, and that you would then have been entitled to have received a year's dividend upon them; he said, yes; I then said, what could be your inducement to pay from twenty to thirty per cent continuation interest, when you could have turned these receipts into stock, and sold them for the money you borrowed, and you would have had a year's interest in addition; he said, he had no inducement, and seemed very much agitated; I repeated it several times, half-a-dozen times, I suppose, and he repeated four or five times the same answers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You pressed him very strongly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hold out any inducement to him to say what he did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any threat? - A. No.(The receept is read).</p>

               <p>"Entered W. Johnson."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, It seems to me that there is an objection in this case, which must be fatal to it. Your Lordships observe this is an Act, the title of which is, for raising a sum of seven million and a half by way of Annuities, and it states that that Act passed the legislature on the 14th of May, 1796. Now it appears upon the face of this instrument, that the only date there is to be found, is the 26th of April, 1796. It seems to me, my Lord, that that is a payment made before the passing of the Act of Parliament, which creates a punishment upon any person who shall be found guilty of forging an instrument of this sort, and therefore cannot be a felony and forgery by this Act of Parliament. Neither the indictment, nor the instrument itself, bears any other date than the 26th of April, your Lordship will therefore be bound to see, whether, in this case, you can have reference to this Act of Parliament upon which the indictment is founded.</p>

               <p>My Lords, your Lordships would probably ask me why I presume the 26th of April was the date as appropriate to the second payment, or the third payment, or any other payment, stated upon the instrument itself. It is not for me to contend, that your Lordship is bound down by the 26th of April, but it seems to me, that it is quite sufficient for me to contend, that if there be no date upon the face of the thing, as applicable to any of the receipts, so stated upon that paper-writing, your Lordships will not presume a date against the prisoner at the bar, unless you feel yourselves bound so to do.</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. This is for uttering, now the uttering was long since that day in May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I was aware your Lordship would see that. But does your Lordship think you can go out of the record itself, and out of the thing itself, as it is stated upon the paper-writing, and let in parole-testimony to explain that writing; or is not your Lordship of opinion, that it must appear distinctly upon the face of the writing itself, and cannot derive any assistance from any parole testimony which may be given upon the occasion. With respect to Forgeries, I apprehend, wherever a date is stated upon the record, and the instrument is stated to be forged, it is for my learned friend to shew that that forgery was committed upon the day stated in the indictment, and in the instrument itself. I trust, that in this case, if there is in any date appearing upon it, your Lordship will have resort to that date, and will not feel inclined to be assisted by any evidence of a parole nature.(Mr. Raine said a few words on the same side.)</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. If an indictment states an instrument of any date, the instrument produced must correspond with it; but there can be no doubt that a forgery may be committed upon an instrument which has no date, and if it appears that this was uttered after the time of the passing of the Act, does not that do away the objection? - I see nothing at all in the objection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(To Aslee) Prior to the date of the Act, were there not receipts for the Loan of seven millions and a half issued by the Bank - cannot the whole of the payments be made at one time? - A.Certainly they can. But in that case, the mode of giving the receipt is different. Supposing any gentleman had come between the day of the deposit and the 26th of May to make a payment in full, the lower parts would have been scratched through, and the whole amount then paid would have been written.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To make it agreeable to the Act? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. I humbly crave leave to say a few words. My Lord, I have known Mr. Parry a considerable time, and transacted a great deal of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180064"/>business for him. My Lord, the receipts that I gave Mr. Parry I took in the common course of business from the Stock Exchange; I will bring gentlemen from the Stock Exchange, to shew that Scrip-receipts are taken without taking any notice of them. Mr. Parry attended almost every day for a twelve-month before this took place; he always found me in business; I was not a day from the Bank, and if I had been guilty of the crime of forgery, or of uttering, knowing to be forged, is it possible for you, my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, to suppose that I should have continued in my situation at the Bank? I hope, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, before you give a verdict, before you consign a fellow creature to the grave, I hope you will pause well, and consider, before you find me guilty of such a crime. There is no proof of any thing of the kind; and, if I had been guilty, is it possible to suppose, I should have been found attending my business, even to the very minute that I was apprehended? These receipts go as current as Bank-notes at the Stock Exchange. Mr. Parry was attending there himself every day, and knew as much of the business as I did myself. I now throw myself upon the mercy of your Lordship and the Jury, humbly craving that, through God Almighty's power, I shall receive a verdict of not guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Mr. Kaye.) I believe Mr. Reeves was, in point of fact, sent for to the Bank, and came when he was sent for? - A. He came with the person who went for him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stock broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the traffic of Scrip in the market? - A.Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you been a broker? - A. Between thirty and forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the business of purchasing Scrip in the market, and selling it, requires a great deal of expedition? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the office open? - A. From ten o'clock till half past three.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing that is done, is done in a very great hurry and confusion? - A. Yes, very much so indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a person might keep a regular account of the Scrip he bought or sold on a particular day? - A. I do not. I mix them all together, take them to the banker's, and there deposit them, without taking any account of the numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Reeves? - A.Seven or eight years; I remember him when he was a clerk in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character for honesty? - A. I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You do not take the numbers so that you know that you have No. 3, from such a one, and No.6, from such a one? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you keep no account at all? - A. I take an account of the thousands, but not of the numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if you had bought of me, upon any given day, 1000l. or 10,000l. Scrip, you would have been able to say, I bought 10,000l. of Mr. Garrow on Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whether it was No. 6, No.7, or No.8, you could not tell; but the amount, and who you bought it of, you would know? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, you sometimes borrow money, and borrow stock, upon the deposit of Scrip - do you ever do that? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have any difficulty, in that case, to name your principal? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose I say, Mr. Johnson, be so good as borrow me 10,000l. upon these Scrip-receipts; you go to your banker, deposit them, and get 10,000l. a month; afterwards, if the banker wanted to know who your principal was, you could tell him? - A. I should tell him he had no business with it.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose he did say so; supposing, for the end of public justice, it was necessary that you should, you would have no difficulty in knowing who your principle was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your books would tell it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these transactions conducted with any degree of hurry and bustle? - A. A wonderful deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, it is not easy to keep a regular account of such transactions? - A. I think it impossible</p>
               <p>Q. Are they easy negociable securities? - A. Perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they are negociable when the Stocks are shut? - A.They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, they are a more marketable commodity than the transfer of stock? - A. Certainly; because we cannot get stock when the Stocks are shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known any error creep into these transactions, in consequence of hurry and bustle? - A. I have, sometimes, bought Scrip where I had bought four papers, and only three have appeared.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these receipts negociable when all the payments are made up? - A. They are.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Do jobbers keep books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Possibly those books contain an account of purchases and sales? - A. In my book I take an account of the transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. If you buy, you record that; if you sell, you record that? - A. If it is for a future day I put the sum and the name.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had bought 10,000l. stock, could you not have told the next day who you had it of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it to be a common thing to keep Scrip-receipts, upon which the full payments have been made, floating in the market? - A. It is very frequently the case.</p>
               <p>Q. For many months? - A. I have never kept them so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever kept them so long as to lose a great deal of money by not having a dividend? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you possibly suppose an inducement for any man to do that if the receipt is genuine? - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. They are particularly marketable when the Stocks are shut? - A.They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known instances of these Scripreceipts being negociated after all the payments are made? - A. Yes, long.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. I cannot say the precise time, but for a considerable time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at all acquainted with the prisoner? - A. I have known him five or six years, he has always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q.You do not keep an accurate account of the numbers and dates, but you have no difficulty in stating to the amount of every purchase you make upon every given day? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>- ATKINS sworn. - I saw the prisoner and two men in the evening of the 15th of February; the first time I saw them, I heard them whistle, and I saw three men looking in at my window; the prisoner was one of them; they all appeared to be like soldiers, but it was dark; I went a little further and watched them; they looked in at several shops; I followed them up to Briggs's shop, and Eamer went in first, one of the others followed him, and took the basket out over his head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to have some tobacco; I know nothing of the man that took the basket.</p>

             sworn. - On the 19th of March, between four and five in the afternoon, I was passing along <placeName id="t17980418-74-crimeloc391">Little St. Martin's lane</placeName>

                        targets="t17980418-74-off389 t17980418-74-crimeloc391"/>, when the prisoner at the bar came up, and accosted me with how do you do, and he said he knew me; I was surprised at it, I told him, he was quite a stranger to me, and that I knew nothing of him; he persisted that I did; and I still told him, that I did not; he asked me for something to drink; I told him, as a stranger, I could not think of giving him any thing to drink; he persisted in my giving him something to drink, and forced me away to a gin or liquor shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by forcing away? - A. He took me against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. But how against your will? - A. It was against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any struggle? - A. I cannot say I did make any struggle, but it was against my will to go; there was him and several others; when I came there, we went into the house, and he called for half a pint of rum; he produced the rum, and drank some of it himself, and some he gave to those people that were in company with him, there were three or four more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they soldiers? - A. Yes. He insisted upon my paying for the rum, for which I paid one shilling; upon which I changed a seven shilling piece, out of which I had two half crowns and a shilling, besides paying a shilling for the rum. When we left that place, I meant to go about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A.Not longer than the liquor was drank. When I came came out, he still persisted in detaining me, and laid hold of me, and persisted in having something more to drink; upon his persisting very violently that he would have something more to drink out of the change I had received, I gave him half a crown, and the other half crown he forced out of my hand; upon that being accomplished, he insisted upon having two guineas more from me; I was very much surprised, and asked him for what; and he insinuated that I knew for what; I told him, I was at a loss to know what he meant, as I was a stranger, and unacquainted with him; then he persisted upon my going to another house, and forced me away to another house, called the Cart-and-Horses, in Little St. Martin's lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the other people with him all the time? - A.They were. When we came there, he forced me into a box to sit down, and called for a pen and ink and some paper; he then insisted upon my writing an order for two guineas; I told him I would not, and persisted in it; after this, he rifled my pockets of a pocket handkerchief, a pair of spectacles, and an eye-glass, a small pen-knife and a muslin handkerchief; I called out, was I to be robbed and murdered? he then knocked me down upon the bench, I was then upon my legs; after this I had occasion to go into the yard to make water, and he forced me into the necessary, and there he unbuttoned my coat and waistcoat, and turned out my pockets; still the others were with him, and in the street also; and, at the time my pockets were rifled, two or three of them stood to screen him while he was doing it. After he had ransacked my pockets and undone my clothes, he suffered me to come out; he swore he would split my scull and beat out my brains, if I did not give him two guineas. After this, I was forced back into the box from whence I came, in the room, where he told me, after being there but a short space of time, he would take my hat, my shirt and my boots, which I had on at that time. While this happened, a person whom I knew nothing of who happened to be in the room, went to Bow-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180070"/>street, and gave information there, and they quickly came to my assistance, or else I no not know what would have been the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the violence was committed upon you in the street, was there any body about? - A. It had rained a little, and there were very few people about; I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all? - A. I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What may you be? - A. I live with Mr. Packhurst, at Maidstone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you live there now? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you his servant? - A. Yes; butler and valet. I have now lodgings in St. Martin's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the gin-shop you speak of? - A. Somewhere in that neighbourhood, but I cannot say the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in London before? - A. Yes, I have, at various times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you lived in London before? - A. Six months and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live then? - A. With the present Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a servant of the Lord-Mayor's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you discharged by him? - A. Yes. I was his Lordship's man and butler.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character from his Lordship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 19th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and was pretty light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. St. Martin's lane is a very great thoroughfare, is it not? - A. I have been so little there, that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You pass through it every day, do not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you pass through it that day? - A. I was going to Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Hall, who is an evidence here? - A. I was at St. James's, I went to see the King, and Hall made way for me to stand; and I asked him to drink some beer for his civility, and that is all I know of him, except that he was amongst these people at the time this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said there was nobody there at all that you knew? - A. I was so flurried I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that Hall is a soldier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you happened to take a liking to him, and treated him? - A. It was for his civility, it was in a room with a great many people.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to a public-house with him? - A. Yes, in the public tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the Bow-street officers there? - A. I did not know who they were when they came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with them about this business? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, has no one told you that putting in fear, and using force, would maintain an indictment for a highway robbery? - A. I do not want any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to treat this man at the gin-shop? - A. Yes; they forced me to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not a number of people in the public street at that time? - A. There might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord of the liquor-shop? - A. There was a little old woman that could hardly walk.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some rum, which the prisoner paid for? - A. No; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you got to the public-house, make a complaint to the mistress of the house? - A. No; but I called out, and said, was I to be robbed and murdered; there was only the woman of the house there, and another woman, which I believe was the prisoner's wife, and a man that went for the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Hall here? - A. No; he attended at Bow-street, and Sir William Addington said there was no occasion for his attendance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you meet a number of people from the gin shop to the public-house, to whom you could have told your story, and complained of what had been done to you? - A. I was so much alarmed that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not in your power to have complained, and had him apprehended? - A. I could have got away from one, but not from three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not, at that time, by calling to the passengers, have extricated yourself? - A. I suppose my fright was the cause of my not doing it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many men were there altogether? - A. Three or four, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them was a friend of your's, who went to Bow-street? - A. No; he was a man that came promiscuously into the tap-room while this disagreeable business was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a soldier? - A. I believe he was, by his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many where there in the public-house? - A.Four, besides the prisoner and the man who went for the officer, he took no notice, but upon hearing me cry out, was I to be robbed, he went away without anybody knowing it, for the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were five altogether? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of whom went for the officers, and another of them was Hall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to say that you could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180071"/>have extricated yourself in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect a reward of forty pounds, now, if this man is convicted? - A. I have heard of such a thing, but I never was in any trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect a share of that reward? - A. I have no expectation of any thing but justice.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an Excise-officer: On the 25th of September I was stationed near Ashford, in the county of Kent; I know the prisoner perfectly well, and he knew me. On the 23d of September, 1795, in consequence of an information I had received, I went to <placeName id="t17980418-78-crimeloc407">Newchurch in Kent</placeName>

                        targets="t17980418-78-off404 t17980418-78-crimeloc407"/>; I called upon Mr. Thomas Hayward, an officer of Excise, to assist me; we saw a large quantity of unmanufactured tabacco in a cart; I cut open one of the bags, and found it was tobacco; the cart passed me about one in the morning of the 26th; it was a moon-light night; I told Hayward that we should seize it; Mr. Hayward rode the fore horse of the cart, while I went behind, and took a sample from the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of bags were they? - A.Bags about forty pounds weight, the usual bags that are used by smugglers in conveying tobacco. When I rode up, Hayward told me that Hart was taking the reins from the shaft horse; I immediately rode round to prevent him from so doing; a scussle then ensued between us, in which I threw Hart into the hedge; he then sprung from the hedge, and caught me by the collar of the coat, drove me from the horse, and called Waddell to his assistance, and they both fell upon me, and beat me with their sifts; Hart sat upon me, and got his hand twisted in my neck-handkerchief; in that situation I remained insensible, and on recovering myself, I found Hart sitting upon me, with a large drawn knife, he swore that the goods and horses were not given up, and he would murder me. Waddell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180074"/>came back some time after, with the cart and horses, and they went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any fire-arms used? - A.Hayward said he had discharged his pistol, but that was while I was insensible.</p>
               <p>Q. What rendered you insensible? - A. He strangled him by the neck-handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the treatment you had received, were you at all ill? - A. I was not able to do my business for a month; I went to a public-house, and called the people up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not frequently seen him since? - A.Once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he has not been out of the way? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no resistance, till you made an attack upon him? - A. I made an attack to prevent his unharnessing the horse from the cart, and he held a stick to keep me off.</p>
               <p>Q. You were armed, I believe, with a cutlass? - A. Yes, and pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no arms? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have seen him since - have you seen him in such a situation as that you dared to take him? - A. One of the times we went to his house to take him, and he went away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an Excise-officer: I was with Mr. Walton on the night of the 25th of September, 1795; I knew the prisoner before, and he knew me; I staid in the field with the horses; Mr. Walton laid under the hedge, to watch the cart coming; Mr. Walton came to me, and told me the cart was gone by; we went after it; Mr. Walton went behind, and called to me, seize the horses and the cart, for it is loaded with tobacco; I seized it, and Hart was endeavouring to unharness the horse; I called to Mr. Walton, and almost directly Mr. Walton called out for help; I went up, and Waddell and Hart were both upon him; I told them if they did not leave off, I should be under the necessity of firing upon them; Hart said, d-n your eyes and limbs, fire and be d-d, for we have fire-arms as well as you; I then fired, and shot Hart in the hip; upon that Waddell came up to me with a pistol, and snapped it at me; he had a cutlass, which I supposed was taken from Mr. Walton; he said, d-n your eyes, we will soon settle you. Finding we could not do any thing, we gave it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards called out to Mr. Walton? - A. Yes, several times, but he did not answer; I thought he had been dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. At the time you were almost overpowered, Hart was not with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Walton strike him with a cutlass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You fired at Hart, and hit him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very near him, were not you? - A.It is very little distance from him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. In the night of the 2d of July, 1790, I went with Mr. Taylor to make a seizure, in consequence of an information; we were to meet two other officers, in the fields between <placeName id="t17980418-79-crimeloc413">Camberwell</placeName>

I said to Taylor, here they are coming, now we want our companions, but we must do our endeavours to take them if we can; I was laying beside a gatepost, and I jumped up and caught Hart's horse by the bridle; I told him we were officers, knew him perfectly well, and should seize his horses and his tobacco; he then said, d-n your eyes, you are officers are you, you b-s, come up here, and we will give it them, says he, speaking to his boy. Mr. Taylor took hold of the horse's halter that he was leading, and I struck at Hart with my stick; by striking at Hart, I got the bridle into my own possession; I hit him again, over the knee, with my stick, and told him to get off; the boy then coming up to his assistance, struck me on the head, and nearly knocked me down, with a large loaded whip; Hart then cut at me several times with his whip, and as I recovered again, I called to Taylor to help me to get him off the horse; Taylor came up, and fired his pistol at him, behind him; now, you b-s, catch me if you can, says he, and set spurs to his horse, and rode away with one horse, and the boy with the other, leaving one horse and five bags of tobacco in my possession; we then came across the fields, to go to Kennington Common, and then Hart and the boy met us again, with their horses unloaded, and said, now you b-s,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180075"/>we have you, and swore at us very much; I told him, if he advanced a step further I would shoot him. Taylor was leading the horse, Hart and the boy turned about and rode off, the boy went down by the brick-fields, and Hart went back again; I pursued the boy, the horse with the bags we had tied up to the pales; while I was pursuing the boy, Hart came and cut the bridle, and got the loaded horse away from us; I pursued the boy, he jumped off his horse, and we seized it.</p>

               <p>Q. He had no fire-arms? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Bird go to Annis's house with Chambers? - A. No; Wolse was waiting for him to receive the sugars; he was in at Annis's house waiting to sell the sugar; they were never in the house five minutes before they were carried out by a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Wolse received them, and not Annis? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When was Bird taken up? - A. I took him up when there was opportunity for it, I believe it was in November.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear he was taken up before January? - A. It might be January, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in November was it you gave this information? - A. I believe it was the 22d of November.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not call you an informer or a stag in that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not pull his hat off, and he called you an informer of a stag? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. We did not get a warrant because we would not give any alarm; Mr. Colquhoun's office was full of gentlemen about other business.</p>

               <p>Q.What was Flowers doing with the other men? - A. I was intrusted with the key of the premises of Mr. Wade, and upon my putting the key to the door, it was opened for me; I then said to Flowers, what pretty works are going on here; he told me to hold my tongue; I told him I should not, as I thought it was very cruel for such proceedings to be going on and Mr. Wade to know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that was going on? - A. I saw, on entering the premises, several bags, I saw in one of the bags sugar; I said, I thought Mr. Wade was liable to be exchequered for the things being upon his premises; he told me there was no fear, he could cover it in half an hour; I unscrewed the first shutter of the window with an intention to take the shop-shutters down; he said, not to take them down; I told him I should, as I would not be hindered from my business by any person; on recollecting myself, I thought some person going by might recollect this sugar on the premises, it might be seized, and the expences fall upon Mr. Wade, and I did not take the shutters down till they had taken them to Coulthurst's, which is very nearly opposite; I saw some of the bags taken there, I cannot say that I saw them all taken to Coulthurst's.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe who received them at Coulthurst's house? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Coulthurst's house was open? - A. They went in at the front-door from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during any part of the transaction, happen to see Coulthurst himself? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the time you saw Coulthurst's door open, was it at a time when the shop was open for the fair conduct of the business? - A. No; it was about five o'clock in the morning, it was not quite day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember there being any thing to drink? - A. Yes; during the interval, Flowers said to Marshall, make another pot of grog, which Marshall did, and offered it to me; I said, no, I should not drink grog at five o'clock in the morning; Spicer was outside of the door, and it was given to him; Flowers, and some one, returned afterwards for their hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since this took place? - A. In September, six or seven months back.</p>
               <p>Q. I take for granted, as you had seen this transaction yourself, you immediately gave information to a Magistrate? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you went to the Magistrate? - A. Not till February.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not go voluntarily? - A. Yes I did; I understood there was a summons, but I did not receive it.</p>

            , and William Turtle, come from the Bushey Park in Flower's own boat, with several bags, they rowed under Mr. Wade's, the block-maker's wharf; I put my sculls into my boat, and, as if I was going to work, I went into my boat, and rowed round the tiers, and staid there sometime, to the amount of half an hour; I saw Flowers, Lediard, and Turtle, go out of Flowers's boat, that they had the sugar the first time in Turtle's boat; then they went to the Bushey Park again along side the starboard quarter, Flowers went out of the boat, Lediard and Turtle staid in her; then Flowers came out of the Bushey Park over the lighter into his boat, and there he received the bags of sugar from the others as they handed them out; then they rowed round Mr. Wade's wharf as far as they could, they took a bench out Charley Faulkner's boat and put it on the mud for them to walk upon, and carried the bags up upon their backs to Mr. Wade's wharf again. Then I rowed my boat to Mr. Forrester's, a boat-builder, and made her fast to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Wade's and Coulthurst's? - A. I suppose about thirty or forty yards; Mr. Coulthurst's is about seven or eight yards from Mr. Wade's, just across the way. While I was standing at Mr. Forrester's, I saw nothing, I only heard doors open and shut; I then walked up towards the watchman's box and back again, and then I saw, to the best of my knowledge, young Marshall open Mr. Wade's door; as soon as Mr. Wade's door was open, Mr. Coulthurst came and opened his own door, I knew him perfectly well; I saw Lediard come out with a bag of sugar, and Turtle followed with another; then I walked back as far as Wapping New-Stairs again; as I was coming, I met Wilkie, a watchman. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I saw the same happen again, Lediard and Turtle, each of them, took a bag of sugar into Coulthurst's house: in about ten minutes I saw Flowers, with a brown jacket on, go into Coulthurst's.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he any bag? - A. No. Then I looked through the key-hole and saw them weighing sugar. About seven o'clock in the morning, Turtle was washing one of his boats, and I was washing mine, I went up to Flowers's own boat, the boat he came first ashore in, and in Flowers's boat I took up almost a handful of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of sugar do you think there might be? - A. I suppose about three quarters of a hundred in each bag; I suppose about two tons altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You heard all that was stated by the Counsel to the Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him desire you to go out, I dare say? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180083"/>Q. You say this was about the 30th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you had had a quarrel with Flowers? - A. I had not had a quarrel with Flowers for eight or nine years to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a thing you cannot have forgot; to the best of your recollection, you have had no quarrel with Flowers for eight or nine years? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the 30th of October had any misfortune happened to your boat? - A. My boat was stove in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a member of the boat club? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to the club to make good your loss upon your boat being stove? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Flowers and others object to that? - A. I do not know but what he might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he or did he not? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Upon your oath, in consequence of his objecting, did not the club refuse to reimburse your loss, upon the ground that it was wilfully done? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you claim? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect? - A.Nothing; I expected the boat-builder was to be paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious how you answer my next question-upon your oath, upon that refusal of the club, at the desire of Flowers, the prisoner, did not you state that you would be revenged of him for that act? - A. No such thing; I know Flowers to be a very bad man.</p>
               <p>Q. You never expressed any resentment against him for advising the club not to make good your loss? - A. I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it positively? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made use of any expression of resentment at him, on account of the club's refusing you? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is Coulthurst's to the watchman? - A. About that distance that you could shoot a marble into it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him, doubtless, what was going forward, and desired him to watch these people? - A. No, we had no conversation at all, only how do you do, and how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew all these people perfectly well, not only by sight, but by name? - A.Very few of them but what I have taken goods for.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this 30th of October, had you any occasion to go to Mr. Staples's office? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of a week? - A. I cannot say, it might be the 2d of November, I dare say it was somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you believe you gave any information at Mr. Staples's office on the 2d of November? - A. I went as soon as I acquainted the West-India merchants of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these gentlemen, and tell me, upon your oath, if you gave any information in any part of the month of November? - A. I gave information at Mr. Staples's as soon as ever I spoke to my friends, and Mr. Coome came about it; I did not retain such matters as them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you give any information even in the month of December? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you gave any information even before Christmas? - A. Yes, I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did before Christmas? - A. These are matters I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I must strike out before Christmas? - A. I do not know about striking out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you believe you gave any information before New-year's day? - A. Yes, I do, I made no memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you believe you did? - A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that you did before the 13th of January? - A. I will, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Take your time and consider? - A. I cannot consider.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you venture to swear, that during any part of the month of January, you gave information? - A. I think I did, the 2d of January, and they were apprehended on the 22d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent that you gave information three weeks before they were apprehended? - A.They were not in the way to be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some other persons examined before either Flowers or Coulthurst were taken into custody? - A.There were.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you converse with him? - A. I told him, at the door of the public-house, he had better go about his business, or I should have something against him before it was long; Coulthurst was in custody then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him the first time? - A. No, it was the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the 30th of October, that you said you should have something against him soon? - A. It might be so.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you communicate Flowers's name, as the person that you had seen stealing sugar, to the West-India merchants? - A. About a fortnight or three weeks after it happened; on the 30th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the name of any of the West-India merchants to whom you communicated Flowers's name, as the man you had seen stealing sugar from the Bushey Park, in a fortnight or three weeks after the 30th of October? - A. Mr. Batchelor, who sits there.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw him at the office, after the 30th of October, how often might you see him at large? - A.Very seldom.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180085"/>Q. Once a week? - A. Once a day, or so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the 30th of October, till the 2d of January? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Both before and after you had communicated all you knew to the West-India merchants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the West India merchants attend the examinations before the Magistrate? - A. Some of them did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen him at the common plying-place daily? - A. I have seen him daily.</p>
               <p>Q. At the plying-place? - A. Yes; but I never saw him at work.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make application to the club for the repairing of your boat? - A. The first Tuesday of the quarter before last.</p>
               <p>Q. The first Tuesday in December? - A. No; the first Tuesday after Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a Custom-house officer, are you not? - A. I am not now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you ceased to be so? - A. Ever since the 25th of last August.</p>
               <p>Q. You were tired of it, and resigned, I suppose? - A. No; I was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is not an impertinent question, may I ask what it was you were turned out for? - A. I was turned out for another officer and me having a few words together.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it might be this, for charging a man with a felony that he was not guilty of? - A. I do not know what I charged him with; I never charged him with any thing; I seized a bag of sugar, and a bag of coffee, and because I laid him before the Board, he laid me before the Board for bad language.</p>

               <p>Flowers's defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge, it is a malicious piece of business; Branham and I have been at variance several years, and have fought several times publicly, entirely owing to a quarrel at the club; I was steward of the club; a few days before we called a meeting of the club, and took his name out, because he was such a bad fellow, and it broke up the club.

The premises that he says the sugar came through, were locked up for a month before; he is a very bad man.</p>

               <p>Q. Mostly plying at these Stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity ever to look at this boat that was stove? - A. No; I had no right.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that Branham seized a boat of a son of your's? - A. Yes; he was an apprentice of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. And the boat was seized? - A. Yes; but I lost nothing by it, the captain paid me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any bags seized on board the ship by you, or other officers? - A. None by me; some officers came on board rummaging the ship; for these men, the lumpers, are very apt to stow away little bags till they can get an opportunity of taking them out of the ship without our seeing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Flowers on board the ship all the time? - A. Never; nor in a boat.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, was there not an entry made in your own book, of the seizure of bags of sugar that had been stolen in the Bushey Park? - A. I did not know it till they were brought up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that the ship was not plundered at all? - A. I think not; unless these lumpers might put some by in bags, or stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. And these Jumpers might also chuck them over into a boat without your observing them? - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any lamp near where you were robbed? - A. Yes, directly where I was robbed; the prisoner did not speak to me till she took hold of my arm; the money was in the same pocket-book with the notes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long might this be going on? - A. Not above a minute or two; when she was found again in Cheapside she was somewhat different in dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her face distinctly? - A. Yes; she was searched immediately, but no property found, none of it has been since found; when I challenged her with it, she said something, but I do not recollect what.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, knowing this to be a capital charge, that the prisoner is the woman? - A. I can do it with the greatest safety.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the change of her dress? - A. She had a large fur tippet round her neck when she was taken, I cannot say whether she had a cloak on or not.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been out of place? - A. Near six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been looking for a place lately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you were paid your wages when you came away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. May I take the liberty of asking how much you received? - A. About ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Your loss, upon this occasion, is about seventeen pounds, seven shillings? - A. Yes; I believe it is more.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of the ward and inspector of the watch: About ten or a little after ten on the Easter Sunday at night, the prosecutor came to the watch-house, and said, that he had been accosted violently and against his will, that he had been taken by the arm by a woman, then named Appleby, that she shoved him against the wall, and he could not extricate himself till he had lost his pocket-book, and then she got off. I then went to the watchman who stands at the end of Bread-street, and asked him if he had seen her; in consequence of what he said, I went down Cheapside, but could not see her; coming back again, I saw some women the corner of Milk-street, the first person I laid hold of was this Mrs. Appleby.</p>
               <p>Q.Who do you mean by Mrs. Appleby? - A.The prisoner at the bar. I said to her, Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180090"/>Appleby, how do you do, there is a gentleman across the way would be glad to speak to you; she was rather backward of going, and the watchman and prosecutor being together, I beckoned them over; accordingly they came across, and I said, is this the woman, and he said, that was absolutely the woman that robbed him; accordingly we took her to the watch-house, in order to search her, but we found nothing upon her but a shilling and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. She was found in Cheapside, the place where the robbery was committed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he say that there was a difference in her dress? - A. Yes; and so said the watchman, that when she went past him before, she had not that tippet on. He was perfectly sober.</p>

             sworn. - I went on the Sunday night, with Mr. Lord, to the prisoner's house; I saw the prisoner there, and two young men, sitting by the fire; I verily believe one of them was Foreman; I would not undertake to swear it; it was rather dark; and the next day I went to apprehend Mr. Disney; he kept an Agency-office, next door to the Bow-street office; he left his house, and I could not find him for some weeks after that; I saw Foreman afterwards, but I cannot positively say whether he was one of those two men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(To Chandler.) Do you not know, of your own knowledge, that Mr. Lord committed wilful and corrupt perjury upon the trial of Foreman? - A. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lord say that he should get 40l. out of his 53l. if Foreman was convicted; and he would swear hard to convict him? - A. I have heard him say, if he was convicted, he should get 40l. out of his 53l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lord say that he would not have taken me up, if he had not known that I had had some property, and that he expected to get his money back and 40l. more, and he would not appear against me? - A. No; I have heard him say, that if you were taken up, he thought he should get his money, for that you had money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard him say, he would swear hard against me, for if he did not convict me, he expected I should prosecute him for perjury? - A. I have heard something of that sort; but I do not exactly recollect the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that Mr. Lord came to me, and wished me to apply to Mr. Read, a sadler, upon the business? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he said that he would not have taken me up, but he expected, upon my being taken up, that I should have paid the money? - A. He said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180093"/>he thought you would pay the money, rather than suffer yourself to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lord write a sheet of paper of a false paper writing, and read it to you, to strengthen his evidence? - A. I remember the writing very well; he said that was what he should swear in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not heard Lord say that Wilson was the man that robbed him? - A. Yes; we went to Mr. Bond to take out a warrant for Wilson, but there were three of them together at the time he was robbed, and Mr. Lord did not know any of them except Wilson.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Disney? - A. I had not known him before he came to Mr. Lord, about that business.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been upon any sooting of intimacy with him since that? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever talked the case over with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever suggest to him, at all, what you could say upon the subject? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner had no knowledge of the manner in which you would answer these multitude of questions that he has put to you? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Lord. Mr. Chandler has been arrested, and there has been a communication between him and Disney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This prosecution is commenced against me for the purpose of extorting money from me, that I would not by any means comply with; I knew I was not guilty of the charge alledged against me, I am conscious Foreman was never at my house after the robbery, they had frequently applied to me to settle it; when they enquired of me for Foreman, I said, I would do all I could to find him out; it must strike every body, when they recollect the public situation in which I lived, next door to the Public-office, Bow-street; the father of Henry Foreman formerly kept the Brown-bear, and being known to all the officers, is it reasonable to suppose he would come into such a situation as that; in fact, he never did come into my house after that.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FOREMAN sworn. - I keep the Gold-chain in the Tower; Mr. Lord came to me to compound felony, with respect to

            , my nephew, I was examined here when he was tried; they wanted me to give them fifteen pounds, they then left me, and said, they should proceed to prosecute him; and, on the Sunday after, Mr. Lord came again, with Kennedy; he first asked me twenty-five pounds -</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Disney? - A. I knew nothing of him till that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Chandler before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. - MORRIS sworn. - Mr. Lord called upon Mrs. Wilson, in Maiden-lane, the day of the robbery, and said, that he had lost his property; he called several times that day, and he has repeatedly called upon me since, at my house in Wardour-street, he got me to write into the country to his friends to get them to settle it; he told me, if Wilson would come forward with the pocket-book, he would go no farther in it, but think it was a drunken frolic. <rs id="t17980418-94-verdict499" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did she say any thing else? - A. No; when Mr. Kelly came home, he went to the Justice's directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Kelly bring the things away with her from Mrs. Jones's? - A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where was the petticoat that she said she had got? - A. In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might have seen it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was admitted to bail, was not she? - A. No; she was fully committed to jail at first.</p>
               <p>Q. But when the matter was fully heard, the Justice admitted her to bail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, you know, that she surrendered herself here this morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Underhill's defence. This young man, and young woman, do not know any thing at all of it; I found the things in an open court, and took them into the room where this young man and woman lived.</p>
               <p>Doe's defence. I sold the handkerchief to Mrs. Jones, and told her it was not my own, it did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Caslin's defence. Underhill brought these things to my room, and asked me to let him leave them in my room, and if I would sell the petticoat for him, which I did, for one shilling, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. I bought these things, and, to my judgement, I gave the full value for them; I gave one shilling for the petticoat and pin-afore.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Kelly.) What did Caslin say when you went into her room? - A. She said, the little boy, Underhill, brought them in to her for pieces for a shift.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What do you think the pinafore is worth? - A.Five pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the petticoat? - A.Eight pence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jones called nine witnesses, who had known her from six months to twenty-three years, and gave her an excellent character.</p>

             sworn. - I am watchman and constable of the night for Kensington: Between two and three in the morning of Tuesday, the 27th of March, I saw the prisoner cut the rope, and the basket dropped, he then took it on his shoulder and carried it ten or twelve yards; I took it from him, and pursued him; I never lost sight of him till I secured him; there were eight fowls and three rabbits in the basket, all alive; this is the basket.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Walkling.) Are you responsible for these fowls? - A. They were my own, I bought them to bring up to London for sale. This is my basket.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a watch-house keeper: I heard Williams call out for help; I came up to his assistance, and he beat me about very much; when I got him just to the door of the watch-house, I had got the door open, he pulled out a knife, and said, he would cut the first bloody thief's arm off that attempted to shut the door. I found a crow that had dropped from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The first time I saw those fowls was upon William's shoulder; he told me the fowls had been cut from a waggon, and sent me forward to ask three waggons that had gone past whether they were their's or not; and two of them said, no; and then he laid hold of me, and said I was one of the thieves.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Williams.) Is what you have sworn true? - A.It is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a petrol belonging to Bow-street: On the 4th of this month I heard an alarm in the Strand of stop thief, and I saw a great number of people round the prisoner; I took hold of him, and asked what was the matter, and I was informed he had stole a tub of butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge? - A. No; he said he thought the people were going to murder him, he had not stole any thing; I secured him, and took him to the shop; and Mr. Eastgate said, this one of the men that came into his shop; Mr. Eastgate desired me to take him to Bow-street.</p>

Our court goes into another court; it is not a thorough-fare; the other court is called Bennett's-court. He put this cask of butter off his shoulder upon some gratings which look into a cellar where the water comes in; I let him put the cask of butter down, and let him go by our coal-shed door; I threw down the pan, and ran on tip-toe after him and collared him; my husband came to my assistance; and I said, this is the man that had the cask of butter upon his shoulder; my husband and I held him all the way down the court; he struck me several times, and the mob said we were murdering the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband and you beating him? - A. No; but he struck me several times; my husband let him loose, and then I was obliged to let him go, for I could not hold him; he got away, and when I saw him again, he was in the hands of the patrol; that was in about ten minutes; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish his person? - A. Yes; I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw this man before? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This is a very narrow court? - A. Very narrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps alight? - A. Yes, I think there were.</p>
               <p>Q. And, though he was beating you and your husband, neither you nor your husband struck him at all? - A. Not till he got to the bottom of the court, and then I did over the head, but he got away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him for ten minutes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he was brought back, he was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you knew you should find a man in custody? - A. Yes.</p>

On the 7th -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We must not hear that.</p>
               <p>Newlin. Horribin was taken up, I believe, on the 10th of April; I took him myself in Dyot-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you saw this, you went and informed the master? - A. Yes; I followed him home, and he set the cann at his master's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the kettle? - A. I think it is, but I cannot say; I picked it out from the ranks, where there were a great number of them, and the master said that was the kettle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You describe yourself to be a carpenter-are you a carpenter? - A. Yes; I follow the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you any other business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been employed by Police-officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. Monday morning the 5th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. And when was he taken up? - A. I think the 10th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Five weeks afterwards? - A. Yes; the master wished me to watch to see if he could not catch him with more.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the half-guinea that Pittman gave him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you saw some oil pour out of the nozle of the kettle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that in your first information? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you never thought of it till you found it necessary to prove it was oil? - A. I think I mentioned it to the Magistrate at Bow-street, I know it to be true that it did run out of the nozle of the kettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180098"/>Q. You had seen nothing but the kettle before till that circumstance? - A. I saw it poured twice into the measure, and after that is the cisten.</p>
               <p>Q.And you swear that that is the kettle? - A. I went down to the door of the office, and looked at the kettle, it was marked No. 10.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you saw it marked No. 10 before? - A. No, I will not; I know it by the nose being bruised; the nose being so short that there is no other kettle like it in the whole boiling.</p>
               <p>Mr. knapp. Q. What induced you to watch? - A. The inducement I had to watch was, I had seen several people many times going into this shop with oil in canns, and I have seen the prisoner Horribin go into the shop repeatedly with a cann full of oil.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did your conscience suffer you to see that repeatedly? - A. I stopped till I could not bear it any longer; I was determined to know whether they had any perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear they were full? - A.Apparently, from the weight of their carrying it; I waited till I saw the money was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know why it was worse that time than any time before? - A. I had seen them several times, and that made me watch.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a contractor for lighting lamps, in partnership with Joseph Lucas and Christopher Spencer; the prisoner was our cellar-man, at the lamp-office, in Phoenix-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Pittman's shop? - A. Yes; about 4 or 500 yards from our cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any information from the last witness, respecting your servant Horribin? - A. Yes, on the 5th of March, a little after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any kettle? - A. Yes; Newlin pointed it out.</p>
               <p>Q. you did not apprehend the prisoner till some time after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's duty? - A. To measure the oil; he was among tons and tons where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it possible to miss by your eys two or three gallons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In point of fact, you did miss it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this charge being made, some weeks afterwards, Mr. Pittman surrendered himself, did not he? - A. No; Mr. Bond sent for him.</p>
               <p>Q. But he went without being taken up by a warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of as much oil as that? - A. About five gallons are worth 13s. 6d. the cann holds about five gallons and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if he gave more than half-a-guinea, it was not much under the value? - A. No; it is worth 2s. 8d. a gallon, that is what it cost us; the common price is 3s. 6d. a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. An oilman would not give 3s. 6d. for it? -No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much oil may you have at a time? - A.Sometimes we have 200 tons in the warehouse at a time.</p>
               <p>Horribin's defence. I am innocent of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Pittman's defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Pittman, called six witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuckey. I never had reason to suppose that Horribin had been guilty of any thing of this sort before.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at Bath: On the 19th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I took a coach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180099"/>from Webber-row, St. George's-fields, to <placeName id="t17980418-103-crimeloc559">the Saracen's-head, Snow-hill</placeName>

The prisoner at the bar; I desired him to drive into the yard; he said, it was not allowed; I said, go in, and ask why it is not allowed; he went, and came back, and said, it was not allowed; I desired him to tell the book-keeper to send out a porter or two to take the trunks in; he went into the yard, and brought out two men with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the yard immediately join the street, or is there a passage? - A. There is a sort of lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see whether he went to the bookkeeper's office or not? - A. I could not; he was back in about a minute, with two men; I asked him if these two men were sent out by the bookkeeper or not; he answered they were; are they the porters of the yard, I asked; he said, yes; I handed the trunks out to the coachman to give to these men; after the trunks were delivered to the men; I was taking the number of the coach, 496, and also taking care of the children.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had taken the trunks, did you observe which way they went? - A. I did not; after I had paid the coachman, and taken the number of the coach, I went up the yard; I should tell your Lordship, that when I was going away, I observed a porter's knot in the coach, I did not observe it while I was in the coach; I went up to the coach-office and enquired for my trunks, they were not there; I then went after the coachman, and found him upon the stand at the Old-Bailey; I asked him who those two men where that he brought out-did you see the book-keeper; he said, yes, I went into the coach-office; did you go into the book-keeper's office; he answered, I went into the office and saw the book-keeper, who told him he might bring them himself and be d-d; that he then met the two men to whom he delivered the trunks; I said, how could you tell me that the book-keeper sent out the two porters of the yard; says he, I know nothing about it, you may do as you can; I told him, you must come back to the book-keeper's office, and let the book-keeper see you; the porter and myself went back, and the prisoner followed; but when he came back, he acknowledged that he had not been into the book-keeper's office; he was at that time confronted by the book-keeper; the bookkeeper declared he had not seen him; then he went away; as I knew the number of the coach, I thought he would be easily found; on the Monday morning the prisoner and I were both at the Hatton-Garden office together.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what he said taken in writing? - A. I cannot say, I think not; the prisoner said, there were no boxes put into the coach; and then he said, he saw them put in, but he never saw them taken out; I delivered them out of the coach into his hands, and I have never found them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You gave them into his hands as he gave them into the hands of the two persons that came with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no difficulty in finding him, you went to the nearest stand, not an hundred yards from the Old-Bailey? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the Saracen's-head pretty well, yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that there are two bookkeepers? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there are waggons go from the Saracen's-head as well as coaches? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Haviland coming there in January last? - A. I do, I went with him to find the hackney coachman; we found him in the ranks; that is him at the bar. Mr. Haviland asked him who he had delivered the trunks to, and he said, he had been to the coach-office, and got a porter to fetch them. Mr. Haviland told him there was no luggage brought into the house nor to the coach-office; he said, he had been to the coach-office, and the book-keeper had desired him to bring them up himself, and be d-d; he spoke to Mr. Haviland in a very insolent manner, and he might do what he could.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge; the porter came down the yard, it was late at night and very dark, I did not go into the warehouse, but as soon as I got into the yard, I called out, porters, and two men came; I did not know but they were porters belonging to the yard. The gentleman and the four children, and the porters, all went up the yard together.</p>

               <p>Q. How does the cellar communicate with the house? - A. From the front of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you get into the house by means of the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was it forced open? - A.There ws a large bar, and the padlock forced from the bar, and then by pushing the bar on the one side, any person could go down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put the proprty that you lost over night? - A. All within-side of my desk in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180101"/>shop; part of the guineas were in a bowl, part of them in a paper, and part of them in a bag; the shillings were part in a bag, and part in a bowl; the notes were part in a bowl, and part in a bag; those of them that were in the bowl were inclosed in a paper; there was wrote upon one paper the name of Reynolds; there were Bank-notes and cash in that paper, and there was a draft for 311l. 17s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner the next morning? - A. Yes; and saw him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the desk broke open? - A. Yes, I had the key; the first time I saw the prisoner, was about half past four, in custody of Metcalf, at the watch-house, and there I saw my property upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same property that you had secured the night before in your desk? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. No; I never saw him, that I recollect, till the 5th of April. I am not sure, in the hurry, whether the accompting-house door was broke open or not, but the accompting-house window was thrown up, and I suppose he made his escape that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he make his escape to? - A. He was pursued by the watchman and patrol, and was taken as he was going up Holborn hill.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's: On the 5th of April, in the morning, about a quarter after five, going past the prosecutor's house, I saw the prisoner at the bar stooping at the cellar window of Mr. Clarke's house, I heard the cellar window shut to, I crossed the way and put my hand against the shutter, and found it was open; I kept my eye upon him, and called to a watchman to spring his rattle, which he did. At the end of the King's-arms gateway, he threw down a coarse apron, containing papers of halfpence and penny pieces, one paper contained five guineas worth, I believe; I pursued, and was stopped by the watchman, and when I was stopped, he crossed over directly from Field-lane towards Shoe-lane, and there he was stopped by the St. Andrew's inspector, Howard, and there I lost sight of him in turning the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes. Then I went to let Mr. Clarke know, and he went with me to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it cut through? - A. By means of a centre-bit.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an aperture was it? - A. Large enough to admit an arm in up to the shoulder, because I tried it. Upon looking, I found the most valuable part of my property in the lower window gone; watches, seals, rings, bracelets, and a number of articles stated in the indictment, to the amount of upwards of 200l.; how much more I cannot say; there were seven or eight pair of sugar tongs, I think eight, and there was a silver breast-plate, which I make for the Artillery Company; there were two or three hoop rings, and the settings of some pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you as to those things that are found? - A. Yes, and many other articles. I gave information at Bow-street immediately, but heard nothing for a fortnight; I got my information from the accomplice (Clark, otherwise Lewis); in consequence of which, I went with Armstrong, Harper, Peach, and Wray, to the sign of the Trumpet, in Shire-lane, Temple-bar; I found Clifton and Seaton there; I went in first, and knew them to be the men by the description given me; in consequence of that, the officers put them in a coach and took them to Coldbath-fields; from thence we proceeded to some lodgings in Pinner's-court, Gray's-inn-lane, but they were locked; then we went to other lodgings in Wych-street, Temple-bar; there we found Mrs. Seaton, but no property; we took Mrs. Seaton back with us to Pinner's-court; and there, in a tumbler upon a shelf in the fore room, I found a ring, which I am very sure is mine; in a small trunk in the back room, which is a bed-room, I found a pair of silver sugar-tongs, which are mine, and I am sure were in my house the night previous to the robbery; the next day the prisoners were had up to Worship street and examined; I swore to the property found; I also got a warrant to search the house of one

               <p>Q. Did these people say any thing to you in the course of the night? - A. The tall man spoke to me; he asked me what the coach was standing there for, I told him I was about my business, as I supposed he was about his; my coach was on the stand, within about four doors of Mr. Nicholson's house; Clark moved my hat over my eyes as I sat; I was neither asleep nor awake; I asked him what he did that for, and he said, he was only larking, or joking, or something of that sort.</p>

            , otherwise CLARK, (an accomplice) sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes. On Friday the 9th of February, Seaton and I were walking up Cornhill, and we observed a boy taking down the shutters of Mr. Nicholson's shop, the corner of St. Peter's-alley; that was about half past seven in the morning; I said to Seaton, there is a boy taking down the shop shutters, and they do not appear to me to be lined with iron; accordingly we went over the way, and Seaton looked at them; Seaton said to me, no doubt but we might cut a piece out of them; accordingly we went away, and met the same evening at the Trumpet in Shire-lane, myself, Seaton and Clifton; we told Clifton what we had seen in the morning, and we agreed to go on the Saturday night to cut a piece out of the shutter; accordingly we met the next night at the same house, the Trumpet, and staid till half past two o'clock in the morning; from thence we went to this house, the corner of St. Peter's-alley, and Seaton, with implements that he had got, cut a piece out of the shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. What implements were they? - A. What we call a spike-bit, and a chissel; after the piece was cut out of the shutter, the window was broke by cutting the shutter, a great quantity of property was taken out, watches, rings, seals, and bracelets.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who put his hand in? - A. I did myself, and Augustus Seaton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - A. No; Clifton was standing by on the pavement; I and Clifton received part of the property that was taken out by Seaton to take it away; after that, we went to Seaton's house, in a court in Gray's-inn-lane, I do not know the name of it, and there they were sorted by the receiver in two different parcels; accordingly myself and Seaton, and Clifton, took them to a house in Flower-de-luce-court,

             I heard his name was, but I do not know the man; we took one half of the property then, and Seaton knocked at the door, and a man looked out of the window that I never saw before, I understood it was Dudfield, he came down to the door, and opened it, he shewed Seaton and I up into his bedroom, Clifton staid in Fetter-lane; Seaton and the man agreed for the property, the woman at the bar was there at the same time, sitting upright in the bed, I stood behind them while they were agreeing for the property; there were two gold watches, several seals, rings, sugar-tongs, ear-rings, bracelets, necklaces, &amp;c. Seaton asked eighteen guineas for the property; Dudfield said, he could not afford to give any more than twelve guineas; the woman at the bar replied, she did not think her husband could afford to give more than twelve guineas, upon account of the tax that had been laid upon gold watches at that time; then Dudfield said, he would give thirteen guineas for them, he gave the money to Seaton; as we came out of Dudfield's house, we met with Clifton, and we all three went to Seaton's house in a court in Gray's-inn-lane; we told Clifton what money we had got for the property; then we agreed that Seaton should take the remainder of the property to Dudfield's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you divide that money? - A. No. Seaton kept it; Clifton and Seaton went back again to go to Dudfield's house, but I did not go with them.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time did you receive any part of this money? - A. After they came back, which was in about three quarters of an hour, they told me they got fifteen guineas more for the remainder part of the property, and then it was all equally divided amongst us three.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew if you got somebody else to take your place, and swear against some other persons, they would be hanged and you saved? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was after you had been in custody a week, or a fortnight, that you made this charge upon these young men? - A. In less than that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Nicholson. I have no doubt of these tongs being my property, it has my private mark upon it, L Z K; the ring has been marked, but it has been taken out, I believe it to be mine.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When you sell sugar-tongs, and other articles, do you not sell them with a private mark upon them? - A. Yes.</p>

On Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180106"/>the 22d of March, the prisoner and another person came to my house, about five o'clock, and called for a pot of beer, and they had to the tune of three; about half past seven I went out, and when I returned, in about ten minutes, they were gone; I did not miss the pots till they were brought back, in about half an hour, by the patrol, with a quart pot and a pint pot, and he has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>- FORD sworn. - I am a patrol: (Produces a quart and a pint pot); I had them from the prisoner at the bar, in Benjamin-street, St. Sepulchre's, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, or it may be better; I was going round Cow-cross, between seven and eight o'clock, and seeing something under his coat, I stopped him; we followed him; he went into an iron shop, and offered the two pots for sale; he came out of the iron shop and ran, and we followed him; he fell down, and then we took the pots from him; we asked him whose pots they were, and he said Mr. Carter's, at the Green Man and Still, in Coppice-row.</p>
               <p>Q.Had not you recommended him to confess the truth? - A. No; I had told him nothing of the kind. I have had the care of the pots ever since.(Produces them. They are deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a great quantity of dust to sift at 4d. a load, and all that I found in the dust; I found these pots among the dust; I went to sell them, and when this man stopped me, I told him I had picked them up upon a dust hill.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17980418-107-verdict587" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know the situation of the prisoner at the bar, Homan? - A. I understood him to be a <rs id="t17980418-108-deflabel593" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

             sworn. - I am an auctioneer: I was coming by and saw an assemblage of people; I saw the termination of the battle, which was the death of one of the combatants, Turner; I saw the prisoner there just before they went to fight; I thought I saw in the publican, Niblett, a disinclination to fight; I took him aside, and told him I hoped he would consider well before he went to fight; I told him it would let him down very much; he thanked me for my advice, but said he had gone so far, that it must be finished in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any particular conduct of the prisoner? - A. When I saw the deceased much hurt, I broke into the ring among them; I told the prisoner at the bar, if he set the man to fighting any more, I would have him taken up; by this time other people had broke in; the prisoner said he had a guinea in his pocket as well as me, and he would set him up to fight,as long as he would fight; he never did fight afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean the linen wrapper? - A. Yes. And he had made them fast; I had also three pieces to take; I know he had his fast, it contained twenty-eight yards of printed calico; I saw him carry them out of the house, and in about a quarter of an hour after I saw him in Smithfiels, he had his last delivery, he had delivered one; I followed him to Stock and Cooper's, upon Holborn-hill, he came out there, and I took him with another piece upon him he had no bill with; I stopped him in Baldwin's place; it was wrapped in a wrapper; I asked him, what he had got there, and the reply that he made me was, that he was done; I told him, if he would go back with me quietly, I would not call any other assistance; he went with me to the Old-jewry, and there we went in and had a pint of beer, and I sent the waiter for our foreman, and if he was not at home, to tell Mr. Curzons to come; I related the business to him and he proceeded to the warehouse with him and the property as I found it upon him, and it was delivered to the constable. When I was going out with my parcels, I suspected him, because as I went out past the warehouse window, I saw his wrapper undone again, and his head go from one of the piles in the warehouse; and I went back with my goods, and followed him.</p>

               <p>Q. And the reason why you say he had no account of it, was, that he did not produce a bill of it to you? - A. No, he told me first, he was done, and then he said, he was going to

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner and this piece of calico, (produces it); it was delivered to me by Mr. Joseph Peele, on the 30th of March, about three in the afternoon; I have had it ever since. I heard him say to Mr. Peele, afterwards, that he was going to carry it to Mr. Goulding's, in Portpool-lane, or to some pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Peele say any thing to induce him to say that, did he use any threat, or make him any promise? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peele. This piece of calico is my property, it has our mark upon it, "Peele, Yates, and Co."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see if any was missing? - A. It was impossible for me to miss it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say, of your own knowledge, whether that was one of the pieces that was to be delivered to you customers? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you a piece of the pattern in your house? - A. I cannot say; we had a great many of this pattern in the course of the last year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had two deliveries of goods; when I came to deliver them, I found I had got one more by mistake, and I intended to carry it back again.</p>
