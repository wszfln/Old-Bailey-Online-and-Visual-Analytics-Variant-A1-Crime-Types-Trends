                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, at 9, Parade, Norbiton—the prisoner brought me this cheque on Friday, November 30th, and asked me to cash it—I said, "Yes"—I examined it and became suspicious, because of it being crossed, and not being properly endorsed—the prisoner told me he had been doing work for Messrs. Marshall, the publishers, who had sent him this cheque in payment for work he had done—he broke off the conversation by ordering six bottles of whisky—I told him I would get the cheque through as quickly as possible, and if he returned on Tuesday morning he could have the whisky and the money—I took it to the bank, and requested them to put it through at once, as I was certain something was wrong—on Monday morning I went to the bank—the cheque was stopped, and later on I saw detectives—on Tues<lb/>day evening the prisoner came for the cash, and was given into custody.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on December 4th at Thornton Heath Police-station—I said he would be charged with breaking open a street door letter-box and stealing a letter containing a cheque for £2 odd—he said, "I know nothing about break<lb/>ing open the letter-box, I admit having the cheque; it was given to me by a man in the Canterbury Road to get the cash for him; he was going to give me 5s. for it; you would do the same if you were hungry; I have been trying to find work"—on searching him I found 5s. 11d. and 18 pawntickets, half in his own name, principally for shirts, clothes, etc.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the Aldersgate Street Branch of the National and Provincial Bank—on November 28th this cheque was presented to me across the counter, about 3.30, by the prisoner; I am not sure of the time to the minute—I was not satisfied with the signature; I referred it to the ledger-keeper, Mr. Fear, and also to the accountant of the bank, Mr. Boyton—I then told the prisoner I was not satisfied with the signature, and I should have to make inquiries about it—he said very sharply, "What for?"—I did not say anything; I went to the other end of the counter and spoke to a junior—the prisoner said he would be back in five minutes, and went out—I noticed that his voice was a very unusual one—I heard him speak several times before the Magistrate, and recognised his voice then—he was wearing the same beard as he is now—when he did not come back in five minutes, Mr. Blyton, whose cheque it was, was communicated with—the cheques are signed "Fisher and Neville," but Mr. Blyton is the firm—he came to the bank and made a communication—I had given a description of the man who had presented the cheque to the manager of the bank—that description was communicated to Mr. Blyton—he went away and returned with the prisoner after closing time—Mr. Blyton said to me, "Is this the man?"—I said, "Yes"—the prisoner said to me, "What time was it that you saw me?"—I said, "About half-past three"—he said that he had never been near the place at all—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man who presented the cheque.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> The description I gave to the manager was that you were sandy-featured, tall, dressed in a light coat, a <hi rend="italic">bowler</hi> hat, and wore rather an anxious, worried look—it might have been 4.30 when you came in with Mr. Blyton; I generally leave the bank about 5 o'clock—I did not leave at ray usual hour on this night—when you came in with Mr. Blyton you had on a silk hat and a fawn coat with silk facings—I did not call Mr. Blyton's attention to your change of clothing—I did not identify you by your clothes—I looked at your face—no attempt was made to detain the man who presented the cheque, or to follow him—I first heard it suggested that the man had a grey overcoat on and a tall hat at the Guildhall—I said at the Guildhall, "I recognise the accused's voice; it struck me, being musical"—I said I was musical, not that your voice was musical.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mantle-maker in the name of Fisher &amp; Neville, at 7, Monk well Street, City—I have an account at the Aldersgate Street Branch of the National and Provincial Bank—on November 28th, about 3.30, a messenger came from the bank and brought this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is a forgery; it is not signed by me or by my authority—it has a resemblance to my signature—I looked at my cheque-book, and found that the counterfoil and cheque between Nos. 29509 and 29511 were missing—the counterfoil before the missing cheque is dated July 30th—my cash-book was entered up by the prisoner for the week ending July 31st—we make up the books on Tuesday afternoon—the prisoner attended as the representative of the accountants, Messrs. Foster, Wright &amp; Co.—he was bead clerk to the firm of accountants whom I employed—he or some other clerk came every week—he would have before him the cash-book, the pass-book, and the cheque-book, and from them he would prepare a statement similar to the one produced now—this is the statement that he made—it shows the amount there is in the bank in the firm's name—when I found the cheque had been forged, on November 28th I went round to the bank, where I was given the description of the man who had tried to cash the cheque by the manager—in consequence I went to the accountants' office and saw the prisoner—he went with me to the bank—I told him what I wanted him to go with me for when we got outside the office—I went up to the counter at the bank with him, and Mr. Nicholls said, "That is the man"—we went into the manager's office—Mr. Boyton came in—he was not able to identify the prisoner—I re<lb/>member the prisoner coming to my office on November 27th to make up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190012100013"/>
               <p>my books as usual—he had the cash-book, the cheque-book, and the pass-book before him—this is the account which he made out, purport<lb/>ing to be an extract from those books, showing the amount of money in the bank—the balance at the bank for the preceding week was £880 19s. 11d.—the amount paid out was £621 9s. 3d.—there is an entry in the prisoner's writing of £593 1s. 3d.—the addition in the cash-book is correct—it appears that more money was paid out than really had been; the difference being £28 8s., which is the amount of the forged cheque—the amount £76 8s. 11d. is made up of the outstanding cheques, and includes the sum £28 8s.—there is a slight alteration in the pass-book, which I believe is in the prisoner's writing—when the prisoner was given my pass-book on November 27th the returned cheques would be in the pocket of the book—there should have been one for £28 8s., but there was not—I have seen nothing of it since; I think it was dated Novem<lb/>ber 24th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bank messenger called at my office about 3.30—Monkwell Street is about two or three minutes' walk from the bank—the manager gave me the description of the man who had come to the bank, as a tall man with a red beard—he said he had an overcoat on, and I be<lb/>lieve he said he had a tall hat on—I did not hear anything about a <hi rend="italic">bowler</hi> hat—I cannot say I have ever seen you wearing any hat except a tall one—at your office you pointed to your coat and said, "Do you call that grey?" and I said, "Yes, a dark grey"—your figures in my cash-book are correct—there appears to have been an alteration in the sum £593 1s. 3d., but you have initialled them—there is "T.U.T.," and then "W.A.R."—the practice is, if there is a mistake, to put the pen through the figures and initial them, and not to scratch them out—I should suggest you erased those figures—these alterations were on the pink paper when I had it—I do not know if the £28 8s. was blue ticked at the Guildhall; the accountants have had the books to make up since—you did not say you had never been to the bank before we got into the manager's office—I do not remember saying to you, "It is evident, Roberts, if you were in the office you were not here"—I had already found out that you had been out of the office—our office was never left without someone in authority; if I or one of my brothers were not there you were in authority—the cheque-books were kept under lock and key—they could be got out by taking the drawer above the one they were in out, and putting your hand in—I do not think anything was said about the grey overcoat till we were at the Guildhall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—in November I was staying with my daughter at the Tudor Hotel, Oxford Street, for about three weeks—the prisoner was staying there too—I had not met him before—on November 13th he brought me a newspaper and pointed out an advertisement of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway—he said it would be a safe thing to invest in, that he was going to invest, and it would pay a good percentage—on the day before I gave him a cheque for £6 10s. to make a bet for me at his suggestion—it did not come off—I said I had some money which I wanted to invest—he said he was going to apply for 60 shares for himself—I said I should like 60 shares—I got my cheque book—my daughter advised me not to invest—I wrote this cheque for £60 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on Parr's Bank, Notting Hill Branch, dated November 13th to Louis Kane or order £60—it has been passed through the bank and endorsed "Louis Kane" on the back—I belive that is the prisoner's writing—it is an open cheque—he asked me not to cross it because he wanted to cash it at once, as the list would be closed, and there would not be time to cash a crossed cheque—I asked him for a receipt—he gave me one after I wrote the cheque, and before he left with it—it was on the hotel paper—on the front of it there is a receipt for the bet—(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he calls himself "Professor Kane"—I think he is a professor of thought reading—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Received of Mrs. Williamson £60 for 60 shares in the Waterloo and Baker Street Railway, to be returned if the shares cannot be obtained.—Professor B. Kane")—if he could not get the shares he would let me have the money back—he wrote the receipts for both the sums at the same time—this was about 2 or 3 p.m.—he asked me to be quick, or else the bank wound be closed—I believe he left the hotel then—I did not see him again till next morning; then I asked him if he had got the shares; he said he had only got 60 in all—that would be 30 for me—I asked him for the other £30 back—he said that would remain for the next instalment—he showed me a prospectus of the company, and a receipt—I did not look at it very carefully; it was in the joint names of Professor or Mr. Kane and Mrs. Williamson—I do not think I took it into my hand; it was on white paper—he kept it—this the prospectus (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the next day I asked if I could sell my shares,</p>

               <p>because I had changed my mind—he said he wished I had told him that before, as he could very likely have transferred them—he showed me a letter to somebody named Robinson—I do not think I read it—on Mon<lb/>day, November 19th, I went to the Company's bankers Lubbock &amp; Co., and made inquiries about the cheque; I went on to the promoters, the London and Globe Finance Corporation—I think the bank told me to go there—there were no entries of shares having been purchased in either of the names—then I went and saw Mr. Martin, a jeweller, in Oxford Street near the Tudor—I told him what had happened—I saw the prisoner on the 19th at the hotel—he said he had not been able to sell the shares—Sergeant Clark and Mr. Martin called on me that evening; I never got any shares or any of my money from the prisoner.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 137, Oxford Street—I know the prosecutrix—on November 19th I saw the prisoner at her request at the hotel: I asked him what he had done with the money which he had obtained from Mrs. Williamson, and which he was to invest in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway—he said he had applied for 120 shares, 60 for himself and 60 for Mrs. Williamson—I asked him whether he had cashed the cheque at the bank—he said, no, he had not; he had handed it over to a man named Weller, who was his broker—I asked him for Mr. Weller's address, and he did not seem to know—I asked for a directory to see if I could trace the address, and was unable to find it there, or in the telephone book—he said Mr. Weller was a member of the Stock Exchange, and gave an address, in Copthall Mansions I think it was—I could not find it—I asked trim if he cashed the cheque at the Notting Hill Branch of the bank—he said no, he had not—I asked him what time he was in the City that afternoon—he said about 3.30—he said that Mr. Weller had the money for the cheque—I told him I had been to the bankers of the company, and they could find no trace of either name on their books—he said perhaps it was in the broker's name—I said, "Have you got the broker's contract or the banker's receipt?"—he said he had had a receipt, but he tore it up; he did not keep such things—I saw him on the 20th at the hotel with a person who was supposed to be his wife—he</p>

Whit<lb/>bread's for sale for £75, in consequence of a serious injury to the proprietor.—Address, Bunbury &amp; Co., Auctioneers, 28, Finsbury Circus.</hi>)—I went there, and saw the two prisoners—they told me that the house was the Hope, in Banner Street, St. Luke's, and asked how much I had got—I said, "£75"—Mrs. Clara Allen, who acts as my housekeeper, went there with me—the prisoners said that it was a good house, and I should get on very well in it if I could cater for men's dinners—Mrs. Allen said that she could do that—they asked for £10 or £15 deposit, but that £10 would do—I said that I could get £10 next day, October 4th, which I did, and a receipt was given me, which I tore up—Mrs. Allen and I went to see the Hope with Hiscocks—it looked pretty fair, and I told Hiscocks I thought I would take it—that was after I had received this letter of</p>

               <p>October 7th, asking me to call on Monday next, and accompany him to the brewers—I went to Finsbury Circus on the Monday, and saw both the prisoners, and we went in a cab with Mrs. Allen to Whitbread's—we called at a public-house, where I paid Hiscocks a fee of 4s. 6d. for going to the brewers—he then left us and went into the brewery, and came out and said, "Come on, you can't see it now; you must see it another time"—on, I think, the 15th, we made another visit to the brewery with Hiscocks and Mrs. Allen—I went into a passage, and sat down on a seat, and Hiscocks went in, and came out, and said, "You cannot see the brewer"—he wanted a fee of 10s. that day, and he gave me this I.O.U. for it; I have never been paid—next day, October 16th, I went to the office again, and saw Hiscocks; Bunbury was not there—Hiscocks told me that the Hope was sold—I asked him for my money back; he said that he would acquaint Mr. Bunbury with it, who had gone to Southampton for a week—on October 17th I got this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that Banbury was out of town, and when he returned he would make an appointment; signed "pro Bunbury &amp; Co., F.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the London Trading Bank, Limited, 12, Coleman Street—on October 3rd an account was opened of Mrs. Eliza Bunbury, trading as Bunbury &amp; Co.—Eliza Bunbury and W. Bunbury were entitled to draw cheques—W. Bunbury is the prisoner—I produce a certificated extract of the account up to February 22nd this year—I was only asked to bring an extract between certain dates—here is an entry of £1 1s. on March 24th—there is no money there now; there is an overdraft—I also produce a certified copy of the account of H. Hiscocks with our bank—on October 4th, 1899, a cheque for £1 18s. was debited in the name of Bunbury—the next is £1 1s. to Miller—there was an overdraft of 6s. 7d.—on March 10th, 1900 a cheque for £50 was paid in, and instructions were given to specially clear it—on the same day a cheque book was obtained, and a cheque drawn for £25, and on the same day another cheque for £20 was drawn, and another for £5, which exhausted the account—on March 19th, there was l0d. left, which we appropriated for commission—£61 12s. altogether was paid in since October—nothing was drawn out between 1899 and March 10th, 1900—the whole of the money which was paid in was drawn out in nine days, except 10d.</p>

Jenner"—there was no name over the shop in Ordell Street—it was apparently well stocked with tea and sugar, but the packages were dummies and contained sawdust, and I found a quantity of empty sawdust bag—when I went back he asked me if I had been round to the other shop—I said, "Yes"—I obtained an order from the Home Office and went to Holloway Prison on December 4th and saw James Birch in the visitors' room—he was under remand with another man for stealing and receiving—he made a statement which I reduced to writing, and he signed it—I saw him again at Wapping Police-station at 7.30 last Saturday, December 8th, when he made this second statement on one of the forms—he was brought to me by a third-class inspector (<hi rend="italic">Helden</hi>) about 7.20 p.m.—Helden wrote the statement—I was present—he signed it—I arrested Jenner—Helden arrested Albrow.</p>

               <p>and Youell and a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> whose name I do not know, and Malyon—the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> went the same way as Youell, across the Flats—we stopped at several public-houses, and finally at the Rabbits—four of us went in and came out, and Youell was so bad he did not like our cart pulling his horse along, and he said, "I am going across country," and jumped on his horse, and I went straight home—the other man walked by the side, and on the way we passed Clark about 30 yards from the Rabbits—I remained in Malyon's company till he got home.</p>

I am a general dealer, of 19, Bigglesdorf Road, Stratford—on November 21st I went to Romford Market, and met Youell there, whom I knew well—we had a drink together, and I subsequently met him about 2.30 or 3 o'clock very drunk outside the Cock and Ball, and I saw him a second time with two young women who were strangers to me—I went and had a drink with him again, and he fell down two or three times, and I asked the ostler to let him lie down in the stable—the ostler put him in the stable for an hour or an hour and a half—he lost a sovereign in the Cock and Ball, and the landlord helped him to find it—he came out of the stable in the afternoon near 5 o'clock—I had a pony to sell, but could not sell it, and was taking it back, and tied it behind Malyon's barrow, and asked Thomas Maylon if he would allow the two horses to run behind—I do not know <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> Maylon—Perkis,<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Malyon, Youell, and myself were in the barrow; five of us—the other man was a stranger; we brought him from Romford—Arthur Malyon was not there—I went into the Rabbits and had a drink, and then I took my pony away—no one was in the barrow when I left—Thomas Malyon was outside the public-house, and so was Perkis—when I was about 30 yards on the road to Stratford, Perkis and Thomas Malyon drove past.</p>

I live at 34, Walpole Way, Richmond—on November 24th there was a "sing-song" there, downstairs—the prisoner was there—I went down about 11.30 p.m.—I offered to sing a song—a fight took place between me and the prisoner in the courtyard—as I went upstairs the prisoner's wife called me a b—, and my wife said I was no b—, and the prisoner challenged me to fight—after the fight I went away and stood under a lamp—I was told that somebody was knocking my wife about—I went back and saw the prisoner and his wife knocking my wife about—I knocked the prisoner down, and pushed his wife away—as he went on to the ground I saw a knife in his hand, and he struck me on my leg with it—it cut through my drawers and trousers,. and cut my leg—I was attended by a doctor.</p>

                  </hi> (321<hi rend="italic">M</hi>). On November 17th I was called to the Pitt's Head at 4.45, and found the prisoner detained in the bar—Mr. Kirk said, in the prisoner's presence, "This man has given a counterfeit coin to my barmaid, and I wish to give him in custody," and handed me this coin—I said to the prisoner, "You hear what he says"—he said, "Yes"—I searched him there and found 10s. in gold and some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, and 7d. in bronze—he had it in his hand; he took it out—he was taken to the station and charged, and said, "I gave it in mistake for a shilling"—I received both these coins from Mr. Kirk, one in the bar and the other at the Police-court.</p>
