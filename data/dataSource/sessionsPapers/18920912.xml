                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Newbury Street—I am twelve years of age—I know the Red Cow in Long Lane—on 2nd August I was there, and saw a man rolling a barrel up Half Moon Passage—I saw two men, but I did not notice the other; the prisoner was one of the men—I had seen him before, and knew him—I did not see what they did with the barrel; I only saw them rolling it up the passage.</p>

On 2nd August Cakebread spoke to me, and in consequence of what he said I went to Half Moon Passage, and there found a barrel of beer, which he identified—in consequence of what the two boys said I went back to the Rose and Crown, where I saw the prisoner outside—I said to him, "These two boys tell me that you have rolled a barrel of beer into Half Moon Passage," and I asked them if they identified the prisoner as being the man—they said,</p>

I live at 8, Half Moon Passage—on the Tuesday after Bank Holiday I was with the prisoner and his mother, Mrs. Macklin, from two in the afternoon till eight in the evening—we went to buy a pair of boots in Old Street for the mother, who is a cripple; she was on crutches—she had not enough money to pay for the boots, and we came out and went into Aldersgate Street—that was near seven o'clock—when we got a little further the mother said she could not walk any further, or he would have to get a barrow and take her home; it was before eight when he put her on the barrow and took her along—I walked on with my baby.</p>

I live at 9, Montagu Mews, Hammersmith, and keep a coffee-stall outside the Hammersmith Broadway Railway Station at night—at half-past eleven on Sunday night, 14th August, I opened my stall—all five prisoners were waiting outside to be served, apparently—each of the prisoners called for eggs and coffee—they consumed the articles—I asked each one of them for the money, and they all laughed at me—I said to each one of them, "You have had so-and-so, it is so much"; I said to one, "Give me fivepence," to another, "Give me sixpence," and so on—they laughed at each other, and refused to pay me, and swore at me—Christie said, "I will turn your b——stall over"—Perry said, "Come on, let us turn his stall over"—they all said "Yes," and all of them started breaking up my cups and saucers—I shut up the stall and went inside—Christie forced the door open; he got in first and struck me in the chest and knocked me up against the urns, and all five surrounded me, and I felt a hand in my right-hand hip pocket; to the best of my belief it was Christie's hand, but I could hardly say—I had 9s. 5d. in silver and bronze in that pocket—the prisoners went out and got round the stall—I felt in my pocket and missed the money—I know it was 9s. 5d., because it was the amount for my milk bill; I had done no business till the prisoners came—the prisoners then got round my stall outside, and tilted it half-way over—they knocked the stall about, broke the window, and found some old boots, or something, which they threw, and damaged the stall very much—they spilt the milk and ate some cakes—Berry, my assistant, was outside—Jimson made an attempt to enter my stall again—I could not see if he had been in with the others before; I have no doubt he had—when he tried to come in again Berry stopped him, and Jimson struck Berry on the jaw—I cleared up my things, and opened the stall again—Olive went away; the others were still outside at the back, and they came round and I shut up again—they simply jeered and laughed at me when they came back again—when I shut up the second time the prisoners ran away, and a gentleman brought me assistance, and I informed the policemen what had been</p>

               <p>going on—the same night I identified Christie and Breach at a common lodging-house in "Waterloo Street, and they were taken into custody—about two days afterwards I identified Perry and Olive from among a number of other strange men at the Police-station without hesitation—afterwards the police came again, and said they had caught Jimson, and I went and picked him out in the same way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Christie.</hi> You had about sixpenny worth at my stall, and you encouraged young Olive and others to call for it for you—Berry gave Breach one cup of coffee to encourage him to go away; a cup was not given to you—the stall is quite large enough for four men to get into; the door is broken off the hinge now; you burst your way through—I took my coat off in the stall—the stall was not tipped right over; you tilted it, and knocked over about fifty eggs; my milk was not <hi rend="italic">spilt before you came.</hi>

Olive paid 2d., but he had more than that, and owed about 4d.—if I said before the Magistrate Olive paid for what he had, it was a mistake—the Magistrate gave me £1 to repair my damage—I gave two policemen, Lock and Jones, drinks out of it—I knew the prisoners before; they are well known; they have had stuff before and not paid for it—the stall runs on wheels, and the door is at the side—only one person can get in at the door at a time—Christie came in first; to the best of my belief it was his hand in my pocket—I swore it was his at the Police-court—Jimson came up to the stall after the money was taken, had stuff, and refused <hi rend="italic">to</hi> pay, and struck my witness on the jaw—he was at the stall and had stuff with the others—I fancy it is correct to say that he came up to the stall after the money had been taken—I could swear he was there at the same time as the others, and called for things—he was there before the money was taken—it was not the police who made me prosecute; they asked me to come to the court—I should have come if they had not asked me—the amount of damage done to my stall was 30s.—Jimson came up and ordered stuff, declined to pay, and went away, and then when the others had forced their way in Jimson came up again—the constables did not have anything out of the £1, only two glasses of bitter which they asked for.</p>

I live at 9, Montagu Mews, Hammersmith—on this Sunday night I took the stall round and just settled it down, and we were opening it when Jimson came up and struck me on the jaw—I was pulled away by a friend—I went away down the Grove about 40 yards, and did not have a view of the stall—I saw all the prisoners there—later on when I came back I saw all the prisoners round there, and I gave Breach a cup of coffee to entice him away, and then I went away—I saw Perry taking a cake.</p>

I live at 13, Angel Road, King Street, Hammersmith, and am a compositor—on this Sunday night I was on my way home, and I saw all the prisoners and several other men surround the coffee-stall—Christie aimed a boot at me, and asked me what I was looking at—they were smashing various articles on the stall; you could hear it quite plainly, but I could not say positively what they were doing, because the crowd was so great, and it was so organised—I went a few yards away for the police, and the prisoners saw me speaking to the police and ran away—I spoke to two plain clothes constables, who I</p>

On the 17th August, about 3.30, I arrested the prisoner and told him the charge—he said, "I can prove that the first marriage was not legal, as she married me in an assumed name, and I was only 17 years of age. It was her mother who forced us to get married, and she afterwards left me, and I went to sea"—at the station he said, "I was at sea for some years, and when I returned I wrote to her mother at Norwood, but the letter was returned, and I never saw anything of her till last January in King's Road, and I spoke to her.

Murder!"—a few minutes afterwards, after I was getting over my fright, two men and a woman came up and stood there a little while; one of them had a very peculiar walk—the short one stood back, and the tall one and the woman said, "Are you coming home?"—he never answered, and they said again, "Ain't you coming home to-night? I don't keep my house open all night for you"—and then the two men came back, leaving the woman standing at the lamp-post—my little boy said, "Mother, that man has picked up your cat—the big one picked up the cat and gave it to the little one, who came and gave it to mc; but I was too frightened to know him again—the little boy was then by my side, without shoes or stockings—the men walked straight down, and the little one went away and came back with a white bundle under his arm—I went to the Police-station</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter was signed "G, R, Cornelius</hi>")—he also passed this document, C, to Cornelius—after the arrest I was looking at the letter, and the prisoner said, "I am doing his writing for him; I wrote that letter for him, and was going to take it"—I have an opinion that the letter is in a similar hand to the cheque, and that the person who wrote it wrote the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 86, Leadenhall Street; that is the chief shop, and there is a branch at 12, High Street, Finchley—on the 8th August I caused a parcel of cloth to be sent to the branch establishment containing six pieces of 5 yards and fifteen pieces of two and a half yards, twenty-one yards altogether, worth £11 11s. 3d.—that was the price charged to the trade, and charged to the branch office—the parcel was signed for in the ordinary way—it did not arrive—I made a claim against the company—I gave the officer Savage a sample on Tuesday evening—I have since seen some of the cloth—I accompanied Savage, and had an interview with the two prisoners—this is the cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is practically all here; three pieces are missing.</p>

I received notice of this robbery on the 19th—I got a sample, and circulated information among the pawnbrokers; the result was that I found one piece pawned at Mr. Swinfins, at 32, Kingsland Road—I got a ticket in the name of Bishop—I made inquiries, and a little after five in the evening I was called to Hoxton Station, where Elizabeth Bishop and her father were detained—there was a long conversation with them, and I went to their house, and found there another piece of cloth—I then conveyed them to Bishopsgate Station, and this piece was identified by Mr. Hawes—I had a communication with him, and on Thursday, the 11th, went with him, in company with Shepherd, another officer, to Phillips' shop, 13 and 14, Cutler Street, which leads out of Houndsditch—I there saw the son, and had a communication with him—eventually he showed me all this cloth; he first went to the corner of the shop and brought one piece; I spoke to him again, and he went and fetched another piece; I spoke to him again, and he then pointed to where he had taken the two pieces from—that was on a tin hook in the corner of the shop—I saw the remaining pieces—a pair of trousers was hung up just inside the shop door, among other things, with a measurement ticket on it—I then went to 113 and 114, Houndsditch, at the corner of Cutler Street; that is another shop of Phillips's; I went there with his son—after waiting there a few minutes the prisoner Phillips came up; I saw him outside the shop—I said to him, "Mr. Phillips, come across to 114 with me"—he said, "All right"—we walked together, and when we got into the shop he said, "It is no use my telling you what I am; you know"—I knew him well—I said, "This cloth is stolen" (pointing to the cloth on the bench), "where did you get it from?"—he said, "I bought it of my brother-in-law, Lazarus Samuels, on Tuesday"—I said, "Have you a receipt for it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Then you will have to go to the station</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 2, Hyde Street, New Oxford Street—about two a.m. on 23rd July I was awakened by the sound of a crash, and on looking through a side window I saw that a plate-glass window had been broken from the outside—I opened the door, and saw a constable outside, who gave pursuit, and a few minutes afterwards brought up the prisoner—I charged him, and followed him to the station—I missed this box of cigars and dummy packets of tobacco.</p>

I was on duty on the morning of 23rd July in New Oxford Street; I saw the prisoner loitering about, and kept observation on him, and saw him go to 2, Hyde Street—he picked up something from the gutter and threw it into the window, put his arm through and took some goods—I gave chase across Oxford Street—the prisoner threw something at me which hit my helmet—I fell, but got up and caught the prisoner in Hart Street—he said, "All right, governor, I will go quiet"—he handed me these cigars and packets of tobacco—after I came back I found this cigar box in the road, with cigars smashed up.</p>

Cocks, Biddulph, and Co.—at that time a cheque for £1,254 had been drawn—in consequence of that I communicated with Cocks and Co., and the matter was placed in the hand's of the police—the cheque had been forwarded to the executors for signature, and the bankers returned it as not sufficient—this' is the cheque book of the Ellicombe estate—on examination I found that two cheques had been abstracted, counterfoils and all—one of those missing was No. 86,805, and the other 86,808; that No. 86,805 was for £450.</p>

I did not purchase a watch there; I don't know what you are talking about"—I took him to Bow Street Police-station, and charged him with stealing two blank cheques and forging and uttering the two cheques—he said he knew nothing about it—when Miss Connell identified the prisoner at Bow Street I did nothing to assist her, or to suggest or stop or interfere with her in any way—she had no difficulty in identifying the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookmaker—I am a friend of Mr. Tatham, landlord of the Half Moon, who is very ill with quinsey, and cannot come here—he was here all day yesterday—on 18th June I was at the Half Moon—I can fix the date because the Alexandra Park races were on the same day, and Mr. Tatham asked me to go for a drive previous to our driving to the races—the Alexandra Park races are held four times a year—we drove in Mr. Tatham's pony and trap to the City, and got back about twenty-five or twenty minutes past twelve—a gentleman was in the bar to whom Tatham spoke; I asked the manageress when dinner would be ready, because I wanted to get to Alexandra Park at two o'clock—I don't know who the gentleman in the bar was—I do not know if he was the prisoner—I went upstairs about twenty-five minutes to one, leaving the gentleman behind in the bar—we were at dinner about half an hour, and when I came back, about five minutes past one, the gentleman was there—Mrs. Mason was there all the time—I then started, and was at Alexandra Park at twenty minutes to two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I drove there with the landlord—we drove to the City to the brewery in John Street Road—I think it took us about twenty-five minutes to get there—I was making a book that day—I sent my clerk on to Alexandra Park in advance to occupy a place for me—I was asked to give evidence about a fortnight ago.</p>

I am manageress at the Half Moon, 471, Holloway Road—Mr. Tatham is ill; he was here yesterday—on the Saturday in June, when the Alexandra Park races were on, White came to the Half Moon with Tatham for their dinner at exactly a quarter-past twelve—they remained in the bar till dinner was ready—one or two more strangers were there, and the prisoner came in while Tatham and White were in the bar, and had a Scotch and soda—I remarked to the prisoner that the governor was punctual for once in his life.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Half Moon is not far from where the prisoner lives—he usually came in on Sunday evening, and sometimes to dinner on Sunday—I knew him very well as a customer—I don't know when there were races at Alexandra Park before those on 18th June—there have been some recently, I think—if I looked up the date it would help me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The day I saw the prisoner there was the day White came home to dinner with Mr. Tatham, and they and I went up to dinner together at half-past twelve; it was ordered for a quarter-past twelve—when we came down the prisoner was gone.</p>

July I had a warrant to levy an execution on the prisoner's goods, issued by the Bloomsbury County-court—on 26th July, about 10.30 a.m., I went in with a man named Newport—the amount was £6 5s.—I saw the two prisoners there, and read the warrant—John said he did not see how he could pay; I told him he had better get a notice, as he had formerly—he said he should have to go to Leytonstone to get it, and while he was away I went to the court—there was sufficient for the claim and costs and one month's rent—I went to the auctioneer and returned at 12.30, and then made the technical levy, and a claim for one month's rent was given to me—I made an inventory of the goods, and again asked Arden for the money—he said he had not got it, and the sooner the things were cleared out the better—I went away, leaving Newport in possession, and came back at 3.30 with a van to take away the goods—I then again asked him for the money; he said he would not pay it, but later on he showed me some money; I do not know how much—I instructed the carman to take out the goods, and when he came into the room the woman said all the b——lot would be smashed before they were taken out of the house, and began smashing the empty drawers with her feet; they had been cleared out when I was gone—I noticed when I came hack that the prisoners were not so sober as before—I sent Newport for a constable—I got the warrant from Newport, and the notice attached to it, doubled it up, and put it into this pocket—when Newport was gone they both ordered me out of the house—I said, "No"—they said that if I did not go out they would put me out—I told them to remember what they were doing—five or six people hustled me out of the parlour into the passage, and the female prisoner struck me several blows on my head, knocked my hat off, and knocked me down, dragged me to the door, and I got jammed between the door and the door-post, and the female prisoner took the warrant out of my pocket, handed it to her husband, and said, "Here are the b——papers, now we are all right"—he went away—one of the people was a lodger on the top-floor—I knew Arden before; he was a bailiff working under a licence granted by Judge Bacon—the female prisoner still persisted in trying to get me out, and I was ultimately put outside without my hat, and the door closed—a constable came and knocked at the door; it was not opened—we got a smith, who forced it open, and we took the things away—I got my hat again—I asked the woman for the papers in the constable's presence—she said she did not know anything at all about them; she had not seen them—the two prisoners were taken to the station and charged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undergoing a term of imprisonment for uttering this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on May 5 I met the prisoner in Fleet Street—he asked me how I was getting on—I said I was hard up, and was selling wine on commission—he asked if I could get him some paper—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "Cheques"—a day or two afterwards I went to a house in Kensington, and saw a cheque-book—I cut two leaves out, which I gave to Kelly—he met me two hours afterwards, and the cheques were filled up in his writing, to the best of my belief—I have received letters from him—we went to a public-house, and saw Walpole—he asked the landlord to cash the cheque—we went to Piccadilly Circus—Kelly was with us all the time; he went to his sister's place, who keeps a dairy, and brought the money out—Kelly had 30s.—told him where I got the cheques from—he said, "You b——fool; why did not you take the lot?"</p>

I live at Farningham—on 12th or 13th May, at 3.30, I saw the prisoner in the Barley Mow, Salisbury Square, Fleet Street—he introduced me to George Stephens, who he said was the son of a retired victualler, and kept the Mitre, in Mitre Court, and he was in trouble as his wife was in premature confinement, and there was a dead baby at home; and if I could get a cheque changed for him it would be a benefit—he handed a cheque to me—I introduced him to the landlord, who had cashed cheques for me, but was unsuccessful—we then went to Piccadilly, then to Paternoster Square, and then to Herne Hill, where my sister got my mother to cash it—I had had a glass or two, but was none the worse for it.</p>

I took the prisoner on August 16th at Sheffield, and told him he would be charged with George Stephens with forging and uttering a cheque for £5 10s.—he made a statement to me in the train which I took down; he said, "I met Stephens in Fleet Street, outside Mitre Court; he told me the firm he was travelling for in the wine trade, and asked me if I could introduce him to any customers; we went into the Clachan Tavern, Mitre Court, and I met a friend; he asked me if I knew where he could get a small cheque cashed. I said, 'No; people are very dubious about cashing strange cheques'; we walked down Fleet Street and saw Walpole at the Barley Mow public-house. Stephens asked if he could get the landlord to cash the cheque, which he said was for £5 10s. I said, 'I cannot do it. 'I asked him whose cheque it was; he said, 'My cousin's; it is as good as a Bank of England note. 'I said, 'Why not pass it through a clearing bank?' He said, 'I must have the money to-night, as my wife is just in her confinement. 'Walpole said, 'If it is all right I can get it cashed for you. 'Stephens made the same state<lb/>ment</p>

Walpole said he could get it cashed at his sister's at Herne Hill; we went there, and I and Stephens waited outside while Walpole got the cheque cashed, and handed £4 10s. to Stephens, saying he would give him the £1 balance next day. Stephens gave Walpole some money, and me half a sovereign, part of a debt he owed me. He then left; a few days afterwards Stephens came for the £1 balance, and asked Walpole to cash another cheque, which was lost by Walpole on our way to Herne Hill. "</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon of police—at 1.20 on the early morning of Wednesday, 3rd August, I was called to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120054"/>
               <p>Millwall Dock, and found a body lying in front of P warehouse in a slightly dishevelled condition, but chiefly noticeable for being very much smothered in blood—I found a wound under the arm, which had severed an artery—I examined the body more carefully at the mortuary—I found the wound was two inches above the elbow on the inner side of the arm; it was seven eighths of an inch broad, and one and three quarter inches deep—death was caused by syncope, or failure of the heart's action from hæmorrhage, due to the wound having severed the artery—any knife would have caused the wound; probably it was a broad-bladed one, but there were no special marks about the wound—it was a clean-cut wound—the arm must have been in a raised position when the wound was inflicted, from its position—on 5th and 6th August I examined a coat belonging to Shoenmaker, and a guernsey shirt and trousers belonging to De Ryter—I found blood stains on all those clothes; in my opinion the stains were about a couple of days old, but it is very difficult to say—I also examined and analysed some water in a bottle shown to me by Culley—in my opinion the water contained blood, but I could not swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of this ship—she arrived on 30th July—both prisoners were on her during the voyage; De Ryter as seaman, and Shoenmaker as fireman—the mate, Landells, did not mix with the crew in any way, to my knowledge—both prisoners could speak English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> According to the articles both prisoners are Dutchmen—I said before the Coroner, "I believe De Ryter had constantly cheeked me, but he has always spoken in Dutch, and I did not answer him"—with the exception of nautical terms they knew English—they always spoke in Dutch; but an instance I can give is that I had to have a Consular Court on De Ryter, and he replied to all the questions—De Ryter was troublesome on board, and I thought he was impertinent to me because he spoke in Dutch; it was not what he said, but the way he said it—another of my crew was taken to the Consular Court and put in irons for using a knife—I begged him off—I could not say whether that man who threatened the officers with a knife was on board the ship when the mate was killed or not—he was one of the crew; he had threatened me and the steward with a knife—when a ship is in port, the officers who go out at night can stay out as long as they like, so long as one officer is on board—I was on board on this night, and Landells could go out for all night, or come back when he liked—the sailors have no fixed time for returning when the vessel is in port; they have to ask permission of the chief officer—they did not ask permission of me; I was not on board at the time—I don't know whether they left to go on shore before or after the mate.</p>

I am resident manager to Spiers and Pond, of the refreshment bars at the Zoological Gardens—I supervise the buffets, and hear employee's complaints and other matters—I know Norman's writing—I see it almost daily—she has been with me twelve months—the signature on the ticket B is not hers—I will not swear to the figures £33s. 5s. 3d.—the signatures on the seventeen tickets produced are not hers—Norman complained to me on Tuesday afternoon—I got this rough cash-book—then I sent for the prisoner—Norman was there when he came—I said Norman had stated that she paid in £37, and that he had only entered £33—I asked him what it meant—he said, "If she had paid in £37, £37 would have been entered; but she only paid in £33"—Norman said, "Just now you said you had taken £4 for the 'sus. "'—Norman said he was always making mistakes—the prisoner said, "You don't know what you are talking about"—I said nothing more could be done till we went to the Central Office, and could look at the ticket that was paid in—I went to the Central Office the next morning; the tickets were looked over, and this one produced for £33 5s. 3d.—I showed it to Norman—I sent for the prisoner and Mr. Ellis—he was given into custody on the Wednesday—by rule, a book should have been</p>

On 17th August, about two o'clock, the prisoner was given into my custody in the Albert Road, Regent's Park, by Mr. Blanchette, who charged him with stealing £4—I took him in a cab to Albany Street Police-station—I was not called at the Police-court—when the charge was read over to him he said, "I emphatically deny the charge"—then he was taken in a cab to Marylebone Police-court—on the way there, before I spoke to him, he said, "Can I speak when I get to the Court?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Can I have a solicitor?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Shall I plead guilty?"—I said, "Please yourself; take your counsel's advice"—he said, "I went there with a good character; if there is a loophole to get through I'll get through it," and that this would be a stain on his character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies at Somerset House—I produce the file of proceedings in connection with a company called the Charing Cross Publishing Company, which was registered on 18th July, 1873—to the memorandum of association, among the signatories, is "William James Morgan," described as an editor, of 27, Morton Place; also the name of Joseph Sidney Tomkins, of 5, Friar Street, Broadway—that is given as the registered address of the company, and is afterwards altered to 4, Broad Street Buildings—I find on the file a notice of 2nd February, 1880, filed on the 5th, of a resolution to voluntarily wind up the company on account of its liabilities—it is a notice from Tomkins as the chairman—the Somerset House authorities afterwards sent a notice to the registered address, calling attention to the requirements of the Companies' Act of 1890; that was returned through the Dead Letter Office—I also produce a file of documents in the City of London Publishing Company, Limited; that was registered on 30th March, 1881—among the signatories to the memorandum of association I find W. J. Morgan, publisher, 5, Friar Street; and J. S. Tomkins, 5, Friar Street—that is the registered address of the company; that address is afterwards changed to 46, Leadenhall Street—the last documents with reference to that company are three letters of April, June, and August, 1891, which were sent to that address, and were returned through the Dead Letter Office—there was a memorandum of agreement filed—Morgan and Tomkins are described as proprietors of certain publishing companies—they appear to be vendors of the City of London Publishing Company—on the file is a resolution to wind up; it was passed on 31st December, 1884, and filed on 14th January, 1885—in consequence of the letters being returned through the Dead Letter Office, the company was struck off the register, under the Companies' Act of 1880, on 17th November, 1891—I produce the file of proceedings of a company called "The Beraners Gallery, Limited," registered on 17th August, 1891—among the signatories to the memorandum of association are "Wm. Jas. Morgan, of 64, Berners Street, art dealer," and "J. S. Tomkins, of 5, Friar Street, publisher"—in the memorandum</p>

               <p>of agreement Morgan is described as the proprietor and vendor of "The National Artistic Union"—64, Bernard Street is the registered address of the Berners Street Gallery, afterwards removed to the Bloomsbury Mansions—the consideration is set out as £1,200, consisting of 100 fully paid-up shares of £5 each in the capital of the company and £700 in cash—a letter of inquiry was sent from Somerset House with regard to the company in February, 1888, and returned through the Dead Letter Office, and all traces of it being lost, the dissolution was adjudged; another letter was sent in April; and another in June, and the dissolution was gazetted on 14th September, 1888—I also produce the file of proceedings of a company called "The Authors' Alliance Limited," registered on 23rd November, 1887—among the signatories of association I find David Tolmie, journalist, of 20, Eresbys Road, West Hampstead; and Joseph Sidney Tomkins, of 5, Friar Street, described, as a secretary; the signatures are attested by W. J. Morgan, of 5, Friar Street, Broadway, S. E.—there is a list of shareholders, among whom David Tolmie appears to hold 21 shares, and Joseph Sidney Tomkins, 21; Charles M. Clarke, of 27, Amherst Road, literary agent, 20; Gilbert Campbell, of 8, Barnard's Inn, gentleman, 20; William Jas. Morgan, of 29, Chancery Lane, manager, 1,500 shares—there is on the file an agreement in which Morgan is described as the sole proprietor of the City of London Publishing Company, and David Tolmie as trustee of the Authors' Alliance, in consideration of 1,500 fully paid-up shares and £500 in cash—the address of the company is registered on 19th April, 1888, 59 and 60, Chancery Lane; the number of shareholders on this list is 17—no further returns reached our office, and in November, 1891, we sent the usual letter of inquiry, which was returned in the same way, and the company was dissolved on 16th August, 1892.</p>

J. Morgan, of 5, Friar Street, Broadway, S. E.—there is a list of shareholders, among whom David Tolmie appears to hold 21 shares, and Joseph Sidney Tomkins, 21; Charles M. Clarke, of 27, Amherst Road, literary agent, 20; Gilbert Campbell, of 8, Barnard's Inn, gentleman, 20; William Jas. Morgan, of 29, Chancery Lane, manager, 1,500 shares—there is on the file an agreement in which Morgan is described as the sole proprietor of the City of London Publishing Company, and David Tolmie as trustee of the Authors' Alliance, in consideration of 1,500 fully paid-up shares and £500 in cash—the address of the company is registered on 19th April, 1888, 59 and 60, Chancery Lane; the number of shareholders on this list is 17—no further returns reached our office, and in November, 1891, we sent the usual letter of inquiry, which was returned in the same way, and the company was dissolved on 16th August, 1892.</p>

Sidney Tomkins, Secretary," and there is another signature, "A. Reeves" (<hi rend="italic">The endorsement on the cheque relating to the remittance of the 1st March was "Authors' Alliance, W. J.

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that they should be glad to receive manuscripts, and that they made no charge for their reader's fee</hi>)—in consequence of that I sent a manuscript magazine article for insertion to the City of London Publishing Company, 5, Friar Street, Broadway—I received a letter saying that the cost of publishing my magazine article would be £7 10s.; I sent £7 10s.—I never saw my article in print, nor did I ever receive my manuscript back, or get any value for my money except some proofs—a lengthy correspondence ensued between me and the City of London Publishing Company; I received seventeen letters between June, 1886, and September, 1888; four were signed Morgan, and the rest Tomkins, I think—in September, 1888, I came to London, and went on the 3rd to 59 and 60, Chancery Lane—the doors were closed, and I could not get in—it was before noon, I think—I went again on 4th. September, and found the door open, and went into the office—I saw Tomkins, and asked if Mr. Morgan was in—he told me Morgan was out of town—I asked for Mr. Tomkins; he said he was not in at present—he asked me what I wanted—I said I preferred to tell my business to Mr. Morgan, and would call again—as I went out Tomkins went out after me, through another entrance, and locked the door—I followed him, and saw him go through the building in Chancery Lane, round the square, and enter the building by another entrance in a street I don't know the name of—the next day I returned to the office; Tomkins was writing some letters there, and I recognised his writing as that I had seen in the correspondence signed Joseph Sidney Tomkins—he said, "Mr. Morgan has not returned yet"—I said, "And Mr. Tomkins?"—he said, "Mr. Tomkins is not here"—I said, "Yes, he is; you are Mr. Tomkins"—he said, "No; I am not Tomkins"—he said that several times, I asserting he was—after a little time he said, "Well, I am Tomkins; but I don't care for everybody to know it"—I said that I had come up for my manuscript, and that I should stay there till I got it—he said he had lost it; that he knew nothing about it—a second man appeared in the office; I believe he was Morgan, but I cannot say positively—I waited there for close on two hours, and then the second man said he had business with Tomkins, and that I must turn out—I</p>

J. Morgan, Manager," and dated 2nd October, 1886—there was an alternative proposal that, in lieu of payment, I was to find a cash order for 200 copies—I agreed to that proposal, understanding that two thirds of the profits of sales were to be mine if I found the cash orders for 200 copies—I was supplied at my own expense with printed subscription forms—I sent £9 1s. 9d. towards about 100 copies, and received receipts signed, "J. Sidney Tomkins, Secretary"—at that time subscriptions from my friends began to fall off, and I received an offer from Morgan to publish my novel at the Christmas season of 1887 for £10—I paid that to Morgan, who sent me this receipt, signed by himself my novel was never printed—I wrote from time to time protesting—I received letters in reply—I never received any proofs—on 9th July, 1888, wrote that unless they were prepared to carry out their contract I should</p>

I was formerly housekeeper at 59 and 60, Chancery Lane—the first man I saw there in connection with the Authors' Alliance was Morgan the day after the office was started and opened he was joined by Tomkins, and a very short time afterwards by Tolmie—Clarke I have seen at the office many times; I thought he was Campbell; I did not know his name at the time—I have seen 8ir Gilbert at the office—I know nothing about Steadman when they were there everything they could get hold of was delivered there, cigars, wines, portmanteaus, and different goods—I ascertained cigars were brought there, so many people came with bills, and told me they were cigars, and asked me if they should leave them without the money—the goods were mostly delivered in the name of Tomkins—I have seen Tomkins, Tolmie, and Morgan in the office together, with another nun when goods were delivered, and I have then heard Tomkins asked for, and Tomkins told them he was not in, but if they would leave the goods Mr. Tomkins would be back in about twenty minutes, or directly, and would give them the money; all sorts of excuses were made—sometimes people left the goods, and when they came back for the money they never got it; perhaps they had gone and taken the goods with them—people very often called—they never found Tomkins and the money there at the same time—I saw scores of ladies and clergymen—Tomkins was very seldom there; he would come and get his letters and</p>

               <p>slip off again, unless there was something coming in—that was after the distress—one old lady waited there for months, bringing her knitting and sewing—I have heard Tomkins asked by these people for their manuscripts he has said the reader or publisher had it—I saw one gentleman, dissatisfied with the explanation, give Tomkins a shaking—I saw the place every day for some months—all the business I saw going on was people coming and wanting their papers, and so on—they kept the key for a long time after the distress and sale of the things; the premises were locked up—they had an agreement for three years—they used to come for their letters, but there was no furniture in the place—I kept observation on the rooms—Tolmie came there—I found they had an office at Finsbury Pavement, and I went there and found they had a distress there that morning—Tolmie came there, and when he left I followed—he went all round the back turnings, and five times he took me to the Swan public-house—he looked in there—I left him there—next day I went again before they came for their letters, and I followed another man, and I found Tomkins and another man standing against the swan—I asked Tomkins for the key; he said he had not got it, but that Morgan had—I said, "I am going to stick to you till you see Morgan"—I stuck to him for about two hours, and then he said, "If you give me back the papers which are in the office I will give you the key; it is in my pocket"—I got the key—that was in August, 1889, I believe.</p>

I live at 30, Fleet Street—in 1888 I lived at 40, Amhurst Boad, Hackney—Clarke then lived at 27, Amhurst Road—I used to cash cheques for him from time to time—on 7th April, 1888, he brought me this cheque, on the Royal Exchange Bank, signed for the Authors' Alliance by W.

Clarke, in Clarke's writing—he asked me to cash it; I did so, and paid it into my bankers—a few days afterwards it was returned marked "N.

J. Morgan, for the Authors' Alliance," and endorsed Sir Gilbert Campbell—they said it was post-dated, and I was to hold it over till 21st December—I gave £5 5s. to Clarke, Campbell being present—it was said that it would be an accommodation for Sir Gilbert Campbell if I cashed it—having got the money they went away—I sent the cheque to my bankers; I think it was paid in on 20th December, a day too soon, by mistake; I was away—it was returned, 'Refer to drawer"—I saw Clarke; I think he came to me—he was away at the time, but when he came back to his office I saw him—he said it would be all right—I was to let it be for a little while; I won't say those were the words—I never got the money—I sent my collector after Campbell, but never came into communication with him, and saw nothing more of him—Clarke introduced Campbell as a friend and as a writer who would perhaps put something in our way; we are publishers—I have been a member of the firm about five years.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This request contained a resolution of the board, at which Clarke, Tolmie, and Morgan were present, to open an account, cheques to be signed "Authors' Alliance, Limited, W. J. Morgan, Managing Director; Charles M. Clarke, Chairman"</hi>)—in accordance with that request an account was opened, and between 6th January, 1888, and 30th June £226 19s. 1d. was paid in—in July the account began with a debit balance of £1 8s. 8d., and to 31st December £201 8s. was paid in, less £2 9s. 6d., the balance against the company when the account closed—taking the other side, many cheques are drawn to numbers—I find the names Tomkins several times, Campbell May 25th, Tolmie June 1st, Campbell June 9th, and Tomkins and Clarke July 5th—then five guineas July 6th, and £8.15s. 10d.—then Tomkins, then numbers, then M. and T. August 11th; also July 23rd and four more—there is only about thirty shillings balance in April, 1888—between 23rd February and 18th May the account is slightly overdrawn—there was no authority to overdraw the accounts—on 31st December there was sixpence on the account—upon 17th May £65 was paid in, 30th May £75, 4th July £75, and 7th August £75.</p>

W.—there was also printed "Berners Gallery, Limited," and an address—the letter offered me a secretarial post at £150 a year, to increase annually £10 to £250 per annum—I was to pay £ 100, to be secured by a bond at 8 per cent, interest—in consequence of that letter I came to London, and saw Morgan at 8, Raebum Street—he told me he was an editor, that he wanted a secretary for an art institution, a registrar—he said he had sold the National Artistic Union—I asked him if the union he was going to establish was perfectly <hi rend="italic">bona fide;</hi> he said it was—he mentioned the premium and gave me four references—he first offered them as a guarantee of his respectability (Tolmie, a solicitor; S.

               <p>those references—I believed them to be honest—in December, 1889 I went to John Street, Adelphi, to an office on the ground floor "Artists' Alliance" was painted on the glass door—I saw a draft of this printed prospectus in Morgan's writing in January, 1890—the paragraph at the bottom is my writing under Morgan's instructions, written in March or April, 1890. (<hi rend="italic">That the list of original members was closed "in April last," but the Honorary Council had much pleasure in reopening the list by the addition of fifty members" and visitors were invited to apply to become members</hi>)—I paid my £100, I think, on 2nd December, 1889, in Bank of England notes to Morgan, at 9, John Street—Tolmie came there; not often at the commencement, but more frequently towards the close—I saw Clarke once, and Tomkins three or four times—my work was to address applications to artists, inviting subscriptions, and send out prospectuses through the post, and letters were written; I got the names and addresses from directories—I confined my letters of application to artists; in response, members were enrolled and sent subscriptions—cheques would come of one and two guineas, and sometimes postal orders—I used to address people in the country; I believe they were all artists—I never saw any meeting of the Honorary Council—I never saw Campbell—I do not remember seeing Mr. Viner—I believe the Rev, Mr. Moulton called once to ask when the opening of the gallery would be—Mr. Phillips, M.R.C.S., called to pay a subscription—C.L. Clarke, M.L.D., called once; also the Rev. J.L. Hall, M.A., to know when to exhibit, and inquire about the gallery—his name appears, as he was invited by Morgan to join the Honorary Council; I cannot say if he gave authority for that—the society was at John Street from December, 1889, to July, 1890—letters, in response to applications, continued to come in to the end of December, 1890, from the time of issuing the prospectuses—some were addressed to me, and some to the society—Morgan opened all letters; I saw cheques in his possession—they were frequently drawn to my order—I did not endorse them—I do not know who did—they never passed through my hands at all except for salary and repayment of my £100; I endorsed those—I cannot give the average of receipts—I never saw any book or anything to give an estimate from—I had an art directory—the only books kept by tin Artists' Alliance, at John Street, were the expense book for postage stamps and an alphabetical register of members—I was not altogether satisfied, but this was entirely new to me; I had never been connected with any art society before—that was my first residence in London—I had been a schoolmaster in the country up to that time—I received cheques for the first month's salary—the second month I had to wait till March—then it was regular; I have nothing owing for salary—in July we moved to 20, York Buildings—on one door was painted "Artists Alliance," and on the inner door "James Longman and Co."—the business there was very much the same, with only the books I have spoken of—I saw Steadman there—I became dissatisfied in January, 1890—I gave Morgan notice in writing <hi rend="italic">to</hi> repay my £100 and terminate the agreement—I had that right under the fourth clause—I did not get my £100—Aforgan said he could not pay then, he would pay as soon as he was able—then the agreement of 5th February, 1890, was entered into—he then I owed me £15 4s. for services rendered—in that agreement the £100 was to be repaid to me, with 8 per cent, interest, within two months from the 2nd</p>

I live at Coombe Park, West Berks—in June, 1891, I received a communication, with a. prospectus of the International Society of Literature, Science, and Art, and a members' application form attached. (<hi rend="italic">The letter invited him to become a fellow, as, with a view of making the society thoroughly representative, a resolution had been passed that a number of members of learned societies should be eligible for election on payment of fees; it was signed Steadman</hi>)—I believe I the statement that a resolution had been passed—I received this diploma, signed W.J. Morgan, curator; Maunder Hill, secretary; Tolmie and Houston, councillors—I also received a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Pantheon</hi>, the official journal of the society, and thereupon I paid a cheque for two guineas, and got this receipt, signed Steadman—on 25th March I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the council had determined he was at liberty to wear the hood and gown, the price of which was</hi> £4 4s.)—in May this year I sent another annual subscription of two guineas, and received this receipt, signed Maunder Hill, secretary; I did not apply for the hood" and gown—my knowledge of the society was got entirely from the documents sent me; I was led to accept in consequence of the names I saw on the circular; I thought that such persons would not be likely to lend their names to any institution that was not thoroughly genuine and sound.</p>

P., of South Shields-that was the only complaint I heard of—no concerts or entertainments were given before October, 1891—the musical department was one of the latest opened by the society—Mr. Pearce was engaged at the time we left York Buildings, which was on the 1st or 2nd October, to work up the musical department, and these concerts were the result of that department's operations—I know nothing about this lodger; it is the first time I have seen the figures—I first saw the books at the gallery on my return from my holidays in August, 1891.</p>

               <p>there—I only saw him there two or three times after I was engaged—they were ail down at York Buildings when I was at the Marlborough Gallery at first, with the exception of their employes—I saw Morgan and Tolmie at York Buildings, and I think Hill—I was introduced to Campbell there as the president, I think—I did not see Steadman there—I saw him about five times in all at the gallery—I last saw him at the end of September or beginning of October, 1891—he and Morgan went out together then—I saw Campbell once at York Buildings and two or three times at Marlborough Street—I saw him there on days on which I was told a council meeting was going to be held—they did not come to Marlborough Street till October, 1891; and it would be after October, 1891, that I saw Campbell there—I was appointed solicitor to the society in the action brought by the society against Mrs. Alcock—books had been kept by the society up to that time, and they were lying about—I asked Morgan who was to be made the plaintiff in the action—it was determined that Hill should be made the plaintiff—I advised them that at the next council meeting they should appoint Hill plaintiff; it did not seem quite dear from the Act of Parliament who should be appointed—I cannot say I looked into the Mortmain Act very carefully—I was only solicitor to the society—by my advice Hill was made plaintiff—it became necessary to make an affidavit of documents, and about then the books were all lost in an omnibus, so I was told—I saw nothing in the society itself to object to—I got no salary after the first month, except that I got a small commission on the 100 letters a week—I paid £200; I got £12 10s. in cash, and gave the whole of my year's work; but I carried on business there, and I thought I would take it out in rent; I was not very pleased.</p>

Viscount Moles worth, and the other was, I think, Lady Willoughby d'Eresby—I introduced also the Duchess of Newcastle, the Duchess of Portland, and the Duchess of Sutherland; I mean I wrote letters to and got answers from them—I never imagined I was assisting in a fraud—members' pictures were properly hung at the gallery—I know there were several members who received paid engagements; I have seen their receipts, and the cheques of some—I know great efforts were being made to induce people to come to the concerts—I was present at the concert at Steinway Hall—I know the society expended £49 over it, at any rate—I had all the receipts—the amount was made rather less in order to bring it within the County court; certain claims were not pressed—I never saw you act as James Longman and Co.—no pictures were ever hung in the w. c.; I believe one was found there—it was not used as a w. o.; it was stopped up, and used as a store-room—a bill of the Guardian Insurance office was hung up in my office over a picture, and the picture could not be found—I don't know if I hung up the bill; if I did not a clerk did by my instructions—I was agent for the Guardian, and no one was interested in that office bat me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective, of New Scotland Yard—on 7th June I arrested Clarke at the Banbridge Police-station, county Down—I said, "Is your name Charles Montagu Clarke?"—he replied, "Yes"—I said, "I am an officer of the London Metropolitan Police; I hold a warrant for your arrest"—I read the warrant to him—it charged hint with conspiracy and fraud—he said, "Very well, I know the persons you refer to, and I am not 'surprised at two of them getting into trouble, Tolmie and Morgan, but I cannot understand about Sir Gilbert Campbell, and I have read about the case in the paper, but I have had nothing to do with it; in fact, I caused my solicitor to write them a letter about my name being on the prospectus without my sanction"—I conveyed him to London, and charged him at Bow Street—he made no further reply—he said he was of no occupation—an officer at Banbridge offered me a pocket-book which he said, in Clarke's presence, he took from him—it contained letters and memoranda, including four cheques, one payable to Dr. Clarke for five guineas, also a card of Sir Gilbert Campbell, and two envelopes addressed in print of Dr. C. Montagu Clarke (<hi rend="italic">documents produced</hi>)—I arrested Sherwin, who was afterwards discharged—I arrested Tolmie on 4th June—I took him to Bow Street, where he was charged—I found on Tolmie, or at his house, paper headed "Association of Accountants and Auditors, Sir G. Campbell, Bart., President;" visiting cards in the name of Ward; letters relating to the International Society, forwarding prospectuses; a letter addressed to Sir G. Campbell, which had passed through the post, threatening proceedings for rent, from 9, Prince of "Wales's Road • a letter to Tolmie that the authorities from Scotland Yard were after them; and several letters requesting return of money sent for Treatise on Double Entry from different persons—on Clarke I found paper headed "Dramatic Union, Wardour Street; Music conducted by Dr. C. M. Clarke, 1d. weekly;" a pawnticket in the name of O. M. Clarke, Amhurst Road, for 15s. for a belt, and dated 24th April, 1891—I had seen Clarke write, and know his writing—the reference stating the Authors' Alliance would be desirable customer, and that Clarke had known the manager, W.

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department,—about three p.m. on 4th June I saw Tolmie and Morgan at 89, Great Marlborough Street, a picture gallery called the International Society of Literature, Science and Art—I had a conversation with them at the time—at 8.30 p.m. I spoke to Morgan in Piccadilly I called him by his name—I said I had a warrant for his arrest—he asked what it was about—I read it to him—he said, "That is a long way to go back; who is doing this?"—I said, "The Treasury solicitor is prosecuting"—he said, "What is it in connection with?"—I said, "The Literary and Artistic Union in Berners Street, and the society you ran in connection with that in Bloomsbury Mansions"—he said, "I don't know anything about them"—I then said, "There is also a Charing Cross Publishing Company, the City of London Publishing Company, the Authors' Alliance, the Artists' Alliance, and the one you are now carrying on is the International"—he said, "This will do me a lot of harm with the International"—I said, "If that is the society you represent it to be, and you will give me the names of some responsible persons in connection with it, I will see them before removing the documents and pictures to Scotland Yard"—he said, "I do not know whether I am doing right in saying anything without seeing my solicitor"—I said, "Whatever you say may be used in evidence against you"—he answered, "I thought so, and I shan't say any more"—I asked if he would give his address—he said, "Not till I have seen my solicitor"—I said, "I think you live at 38, Lynette Avenue"—he said, "Yes; that is right" and "This is a funny thing for the Public Prosecutor to do, as I have taken Mr. Wontner's advice on this matter, and</p>

               <p>he is the Public Prosecutor, is he not?"—I said, "No, he is not; but he often appears for him at the Police-court"—he was taken to Bow Street Police-station by Sergeant Sexton—the same evening, about eleven, I saw Tolmie detained at Bow Street—I read the warrant to him—he answered, "I did not know Morgan in 1881"—I said, "No; I think your case begins with the Authors' Alliance, and goes through the Artists' Alliance and the present society"—he said, "The present society is a genuine one"—I said, "Very well, if you will give me the names of any responsible persons I will see them"—he said, "Oh, we can do that," and gave the name of Madame Dinnay D'Arc, West Square, Kennington—as I was about to write it he said, "Give me the paper, and I will write it for you"—he wrote it on this paper I am refreshing my memory from—I said, "Anyone else?"—he replied, "Yes," and turning to Morgan said, "We can give some more?"—Morgan replied, "No, we can't; not without our books"—Tolmie then returned this paper to me—the same night I went to 8, Barnard's Inn, Holborn—I there arrested Sir G. Campbell upon a warrant—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I suppose Labby has done this?"—I said, "I do not know why you should think so"—he said, "Oh, yes; he has been giving it to us in <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> lately; I do not know where I have benefited by these things"—I said, "You had some cheques from Morgan, and you held some shares in the Authors' Alliance"—he said, "I have had some cheques, but I never held any shares in the Authors' Alliance, and the present society is all right"—I then conveyed him to Bow Street, and he was charged with the other prisoners—they made no reply—on 4th July I saw Steadman at the back of the Police-court at Bow Street, detained—I said, "Steadman, I am Inspector Richards"—he said, "Oh, how do you do? I have seen your name in the papers in connection with this case. Look here, I should like to help you all I can in this matter, and I should like you to say this for me: I acted entirely under Morgan's directions in this matter, and he drew up all the agreements that I have used. And as for Longman and Co., he told me he had bought their business, and he had a banking account in that name at the British Mutual Bank"—I had been making inquiries with regard to the societies mentioned for three or four months prior to last June—on 30th March I went to the Marlborough Gallery; when I got inside the door I saw Tolmie—he said, "Yes sir, what do you require?"—I said, "I came in to look at the pictures"—he said, "Oh, are you a member?"—I said, "No, but I thought it was open to the public"—he replied, "Well, yes, but they are usually introduced by members"—Morgan then joined us, and said, "Are you an artist, sir?"—I said, Not exactly, but I am interested in societies of this kind, and I know of persons exhibiting here"—he then showed me the pictures and a diploma similar to one produced; there were about 500 of them—the diploma was signed by Morgan and Tolmie—I said, "Are you Mr. Morgan?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Is that Mr. Tolmie?"—he said "Yes"—I then thanked him for showing me round, and he handed me circulars and a prospectus like those produced (one <hi rend="italic">Pantheon</hi>)—while I was there a stranger called for a manuscript—Tolmie looked to Morgan, who said, "Oh, yes; it is in the hands of our readers"—amongst the works of art in the gallery was hanging Sir G. Campbell's commission in the 92nd Regiment, of the date of 8th June, 1862—the next time I called was to</p>

               <p>arrest Morgan—I searched the gallery after Morgan's arrest, and found and now produce forty-eight letters from different persons complaining of the Artists' Alliance, and asking for the return of their pictures; a letter addressed to C. M. Clarke, Esq., Councillor, 38, Great Marlborough Street; a letter from a gentleman suggesting that he recognised Morgan's writing in connection with the Berners Gallery, Limited, and asking what had become of it, as he was a member; a letter from San Francisco in reference to a picture which had been sent, and which the society had promised to purchase; some letters asking for return of subscriptions, on the ground that the writers had mistaken W. J. Morgan for W. G. Morgan, a Birmingham artist—Morgan's replies are on the backs of those letters—a Birmingham subscriber got his subscription returned after correspondence—I also found prospectuses of the three kinds produced, a number of pictures in the gallery and in the room occupied by Du Bois as solicitor—there they were mixed with empty boxes, and appeared to have been thrown away—the size of the gallery was about forty to forty-five feet by twenty feet, or almost half as long as this Court, but not so high—the pictures in places were three thick on the wall, the smaller ones being behind; you could not see them—I found this minute-book (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 17) and this list of members (<hi rend="italic">a small book</hi>), forms of application torn from the prospectuses—I added them together, I added the amounts, which came to £2,450—I do not know the writing or the 346 names in the list of members—I find, from the application forms, members were mainly proposed by Morgan and Tolmie, and a few by C. M. Clarke, <hi rend="largeCaps">LL</hi>.

I have lived at Woodlands for the last two years, from 1890 to 1892—I never read <hi rend="italic">Truth;</hi> I just heard there was something in it in connection with the Artists' Alliance; I had not enough time to read it—I went to the offices in the Adelphi; I don't know whom I saw there—I paid my subscription to Morgan, as far as I remember; I did so by letter, enclosing P. O.—I replied to a circular,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120112"/>
               <p>which had, as far as I remember, Morgan's name upon it as proposing me as a member, on one of these forms—I did not know him up to that time; as far as I remember he solicited me to become a member—I cannot say if his name was on the form; I believe it was—I cannot say if the premises were at York Street or John Street; they were in the Adelphi—I don't think I noticed what names were outside the door; I don't remember the name of James Longman and Co.—I heard and understood Sherwin's evidence in this case—I heard him say that one-third of the subscriptions which he solicited went to him, and two-thirds to Morgan—I cannot say I have any reasons for believing it—if that was the arrangement, I don't think I should still believe in the honesty of the Artists Alliance—although I paid no subscription in 1891 I remained a member for that year; the subscription was not asked for—I don't know if that is usual in honest societies; I should not have thought it was usual in dishonest societies; I thought it was an argument in favour of the genuineness of it—I had no intimation that I had ceased to be a member because my subscription was not paid—in 1892 I think I paid my subscription to Morgan, I cannot swear; I paid it then to the International Society; I thought the Artists' Alliance had been absorbed into that society—no one told me that; I suppose I got the idea from the prospectus, sent by Morgan as far as I am aware—I inferred it—Morgan sent the prospectus—he did not propose me—when I enclosed my subscription I said I supposed that would make me a member of the International—I have only seen Morgan the last few days, as far as I know—I have heard the agreement between Morgan and Steadman read, under which they proposed to divide the subscriptions received through Steadman's solicitations; I did not think it sounded very well or the society genuine—I never heard complaints against this society before this trial—I should not have paid my subscriptions to the Artists' Alliance, or to the International Society, if I had known that one was divided into thirds and the other into halves between Steadman and Morgan—I obtained no benefit from the societies—I don't know any of the members.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">acknowledged that this was an error, and that he should have said Hill, instead of Sherwin</hi>)—there is no "proposed" on this form of application for the Artists' Alliance—to my knowledge there was no other form than this appearing on the prospectus—the Steadman agreement refers to the International Union, a different society to either the International Society or the Artists' Alliance—I should not have thought the International Society was not genuine on account of this agreement as to the International Union I think it might have shaken my belief in the society—if it was a wrong agreement, and had been abandoned, I think I should have thought it was an agreement that was not a good agreement—I did not pay my subscription in 1891, because I got a report from the Artists' Alliance stating that subscriptions paid during the year 1890 entitled members to the advantages offered for the whole of 1891—it appeared by the report that this offer was made to members to extend their subscription! because the society was a young one; members who had joined had had</p>

I live at 16, North Road, New Cross—I have been a letterpress printer for about forty years—I have printed for you in connection with the Charing Cross Publishing Company and the International Society since 1875—those publishing companies have published a large number of magazines—I have printed some of them, and I have seen others in circulation which I have not printed, and which I believe were published by the company; I believe I printed all these copies of the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Magazine</hi>—the printer's name is not on any of them, only the publisher's—the Charing Cross Publishing Company published them—I see here different numbers of the <hi rend="italic">London and St. Leonards Magazine</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">London and Brighton Magazine</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">London and Scarborough Magazine</hi>, published by the Charing Cross Publishing Company—I did not print them—this is a bundle of numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Charing Gross Magazine</hi>, published by the Charing Cross Publishing Company—(<hi rend="italic">Morgan produced a number of different books as published by the Charing Cross Publishing Company</hi>)—these purport to be published by that company—I printed some of them—I believe we printed about 2,000 copies of this "Tried and Approved Recipes, by a Lady"—in all cases where we printed books for the Charing Cross Publishing Company it was a real <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> printing of an edition—the company always paid me very satisfactorily—these are copies of the <hi rend="italic">St. George's Magazine</hi>, which purports to be published by the City of London Publishing Company, Unlimited—T have known you seventeen years; your general reputation has always been that of an honest and respectable man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. When I first knew Morgan, about 1875, the Charing Cross Publishing Company was in existence at 5, Friar Street—that was wound up about February, 1880, I believe—Tomkins was secretary of the company—I saw him several times when I called at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120114"/>
               <p>the office there—I don't know if they lived there, or where they lived—I know nothing of the City of London Publishing Company; I did no business with it—my friendship with Morgan was kept up—the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Magazine</hi>, which I printed for Morgan, was in existence before it came to me, and we printed it for about a year, or sixteen months, perhaps—I never heard that Morgan advertised for an editor for it, with a premium of £306—I don't know who the contributors to the magazine were—I know the City of London Publishing Company was one of Morgan's ventures—I believe he was associated with Tomkins in it—I believe it was wound up; I don't know when—I did not know he was putting forward the prospectus of the National Artistic Union—I knew him all the time, but I did not know he was putting forward the Literary and Artistic Union at Berners Street—I only knew he was associated with Tomkins in the Charing Cross and City of London Publishing Companies—I only knew Tomkins as associated with Morgan in those businesses—I did not know they left Berners Street and Friar Street in debt for rent—I did not know Morgan was trading as Bevington and Co. in John Street, Adelphi, in 1887—my acquaintance with him was kept up casually—I should shake hands with him if I met him, and so forth; he was still Morgan to me—I did not know he was promoting the Authors' Alliance at the end of 1887; he came to me in 1887 or 1888 for an estimate for printing for the Authors' Alliance, but my estimate was too high, unfortunately, and I did not get the job—I only knew him as Morgan—I never heard of him as Mr. W. James, the secretary of the Authors' Alliance; I should be surprised to hear it; I don't know that if I had known it it would have induced me to think he was not a honest and respectable man; there are many reasons why he might have a <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi>—I don't mean that he should put it on the prospectus which he was issuing to the public; I don't think a man would be justified in doing that, nor in figuring as a director on the same prospectus in the name of W. J. Morgan—his appearence in the double capacity would be likely to shake my confidence unless it was explained—I did not know of the Artists' Alliance—I went to York Buildings when he was carrying on business there—I saw the name of James Longman on the outside—I did not know Morgan was James Longman and Co., who I thought was another tenant in the same building, and quite distinct from the Artists' Alliance; that was the impression left on my mind—if I had known Morgan was that company I should very likely have asked him a question about it, as I was going in on business then—I did not know him as connected with the International Union—I knew him next at York Street as connected with the International Society, which I believe was a development of a previous society, whether the Union or not I cannot say—I got an order from him at Marlborough Street to print prospectuses, note headings, letter-headings, cards of admission to the gallery, and concert bills for various concerts—we printed about 20,000 prospectuses a month, I should think—sometimes my attention was called to them to look at printers' errors; I know they were different; as they got new members the front page was changed—I did not notice the Executive Council was constantly changing; I know the members were—I knew Morgan throughout the whole of the time between 1880 and 1890; we were not on visiting terms, but when we met we shook hands—I did not know him as advertising for secretaries in connection with the Authors' Alliance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120115"/>
               <p>and International Society with premiums, or for a registrar with premium for the Authors' Alliance—I think I saw an advertisement for artists to appear at an International Society concert—I have only known Tolmie since I met him at the Marlborough Gallery in association with Morgan—Tomkins was not there, to my knowledge—I did not see Clarke or Campbell—I saw Steadman at York Buildings; a portrait of him there drew my attention to him—I know nothing about them being in Chancery Lane—I was present at Bow Street occasionally when this case was on; I have not been in this court—my opinion of Morgan remains unchanged—I have read one or two accounts in the papers of the proceedings here, but they have been very meagre, and I could form no opinion from them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I know that the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Magazine</hi> was very well written, but I could not say from memory who the authors were—my impression is that Friar Street was only used as an office—I understood the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Magazine</hi> had been printed for some time before I had the printing of it; we took it over from another printer—I know no one who new you as Bevington and Co.—I cannot call to mind any alteration in the International Society's prospectus' except as to some of the names; I believe there was no other change; when I took to printing it the smaller size was changed to the larger—I did not print the first lot; we always printed them the same size—I printed the <hi rend="italic">Pantheon</hi>, nearly 20,000 copies I believe—I called frequently at the Marlborough Gallery, sometimes daily; I never saw Steadman there—I met him once in the street outside—all my transactions with the society were perfectly satisfactory—I mean by that that I was always paid, except as to the last accounts, which were stopped in consequence of this prosecution.</p>

I live at 53, Harrington Street, Hampstead Road—I am now a canvassing agent for the London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow Insurance Company—I have a large experience in hanging pictures—I was the hanger engaged by the International Society of Literature, Science and Art, to unpack and hang the pictures of members of the Artists' Alliance and International Society, at the Marlborough Gallery—I received this letter signed "Morgan, Curator," engaging me on behalf of the society—I went for a week, and then was told I suited the society, and was engaged as hanger and remained on as a permanent servant—since that time I have hung pictures of members of the Alliance and the society—part of my duties was to pack carefully and return the unsold pictures when required by members and fellows—I have had such orders direct from the members, or Morgan has given me orders to return pictures—I had to enter those cases in the society's parcels book—when members or fellows desired their pictures returned they always were returned—I know pictures were properly hung in the exhibition; there were between 400 and 500 of them—endeavours were made week by week to sell pictures by distributing hundreds of free tickets of admission to the gallery—the tickets were sent to people living in fashionable neighbourhoods, to the aristocracy—sales were made, and the pictures so sold were sent to the buyers—I took them in some instances—the money for them was remitted to the authors—it was part of my duty to send the cheques off; I directed the envelopes, and put the inclosures in; I have seen the cheques—the gallery was properly adapted for the exhibition and sale of pictures, and had a good skylight; I should say the gallery, except as to height, would cover nearly three parts of this Court; it was about sixty feet long by twenty-five feet wide—these two boards were hung conspicuously outside the door, one on each side, on the railings every morning, with the names of the Artists' Alliance and of the International Society of Literature, Science, and Art, and the "Marlborough Gallery" on the top in gold—the gallery was on the ground floor—so far as I could see, the business of the society was conducted in a straightforward and business-like manner—you and the other officers of the society, Mr. Tolmie,</p>

               <p>Miss Kingham, and (until he left) Mr. Roden Pearce were in daily attendance—Mr. Hill called there almost daily—Mr. Du Bois was there; he had an office there—members of the council used to meet at the gallery at the council meetings once a month, or sometimes oftener—I hare daily seen the minute-book, membership and fellowship roll, day-book, ledger, cash-book, and postage-book—I saw the original minute-book of the society up to the beginning of May, until it was lost in the omnibus—I have heard members who called say they were pleased at the work done by the society; several expressed their pleasure at seeing the gallery—fifteen or twenty members were calling every week, apart from the general public—I knew they were members by bringing cards of admission—if they had not got a card I should have had asked for it if I had been there—concerts were given at high-class West-end concert halls by the society, and members and fellows of the society engaged to sing and play at them—it was the object of the officers to get the honorary members and fellows to attend those concerts, and circulars were sent inviting them to attend at half-price—once a month the pictures were rearranged and rehung, some pictures having been sold and taken away, and fresh works having come in—to my knowledge the pictures were not hung two or three deep, one over the other—Richards said it was so; it is not true—the only foundation for the statement is that a few days or perhaps a fortnight before the arrest, a large picture "Alexander in the Tents of Darius" was sent by Mr. Massey from Newcastle, and there was no room for it except at the end of the gallery, and it was put on the floor there and covered others—Mr. Massey said he thought it was an old master, and sent it for us to obtain an expert's opinion upon it—it was only placed there temporarily till the opinion was obtained—apart from that every picture in the gallery could be seen—they were all properly catalogued in this catalogue, which I made myself—one old painting was placed in a small closet, a disused w. c, used as a storeroom, leading out of Mr. Du Bois' room; it had come by rail and was damaged, and I put it there until it had been repaired—to my knowledge no pictures were out of the way except that one—I should have known it—downstairs in the lower gallery, in the basement, the musical department, there were twenty to twenty-five pictures—that basement was properly boarded, and had a glass ceiling, and the light was almost as good downstairs as upstairs—the pictures there were some set out and some waiting packed up to go back—none were thrown away downstairs—I had often seen you put the account books of the society in your black bag in the evening when leaving—you said you were going to work upon them at home, as you had had no time during the day; and you said you did as much work at home with the books as at the gallery—you were interrupted at the gallery by callers—up to the beginning of May I saw the books there every day—I remember advertisements being inserted in the papers about the lost books—I believe one officer called while I was out one day—copies of the <hi rend="italic">Pantheon</hi> containing an invitation to a meeting of fellows and members, on 25th May, were sent to members—as forms of applications came in they were numbered and placed on a table with others—I have read some of the application forms so signed and filed, and found they corresponded with the names on the prospectus—when I was there first there</p>

               <p>was a needlework department for art needlework, which was carefully shaken and dusted and covered up at night when the gallery was closed; in short, every care was taken of the members and fellows' work sent in for exhibition and sale—members of the Alliance and of the Society were treated with equal consideration at the exhibitions, no difference was made between them—I never heard of your representing yourself as James Longman and Co.—I saw no business done by that firm—I did not know anything of you at York Buildings—I had a card with the name "W. James" on it left one day to give to you as you were out; I gave it to you, and you asked me what sort of a person he was to the best of my recollection—Sir Gilbert Campbell's commission was hung in the musical department on a place for a gas bracket; it was not in the gallery.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. I gave Mr. James's card to Morgan; I never saw it again—I am positive the gentleman who called with it was distinct from Morgan—I know Morgan's writing, and have seen his figures from time to time in different books—I should say each of these four letters, addressed to Mr. James, 8, Raeburn Street, Brixton, is endorsed with the date of their receipt in his writing—Morgan's private address, where he used to take the books home, was 38, Lynnett Avenue, Brixton—this letter is addressed, James, 38, Lynnett Avenue—I still say that another person left the card—Morgan took home all the books but the ledger and cash-book; he left two at the gallery—I have seen him take those two home, but they were the two most frequently left—I cannot say I have seen him take all at the same time; I never looked particularly—all the books were not missing from the gallery—this minute-book was bought after the old one was finished and lost; I know nothing of when this minute was made in it—Hill was secretary of the International Society—Locke and Houston called there; Tolmie was there every day—Stone came there—they were officers of the Society—I was never at a council meeting, but I was in the gallery when it was held—it was held once a month, or sometimes once in three weeks—Morgan, Tolmie, Stone, and Houston attended the meetings; they were all I can call to mind—I saw Campbell there once, some time at the beginning of March this year, I should say; he called to see Morgan, but Morgan was not there—I only had one complaint about the pictures, and that was my fault because I did not forward one—I heard one gentleman ask for a manuscript to be returned; but I heard no complaint; I was downstairs principally—there were two parcel-books, an old and new one, in which everything sent out was entered; they would show the pictures I returned—I have enclosed cheques to various people—I only saw three pictures sold there from 3rd February to 4th June—I sent one cheque to Mr. Mortimer, I believe about the middle of May, I should say—the cheque was given me to enclose in an envelope with a communication—cheques were sent to a number of other people, not to artists—all the works that came under my notice were in admirable condition—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was downstairs in the lower gallery behind a portfolio—that and these were not exhibited, and I know nothing of them, they were simply put on one side in a port folio in the lower gallery—there was an accident to this terra-cotta exhibit—I believe it was in the place where the packing-cases were—to the best of my belief there were no pictures there as if they had been</p>

               <p>thrown away among the packing-cases, they were all in portfolios—I have since heard of a picture, in the disused w. c, which was alleged to have been covered up by a Guardian Fire notice, but I never saw it till I saw it here—I saw by the prospectus that there was an educational department, and that examinations were held—no examinations to my knowledge were held during the time I was there—I don't know who the examiners were—I cannot say whether a register of professors, governesses, and private tutors was kept—no operation in connection with the purchase, sale, or transfer of scholastic business came under my knowledge; I was the hanger in the artistic department—we had many pictures sent to us to forward to other London and provincial galleries; I have taken pictures to the Dudley and to the Institute of Lady Water Colour Painters, and pictures went to the Institute of Water Colours—Miss Kingham was in charge of the musical department after Mr. Roden Pearce left—no concert was given at Marlborough Gallery during my time; there were some given at other places—Mrs. Alcock's concert was before I went there—Mr. Du Bois conducted his solicitor's business in the room running out from the gallery, and distinct from it, and leading out of his room was the disused w. c.—there were two entrances into his room, one from the gallery and one from the passage; but one was fixed by the bookcase in front of it—in Mr. Du Bois' room the council meetings were held after he had left for the day—sometimes he left at twelve o'clock, but usually it was three or half past three—I have seen a council meeting at two, and later; it depended on whether Mr. Du Bois' room was disengaged; he always had previous notice of a meeting—I cannot say where the educational or literary department was carried on—I read in the prospectus that they were branches—I did not take the liberty of asking—I could not say if anything was done in connection with those branches—I did not know Morgan was trading as Longman, at York Buildings, at this time; I never went there—I understand there had been offices there, but I did not know that he still had offices there——if I was there it would be my duty to ask visitors to the gallery, for their cards of membership; the gallery was open to a limited number of the public; it Was said to be open to the public—I asked for cards of membership because I had to make a list of all callers and give it to Morgan—I did not take names and addresses—Morgan engaged me, and I received my salary from him—I don't know if he was the International Society; I did not go into the working of it; it was enough for me to get my money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took it you paid me as the officer of the society in the same way as you paid others—I have posted letters you have written, and proofs you have sent to authors—I have taken to General Abbot, at the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly, proofs of a book being published by the literary department, I believe—I did not know that Tolmie was manager of the educational department—I have seen examination papers lying on the table at times—I can say, from seeing papers, that work was done in those departments—I have no more knowledge as to those matters than by taking proofs and seeing papers—I did not see the amount of the cheque sent to Mr. Alexander Mortimer; I. should think it was before May—here is an entry in the pass-book on March 1st, Alexander Mortimer, £5 18s. 6d.; I do not know what commission you charged—I</p>

               <p>was always under the impression that these dusty pictures did not belong to any member or fellow of the society; the pictures belonging to them were properly numbered and catalogued—I heard Mr. Du Bois say yesterday that he had covered up this picture—I am certain Mr. James called and left his card and asked for it to be given to you.</p>

I live at 26, Enmore Road—I am a Director of the Isle of Wight Railway Company, and of two other rail way companies—I am a member of the International Society-in December, 1891, I attended one of the concerts of the International Hall—I was pleased with it, considering that it was carried on by members of the society—I understood that all the artists were members of the society; I knew no one connected with the society but yourself; and that was the only occasion I availed myself of my membership—in June, 1891, before I became a member, I purchased two members' pictures—on 6th June, 1891, I received a letter from Steadman, the secretary, inviting me to become a fellow, and a prospectus, and I called at the gallery to see what the company was represented by—up to that time I had not heard of the society—I called; and considered the society respectable—I saw you and bought two pictures—you said a good deal in favour of the society, and made yourself very pleasant, and I said I would consider whether I should become a fellow or member; I said I had a son, a student at King's College in the art class; and you recommended that he should become a junior member at half-a-guinea—I said I would consider that, and on 17th June I became a member and sent this cheque for £11 1s. 6d. to your order in your capacity as curator, for myself and my son—I joined because I thought it might be useful to my son to exhibit a picture there—I think that this cheque has been passed through * the British Mutual Bank—I afterwards received another letter from Steadman, asking me to become a fellow; I took no notice of it—I knew nothing of the society beyond the prospectus.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Ashchurch Road, Shepherd's Bush—I am an English timber valuer—I was a member of the council of the International Society from September, 1891, till the arrest—council meetings were held every month; business was conducted regularly at them—an agenda paper was prepared, which you handed to the chairman—the members of the council made suggestions and discussed matters, and the suggestions were put and adopted or rejected—Campbell was chairman up to December, and after that Tolmie was elected chairman for 1892—the minutes of the previous meeting were always read and confirmed and signed by the chairman—I, as a member of the council, had confidence in you, and so far as I know the councillors as a body had confidence in you—I recognised you as manager of the society in everything, all the time I was there—the council knew you received the moneys—I don't doubt you did so on their authority—no authority was given when I was there; it may have been given before—your signature was on all cheques for work done as a member of the council, and for canvassing letters—I wrote letters—I received no payment as member of the council, there were no directors' fees, but I received payment for writing letters soliciting subscriptions—I was paid £1 for 300 letters, and 15 per cent, commission by you—I believe whenever I received payment by cheque it was always signed with the stamp of the society, W. J. Morgan, curator sometimes I was paid by cash—between September, 1891, and the arrest I made an average of about £2 per week—I was a member of the society before September, 1891; not of the council; I was first connected with the society about the beginning of April, 1891, as assistant secretary—I got then £1 for 300 letters, and 15 per cent, commission—I was promoted from assistant-secretary to member of the council without any additional remuneration—I only heard of the International Union from papers sent; I knew nothing of its existence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner—on Monday, 8th August, I was called in to examine the body of the deceased child—it appeared to be about two and a half years old; it weighed twelve pounds four ounces——the proper weight of a child of that age is about twenty-five to twenty-six pounds—it was very thin, wasted; the eyes were sunken; its arms and legs were nothing but bones covered with skin; there was an absence of all fat; the body was in a very dirty state, with vermin both on the body and head—I saw the prisoner there at the time—she was intoxicated—I asked her if she was aware that the child had been ill very long—she said she had not noticed anything the matter with it—I subsequently made a post-mortem examination—the organs were all more or less healthy, with the exception of the lungs; they had a little old congestion, but not sufficient to account for death, there was very little blood in the veins, and it was very pale—I think</p>

               <p>the child died from an insufficient quantity of food, and not of proper quality—a child may die from food which it cannot digest—if it received improper food it would be thin, but not so thin as this was—there wag about an ounce of milk and water fluid in the stomach—the intestines were empty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were no marks of injury or violence—the child could be reduced to a wasted condition by giving it food which it cannot assimilate, but not so emaciated; starvation or improper food would present similar appearances—I would not say definitely which was the cause of death in this case.</p>

I then pointed the handle of the knife to her throat. She threw her hands up, and then said, 'Oh, Jim, see what you have done. 'I then caught hold of her wrist and saw it was bleeding, and said, 'Mate, it is an awful cut. 'I then turned round and cut my own throat with the same knife. "</p>

On 13th June I was on duty in the King's Road Police-station when the prisoners were brought in—they were charged with being concerned in cutting and wounding Edward Day, in Cahill Street, with intent to do him grievous bodily harm—on the charge being read to them Gillett said, "At the time the affair happened I was standing some little distance away from the others, wishing my sister, who lives in that neighbourhood, good night, and looking up I found something was wrong with my companions, and went toward them, and got taken"—Porselli said, "Do you think if I had done anything I would have come here?"—I said, "But you appear to have been brought here"—Zoller said, "I do not understand much English"—the next morning, about 3.30, a dark felt hat was brought to the station, indented at the top—I brought Gillett out of his cell, and he said, "That is my hat," he put it on, and it seemed to fit him well.</p>

I am a butcher, at High Street, South Norwood—on the night of 8th August, about a quarter to eleven, I was on the up relief platform at Hayes, and on a seat I saw a little girl lying on her face—I spoke to her—she did not appear able to answer—a handkerchief was tied tightly round her neck, knotted under the right ear—Frederick Groves was with me—I ran to fetch some of the railway officials, and found a booking clerk—the child's face was smothered in blood, and its clothes and hands—the face looked as if it was being strangled—I held her head up while Groves tried to cut the handkerchief with a knife, but he could not, it was so tightly tied, he kept snipping it—it was a very difficult thing—(<hi rend="italic">the child was called in</hi>)—that is the little girl—I took her to the Railway Arms, and asked the landlord to let us have some water to wash the child, or give it some drink—he refused—we asked him to allow us to have a cab to fetch a doctor he refused, and told us to take it back where we found it—the house is almost adjoining the Hayes Station—he refused us any assistance—I believe his name is Holmes—we took the child to a cottage opposite—the landlady there gave us water, and I carried the child until we met a police-constable—we then took it to a doctor's, and then to the Cottage Hospital—I asked the child her name—she gave her name and address, and also told us she had been to Reading—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the handkerchief—it was cut away a bit at a time—I asked her how she got to the seat—she said she crawled there.</p>

Smith at the commencement of the. claim she made against Mr. Park—I received from her this deed marked A, and this letter of instructions, and other documents, which were filed in Court—towards the end of January, 1887, Mrs. Emily Wright brought me a document purporting to be the will of Mr. J. C. Park, and about three weeks afterwards Smith called at my office; I showed it to her; she read it and asked me what I thought of it—I said I thought it a very dangerous document, and before she propounded it as a will she ought to consult some other solicitor—she tore it up and threw it into the fire, and said, "That is the best place for that"—I did not notice that she kept the signature—it said, "I give all I possess to Miss Smith, of Teddington," and the signature was across a penny stamp—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purports to be a copy, but it is written the other way of the paper—the witnesses' names are Ingram and Allistone we filed her claim under the deed, and acted for her up to the time she went to prison, after which we handed over some documents'</p>

Smith was charged in 1887—I am the person she mentions in her examination—I went with a police-officer to identify her, at 41, Talbot Road, when she was arrested—she and her sister and Paul were arrested together, and I charged with conspiring to defraud—Paul was not there at first; he came in afterwards, and was arrested—there is no truth in her allegation that I took possession of a tin box containing documents, or of any letters from Mr. Park to Mr. Park, jun—when Paul was arrested he was carrying a black bag, which was taken from him, and I found in it two documents marked J. P. 2 and J. P. 3; they purport to be copies—also J. P. 1, a penny memorandum-book, and the memorandum J.P. 5 that was in October, 1887—on November 9th, 1887, I took a statement from the prisoner Ingram, with a view of calling her as a witness for the prosecution, and she was called—she signed every page of her statement as it now appears—this is it—she says: "I know nothing whatever about Mr. Park's affairs, or if he left a will.

C. Park" and "I agree to the above" I believe are his writing, the other I am doubtful of; I do not believe it is his; the "k" is rather unlike his, but I should pass this as his writing—this cheque of January 12th, 1886, on plain paper, I know nothing of; he never signed cheques on plain paper, to my knowledge—these other cheques are signed by him—Mrs. Park was my stepmother; she had a paralytic stroke 1886—from my diary I fix the date, and that I left Auckland House on 8th September—Mrs. Park was then perfectly well—on Saturday, 11th September, 1886, I received a telegram, in consequence of which I drove to Havant from South Hayling, and went by the 3.18 Southwestern train to get the 6.20 for Teddington—I then found my stepmother suffering from a seizure.</p>

After the death, Smith claimed that the house had been bought, but when she saw me she never asserted such a claim—proceedings were taken on an alleged agreement, the signature to which was denied—between 1883 and 1886 fresh matters went to other solicitors; I had to take some up afterwards—he employed several solicitors—a draft settlement came into my hands in 1882—the lady's name was Miss Kemp—that settlement, on behalf of the son, fell "through in 1882 or 1883—Park wished his son to marry again before 1882, and in 1886, and names were mentioned.</p>

In Ingram's action an order was made that I was to deliver up all documents in my possession to the executors—among them were three letters and part of another one—this claim on the deed was under consideration, but I cannot speak to dates—I read through the letters a second time by special request—I applied for the Order on 18th July, 1888, that they should be destroyed—I did not keep them, because I was afraid of their getting into other hands than the executors, and I thought they ought not be parted with under any circumstances.</p>

Smith and Cornelius John Park—in December, 1889, I was staying at New Maldon, and Smith came to see me there twice—she asked me if I would make an affidavit of what I knew about Emily Wright—(I do not know whether Emily Wright was dead at that time), she asked me if I remembered Wright at Teddington—I said yes, and she asked me to go to London one day to See her, and then told me Emily Wright was dead, and that Mr. Park had left money to her, Miss Smith, by will, and if I made a statement she would give me something for my trouble; I believe it was £20—she gave me something that night, I cannot say how much—she came and saw me a few weeks afterwards, and in consequence of a letter I had I went to see her at Talbot Road, Bayswater—I took down a statement on another occasion, and she read it, and asked me to copy another paper which she had written out before I got there—when I had done it she asked me if I knew what an affidavit was; I said, "No"—she said, "Well, this is my affidavit and yours together"—I put it in an envelope and addressed it to Mr. Kimber, the solicitor—she said she would post it—she gave me something on that occasion—on one occasion I saw Mrs. Ingram with her—about the end of June, 1890, I went with her to Mr. Kimber's</p>

J. Park has my writing on it—Miss Smith gave it to me, and I wrote these words at her request—she did not dictate them; she gave me a book to copy them—the spelling is the same—after I wrote it she robbed it with her fingers to make it dirty, and said, "I have had it a long time in my box"—she took it to Mr. Kimber, and I heard her tell him that I had found it in my box—when I had sworn the affidavit she gave me 10s.—I said, "I do not know half what they have been reading"—she said, "I will get you an office copy, and you can. learn that"—she afterwards asked me to go to Auckland House to see Mrs. Park, so that if I was asked on the trial what Mrs. Park was like I could say what sort of person she was—some time afterwards she brought me an office copy of an affidavit, and told me to learn it—my address in it was 58, Chippendale Road, Harrow; I had never lived there—she said I was to go there and stay a few days before the trial, that they should not bother me, and I was to learn it like a book, because I might be cross-examined—on the day before the trial came on in Chancery she sent my expenses for the trial and a new bonnet—I saw her at the Court in the afternoon some days before I was called into the witness-box, and went with her to Warwick Road—she said she wanted to see me alone about the affidavit which was sworn, whether I knew it; she said, "Suppose I am the solicitor and you are the witness," and she cross-examined me on it—I could not answer—she said I might be all right when I came to the Court, and gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I was called at the Court the next day and cross-examined about my affidavit, and described how it came about—I spoke the truth—I never saw Smith afterwards—Mr. Kimber spoke to me after the case—I once saw a piece of paper in Smith's hand with a penny stamp on it, and "J. C. Park" written over the stamp, and there was writing above it—she showed it to me that I might mention on the trial how the paper was <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi>—this is what I copied: "In the years 1885-1886 I saw the said J.

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, which for many years I have made a study—I have carefully examined the signature on this deed, J. C. Park, with his genuine signatures on the cheques, and in my opinion it is not genuine—I can give reasons—I have also examined this signature on the letter of 29th November, 1886, I do not think it is genuine—the signature to the letter of instructions with "I agree to the above" is more like Park's genuine signature, but I cannot give a decided opinion one way or the other with regard to it—the last line of the body of that document Is much closer to the previous line than any other lines in that page, and I also find that there are more letters in that line than in any other line, showing that it is compressed from top to bottom, and from side to side—it appears as if the words "I agree to the above" had been written in to fit the writing of the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SYLVESTER</hi>. It is possible that writing may be fitted so as to leave room for a signature as much as that a signature may be fitted to suit the writing—I cannot give an opinion whether the "I agree to the above" is in Mr. Park's writing; I heard his son swear it was—I had thirty cheques to compare the signature with—I have seen and compared the cheque on blank paper. (<hi rend="italic">The Witness was cross-examined as to similarities and dissimilarities between the formation of various letters and style of writing.</hi>)—you cannot expect a good signature from a man of eighty; you would expect a tremulous signature—I have no doubt in my mind about the signature to the deed not being genuine, it is larger than he wrote at that time.</p>

I have often given evidence—juries have not always agreed with me—I don't expect twelve men to find out in two or three minutes what it has taken me two or three days to work out—the first few lines of the first page of the letter of instructions are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120164"/>
               <p>written closely together, and on the second page they get much wider in the middle, and I do not see why the last line should be crowded if there was a blank space underneath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TATLOCK</hi>. I think if the "I agree to the above" had been on the paper, and the last line had been written in the ordinary space, they would have clashed—a "J" pen writes differently to a scratchy pen. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was further cross-examined as to characteristics of the writing of various documents.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My opinion is that in signing this the ink failed in the pen, and that the writer continued with the pen exhausted, and made some scratchy marks, and then it was gone over again and made more distinct; the failure of iuk occurred when the "J" was made, and before the "C" was made—I have a cheque of the same date as the deed—I was not called upon the trial before Mr. Justice Romer—I had been consulted by Miss Smith about this signature; I went down to the Probate Court with her, and examined the deed; I was not called as a witness.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. None of these variations could have been constituted by going over the signature with an empty pen, because I consider the faint indications of letters are underneath the ink—there was a faint signature before this was made, and if there had been this signature over it would be explained by a failure of ink—I should think the "J. C. Park" and the "Margaret" were written at the same time, because there is a peculiarity; the "ar" is faint also, and it has been gone over, and I think Allistone's name is written at a different time; it appears to be different ink—I think "Park" and "Margaret Josephine Smith" were written with the same pen and ink, and the "Thomas Allistone" with different ink, but whether at a different time I could not say—I am inclined to think that the signatures Micklethwaite, Park, and Paul in this letter of instructions were in three different inks—the words "I agree to the above" are in a different ink to the "Thomas Allistone" and the body of the letter—the signature is more similar to the genuine writings than otherwise—I believe the signature "J. C. Park" has been patched up.</p>

I find on 16th June, 1889, Miss Smith changed her solicitor to Mr. Bridger, and papers were handed over to him, and are in his possession, on an undertaking to hand them over to me if I want them—no proof was ever taken from Davis—I find from letters from Miss Smith this letter, in which he prepared his own proof; it was used by me as his proof—no letter was written to Octavius Davis in 1890 to come; I have searched the letter-book—I may have asked Miss Smith to bring Davis, but this letter of 7th November, 1890, to her explains why he did not come—I think there is no letter asking her to bring Davis—Miss Smith called next day, and said she had not said anything of the kind.</p>

I am sorry I had anything to do with her. She induced me to say what I did at the trial. It was all false; now I intend to tell the truth; I did not witness Park's signature to the paper"—a little while after, when going back into the cell, she said, "She did not offer to double the £500 to make me say what I did"—at 5 o'clock the same evening I arrested Allistone—I read the warrant charging him with forging the deed—he said, "It is a bad job; I will make up my mind what to say when I go before the Magistrate"—on 22nd June I arrested Micklethwaite—I told him I was a police officer, and was going to take him into custody for forging and uttering a deed, purporting to be signed by J.

                  </hi>. I am a laundry proprietor and dyer, of 103, The Grove, Hammersmith—in 1885 I was an estate agent at 214, Fulham Road, and Miss Smith called upon me alone; she came a second time with a gentleman, and said his name was Park—they forced me to put two houses on my books which belonged to Mr. Park; and about a week afterwards she came with him, and my daughter Annie was present—the houses were given to me at £40 a year the first week, and when he came again he said I might take less to get rid of them—he said Miss Smith was about to get married to his son, and it was important that they should be let finally, as two houses would be too much for her mother to look after—I subsequently got instructions to let Cromer Lodge—I went to Teddington, looked at the houses, and called at Auckland House.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was managing the estate agent's business for the prisoner Paul during the time he was in the country, as he lodged at my house—he is a house agent—I had to attend to my own business as well—I was a landed proprietor too; I have a house or two—I gave Paul a job when he returned from prison, doing machine work in the laundry—I knew he had been in prison; I saw it in the papers—I considered he was as respectable a man as we are; of course a conviction looks bad,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120168"/>
               <p>but when I knew him he was a highly respectable man, and had a livery stable in St. James's; he had then, I suppose, £2,000—I did no business, but I turned 5 per cent, during the months I was there, and I introduced some customers, big firms, furnishing companies, and all that—I have met Paul and Miss Smith together, passing through Brompton Cemetery, once or twice—at the time Paul was arrested, in 1887, we were not still doing business for each other, but he was lodging at my place; he owed me some money, and therefore we did not speak after that; I passed him and took no notice—I believe he lodged with me in 1885; I do not know about 1886—when he came out of prison he came to me; he was down, and I did not want to keep him down—I saw him two or three times walking about with Miss Smith—I was first asked to make an affidavit, I think, in 1889—Mr. Edwards' clerk asked me.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the time when my father was managing the estate office in Fulham Road—I went there every day for a fortnight to take his dinner—one day when I was there, Miss Smith and a short stout gentleman, Mr. Park, came together—he spoke about houses to let at Teddington or Richmond, and then about Hayling Island—I said I had been there; he asked how I liked it; I said, "Very much," and that I had seen the lifeboat launched on stormy days—he said Miss Smith was going to marry his son and live on Hayling Island—she was wearing a locket with a portrait in it—he said it was his son—I could not see the likeness because I am near-sighted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. I</hi> took my father's dinner into the back parlour, but the folding doors were thrown wide open; I then walked into the office, and stood speaking to my father when the lady came in, which prevented my asking him if I should fetch his beer—I had never seen the lady or gentleman before, but I have seen Miss Smith several times since; I saw her walking with a gentleman in Fulham Road; I cannot say whether that was Paul, because I am near sighted—I saw Ingram once in The Grove, Hammersmith—I made an affidavit; Miss Smith asked me to state what I knew—she did not remind me of this interview in 1885—she said she was having an action and wanted me as a witness, and asked me if I remembered what was said on that occasion—Mr. Edwards' clerk wrote out the affidavit as I told him; I did not find it ready written—these people were conversing there nearly two hours, but not with me; my father's dinner was hot when I took it.</p>

I have carried on business for some years as a dentist in Harrow Road—for the last seven or eight weeks I have been in the hospital with phthisis—I knew Sir Charles Manley Brown very well in 1885 and 1886; he came to my place and introduced a gentleman as Mr. Park, who came to me afterwards professionally—I went down to Auckland House, Teddington more than once, to attend him professionally, and I did something to his teeth there—on the first occasion I was there professionally about half an hour, but I stopped two hours—while I was there I saw Miss Smith; I had known her previously—I saw her at Auckland House on that occasion—I did not stay</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave evidence before Mr. Justice Romer, and was cross-examined—I heard after that Mr. Justice Romer said he believed Mr. Park in preference to me—I have no book to show the year or month of the date of my visit to Mr. Park, nor have any of my patients except their names—it was about 1885 or early in 1886; I think it was in 1885—I distinctly remember visiting him twice—I have no idea how Sir C. M. Brown came there; I understood he was a friend of Mr. Park that was about 1885; I do not know where he lived—I used to meet him in Bayswater—he never lodged at the house kept by M. J. Smith in Talbot Road—I have known her since 1884, and I must have known her when she was living there; I understood making affidavits—I gave my address 18, Westbourne Villas, Bayswater—but the name was changed some months, before to 18, Harrow Road; it was Westbourne Villa; when I was asked how it was to be found, I replied, "I daresay they would find it in an old directory, or making use of their tongue"—I said it would sound better if I called my house Westbourne Villa—Sir C. M. Brown was tall and stout, and had a long beard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> 18, Westbourne Villas was the right description of my house when I went to live there, but a few months before this the Board of Works had altered it; that was well known to the postmen; letters so directed would reach me now—I do not keep books, only a rough scribble—it is a ready-money business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief manager of the Chartered Bank of India, London, and China, 65, Old Broad Street—there is a branch at Bombay—the defendants were customers of the bank for a considerable time—they carried on business at 35, Great St. Helens, as steamship owners and merchants—part of our business at Bombay is purchasing bills of exchange, with shipping documents attached—they are forwarded to me in London, and would be presented for acceptance here—the firm did a good deal of business with Beyts, Craig, and Co. for many years—I retained the bills sent over here till they were paid, and then handed over the shipping documents to the firm—I produce four bills of exchange; the first is for £1,000, with a bill of lading for 1,600 bags shipped by the ss. <hi rend="italic">Stanton</hi> by Beyts, Craig and Co., which is signed H. S. Beyts—there is an invoice attached to the bill; the total is £1,155 14s.—the signature is Bombay, Beyts, Craig and Co.—the next bill is for £907 2s. 10d., with a bill of lading showing 1,334 bags of brown nuts, shipped for Antwerp; the invoice is made out in a similar way—the next is for £892 17s. 11d. for 34 bags of linseed, shipped at Antwerp—the last is for £933 2s. 4d., represented by a bill of lading for 1,334 bags of rape seed, shipped at Antwerp; the bills represent £3,370 3s. 1d.—those bills were accepted</p>

               <p>on 23rd May by Beyts, Craig and Co.—the signature in each case is Mr. Beyts'—those bills all matured on Saturday, 25th June—I received these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 24th June, and again communicated with Antwerp; and on 28th June received an answer, in consequence of which I went, between five and six p.m., with Mr. Barnard, the assistant manager, to the office of Beyts, Craig and Co., and saw the two prisoners—previous to that he had promised to make a deposit, first on the Saturday and then on the Monday; on Tuesday nothing came, and I went round and said to Mr. Beyts, "How is it these bills are not paid?"—I did not get any definite reply, but he was desirous that I should wait till the following day—I pressed him, but I could get nothing satisfactory from him—I said, "Are the deposits all right?"—he did not give any distinct answer, and I said, "Do the deposits exist?"—he said, "No—I asked how it was he had accepted bills knowing that the deposits had never been shipped—he said, "Yes"—I asked him why he had not stopped—he said he wired to his son at Bombay to stop it, but he persisted—I said to Craig, "You have been to Bombay, how is it?"—he said, "When I was in Bombay there was nothing of the kind"—I said, "Why did not you stop it, then?"—he said, "My old partner's son and I did not like to"—Mr. Beyts said he was dazed, and said he would all tomorrow—I said, No, they must know the amount the bank would lose—Craig said about £30,000—I guessed then further, and he produced an account showing that the Bombay firm was credited to them in a large amount of money—I pressed Craig again,. and he turned to Beyts and said, "You had better tell Mr. Jackson everything"—they said they would come next day—I said, "You mean to tell me you have been accepting bills when you knew the produce had not been shipped?" he said "Yes"—the directors were told next day, and on the 29th two of them came to the bank, and Beyts gave me this memorandum, the total of which is £46,349 2s. 6d., for which there is no produce—even that does not exhaust the amount.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have known this firm in London eight or ten years—I have been manager of the bank ten years, and I was assistant manager before—I have not the ledger here to show the vast transactions of the firm with the bank—the firm shipped coal to India, and they may have shipped sugar—the bills always came with the documents—when the acceptances sent by the branch at Bombay were sent to the head office, the clerk used to leave the bill and call for it accepted the following day—till last year the amount of drafts accepted by this firm was very small, but last year it was larger—up to the failure of the New Oriental Bank there were some few bills which I had to hold over for a week or two—I think I heard of the stoppage on June 9th—the ss. <hi rend="italic">Stanton</hi> had arrived at that time; she arrived about the end of May—these were accepted on May 23rd—I knew of the ship arriving at Antwerp—I suppose notice of fire insurance was given in the usual way—we did not on this occasion give notice to the people at Antwerp that the goods were to be held on our account; we had a lot of bills purporting to be drawn against goods by the <hi rend="italic">Stanton</hi>, but some of them were paid—there was a certain amount by the <hi rend="italic">Stanton</hi>, some of which were paid long before they fell due; there might be £1,700 due on June 18th paid on June 4th, and £953 due on June 18th, and they went on</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PYKE</hi>. Mr. Craig gave me April, 1891 as the date of his leaving India, and he told me he got back to Bombay in October—he came back again in March this year—every one of these bills was signed by young Mr. Beyts; not one by Mr. Craig—young Mr. Beyts would send them, when signed, to our branch in Bombay, with the bills of lading, and they would put the money to the credit of the account in Bombay—if Mr. Beyts or Mr. Craig had not accepted a bill we should have sent it back to Bombay—the acceptance of a bill does not take any money out of our pockets on this side—I think all the bills I have referred <hi rend="italic">to</hi>, which came to £46,000, were drawn or signed in Bombay, about May, 1892, by young Beyts, when Mr. Craig was over here—the payment of those bills was in many cases in anticipation of the date of maturity, and we should allow discount for that—as to their solvency, I was not perfectly certain, but I knew nothing <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the contrary—we had not got security for the amount; we relied on the security of these documents—I knew the ship had arrived about the end of May with the goods, as I supposed—I did not stop the goods; I wrote to inquire about them on June 24th or 25th—I did not stop them, because some of the bills were paid shortly afterwards, and Mr. Beyts said these goods were all sold, and if I sent a bill of lading to Antwerp it would interfere with his credit there, and he asked me not to do it; there had been previous instances where he had asked me to do the same—that was a week or a fortnight before the bills matured; but a lot of them had been paid—we have stopped goods—Mr. Beyts always came to me—I never saw Mr. Craig with reference to this matter—I said to Mr. Craig, "You have been in Bombay, and must have known this was going on"—he did not say that it never went on when he was in Bombay—he said that when he left Bombay in 1889 nothing of the kind was going on, but when he returned in 1891 he found it going on—I said, "Why did not you stop it?"—he said, "Oh, it was my old partner's son"—my memory is very clear—I consulted Mr. Barnard, and Mr. Craig said it was £30,000; I made a mistake at the Police-court—they volunteered to come and make a proposition next day about the way they were going to meet their liabilities.</p>

McCabe, Banks, and myself were there—the prosecutor, who held this pass "A" in his hand, said to the prisoner, as nearly as I remember, "Do you know anything about this pass? Can you give me any explanation about it?"—the prisoner, without taking the pass into his hand, said, "Yes, I know all about it; it relates to ten bags of flour that I intended to take, and after it was loaded up on the van, and had been taken away, I heard a whispered conversation between two men on the dock, to the effect that the job looked very crooked; I went after the van; it was standing at a public-house outside the dock gates, and I had the bags brought back again, and I unloaded them myself from the van, and they are at the bottom of the jetty now"—Mr. Perry asked what "R. D." meant on the pass—the prisoner said, "That refers to the ten bags of flour"—Mr. Perry told Cleary to go to the bottom of the jetty and see whether the ten bags of "R.D." were still there—Cleary went, and on his return said the ten bags of "R.D." were there—that is all the conversation I remember—the prisoner was told to leave the office by perry—I went and looked at the ten bags, and I should say they had laid there six months undisturbed—if "R.D." flour was sent out, "R. D." would be put on the pass, and if it were Superlative or Crown and Ruby, that would be put on it—everything was done in order; the actual description with the number should be put on—"R.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the Arsenal at Woolwich—I married a daughter of the prisoner, and we lived in the same house as the prisoner and his wife—on the night of 24th August, about a quarter past eleven, I and my wife came home together from the theatre; she knocked at the door, the prisoner opened it—I stopped at the gate talking to a friend—as soon as the prisoner opened the door, he rushed at me past my wife with an axe in both his hands, and aimed a blow at my head with it; I put up my hand, and received the blow in the palm of my hand, which was cut open about two inches long—I immediately closed with him, threw him to the ground, and held him till a constable came, and he was given into custody—my hand was dressed by the doctor at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My wife took away the axe from his hand—I saw that he had a wound on his nose next day; I suppose that was caused in the struggle—I did not bite him, he said that I did, but it is not true—I saw him that evening about eight, before I went out, and he bade me goodnight; and I said, "Good-night, father," he spoke in a perfectly friendly manner—I have seen his discharge from the Army, where he had been twenty years, it stated that his conduct was good; he has an African medal, and a good conduct pension of 4s. a day.</p>

                  </hi> (251 <hi rend="italic">R</hi>). On 24th August, shortly after eleven, I was called outside the prisoner's house, and found the prosecutor had him on the ground, holding him; the prosecutor was bleeding from the hand—I asked the prisoner why he did it—he made no reply—I believe he was quite sober—on the way to the station he said, "I will do for him," and at the station he said the same—I produce the hatchet; the prosecutor's wife gave it me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the station the prisoner said he believed he had been bitten through the nose by the prosecutor—the doctor examined his nose—I saw marks of blood about it—he was rather excited—when I went there he was lying flat on the ground on his back, in the front garden; he was not struggling, he was lying quite still, and the prosecutor holding him—he looked very wild—the hatchet had been taken from him by that time—I believe the prisoner had been thirteen years with his regiment in India.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon—I saw the prosecutor at the station about midnight on the 24th—he had an incised wound an inch and a half long, running down the centre of the right hand to the bone—this hatchet could have done it; it is not very sharp—there must have been considerable violence used—the prisoner had a wound at the side of his nose, which I dressed; it was a lacerated wound, like a tear.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Well Street, Camberwell, and am a cab-driver—I have known the prisoner twelve months—he is my daughter-in-law's brother—on Wednesday, 29th June, about two in the afternoon, I was with my cab outside the underground railway at the foot of Westminster Bridge—I saw the prisoner—he hired my cab, a hansom—I drove him first to the Southampton Restaurant, Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane, where we had a drink together; he had a four of gin—we remained inside there about ten minutes, and outside about twelve minutes afterwards—he then got into the cab again, and I drove to Grosvenor Park, Camberwell—we stopped at the Grosvenor Arms, and went in; he had half a quartern of gin, which came to 3d.—the prisoner paid me my fare there—I said, "Jim, I am going to change horses, as I have a new horse"—he said, "Don't change your horse, because I shall want you again to drive me to Victoria"—I said, "Well, I will go and change horses; I am close to the stables, and will come and fetch you"—he said. "No, I shall not be about two minutes"—I said, "If you are longer than five minutes you will find me gone; I am not going to keep this horse out any longer"—he then left me, and went round the comer</p>

               <p>towards the church in the direction of Grosvenor Park; that was somewhere about four—he returned in about seven or eight minutes, got into the cab, and said, "Go on to Victoria"—I first went to the stable and changed my horse—in Trafalgar Street he said, "Don't go to Victoria, go to Charing Cross instead"—I drove into the yard of the South-Eastern Station—he got out there and said, "You can leave your cab here, because we will go and have a drink, as I am going to leave you," and he said, "I have shot a girl"—I said, "You shoot a girl; you never had the pluck to shoot a revolver, I think; in fact, you could not shoot for nuts"—he said, "You are laughing"—I said, "I can't help it"—he said, "But you will find it a very serious matter"—we then went to a public-house in Villiers street, called the Griffin, and the prisoner had another quartern of gin there—I said, "Is it right you have shot a girl?"—he said, "Yes; I loved her, and I swore nobody else should have her"—I laughed again, and said, "What have you been reading, some horrible novel? What is the matter with you? Are you mad?"—he said, "You keep on laughing; you will find it a serious matter"—I said, "Oh, bosh; I am going back to my cab"—we then left the public-house, and went towards my cab—on the way he put his hand in his left side pocket and pulled out a revolver, and said, "I should like to see the man that would arrest me now"—upon that I put my knee on his hip, caught hold of his wrist, took the revolver out of his hand, and put it in my pocket—it was fully loaded in six chambers—he said, "Give it me back; I will give you all the money I have for it"—I said, "No, you could not have it for £50"—he said, "I don't owe you any animosity, Briggs; shake hands"—which I did—we returned into the yard to the cab—on the way I asked him if he had any more cartridges; he put his hand in his pocket and gave me eighteen cartridges—I was going on towards my cab, when he came behind me and struck me on the left ear—I said, "You whelp! what do you mean by that?"—he said, "I can hold my own with you"—I then struck him; he put himself in an attitude, and we fought a fair round—he said I might as well hit mahogany as him—a porter came and caught him under the legs, and carried him outside into the Strand—I drove out of the yard, and a little way in the Strand I got a fare, and drove off to the Criterion; the prisoner ran and jumped up behind, and got on to the cab; in Waterloo Place I told him to go away—her said he would not—I said, "You had better go from me, I have had enough; if I lose my temper I may perhaps do you an injury"—he then went away, and I did not see him again till he was at Lambeth Police-court—I withdrew the charges from the revolver, and kept it in my pocket, and the next day I gave it to Inspector Dunlevy, with the cartridges—I saw something in the newspaper, and went to the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he told me he had shot a girl I thought it was ridiculous; I thought it was imagination—he has generally borne the character of a peaceable man—when he hailed me, and got me to drive about, he seemed rather muddled from the effects of drink—we had drink twice at the restaurant, once at the Grosvenor Arms, and once in Villiers Street—at the Grosvenor he seemed rather worse—he seemed dazed, and rather thick in his speech—I believe an aunt of his died in an asylum; it is a well-known fact in the family—he has two cousins in a private asylum—he told me that</p>

               <p>afternoon when we were in Chancery Lane that he had had a very good time, that he had won £30 at the Alexandra Park races—he said he had been horribly screwed the night before—I knew he was sodden with drink, he had been on the drink for months—some time back he came into £200, or something like it, under his father's will, and it had all gone in drink—I don't know why he should be described as a betting man; he has laid his money out in betting and drinking; he never kept a book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have only known him twelve months—he has been abroad; I did not know him before he went abroad—he was drinking heavily when he came home—he had money sent him to bring him home—his father died about eleven years ago, before he went away—when he came home from Australia, the first time I saw him, I thought there was something strange about him, he would seem so quiet, and when talking to him about one subject he would go into something else quite different—I have known that occur at various times—he would begin talking about his life in Australia, and then go on talking about his father and mother—he would sometimes sit very quiet, and perhaps not speak for half an hour, without taking the slightest notice when you spoke to him—I was not in the habit of driving him about—when he first came home I took him about a little, three or four times only, and then I did not drive him till this particular day—about three weeks previously, I think, I drove him to the Canterbury; that was the last occasion before this—I used to see him sometimes two or three times a week—I have seen him in other cabs, not to speak to him, very often—I did not know that he was racing; I knew he would bet his money, he told me so—I knew he lived in Brewer Street, I did not know the number—he never told me where he lived—he told me he had a wife in Australia—he said nothing about being married here—he did not show me a photograph of himself and wife; he sent one in a letter to his sister, Clara Briggs, my son's wife—I believe he went to Australia alone, and came back alone—I knew his two cousins personally, William and John Devenish—I saw John about three months back, he came to my house—I know he was mad enough then by the way he carried on; I don't think he drank to excess; I don't think he had the money to drink—soon after I saw him he was taken away to a madhouse, I believe to Dr. Stacker's, in Peckham Bye—I know he had been confined before, and so had his brother William—I saw William about nine months ago, in the street, walking about—he was not a man that drank a good deal, to my knowledge—I have seen the aunt, she was not a drinking woman at all—she is living—her name is Devenish; she lives at 48, Lorrimore Road, Walworth; she is an independent lady, and is the mother of William and John; neither of those three people were in the habit of drinking, as far as I know—I don't know who the father was, I did not know him at all—Mrs. Devenish was either the prisoner's father's sister, or something.</p>

I live at 81, Grosvenor Park, Camberwell—I knew Emma Oakley; she had been a lodger of mine for about fifteen months—she came with me to Grosvenor Park, about Christmas, from a previous address—she had the front room ground floor, furnished as a sittingroom, and the back as a bedroom—I know the prisoner by sight; I have seen him as visiting at the house for about seven weeks before the 29th</p>

               <p>June—I can't say that I have seen him every day, but I have seen him frequently; he used to come to see Emma Oakley—on Wednesday afternoon, about a quarter to four, I was in the washhouse at the back of the house; I heard a knock at the door, and I heard the deceased let somebody in—I heard the door shut again—I heard someone speaking in the passage—I heard them go into the parlour and heard the door shut—I next heard the sound of a revolver, four or five times, I should think, reports very quick one after the other—I should say it was about five minutes from the time I heard the knock at the front door that I heard the banging of the firearms—I then ran upstairs, and saw the prisoner leave the door of the sitting-room and run out of the street door; he was putting his hand behind him as though putting something into his pocket—the parlour door was closed—as he was just going across the road I said, "I see you"—he was just running across the road between a walk and a run—I then went into the parlour; there was a great deal of smoke in the room, and a strong smell of powder—the deceased was lying on her back on the ground, between the door and the window, bleeding very much—she had on a cloth ulster; I saw afterwards that she was not dressed—I put a pillow under her head, and at once sent for a doctor; he came, and the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She had on a cloth ulster, buttoned from the top to the bottom—he was her only visitor except her sister; she used to come—at first I thought they were married; she was very quiet and well conducted, there was no quarrelling between them, they always appeared to be on very affectionate terms—she was a tall young woman, dark and muscular, a good deal bigger than the prisoner—this is a photograph of them taken together—I never knew spirits to be brought in to them, only beer; I probably should not have known; it was not my business—I think he had been in the room about five minutes before I heard the shots—there was no noise or tumbling about, I did not hear anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 246, Westminster Bridge Road, and am a tailor's manager—I have known the prisoner about ten months—on 29th June there were some monetary transactions between us—I owed him a matter of £10—I paid him half a sovereign that morning, about half-past eleven, as near as lean remember—I heard that he was keeping company with the deceased girl, I have seen them together—when he left me that morning he said he was going to Southwark, that he tad promised to be there at three, but he was going earlier, to Grosvenor Park, to see his girl—I did not see him again till about a quarter to six in the evening—I was at the door, he came up and said, "George, the money you owe me I give you, I have shot my girl"—I said, "Don't talk nonsense, you must be joking"—he said that he had been down and saw her coming out of a public-house with two men, merely clad in her dressing-gown, that it was in a fit of jealousy, and he must have been mad; that he came away, and went and bought the revolver; he did not speak to her, he could see she was playing him double, that he bought the revolver, and went back and shot her—I would not be quite sure about buying the revolver; I concluded that he must have had the revolver—I had never seen him with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189209120192"/>
               <p>one before, and I naturally concluded that lie had gone and bought it; I would not be sure upon the point; all I know is that he said he had shot her—I won't be certain that he said he had bought it—he said he had shot her, he had just done it—he said he had spent £40 on her in a fortnight—he said he was going to marry her the next week—he said, "Come and have a drink, as I expect to be arrested every moment"—I went and had a drink with him—when I parted with him he was crying—he asked my advice what he should do—I did not think he had done it—I said, "I can't advise you"—he seemed in such a dazed condition, I thought he was joking—I bade him good-night at the Rodney publichouse, and shook hands with him—he did not say where he was going; he said he did not know where to go—during the time I have known him I have seen him four or five times a week—I have not been about with him, no more than across the road to have a drink on different occasions when he has purchased clothes—I did not know of his having a revolver in his possession—I never saw one or ever mentioned one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think he did say anything about having bought the revolver—I did not say so before the Magistrate—more or less, I should think he had been on the drink at least seven months—he was really not right in the morning—I came to the conclusion that he was going wrong altogether, that he was reckless, that he was doing things that must, of course, come to an end one way or the other—I looked on him as not quite right in his intellect, a weak, foolish man, besotted with drink that was the opinion I had of him, that he was spending his money recklessly, getting so besotted with drink that one day it must come to a final, to be a dipsomaniac, in an asylum for the mad—my opinion was that when he came to me he was suffering from delirium tremens, he was all of a shake in the morning when he first came—it was the second time that I had the drink with him—he paid for the drink—he was apparently right off his head, I thought he did not know what he was talking of—I knew him as a quiet, peaceable, kind-hearted man—he is no relation of mine, an absolute stranger—I did not believe a word of his story; if I had done so I should have had him arrested—he said he had pawned his watch and chain to find money for this young woman, and had spent £40 on her in a fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He came to me four or five times a week, merely as an acquaintance, to say "How do you do?" in passing—he told me that the money he had left him he was laying out in horse racing, backing horses; he said that was how he got his living—I considered he was weak-minded through the effects of drink—his hand was shaking, and likewise the whole of his system.</p>

               <p>on the floor in the front parlour; she had on an ulster, chemise, and stockings—I searched the place, and found a photograph like this and some letters—in consequence of inquiries I made I went to 6, Brewer Street, Pimlico—I waited there till the prisoner came, about five minutes to eleven; I heard him go upstairs and go into his room—I went up with assistance, 'and knocked at the door; it was locked—the landlord spoke to him through the door, and said someone wished to speak to him—as the door was not opened at once I commenced to force it, but before I could do so the prisoner opened it, and I and my brother officer rushed at him—I seized him and held him while the officer searched him—I said, "We are police officers, and you will be charged with the murder of a woman at 81, Grosvenor Park"—after a few seconds he said, "I know nothing about it"—I cautioned him—he said, "I am not such a fool as to incriminate myself; I am educated; you have got your business to do, and I must put up with it; I thought you had come here to murder me"—on the way to the Carter Street station in a four-wheeler he said, "Dont hold me so tight"—I said, "You will be dealt fairly with; we shall treat you with the utmost kindness if you behave yourself"—he said, "I will; I am in an awful position"—at the station he was charged with the murder of Emma Oakley—he made no reply—he appeared to be apparently recovering from the effects of drink, but was perfectly steady—I did not observe any mark upon him; Brogden did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not examine him—when I went to arrest him I went up to him perfectly quietly, nothing like threatening violence; we only rushed at him, thinking he might have the revolver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in the office of the solicitors of the South Western Railway Company—I was present on the 6th May at Southwark County-court when this action was tried—I heard the prisoner sworn and give evidence—I took a note of it; this is a copy of it—in his examination-in-chief he said, "The two front wheels of the cab were broken; the shafts broken; Alexander has done a lot of work for me; this is the bill I paid; Alexander is not here"—he produced this account for £13, with Alexander's name at the top—he said, "I paid £13 for repairing the cab," and he said something more about the horse—in cross-examination he said, "I paid £11 10s. in ready money; I swear Alexander did not give me a bill for £3 10s.; I owe him £70; it may be less"—in re-examination he produced a counterfoil cheque, dated 2nd April, for £2 10s.—his attention was again called to the £18 account, and he said, "I swear that is a true account"—that is the end of my note—Alexander was sent for, and was afterwards called as a witness for the company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no doubt a collision between the two vehicles—two or three days after the collision notice was given to the company—before the cab was repaired an opportunity was given to the company to see what was the matter with the cab, and what amount of damage was done to it—Mr. Hope was sent to see it; he is here—he was not called before the Magistrate—he reported to the company—on the 15th May, the day before the trial, we first heard that the claim was an improper one—that was by letter; it is here—it was from Mr. Alexander—it was addressed to the manager of the Accident Department, and stated, "If you will call on me you will learn something to your advantage concerning the claim put in for damage done to Mr. Skinner's cab and horse.—Mr. Alexander, coachmaker"—I heard at the Court that that letter is in the handwriting of Leftwich, who was then in Skinner's employment, he afterwards left.</p>

I am a wheelwright, of Dorset Mews, Clapham Road—prior to 1892 I had been in the habit of doing work for the prisoner in repairing cabs and so on—at the end of January, 1892, a hansom cab of his was sent to me to repair—I used to put a distinctive number on the cabs I had from him; this was numbered ten; I repaired that cab at my premises—I made an entry in my book of the work to this cab, done by my son—I produce the book; the entry is mine (<hi rend="italic">reading the entry</hi>)—I entered the work and the prices at the time; it amounted to £3 10s.—the repairs were finished on 8th February—some</p>

               <p>little time after the cab was sent home I saw the prisoner—the cab was sent to his cornchandler's shop in clapham Road—I save him the account for £3 10s.—he said, "I want a bill made out for 213"—I said, "There is not enough work there to make out a bill for £13"—he said I should have to go back and make one out somehow—I asked him what I should put on the bill—he said, "Put two new shafts down and resetting the irons"—I went back to the shop and did it, and returned to him in about half an hour or an hour, taking with me the bill for £13; this is it—Mr. Leftwich and the prisoner were in the shop—he asked me if I had got a stamp; I said no—he said, "Give the boy a penny and he will go and get one; get two"—the boy brought back two, and he put one on the £3 10s. bill, and asked me to sign it; I did so—he then put the cheque in his pocket—I had seen a cheque at least I had seen a paper; I did not know what the amount was—after I had signed the bill he put it in his pocket—when he asked me to sign the £13 bill I said it did not want receipting—I referred to Leftwich, and asked him if it wanted receipting, and he said "No"—the prisoner said, "Then you don't get no money out of me unless you do receipt it"—I then receipted the bill as it now appears, and he gave me a cheque for £2 10s.; he took it out of his pocket; it was apparently the same cheque he had in his hand—I did not notice at the time that it was for £2 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did when I got home, and I directly went back to his shop, but he had gone—I went after him, and asked him if he knew what he had made the cheque for—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What?"—he said, "£2 10s.; did not you have £1 of me during the week?"—that was so—at that time he owed me about £50 for repairs—I left both the receipts with him—some time after I heard that he was bringing an action against the company; I don't remember the date; I fancy it was about the latter end of March; it was the same day that I left the two receipts with him—I told him if he went to Court with the company I should tell the company about the bill—he said I could do as I liked, or as I chose—before the trial I ascertained who the prisoner's solicitors were, and I went there on business; and before the action was caused I took a letter to be sent to the company—I did not see the letter written; I don't know whose writing it is; I believe it is Leftwich's it was written by arrangement between me and Leftwich—on 6th May I attended at the Court and gave evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been doing work for the prisoner for some tune; he is a cab proprietor and cornchandler—it was somewhere about the end of January that this cab came to me—I knew that it had been injured in an accident—he did not tell me he was going to make a claim against the company—he said I was not to begin on the repairs of the cab till somebody came from the company to look at it—they always do send somebody—he did not tell me he was going to make a claim against the company, and pay me something on account of the job—I think the cab remained on my premises about three weeks, till 8th February, when it went out—he paid me £5 on the 6th February, and another £5 on the 13th—that was for work done previous to this—I gave him a receipt for it in a book, not showing who the work was done for—he gave me another pound in March, before the £2 10s.—I made out the £13 bill to get my money—he would not pay me unless I did it; I had to do it; I believed it was going to be shown to the</p>

               <p>company—I did not know it was to show that he had paid me £13—I did not know what it was to be used for—I did not know that he had taken action against the company—of course, I suppose it was to show to the company—I did not communicate to the company until I found they were going to inquire into the damage—before that I had seen a man named Myers—I see him every day—I believe Myers and the prisoner had been on bad terms for along time—Myers keeps a furniture shop next door to Skinner in Clapham Road—I did not discuss with Myers what I should do with regard to this; I did not talk it over with him or mention it to him; I never had any conversation with him about it, not till after the company came and saw me. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition, being referred to, stated:</hi> "I had four or five conversations about the £18 bill with Myers")—I don't think I spoke about it till after I had been to the company—I don't recollect saying that—I believe Leftwich was in Skinner's employ—I don't know that he was; I saw him there—he was in his employment when he kept the baker's shop; whether he was in the corn shop I don't know—I saw him in the shop when I was paid this bill; I did not ask him if he had left, I did not say anything at the Police-court about the boy and the two stamps; I don't know who the boy was—I could not speak about it before the Magistrate, they would not let me; I have seen Leftwich every day since these proceedings have been pending—I have not talked to him about the boy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, Whenever the prisoner paid me money I signed my book for it—he kept the book, and I signed for all the money he paid me (<hi rend="italic">book produced</hi>)—this is the book—part of it is my writing, the other part is Leftwich's—the latter part shows small sums paid week by week, every Saturday (<hi rend="italic">Entries were read of</hi> £5 <hi rend="italic">on account on</hi> 13th <hi rend="italic">February, and</hi> £3 <hi rend="italic">on 20th February</hi>)—he never during this year paid me £11 10s. in cash; I never received more than £4 in cash of him in my life; if he paid me more than £4 it was by cheque—these sums of £5 were by cheque—there is no receipt in this book for the £2 10s. cheque or the £1, because that was to be left, and scratched out of my book; that was the only bill he had since 1890—I had not delivered to him any separate account for any particular work, since September, 1890—all the payments in this book were made to me on account of the general balance that was owing—Myers had nothing to do with the writing of the latter; I said so at the Police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Alexander's son, and assist him in his wheelwright's business—I remember the prisoner's cab, No. 10, being brought for repairs about the end of January—I and my fellow servants worked on it—we put no new shafts to the cab—the entry in my father's book correctly represents the work that was actually done—the fair cost of those repairs would be about £3 10s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachbuilder, of 3, Gloucester Road, Kensington—on the 5th May this year I and Hope inspected a hansom cab on behalf of the South-Western Railway Company, to see what repairs had been done—the prisoner was there—I called the prisoner's attention to a shaft which had been broken and spliced up afterwards—he said the shafts had met with an accident since new ones were put—I examined the shafts, and I can say that neither of them had been new within the preceding four months—I put the cost of such repairs as I saw at about £5 at the outside—that is what I should charge.</p>

I am a builder—up to a fortnight ago I lived at 136, London Road, Herne Hill—I know the defendant as manager to Mr. Hardman, a builder—I used to occupy premises belonging to Mr. Hardman in Atlantic Road, for which I paid £45 a year—I used to see the defendent on the premises—I employ several men—I am learning Jeffrey the business, and he attends to it when I am away—I have some relatives at Hastings named Savage—I went to Hastings this year with my wife and family and a servant girl, and stayed from July 9th to July 21st at Mrs. Churcher's, Worthing House, Church Street, Hastings—I did not come to town at all during that time—I was not at my house in London Road on the morning of July 13, nor did I receive from the defendant that morning a judgment summons issued by Hardman against me; I was in Hastings on the 13th, and had breakfast with my wife and family, and Mrs. Churcher attended on us I saw my uncle that day at eleven o'clock—we walked on the Parade, and then dined at a restaurant, then went on the pier and went to Eastbourne by boat, and came back without landing, and at half-past five had tea at the Creamery—I was in Hastings that night and Tuesday also—I slept at Worthing House, and at 7.45 a.m. I was in bed—the first I heard of the judgment summons was the notice of adjournment which came by post—I think it was after that I saw Mr. Wilson and asked him to do something for me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure this document was the first intimation I had of the judgment summons being granted—I had heard it mooted that there was a judgment summons, returnable on 26th—I told him so, but I did not attend, as I had not had the summons—the County-court bailiff had not twenty judgment summonses against me in one year—I heard from one of my men that it was the 24th—the first I heard of it was the introducing the word official—I did not think it worth while to go or send to the County-court to know whether the summons was returnable that day—I knew that personal service was required, and as I had not been personally served my interest in the matter had not commenced—my lodgings at Hastings cost £1 a week—I took a few pounds down with me—I was engaged in some building operations, and had about six labourers working—I left money with Jeffrey, a lad of nineteen, to whom I am teaching the business; it was not a cheque—he had a cheque, drawn by Mr. Smith, of Loughborough Road; that cheque was sent down to me at Hastings, endorsed by me there, and paid into my uncles account—Jeffrey had not got it when I left—he did not try to cash it, to my knowledge—the weekly wages averaged about 35s. each—Jeffrey was responsible, in my absence, to see that the work went on—if I had been in London between the 9th and the 21st I should have gone round to see how they were getting on—I got daily reports from Jeffrey—I have not got his letters; it was no use keeping them—July 12th was Tuesday—I will not swear that all this did not take place on Tuesday—if my servant says that they went to the Creamery and the illuminations on Tuesday she</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I pay my men on Saturday, but on 9th July they were paid on Friday night, because there was a bean-feast on Saturday—I was painting the fronts of seventeen houses in Belinda Road, and one of my men acted as foreman over the others, and took their time there were only repairs at Flaxman Road—both those jobs had been started before I left—it would take me twelve minutes to get from my house to Loughborough Park Station; I go there mostly by the London, Chatham, and Dover, but I went to Hastings by the London and Brighton, and took a tourist ticket for 10s. 2d., which lasted a fortnight—I had never been to Mrs. Churcher's house before—Jeffrey slept at my house, and took his meals out—on the Tuesday evening before this Wednesday I was on the parade and the pier with me Savage and my wife; we had supper between ten and eleven, I won't be certain where—it is a fact that on July 9th and 21st I was unable to meet my debts.</p>

I live at Clyde Villas, Hastings, and have retired from business—I am the uncle of Mrs. Furness—I remember their coming to Hastings on July 9th; they stayed till the 21st—Mr. Hunter took his benefit on Wednesday, July 13th, and I met Mr. and Mrs. Furness that morning at eleven o'clock on the sea-front about six minutes' walk from Hill Street; farther from my house, but nearer to the station—we strolled about the parade and had lunch at one of the restaurants, and afterwards went on the pier with a view of attending Mr. Hunter's benefit; it was very crowded, and we went on board one of the boats and went to Eastbourne, and returned at five o'clock—Mr. Furness was in my company all that time—on the Tuesday we went to the front; they were in the place at six o'clock at tea, and about nine o'clock we left, and I went home with my wife—I never heard anything said while I was there about a visit by Mr. Furness to London.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I left Mr. Furness on the Tuesday, evening on the parade, and what his movements were going to be I did not know—for all know he may have gone to London by the 9.15 train—I said before the Magistrate that I left my house at 10.30 on the 13th; it would take half an hour to walk to the sea-front.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the prosecutor, learning his business, and now live at Canterbury Road, Croydon—I was sleeping at London Road during the whole of July—I recollect Mr. Furness going away on 9th July, the day of the bean-feast—he came back on the 21st—he did not come back between the 9th and 21st—I looked after the men in his employment—I went to the men working at Flaxman Road and Belsize Road every day—he went away on Saturday, and I paid the men the next week—Mr. Furness had left me £8 or £9—I was at the County court on August 2nd, and heard part of what passed.</p>
