Wellington-street—I was with Thompson on the night of 10th August, coming from the Britannia theatre—I saw the prisoner speak to her—I could not hear what he said at first—I heard him say, "Sally, where are my things;" she said, "Ask the landlady, she will tell you"—he said, "No, you know where they are"—she said, "Will you hit me"—he said he did not know—she said, "Will you take an oath you won't hit me"—he said, "I don't know," and she said, "Keep your hand in your pocket"—then the boy that was with him told me to go and tell a policeman, which I did, and the policeman followed them a little way, but not far—I left them, and met them again when they got to the Lamb, in Kingsland-road—I heard him continually asking her where his things were, and if she did not tell him he would hang for her—she said, "Will you keep your distance? if you wait till I get home I will tell you where they are"—when we got to Shacklewell-lane, he wanted her to go down there with him—she would not, and we walked on till we came near Wellington-street—he then said he would settle it, and I saw him give her one blow in the mouth; I saw him strike her four times with his left hand—I did not see anything in his hand—I screamed—I assisted in taking her to a surgeon's—I saw that she was bleeding—when the policeman came up I tore open her frock, and saw that she was stabbed once in the head, once in the shoulder, once in the breast, and once in the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the German hospital, Dalston—on the night of 10th August, the prosecutrix was brought there—she was suffering from four wounds, one on the right temple, one on the right shoulder, one on the right chest, and one on the left chest—the one on the right chest was a severe wound—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with an ordinary pen-knife—she was an in patient for eight days, and an out patient for about a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my son as silk manufac<lb/>turers in King-street, Cheapside—our warehouse is the first floor—the house is occupied by Mr. James Walmsley—Mrs. Burton sleeps on the premises—the entrance is from the front door in King-street; that is common to me. and Mr. Walmsley; but his warehouse is partitioned off from the passage—I left on 19th August about 6 o'clock in the evening—as far as I know I was the last person there—I locked the door of my warehouse on the first floor—we have three locks on it—I locked them all—I left a quantity of property in that room—my son opened the warehouse the next day—I went a little before 10 o'clock on the Saturday morning, and found the place had been quite ransacked, and almost every thing taken away—the cash boxes had been broken open and money taken; and I missed silk to the value of about 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a clock there which was going when I left the night before; it had stopped at half past 1—in my judgment it would take a great deal more than an hour to ransack what I found ransacked in that place—I have seen some of the silk at the Mansion house, and some is here—this is my silk and some that was taken that night—we missed twist silk and balls and reels, and bundles, which is called purse silk—I applied to Mr. Loveridge to take some steps in the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father—I left the premises before he did on 19th August—I went the next morning a little before 9 o'clock—I had a difficulty in opening our own door, and sent for a locksmith to open the locks; when the door was opened every thing was in great confusion—some burglars had been there and taken as much property as they could lay their hands on—the locks that I could not open led to the front room on the first floor—we have a front room and a back room, and a passage between them—all the drawers in the front room were open—a panel had been cut out of the door, and they had let the panel lean against the place so as not to excite alarm—what I saw could not have been done in less than three hours—the clock was stopped at half-past 1 o'clock; it must have been stopped; it is a capital clock—the silk we missed was worth 475<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps—I have seen a list of the property which has been recovered—it is about one-fifth part of what we lost—we missed 150 lbs. of silk twist of various colours; some portion was on reels, but the bulk was in balls, and 176 bundles of purse silk like this; they weigh 11b each—we lost 32lbs. like this, on reels, and about 201bs. Of what is called machine silk—I do not see any of that here—this that is here is our property, and a part of what we lost—I can swear to the whole of this—the iron safe was broken open and three cash boxes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is what has been shown to you about one-fifth of what you lost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between one-fourth and one-fifth—no silk in balls is imported into this country to my knowledge—these are made exclusively at Leek, in Staffordshire—they do not come from abroad at all; they have no silk like this abroad, in any one country—we export a considerable quantity—we buy bales of raw silk—I believe none like this is made in France—I never saw nor heard of any—I believe none of this purse silk is imported into this country, we are large buyers; I should have heard of it—we have a mark at the bottom of these balls of silk, on most of them, perhaps all of them—you will find a bit of silk like this (producing a small piece) at the bottom of those balls; we do it to identify our own silk—I don't know whether other manufactures do the same.</p>

On the afternoon of 1st September I went with Knight and saw a cab go down Nicholl-street—I waited and saw the prisoner and another man come out of the court in Nicholl-street, where this house is—I got out of the cab—the other man ran away, and I seized the prisoner—I put him in the cab and drove off to the station—as we were going along the prisoner took this life preserver from under his clothes—he said, "I give you this; I did not mean to give it you, I meant it for the man that has put me away; he is a great rogue, but sooner than I would sell my mate I would cut my throat or suffer death"—this bag did not contain the whole of this property, some was in a sheet and some in a shawl—I found in the prisoner's waistcoat-pocket this small memorandum: "132 ball, 82 two 2 ounce reels, 47 1/2" do.</p>

I am porter to Mr. Boyle, a jeweller, of 28, Cheapside—it is my duty to sleep on his premises, and take care of them—on 28th October I was in the parlour of a public-house in Farringdon-street, about 8 o'clock in the evening, with a female friend, who is servant at the next door to my master's—the three prisoners came in about a quarter past 10 o'clock—while they were there one of them handed me a glass of ale—I left the public-house about a quarter or twenty minutes before 11—the servant left with me—the three prisoners followed me as far as the Old Bailey—I did not say plainly "Good night," but they were for leaving, and one of them; said, "We must have something to drink," and I, having tasted their ale, went into a public-house, and got a pot of ale and gave them some—we then all proceeded together to Cheapside—I bid them good night, and pro<lb/>ceeded up Fountain-court—I saw my friend home to the next door, and I went into my master's premises—I took my hat and coat off, and went up</p>

               <p>stairs to the kitchen—I then went out to get some beer for the family—I was in my shirt-sleeves—I was sober—in order to get the beer, I had to come to the top of the Court—when I reached the top the three prisoners were standing there—I had a jug in my hand, and one of the prisoners said, "Are you going for your beer"—I went down Gutter-lane to get the beer, and they came down the lane along with me—I am quite certain the prisoners are the persons—I reached the public-house, and went in and got my pot of beer—I came out with it, and when I came out Homer came up to me and clasped her arms round me, and turned her face towards mine, and Judd said, "You shan't have it like that," or "You shan't do it like that," and he caught the jug of beer to pull it out of my hand, and, while I was thus engaged, Pullen came up and snatched the watch from my breast pocket—it was suspended to my person by a guard—it was taken—the bow of it was broken, and my waistcoat was torn by the pluck—(I had not a handkerchief at that time; I had when I was in the first public-house)—Pullen started away with my watch—it was some little time before I could get away from the other two—I ran after Pullen as soon as I could get from the others.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after being paid that 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. did Mr. Nicol communicate with you and complain, whether rightly or wrongly, that there had been a breach of contract on your part, and that the coals were of a very inferior quality? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he sent along to my clerk in the afternoon of the same day, but I did not know the result of the conversation till the Monday—I do not think I saw the prisoner on the Monday; my clerk would manage the whole affair afterwards, I think wholly, up to the time of his leaving for the North of England—he intended to have gone to Hartlepool, or rather I proposed his going to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other places: he went to Hartlepool in consequence of a telegraphic message that he received from Mr. Wigdahl; I did not send him there—I am not aware that previous to his going to Hartlepool I had any conversation with Mr. Nicol on the sub<lb/>ject; I cannot swear I had not, but, as far as my recollection serves me, I say no—I cannot recollect that he ever stated to me that he had sold that very cargo of coals to Mr. Croll, the proprietor of some gas works, and that they had been returned upon his hands as little better than rubbish; I cer<lb/>tainly know, through my clerk, there was a dispute about it, but I never to my recollection saw Mr. Nicol on the subject—I saw this bill of lading of the Speculation before I was paid the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the word "heap" is written in here, in very small characters, and also in the margin—those words were in this bill of lading at the time I handed it to Mr. Nicol—I do not know who put them in; they were the same as we received them from the shippers—the original contract did not contain the word "heap"—I cannot say whether the quality of East Hutton double-screened nut coals is different to heap; it depends entirely upon how long the coals have been on the heap—I am not aware that the coals by the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> are at all inferior to East Hutton double-screened nut—whether heap coals are inferior to East Hutton double-screened nut depends upon how long they have been on the heap—I am not aware that the description of coals stated in the contract is different from that described in the bill of lading as heap; it would depend upon the sur<lb/>vey or examination of the coals—there is sometimes a difference of from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between heap coals and coals not heaped; not in all cases.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not "heap" a deteriorating term, to distinguish them from first class coals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it may be so; I should think it would be—there is not a word about "heap" in my receipt for the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> cargo—the whole invoice is not in my writing, but my clerk's—the words "best double screened" were written by me at the request of Mr. Nicol—he did not refuse to pay until I wrote that; he asked me if I would do so and I put it—I wrote the receipt at his office—by the receipt I mean the words "creditor by cash"—I do not recollect whether Mr. Nicol produced the contract or not; I cannot swear that he did not, or that he did, it was such a matter of indifference at the time—I do not of my own knowledge know that the cargo of coals was refused by Mr. Croll, and that it was sold subsequently on the Coal Exchange at a loss—after Mr. McGregor was sent to Hartlepool, and before the cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> arrived, I called on Mr. Nicol about three times with the Captain of the <hi rend="italic">Speculation,</hi> who wished to have it discharged; I think it was before the bills of lading had arrived—on those occasions the loss or damage accruing to him by reason of my alleged breach of contract was not the subject of discussion; he told mo that he was endeavouring to get Mr. Croll to take the coals, and that he had been offering Mr. Croll to allow him so much for taking the cargo off his hands; I think he said he offered 10 per cent.—he told me on the day that I took the other bills of lading, that Mr. Croll had refused to have anything to do with them—on the day that I applied for the bills of lading by the <hi rend="italic">Eagle,</hi> it was talked about leaving the matter between us to arbitration, but I refused, in consequence of his not performing his promise of the morning by returning the bills—on that 24th August, on receiving the bills of lading, I called at Mr. Nicol's office, and found him not in; I then left the invoice—Mr. Nicol had not previously requested that the bills of lading should be made out in his favour according to the usage of the trade—I do not know who the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> was chartered by; I never saw the charter party—he did not tell me that he had chartered the <hi rend="italic">Eagle;</hi> he might have told my clerk that he chartered her for somebody else—I did not charter her—by the bills of lading of the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> the cargo purports to be shipped by Mann, Brothers; they are the merchants who we purchased the coals of—the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> cargo was likewise purchased of them—according to the usage of the trade the bills of lading ought not to have been made out to the order of Mr. Nicol; he did not request to me that they should be made out to him—the first bill of lading being to the order of Mann, Brothers, they endorsed it—it was handed to me with their endorsement on it, and I handed it to Mr. Nicol—the second bills of lading were not made out as the first, because we acted on our own account, Messrs. Mann, Brothers, got the bills of lading signed as our agents; our clerk attended to it—I never promised Mr. Nicol that the bills should be made out to his order, and never intended to do so—the two guineas for expedi<lb/>tion was charged, I believe, in consequence of a telegraphic message sent down to Mr. McGregor by Mr. Wigdahl, which I did not know at the time, to expedite the shipment of the coal; I only knew that from Mr. McGregor; subsequently—I did not know from Mr. Nicol that the bills of lading were required to be sent off to Cherbourg that same night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you understand about this charge "Expences in securing bill of lading, two guineas;" it is one of your own charges? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On receiving a letter from my clerk at Hartlepool I made out an invoice for</p>

Fowles' order, and that therefore their endorsement should be on the bill of lading previous to his—he said that it made no matter; they were merely his agents—I replied that in that case I would have nothing to do with it, I would leave it to our managing-clerk, who knew more about it than I did; therefore, if he waited until his return, the affair would be settled—he went away, and told me to tell Mr. Royal, our clerk, that he should wait for him till 2 o'clock at his office—I can undertake to swear that at that time the only endorsement on the bill was, "John Nicol &amp; Co."—he took the bill away with him.</p>

I am in partnership with my father in the cutlery trade, at 79, Newgate-street—on 13th August I was the last on the premises—I left about half-past 8—the shutters were up, and the street door fastened—on Sunday morning, from something that was told me, I went back to the shop, and found the outer door secure—the second door had been opened but not forced—a great many things had been taken out of the shop, and others packed up ready to go—no one slept on the premises—I identify all the goods in this bag—I found this crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the shop.</p>

P., 208, Upper Thames-street; most of them came by post—I had other people also applying—in consequence of this, I communicated with the police—soon after that the two prisoners came in, and I gave Logan the letters—a great many persons called while they were there; a stranger came in after a berth, and showed me an advertisement and a newspaper; this is the identical one—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards showed it to Logan, and said, "This is not the kind of advertisement that you told me of;" he said, "It is all right, Mr. Groves, this gentleman (meaning the prisoner Gardner) will engage all the persons that come here"—he said that in Gardner's presence, and Gardner said nothing—Logan then left—Gardner remained—while there several per<lb/>sons called, and I referred them to him, and he spoke to them; he afterwards went away, and I got all the abuse—the letters kept continually coming in; one came in last Saturday—I have given 70 or 80 letters to the officer; they contained either one, two, three, or four, postage stamps—I received a letter from a person named Emma Schofield; it did not come by post—I also received one from Osborne (<hi rend="italic">the policeman here produced the letter</hi>)—the one that Schofield delivered to me I gave to the prisoner Logan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 411). I received a communication from Mr. Groves on 31st August—on 7th September, about a quarter to 10, I went to the prisoner Logan's lodgings; saw him, and asked him if his name was Logan; he said "Yes"—I asked him if he was the person who repre<lb/>sented himself to be O. P. in the advertisement, certifying that he wanted 400 hands; he said, no; it was that man I saw him with the other day—that man was Gardner—I took him into custody—he then said "The fact of it is, that that man has an invention in his head by which the Illustrated London News might be printed at one-third less cost price"—I have a packet of letters here; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took Gardner the same afternoon; he had a piece of white paper on his breast, so as to look like the front of a shirt—the whole of these letters contained one or more post<lb/>age stamps, some three or four; they are all directed to 0. P., 208, Upper Thames-street—on Logan I found this strip of paper, it is a receipt signed by Logan, "Received from Mr. Groves some letters;" and a corresponding one on Gardner—I also found on Gardner the letter which has been identified by Osborne; I had previously opened it at Groves's, and found stamps, and had marked them; they were not in when I found it on Gardner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Logan's Defence,</hi> I met the prisoner Gardner about the middle of August last, and in the course of conversation I told him I was out of a situation, and had been out some time; he then told me he had an invention of his own,</p>

               <p>and said he was going to advertise for hands, and said he would give me a situation, for which I was very thankful. He asked me, before we parted, if I could get any respectable place where answers could be taken to the advertisement; he said he could not have them received at his lodgings—I said I would try to get a place. I went to a public-house, and asked the landlord, but he said he could not be bothered. While I was speaking to him, a person named Shoot came up to me, and said, "If you go down to Mr. Groves, he would take them," and gave me a card. I went to Mr. Groves, and asked him if he would oblige me; I told him all about the invention, and he agreed to take the answers; I then left. It was somewhere about a week after that, I met with Gardner; it was the day previous to the adver<lb/>tisement. I said to Mr. Groves, "This is the person I represented; you will be kind enough to give him the letters." I then went away with Gardner. The following morning I went with him again; ten letters were given to me, and two to Gardner. I then went away, and Gardner came and threatened to summons me for these letters—I said "I went and engaged the man, and I was to be the responsible party." He said he had been to Bow-lane station-house, and I was to go with him to receive the letters, and then I was told that I was to come next day. The next morning I was taken to Guildhall, was sent to trial, and here I am now, committed for putting con<lb/>fidence in a man whom I had no reason to doubt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gardner's Defence.</hi> It is a considerable time ago, since I made a discovery of this invention. I have been assisted by a gentleman with money and other means; he promised further to assist me; he promised me some premises; and up to the Saturday after the advertisement appeared, I expected his assistance, when I received a letter from him, which threw me altogether on my own resources. I determined then, that all the letters I received I would answer, making it compulsory for the persons to find their own references. With that idea I determined to act. The man mentioned in this list offered me security from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; if fraud had been my object I could easily have obtained that I might have been rather sanguine, but my object was not fraud. Logan knew nothing at all about what the object was; and probably, having known me long, he might often have heard me talking about it, and consequently he (immediately I told him it was my determination to go on with the discovery) gladly took the situation I offered him. I care little for myself; but I say that Logan had not the least idea that any thing was wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Hand, the attorney in this case—I served the writ on the defendant on 8th March, 1859; that was in the action of Gillman against Westley—I have been in attendance at Mr. Hand's office to-day—I have just come from there; when I left he had gone over the water on some business—I know Mr. Gillman, the prosecutor; he has often been to our office; he generally sees Mr. Hand when he comes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that no proof had been given of the jurisdiction of the Insolvent Court, before which the alleged perjury was committed; he also took several objections to the form of the indictment; it commenced by reciting three Acts of Parliament, under which the insolvency proceedings were taken, two of those three were wrongly recited; and he submitted that Lord Campbell's act, would not enable the Court to amend the description; this was held to be a good objection in arrest of judgment, in Rex v. Byers; and was supported by Reg. v. Gill. The Court intimated that the objection would go much further than was suggested by counsel, for the insolvent jurisdiction depended a good deal on 1 and 2 Vic. c. 110, which was not recited at all in the indictment.</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">would not go so far as to say it was necessary that the 1 and 2 Vic. should be recited; or, indeed, that it was essential that the other three Acts should be; but having been so recited, it was necessary that they should be correctly described; at present the jurisdiction was alleged to depend upon three specific Acts, whereas, as regarded two of them, no such Acts in fact existed. He further objected to the vague form of the statement alleged to be false, and con<lb/>tended that there was no evidence to go to the Jury of perjury as to the hand<lb/>writing, the prisoners expression merely being, "I do not think it is my writing?" I believe it is my brother's." The Court was of opinion that it had power to amend the misdescription of the Acts of Parliament, but considered the objections taken of sufficient importance to reserve for the consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Tunstall of Canning-town—I was on the platform on this Sunday evening, and saw the prisoner there about five minutes to 9 o'clock—he asked Terry about the train to Woolwich—I saw him watch Terry into the porter's room—he watched Mr. Steward, the station-master, up stairs, and immediately got up and went out directly—he</p>

I am a porter at the Barking-road station of the Eastern Counties Railway—I was at the top of the up stairs, on Sunday night, 28th August, and saw the prisoner on the down platform—he walked towards the stairs to the booking-office, came back, picked up the bell, and walked up the stairs with it into the room—I laid down my lamp and followed him; but when I got into the road I could see neither man nor bell—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed under Messrs Kirk and Parry; I had the superintendance of the works going on at the clothing department, but not that job of taking down the wall—there were three jobs going on at that time—the taking down the wall was done by day-work; that was done by the engineer; we had to find them men to do it—they make an agreement for so many men—Mr. Lynch had the superintendence of that alteration; he is clerk of the works—I had to find the men and materials which they required—I recollect that some party-walls were taken down, and I after<lb/>wards saw a lot of bricks there—I know the prisoner; he was turned over to the engineer; but we pay him—he received his instructions from the clerk of the works—I can't say whether he was employed in the clothing store—he used to go in and out of the Arsenal when he thought proper—he did not make application to me to remove any bricks—I never told him he might remove bricks from the clothing store; I had no authority to do so, and I never did it—I heard a party say that he was building two houses—I never gave Turner any authority to remove bricks from the clothing store—there is always lime and mortar pulled down as well as bricks—I believe a great number of the bricks were stacked.</p>

               <p>was to be done—that was with Mr. Constable, the senior clerk of the works—I did not say to the prisoner, "I shall have some old bricks in a few days, you may as well have them; they will suit you"—he did not say to me, "I don't require them; my buildings are nearly completed"—I did not say "You may as well have them as anybody else, and put a pound in my pocket"—nothing of that kind occurred at the gate of the engineer's yard, near to the Arsenal—I had no conversation with him near the gate of the engineer's yard—he did not say "How many have you got?"—I did not say, "I shall have a great many in a few days;" nothing of the kind ever passed—I know Turner; I never saw him take any bricks to the pri<lb/>soner; I never saw him at the clothing store at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am the prosecutor of this indictment, and am a carpenter and builder of 35, Black heath-hill—the first time I had deal<lb/>ings with the prisoner was in the early part of 1857—I filed in the Insolvent Court all the receipts of dealings which I had with the prisoner prior to my insolvency; these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are in the prisoner's writing; I saw him write them all—they are, January, 1857, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; May 14, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; June 8th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; August 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d:;</hi> November 28th, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I was obliged in the early part of 1858 to take the Protection Act—I had not had the prisoner's account, but I supposed it was something between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I scheduled it at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went through the Insolvent Court—I was a debtor of the prisoner's before I filed my petition—the prisoner made no claim on me after I passed the Court, except a con<lb/>versation between us—those 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are not claimed in these particulars—after I passed through the Insolvent Court, I had fresh dealings with the prisoner, and become again indebted to him somewhere about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he sued me in the County-court, Greenwich, for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the action came on on 29th June this year—I heard the prisoner sworn and give his evidence; this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Allen's writing; I received it on 13th November, 1858, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I paid him in my front office—he came in a cart, which he left with his men at the Horse and Groom public-house next door to me; he said, "I am terribly hard up for money, I have been driving all round the neighbourhood and cannot get any, and I cannot send my men home because I cannot pay them their wages; and if you could let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would do me a very great service to-night"—I said, "Well, I can let you have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then went up into my bedroom and fetched two sovereigns out of a box where I usually keep my money, and said to him, "Have you a stamp?"—he said "No," and I provided him with this stamp and this piece of paper, with which he wrote this receipt on my desk—I put it on the, file, and went with him to the Horse and Groom to have a glass of ale—on the trial of the action this receipt was delivered to the Judge, who asked the prisoner whether it was his writing; he said "Yes," but that it was for money which he received of me previous to my insolvency"—I had no dealings with him in 1856, nor has he ever claimed to have had any—the question was whether this was 1857 or 1858; he swore in the County-court that it was intended for a 7—I recalled the circumstances to his mind—I said "Allen, this is too bad; if I never had a receipt for this money at all, the circumstances under which I paid it are quite sufficient; you must remember leaving your men at the Horse and Groom and coming to me, and my going there with you; I remained a short time with you and left you there"—upon this his solicitor said, "Now, Allen, this is very positive; did you ever in your life leave your men at the Horse and Groom while you went to Mr. Wood's?"—he said "No; and I wish I may never be suffered to reach home alive if I ever had more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of him in my life"—that was his only answer to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190070"/>
               <p>the statement I made—I paid the money myself represented by these receipts, and saw him write them.</p>

DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The jury found a verdict against you, did they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was examined and gave the same evidence that I have given here to-day—Allen said both that this receipt was 1857, and that it must have been given before my insolvency—I was alone in the office when he came; my family were down below in the kitchen; they did not see him, but Mrs. Wood heard his voice—I keep books; I have a cash-book; the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not entered in it, but it is entered in the ledger—I made this entry at Christmas; I took it from the receipt on the file—this paper, dated 25th April, 1859, is in my writing; it is an account delivered by me to Allen, in April, 1859; it is simply a debtor account of work that I had done for him; it is my account—here is an entry of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is included in that; he did not give me credit for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has never given me credit for a farthing—there is no date to the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could not prove when I paid him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and therefore I sent him in this second account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I charge him here in November with only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was changed into 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because not being in a position to prove it, I waived it—I did not make any entry of the payment of this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this entry in the ledger was not posted from any other book but the receipt on the file—this "Work at Wellington, extra for dust-hole, and c." is entered from my other books; all this writing was not done at one time—I have got here 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that is a shilling which I lent him for which I had not any acknowledgment—having an entry of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I claimed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because I feel convinced that I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I am not positive enough to prove where I paid it—in April, having an impression that I had paid him another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I charged it; that was an experiment to try his honour—I positively swear that all these entries in the ledger were not made at the same time—although my books only show 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I claimed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can rely on all that is in my books; I cannot rely on anything that is not in them—Allen said in his evidence that he had been at the Horse and Groom with me on some occasion; he did not say that he had been with me there once, and only once; he said he had been with me there several times—I should say that I have been with him there half-a-dozen times—the attorney's question was not whether he had gone there with me after re<lb/>ceiving the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mean to say that I never had a transaction with Allen before January, 1857; I have never said that I had—I applied for a new trial and was refused; I did not since that go to Allen's house and ask him for time—I did not go to him and offer to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down and give him a bill at two months for the balance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of High-street, Deptford—I was pre<lb/>sent at Greenwich County-court during the trial of Allen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Wood—a piece of paper was torn from the file by the Judge, which was said to be a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the prisoner distinctly said was given by him to Wood in 1857—I saw it in the hands of the Judge and the jury, but not so as to know whether this is it—Wood then asked him if he did not recollect his coming to his house on a Saturday night, and asking him to let him have some money to assist in paying his men—Allen's reply was, "I do not"—he said, "Do you not recollect my giving you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and going from thence into the Horse and Groom?"—he said that he did not; he never was there—Mr. Wood then asked him if he did not recollect his going in with him, he having left his son, or sons, I think, at the Horse and Groom; and he said also, "We had a glass of ale at the bar"—Allen said, "No, I recollect nothing of the kind; I was never there"—Wood said, "Do you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190071"/>
               <p>not recollect told me you gave one of the sovereigns to your son?"—he said, "No, I recollect nothing of the kind"—he asked him if he did not re<lb/>collect being there for an hour afterwards, in the parlour—he still said, "No"—Allen said that he had never received more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Wood in his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any question put to the prisoner by his attorney about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection, his attorney did ask him whether he recollected it, and he said, "No, I do not."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Is what you say, that, when the question was put to Mr. Allen, he said that he did not recollect having gone there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was his first answer, following it up with, "I never was, there," or words to that effect—I swear now that he said that he never was there—this is my signature to the deposition. (<hi rend="italic">This being ready stated,</hi> "I am not sure whether he denied going to the public-house with Wood or not")—it is very possible that I said so, because I was called suddenly from my business, and did not recollect it, but I have recollected it since—I was not a listener in the Police-court, also—when I received the summons, I knew that I was going to give evidence—I call myself a surveyor; I am also a house-agent—I do not do a little in the law way, certainly not—I am a house-agent, appraiser, surveyor, and undertaker, and I shall be very glad to bury you at any time—I have drawn up a will—I sometimes take cases at the County-court, as agent for an attorney, a friend of mine, who is on the rolls—I am a County-court agent—various constructions may be put upon that term—I do not tout for customers and take them to an attorney—I appear for plaintiff or defendant, to represent that a debt is owing, calling on the plaintiff or defendant to substantiate the case—you may call that doing a little in the law way, I have no objection—Mr. Wood and I have not had a conversation about this prosecution, nor have I and Mr. Dempster, the attorney—I do not know how they came to call me, but Mr. Wood, as a carpenter, has been to me about measuring work—I did not make a note of what Allen said in Court—he said distinctly that it was the receipt he gave in 1857, though I do not recollect the words exactly—I will not venture to swear that his words were not "Before your insolvency;" but I do not recol<lb/>lect his saying so—the insolvency was in 1858.</p>

The July rate, 1857, would be audited in May, 1858—the auditor attends on 3d May—I was present—the prisoner did not attend that audit—he was very ill at the time I believe—he sent his books—I did not see by the books what money had been paid in on</p>

I saw the prisoner on 8th May—I spoke to him about the deficiency, and asked him how he was prepared to make up that deficiency to the parish?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was something to that effect—he said he had got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in book debts, which he would make over, and the lease of a house in the Kent-road; and he made over those book debts—that was after I had asked him to explain the deficiency—no amount was mentioned—I think he spoke about the book debts and the lease, before he entered into the explanation as to the way in which the deficiency occurred—I never requested him to make out an account of the deficiency—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Metcalfe submitted that the arrangement entered into with the prisoner by the witness was equivalent to a promise not to prosecute, and that anything said by the prisoner upon that was not admissible.

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Go on and state what took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner said he had the misfortune to have his cash-box, containing 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stolen from his office in Glengall-grove, where he then lived—he said it was parish and government money, and was partly in notes and partly in gold, pretty well all gold; he thought it was in the year 1854—he said he did not mention it to any one, without it was his wife, of course, I suppose he meant; but they suspected a servant who had left them, and had got mar<lb/>ried, and he spoke to an inspector of police to make inquiries about the character of the husband, and found he was a steady person; that he was afraid to make it public, for fear he should lose his situation, and he hoped to surmount his difficulties—he also said that he had lent money to a Mr. Mawby, to the amount of 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he gave him 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and Mr. Mawby assigned over the lease of a house and stables, at the back of the Swan public-house, in the old Kent-road—he said it was the parish money; he said he never had any money of his own—he also said that he had lent money to his friends and others, which had all turned out bad debts—he also stated that about three years previous he was deficient with the Govern<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190079"/>
               <p>to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he borrowed 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a Mr. Enoch Clark, for the purpose of making good that deficiency—I think it was at this interview that he agreed to transfer his book debts—he carried on business as a tailor—I believe his book debts were transferred, but I cannot say—they amounted to above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe—the amount that has actually been received upon them is 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I only know that from Mr. Mars<lb/>den—I do not think the amount of the deficiency was mentioned at that interview, either by me or by the prisoner—at that time there were no sums entered in the January rate-book,' as having been received by the prisoner—this is a receipt and deposit book, in which he should enter all monies he received, and also what he pays into the bankers—we found that he had not entered a single shilling—he was not requested to make up that book; we did it ourselves, I and my brother overseer, Mr. Coombe—these are his figures in the January rate-book; this represents that he has received 1,753<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the January rate—that was made up subsequently (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Metcalfe objected to this evidence, as it related to what took place after the arrangement had been made, and a formal deed entered into upon the subject. An indenture of agreement was handed in by Mr. Marsden, which the Recorder, upon perusing, was of opinion had the effect of rendering what took place subse<lb/>quently, inadmissible</hi>)—I had an interview with the prisoner on 8th May—he wrote this letter on 10th May (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter to the Churchwardens and Overseers, stating that he was too ill to attend to his business, and appoint<lb/>ing his brother and brother-in-law to go through the rate-books and vouchers, to ascertain the amount he owed to the parish</hi>)—In consequence of that, the accounts were investigated by those two persons and the parish officers—there is no date to the entries made in this book; I am not able to say when they were made; it must have been some little time after 8th May—they were six or seven days going into the account; it must have been done after the agreement was entered into.</p>

                  </hi>. In November, 1857, the prisoner requested me to call on Mr. Jackson to receive payment of some rates—I did not take a letter; that had been sent the day before—Mr. Jackson gave me this cheque—I delivered it to the prisoner the same day—I have taken money to the London and Westminster Bank repeatedly—I knew that the prisoner had an account there; it was at the Southward Branch, London-bridge—I am not certain whether this cheque was paid in with other monies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have repeatedly paid monies that you have col<lb/>lected for the parish into that bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for Mr. Cooper; that was a regular and proper thing to do—I was employed by Mr. Cooper; I very frequently collected for him—I do not know whether he was ill at that time; he has been ill several times; he was very ill in 1858; I heard that it was brain fever—he had been ill for some time before these gentlemen went to him—it is possible that I may have taken a letter to Mr. Jackson; but the letter requesting him to pay me, I think, was sent to him the day before—I did not take the collecting books with me to Mr. Jackson's; I merely went for the cheque at Mr. Cooper's request—I don't remember Mr. Jackson's returning the papers to me; whatever he gave me I returned with the cheque to Mr. Cooper—I remember receiving the cheque, which I gave a receipt for—when I collect I generally take the books with me, and return them, with the money I have collected, in the evening—I always make entries of what I receive—I took all the books with me relating to the different rates, poor-rates, sewers, lighting, and so on; it is divided into eight books—in this instance I only went for the cheque—I have collected for Mr. Cooper for about eighteen months—I have gone through these books—I merely assisted for a very short period, to make up the cash-book—I did not call attention to the cheque received from Mr. Jackson; that would not be in the cash-book—I did not see the balance made; the prisoner's brother finished the balance—I never had anything to do with the parish at all—I was employed by Mr. Cooper, and returned my accounts to him—I was employed by him when I assisted to make up the cash-book; he requested me to do it—that was not the book for July, 1857—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I did not take great notice of it; it was only handed to me on Saturday night, and I was to do it by the Monday—in fact the only thing I had to do was the addition—it commences in 1855—I did not go through it, only partly—I merely did the adding-up, and the prisoner's brother finished—I made some of the entries, I have no doubt, but cannot see them now—I made them in pencil, and they have been filled up—I am not aware that I entered some sums, which bad been received by the prisoner and had not been entered before; I dare say I did—there were two or three books, but they</p>

               <p>were sent for in a violent hurry—in fact, I ought not to say that I had anything to do with the books at all—the prisoner certainly gave me the book, with the request that I would make it up as well as I could; but, as I said before, I had these books late on the Saturday; they were to be sent in on the Monday, and the brother came and took them from me on the Saturday—this is very nearly two years ago; it was in the early part of 1858—they were in a hurry to make up the books for the purpose of the audit—the prisoner was ill in bed at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. This is the July, 1857, poor-rate book—the sums entered here are in the prisoner's handwriting—there is an amount of something, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here against Mr. Jackson; it is in separate items, and appears to be brought forwards from various other rates, includ<lb/>ing the July rate—I have seen all the books; there is no entry in this, or any other book, of 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or anything like that sum, as received from Mr. Jackson—he appears to be a debtor to the parish to the amount here stated—there ap<lb/>pears to be in his arrear column, that is the irrecoverable column, the sums of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then turn to another page, still in the prisoners hand writing; one sum appears to have been altered; the casting appears to have been made incorrect in the first instance—the sums are here, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the time that these books were given up, the whole of that appeared to be due; I believe it is 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the general rate, July, 1857, Mr. Jackson appears to be a debtor to the parish in the following sums, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that all appears to be due by this book—after the prisoner was suspended, I was appointed to collect, and the books were given into my keeping—in accordance with the appearance of those books, I called on Mr. Jackson for the amount of the rates, and then it was he gave me infor<lb/>mation—I got a cheque from him for the balance; it is something like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that and the 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. make up the amount which appeared to be due from him in these two accounts—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the recoverable book, applicable to the general rate; it is in the prisoner's handwriting—I did not see this book until the other day—Mr. Jackson is there represented as still in arrears for the same sums which I have named, not the items of the poor-rate, this book only purports to be for the general rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that in the July rate-book of 1857, the prisoner has entered all the sums that you have given us, as in arrear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on one line the name of the occupier is put, and "Thomas Jackson" on another line; there are various houses belonging to Mr. Jackson which were separately assessed and afterwards compounded for by him, and the balance is written off as irrecoverable; a man who compounds is rated on more favourable terms—the difference between what the occupier and the owner would have to pay is written off as irrecoverable—the owner would pay the rate instead of the tenants, it appears so here; that is quite usual—the owner's name does not appear—this "compounded for" is written by the prisoner—we frequently allow a landlord to come in after the rate has been made, and compound for his tenants—these books have not been in the prisoner's possession since he was suspended; he gave up all his books at that time—I don't know whether that was at the time the agreement was entered into assigning his debts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you made this agreement with the prisoner, you did not, of course, think he was guilty of embezzlement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not an agree<lb/>ment; I made no agreement with him—I, on the part of the parish, prepared the deed of assignment of his debts, or it was prepared in my office—I con<lb/>sidered at that time that he was guilty of embezzlement; but my clients perhaps, at that time, did not wish to treat it so—I drew out an agreement for the parish to get what they could; of course I knew very well that a collector, when he collects money and does not pay it over, is guilty of embezzlement; and knowing that, I drew that assignment; I advised them to accept it, <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi>—I wanted to get as much for the parish as I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And not being able to get the balance, you advised them to turn round on this poor fellow, and indict him for felony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; it was supposed at the time the assignment was taken that he only owed to the parish what was represented by the recital in the deed, but this 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not included in that sum—it was under the advice of counsel, that the last case was prosecuted; it was not under the advice of counsel that the matter was compromised; I do not say that it was compromised; the criminal proceedings were referred by the vestry—the prisoner was taken into custody in July or August last—this prosecuting him was not made known to me until instructions were given to issue a warrant against him—it was reported to the parish from time to time, that he was keeping a lodging-house at Brighton—I got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one surety; that was probably in December, 1858—I did not get a further sum from the prisoner; it was long before that that I sued him; the matter did not drop then, until I found he was keeping the lodging-house at Brighton—there were actions pending against the sureties, and it had been referred by the vestry, to the Finance Committee; and ultimately, in July, they reported from the subse<lb/>quent discoveries of great defalcations, that they thought the Vestry ought to order a prosecution for embezzlement; that was in July, 1859—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190084"/>
               <p>not reported to the vestry till then—it was reported that he was a defaulter to a certain amount—that was the report made long prior; but the subse<lb/>quent defalcations which amounted to a larger sum, were not reported till July, 1859—I cannot give any particular reason why the report was not made before that; it went on from time to time like other matters; and by July they found what could be collected from the sureties; and it was also reported to them that large subsequent defalcations were discovered, from time to time, over and above the account; and then the Finance Committee reported to the vestry—what I allude to is this; the accounts were supposed to have been taken by his brother, and his brother-in-law, I mean those accounts that were not included in that account—I have settled the action with one surety, by taking 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—and I have settled the other by taking 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by instalments—the third I could get nothing from; he was not considered to be worth powder and shot—there were three sureties—the poundage due to the prisoner is shown in the account—I dare say it may be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on all the rates—there has been no general settlement with him on the part of the parish; each rate is audited—if he had made any application for poundage, he could have received it—there was not any general settlement; the way would be this, the auditor would go through the account, and ascertain what the poundage would be, and if he sent in his account and made a proper application for it, he would have received it; the rate-book will show it; and of course if he wanted the money, he would have applied for it—the auditor generally puts down how much is due to him—I should say that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of poundage extends to the 1856 rate, not to 1858—the rate for 1858 was not under audit at that time—we are not charging him with the receipt of any portion of that in this case, he had only received the book in the middle of January, and then the July rate of 1857 was under audit—there would be no poundage due to him; it would be due to him as soon as collected—the poor-rate is a January and July rate—the sewer and lighting is made for one year, payable by instal<lb/>ments—I can only say that the parish did not pay the poundage, because he did not ask for it—I know of no other reason—I am the person to whom he should apply for it—he did not make repeated applications to me to have it settled; nor to my clerk, that I know of—I have always thought that his salary would be worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but he told me at the time that he was ill, that it was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never gave it my attention unless an application was made—if he required a cheque, upon his writing, it was put before the churchwardens and overseers, and they signed it; it was not then given to me, it was given to the party entitled to it—I drew the cheque; it would either be handed to me and left in my office till called for—not personally paid by me—my clerk transacts business for me—I have no knowledge or recollection of the prisoner's having made repeated applications for his money, from time to time—I have no doubt if he had put it forward in a proper way, it would have been paid immediately, like every other debt of the parish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the prisoner's over-paying upon the highway rate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I made up the account for the highway rate, I found that he had overpaid that; that would not be a deduction upon this matter, it would be a deduction from the general account—I found that out, I should think, about the latter end of June, 1858—he had paid it into the vestry account, and the vestry account gave the churchwardens credit for the amount; that was discovered after I had got the books, and was inquiring for that purpose.</p>

I am a plumber in the Commercial-road, Bermondsey—the prisoner occupied two rooms in my house in July and August last, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on 18th July, he owed me two weeks' rent, and that evening he paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to my wife in my presence for two weeks' rent—I saw him give it to her—she placed it in a drawer; there was no other money there at that time—about 12 or 15 minutes afterwards she went to the drawer, took a piece out and gave it to me—I went to a shop and offered it in payment for some ham, and it was returned to me as a bad one; it was never out of my sight at the shop—after that I came back to my house and looked at the other five pieces and they were all bad—I took them all next morning to the Southwark Police-court and gave them to the police constable—the prisoner continued to lodge in our house after that—I did not say anything to him about the two weeks' rent—on 9th August, my wife gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not see who gave her the money—I looked at them and found that five of them were bad—I gave them to police constable 249 M, the same day—I gave the six pieces on 19th July to Henry Upton—the prisoner was taken into custody on 9th August; he was not taken at my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I think it is very severe that a man should be taken up because he had a light waistcoat and cap on. The boy says I was on the bridge when I spoke to him, and the man says I was about twelve or more yards on this side of it, therefore the boy's statement is wrong; and then the girls only swear that I am the man because I had a light waistcoat and cap on. It is very hard to have one's liberty sworn away by two children; they are not fit to take the oath; they can't tell now whether the man had whiskers or not The boy was proved to tell falsehoods repeatedly before the Magistrate. I had never been in the town at all that evening. I have a wife and children; my wife and one of the children are ill, and they have been in great distress since I have been apprehended.</p>
