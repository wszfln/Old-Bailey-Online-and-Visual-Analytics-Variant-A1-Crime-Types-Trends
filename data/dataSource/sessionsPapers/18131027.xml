            . I am a conductor of the patrol of St. Giles's. On the 19th of September I met the prisoner Jones crossing Guildford-street, Russell-square; he had a bag at his back; he waited at Grenville-street. I asked him what he had got there; he threw the bag off his shoulder; I felt it, and said it was corn. He said he had bought it at a corn chandler's. I asked him where the corn chandler lived; he then said, for God's sake let me go. I then took him into a public-house; I told him I must be satisfied where he got it. He then said he had it of Mr. Bembridge's groom, at Mr. Bembridge's stables. I asked him where the groom was to be found. He said, at the mews opposite. I then sent my brother officer to bring the groom to the public-house; he brought him there. When he came in the parlour I asked Jones if that was the man that he had the corn of; he said it was. I then said I should take them both in custody. They both begged I would let them go. Holding, the <rs id="t18131027-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">groom</rs>

I then sent for a coach, and took them to the watchhouse. Holding said to Jones, it is an unfortunate circumstance, he did not believe that ever before he had given him so much at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there in the bag - A. Two bushels of oats. When I first saw the prisoner he was within a few yards of the stable. I understood him to say that he had been in the stable, and had received them of the groom there.</p>

            . I am a carman to Mr. Challenor. On the 18th of August of August I was sent by my master to the India House for five chests of tea. After I had the chests of tea in the cart I had to go to a sugar bakers in Wentworth-street, for a hogshead of sugar, and then I had to take the whole to my master's. I knew how the chests were marked by the permit. I recollect the number of one of the casks was 16947. When I got to <placeName id="t18131027-2-crimeloc13">Wentworth-street</placeName>

I went into the sugar-house with the order for the sugar. I had nobody with me to mind the cart. I was absent from the cart about ten minutes, and as soon as I had put the hogshead of sugar in the cart I uncovered the chests of tea. I took the tarpaulin off, I missed one chest of tea. I immediately went to the office, and acquainted the officers of it. I, on the same day, afterwards, saw the same chest at Mr. White's house, in Cobley's-court, Essex-street. That was the same chest that was missing from the cart; it had the same number on it.</p>

I never saw them until the robbery was committed, on the 18th of August; it was Wednesday I saw the two prisoners with a chest of tea in their possession. I was in my own house; the prisoners were in the archway that leads to the house where I live. It was about two o'clock in the day. The prisoner, Skinner, stamped his foot on the top of the chest; he knocked the top in; he then said if he lost any of the tea his master would make him pay for it. He then asked me and another woman to hold a bag for him. A third man had the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another man with them, was there - A. Yes. The tea was emptied out of the chest; it pinched my hand so, I let go, and would have nothing more to do with it. The two prisoners emptied the tea out of the chest into a black bag. I saw all the tea emptied into the bag, except some that fell to the ground. The other woman let go her hold. The tea was emptied in the bag by the two prisoners. The man that brought the bag he went away immediately. I could not distinguish what he said.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from the sugar-house - A. About three hundred yards. I live near Essex-street. On Wednesday the 18th of August, about two o'clock, I was coming down Wentworth-street; I saw a cart standing facing of Mr. Coslett's gate, a sugar-baker. I saw the cart standing. I saw no carman. The prisoner, Skinner, I then saw standing about twelve yards from the cart. Skinner had two Jews with him. I knew Skinner before; I cannot speak to the others.</p>

In about half an hour after I was at home some of my children were in the street; I heard them cry, that induced me to look out of the window. I saw the prisoner, Skinner, coming along with a black bag upon his back, and something heavy in it by the appearance; he was bustling on fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him - A. No, he went to a neighbours of mine, about six doors off. He went in there with the bag; he went into Levy's house. He goes by the name of

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. On the 18th of August, Prior (the carman) came and gave information that a chest of tea had been taken out of his cart; it was near three o'clock. Hall and I went to Lion Levy's house, in Wentworth-street. When I went into the house I saw the two prisoner and another person that is not taken; they were along with Mrs. Levy, the mistress of the house. I told Mrs. Levy that I had just got information that a chest of tea had been brought in there. She said she knew nothing of it; I said I must look over the house. I left my brother officer to take care of the three men while I went up stairs. I found no tea. Upon my search we had no information against these men. I had not seen any of the witnesses then at that time. We left the house, and when we came out we consulted, and we returned in again, and finding Skinner in the house, not knowing him, we took him with us. The others we left, we thought we should be able to find them. After Skinner was taken to the office, I saw Mrs. White. When the prosecutor saw Skinner he told him that he had seen witnesses that had seen him steal the tea. As soon as Skinner heard that he confessed the whole; he said it was done by him and the other men; he said it was the first time that he had ever done any thing of the sort, and he had received two pound of Mrs. Levy for his share of the tea; he helped Mrs. Levy to put the tea into a sheet. Levy was not taken up until after last sessions. We went back to the house of Levy, the two men were gone. We searched Levy's house the second time, we could not find the tea. Skinner said, that Levy (the prisoner) had also two pounds of Mrs. Levy. Mr. Challenor brought the tea chest to the office. It has been in my fellow officer's possession ever since.</p>
               <p>- HALL. I was with Mr. Griffiths. I have heard his account, it is correct. I searched Skinner; I took from him a two pound note; he said that was his share that he received for the tea.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Prior. As near as you can say what time of day was it when you left your cart in Wentworth-street - A. Between two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the sugar baker at whose door you stopped - A. Coslett.</p>
               <p>Skinner said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Levy's Defence. I was coming past this alley, I saw two young men that I had never seen before in my life; they had a chest and a bag in their hands up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270005"/>this alley; one of them asked me to hold the bag open for them; I held it open, and in a short time I walked away. I have never seen them since. Then after that I went into the place at the back of Mr. Levy's house, which is a large yard, and there were several people playing at ball, and different games. I went in, and played among them. I had been there a quarter of an hour when some young fellows said there is some officers coming, we had better go away. Some of them run out of the yard. I went into Mr. Levy's back room, and sat down there. I saw the prisoner, Skinner, sitting in the room with another young man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the horse on the night of the 2nd of October - A. Yes. about half past seven o'clock in the evening, on Saturday. I fed him, and left him safe in the stable. He had a halter on, and was fastened to the manger.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door out of the coach-house into the stable - A. Yes, the stable door was not bolted; the coach-house door that led into the street was bolted. The prisoner had been there in the afternoon about twenty minutes. He let me in the stable yard, and passed into the street the way that he came in. He went away about a quarter before five. I saw no more of him. I went to the stable about five o'clock on Sunday morning; upon my going there I found the horse was gone. The back door of the stable was wide open; the door of the coach-house was open leading into the stable yard; the coach-house door, leading into the street, was shut, but not bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a saddle and a bridle - A. Yes. After I missed the horse I went into the saddle room and missed the saddle and bridle. It was a curb bridle, with black reins. I then communicated to my master that the horse, saddle, and bridle were gone. I enquired of the London Mail respecting the prisoner and the horse. I got from them an account that such a man had been on the road. After that, I went to Stanmore in Middlesex; I saw the prisoner there, and Dr. Kerr's horse. I saw the prisoner at the Abercorn Arms; the horse was at Dr. Guest's, a farrier's. The horse that I saw at Dr. Guest's, was Dr. Kerr's horse. It was the same horse that I lost out of the stable; he was a chesnut horse, with a bald face. The horse appeared to me to have been rid hard; he had been down, and broken in his knee, his nose, and his head. The prisoner was in hold at that time at the Abercorn Arms, in the tap-room. I saw the saddle and the bridle in the stable at the Abercorn Arms; they were the property of my master. I am sure they were the Doctor's bridle and saddle. The next time I saw the prisoner was at the magistrate's. I am sure that the horse that I saw at Dr. Guest's, at Stanmore, was Dr. Kerr's horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner and the horse together - A. Yes, I did, down at the magistrate's.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I live at Dunstable; that is in the Northampton road from town. I first saw the prisoner as I was standing at my own door on Sunday morning, the 3d of October; he was upon a chesnut horse. I saw that horse afterwards at the magistrate's. He came along the road as if from Northampton to London. I received information; I went in pursuit of him on horseback. I came up with him at Stanmore, in Middlesex; he was standing at the stable door of the Abercorn Arms, and I saw the horse in the stable as I passed by. I sent for a constable; a constable came; his name is Chapman. I told the constable to take him in charge for stealing the horse; the prisoner denied it, and said it was not Dr. Kerr's horse.</p>

            . I am the ostler at the Abercorn Arms. On Sunday, a little after three in the afternoon, the prisoner came in on a chesnut horse with a bald face. The horse seemed very much tired. He desired me to give the horse some hay and water. He said he had but a very little time to stop. The horse appeared to have been rid hard, he had two broken knees, a cut on his nose, and a cut above his eye. I gave the horse a little hay and water. The horse was in the stable. Mr. Arnold, the butcher, of Dunstable, came and asked if such a person had been there. I shewed the prisoner to Arnold; he was at the stable door; the prisoner was delivered over into the charge of the constable; the horse I took care of. I believe one of the post boys took the horse to the farrier. That horse that the post boy took to the farrier was the horse that the prisoner led into the stable. There was no other chesnut horse with a bald face there. The prisoner took that horse into our house.</p>

            . I am a constable at Stanmore. I apprehended the prisoner at the stable door of the Abercorn Arms. Arnold gave me charge of him on suspicion of stealing Dr. Kerr's horse. I asked Arnold his name and address. He told me to keep the prisoner in custody until he went to Dr. Kerr's. I kept him in custody until Tuesday, then Arnold and Dr. Kerr's coachman came to me. I took him then before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had the prisoner in custody had you any conversation with him - A. Yes; he owned to every thing. I promised him no favour, nor threatened him. He owned to stealing the horse; he said he was a guilty man, that he had offended the laws of his country. I took him before the magistrate, and the ostler rode the horse down to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Langdon. Was the horse that the ostler rode to the magistrate, Dr. Kerr's horse - A. Yes, it was. I fed and attended the horse. My master gave fifty guineas for it. It was a riding horse.</p>

             that lived in the Highway. I said, I do not recollect you now, you do not follow butchering. No, said he; he said he worked at the India House. He then said, we have not seen one another a good while, shall we go and have something to drink. He took me by the arm; we went up Graces-alley, into a public-house at the end of White Lion-street, to have something to drink. We had two pints of beer there; we sat facing one another. I stopped in the house about ten minutes; we drank the beer; I got up to go home. I put my hand into my pocket to pay for the beer. I pulled my pocket-book out. I then took a shilling out to pay for the beer; I put my pocket-book in again; then directly I came to the door to go home; he said he was going my way home, he would go with me. He took me by the left arm, and we went up White Lion-street. On the left hand side there was a great deal of scaffolding; they had been repairing five or six houses; we went in and out of the scaffolding several times, and people run against me I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had hold of your left arm - A. Yes, and I had hold of my umbrella in my right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no hand at liberty to guard your pockets - A. No. When we had cleared the scaffolding about ten yards he decamped all at once; he said, there, and when I had walked about ten yards by myself, as near as I can guess, I clapped my hand, I missed my pocket-book immediately. I cannot swear he took it.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service. I was employed in the same warehouse as the prisoner; that warehouse contained spices. There was a great quantity of nutmegs in that warehouse. On the 17th of September I observed the prisoner; he put his hand and took a handfull of nutmegs from the sieve; he dropped a few back again; he put the rest of them into his left hand coat pocket; he went away, and came back again to the sieve, and took a few more of them; he went away, and came the third time; he took up a few more again, then he went away. Mr. Brown, the elder, came up, I reported it to him, and he reported it to the warehouse-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the hand that put was put into the sieve belonged to the body of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

I heard that they had been stopped in Smithfield. I found the whole ten on the Monday following; my servant found them on the Sunday. I suppose they were taken on the night of the 10th.</p>

            . I am a butcher; I live at No. 9, Coppice-row, Clerkenwell. I saw the prisoner bring the pigs into Smithfield, and he sold them there on the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before - A. No. I am sure he is the man. My neighbour brought three at three pound each; his name is Parkes. Parkes bought a sow and two barrow pigs; Shivvell bought the rest, seven: six barrows and one sow. I thought they were sold at an under price, and that the man could not come honestly by them. Shivvell gave him a one pound note earnest for the seven; he was to give thirteen pound for them. Shivvell went home for the remainder of the money. The prisoner went into the Bell to wait for him. In the mean time he was gone I went in and asked the prisoner where he brought the pigs from. The prisoner said he brought them from near Hitchen, on Sunday he said. I asked him where he came from that morning; he said, from Edgware. I said it was out of the way to come round about that way; it is forty miles to come round that way. I fetched

He was permitted, but the officer went with him. As soon as he drank his gin he wanted to go out into the yard; the officer said he must go with him. He then said, what the hell do you want with me.

I asked the prisoner how he came by the pigs; he said, what is that to me, he wanted his money. I told him he must stop before he had his money. He said, will you let me have a glass of gin; I said, yes, and wellcome. He had his glass of gin; he went out of the back door; I said you must not go away; he doubled his fist up at me.

            . I am a waiter to Messrs. Benson and Miles. On the morning of the 27th of September I was apprised by my fellow servant that Bond, the prisoner, had taken a ham, and emptied it into the dust cart. I went to the cart, and there I found the ham covered with dust. I took it out of the cart, and brought it into the coffee-room. I then secured the cellar window and the top cellar door, and kept them in the cellar. I then sent my fellow servant to call my master up, and I went for an officer.</p>

            . I am cellerman to Messrs. Benson and Miles. On Monday morning the dustmen came between six and seven. In the course of some little time afterwards I perceived the prisoner, Bond, empty the basket in a suspicious kind of a way; he threw the basket down with his left hand, and covered the dust over with his right, which made me suspect that master had lost something, I acquainted my fellow servant of it. I went down in the cellar and counted the hams; I missed one. I saw the ham after it was brought back; it was my masters by the appearance and by the size; it had got no mark on it. I am sure the the prisoner, Hill, did not see it put into the cart, nor was he there when the ham was put into the basket.</p>

No. I lost my things on board the Mansfield; they were in a bag on the forecastle; the bag was tied up; they were taken about half past one in the morning. I had seen them safe in the bag when I went to bed at nine o'clock at night. When I was called up my clothes were on deck. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

The great notes were bank notes. I am sure I had them in my pocket when I went into Wych-street. I took the prisoner and James Hall there to dine. I laid my pocket-book alongside of me on the table; after we had done dinner I went out with Mr. Hall to pay the reckoning, and just before I got out of the door I missed my pocket-book. I said, d - n it, I have left my pocket-book behind. I immediately went back again to the box where I was sitting, and found the prisoner just coming out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in the box but you three - A. No. When I came to the box I found my pocketbook under the tablecloth; it was closed; I took it up, and put it under my pocket. I did not look into it till the next morning. I had plenty of silver about me for any thing I might want. On the next morning when I looked into my pocket-book, I missed a twenty-pound note, and two ten-pound notes. I have seen one of the ten-pound notes since. I know it by the writing upon it.

               <p>Q. Do you know the person that took it - A. No. I called stop thief, and in about five minutes a black man was brought by the watchman into Albemarle-street; the black man was the prisoner. The watchman brought the prisoner and my bag; he shewed me the bag; I believe it to be mine. I told him it was mine. He said the prisoner was the person that dropped it. By the contents in it, it must be mine; there was a pair of spectacles, a pocket-book, a silver thimble, a small pin-cushion, and one eighteen-penny bank token; those things were in the bag at the time I lost it. The watchman took him to the watchhouse, and there I identified the property. I went to the watchhouse by compulsion; I did not wish to prosecute any body.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a general rule of yours, is it - A. That of humanity is, and I hope it always will be. On Monday morning I went before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am a green grocer. I was passing along Albemarle-street, at the end next to Piccadilly; on Saturday night the watch was going past nine; I heard the cry of stop thief at the other end of the street; I saw two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270010"/>running in the middle of the street towards me; I made a stop at the corner of Stafford-street, to see who was coming; I saw the prisoner about twelve or fourteen yards before some more people; I stood there until he came almost opposite of me, thinking he was going into Piccadilly; instead of passing me he turned short and went into Stafford-street; he then had one hand under the lappel of his coat. I suspected him to be the person after whom the cry was raised. I ran after him, and overtook him before he got into Bond-street; I catched him by the collar; he said I took the wrong man. I told him he must stop until the watchman came up; at the same time a person who is here said he had dropped something. I looked and saw something on the ground about a yard from us, and just at that time the watchman came up; I saw the bag picked up and given to the watchman. The prisoner was taken to the lady, and the bag. Then we went to the watch-house. The watchman took the prisoner and the bag to the watchhouse. At the watchhouse, Mrs. Trivett owned the property. The bag was left there with the constable of the night. I saw the prisoner was a black man. He was never out of my sight from the time I saw him until I apprehended him.</p>

I was coming along Stafford-street, going towards Albemarle-street; I heard the cry of stop thief; at the corner of Albemarle-street the prisoner passed me; he ran very quick; he came up from Grafton-street, towards Piccadilly, along Albemarle-street; he turned the corner of Stafford-street towards Bond-street, when a person came from the opposite side and seized him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person - A. Mr. France. I went to his assistance, and we gave him into the hands of the watchman. I perceived a bag drop from his hand, from underneath the prisoner's coat; just at that time he was given into the hands of the watchman. A person that stood by took the bag up, and gave it to the watchman, and said to the prisoner, you have dropped something. The prisoner made no answer. I did not go to the watchhouse with the prisoner. I went afterwards and gave my address to the constable of the night. The constable of the watchhouse came to me on Monday morning, and told her to attend at Marlborough-street office. When the prisoner turned the corner of Stafford-street I observed him to be a man of colour.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty that night at nine o'clock; soon after I was on duty I heard the cry of stop thief; I was on the side of Albemarle-street, near Dover-street. I took towards Grafton-street; I saw the prisoner running on the opposite side to me; he was running very fast towards Piccadilly. I sprang my rattle, and called out stop thief; he gained ground of me. When I came to the corner of Stafford-street I observed the prisoner stopped by Mr. France. I am confident he is the man, although I was not swift enough to take him. He was never out of my sight. I went up, and took hold of him, and told him he was my prisoner. Some person called out, watchman, he has dropped something. I did not see him drop any thing at that time. A person gave into my hands a small white bag. I took the man and the bag to the person that gave the alarm. I met Mrs. Trivett, she owned the bag. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and the bag I gave to

I saw a man running before me; he went into Stafford-street; he was about twenty or five-and-twenty yards before me. When I got about a little way in Stafford-street he came across the road and caught hold of my shoulder. I asked him what he caught hold of me for; he said he did not know; he had his wife with him; he said he had heard the cry of stop thief; he thought I was the person; I said I was not. I knew myself innocent; I made no resistance. I knew nothing of the bag; it was dropped some yards off me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called on by the last witness; I and Griffiths went up George-yard as the prosecutor said they went that way; we went into the Princess of Wales public-house, in Wentworth-street; the prosecutor there pointed the two prisoners out; they were sitting with some girls; we took the two prisoners into custody; we searched them, and found nothing upon them. They denied any knowledge of the prosecutor's watch; they said, they had been striking an Irishman. Denham said, see where the Irish thief has torn my jacket; they wished they had given him more of it.</p>

            . Q. You have heard what had been said by Miller - A. Yes; I agree in what he has related exactly.</p>
               <p>Griffith's Defence. I was coming towards Whitechapel; I met Durham; him and me went into a public-house to have something to drink, and as we were coming out the prosecutor came in; a girl with us ran against the prosecutor, and knocked some halfpence out of his hand; he struck the girl. I said, why do not you strike one of us; he struck me. Durham said, if you strike her I'll strike you; they got a fighting. The prosecutor pulled off his top-coat; they fought near a quarter of an hour; after that this man came back, and said, he had lost his watch; he never mentioned any thing about it before.</p>
               <p>Durham's Defence. The same.</p>

I drive for Mr. Fincham. The prisoner was carman to Mr. Boot; he brought the sugar to me to ask a young man of the name of Potter to buy it. I did. He bid me ask seven shillings for one loaf of sugar, and the other eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How much were you to ask for the tea - A. Seven shillings and sixpence; there was a pound and a half; I sold Potter these things.</p>

               <p>Q. While Turner was tying this sheep where was Bishop - A. Bishop was outside with a wheelbarrow, and while the strange man was going by Bishop laid down by the barrow, and when the strange man had passed by Bishop got up; Turner came out and saw how far the strange man had gone down the road; I saw him look down the road after him. Then Turner put the sheep over the bank; Bishop and Turner put the sheep into the barrow; the prisoner, Bishop, wheeled it away; he took it towards Sunbury.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270012"/>Q. Did you know Turner before - A. Yes, and Bishop both; Turner was Mr. Wood's servant. I spoke to Bishop when he was going away with the sheep in the barrow; I said you have got him; he answered, yes. I am sure of him. It was a fat sheep.</p>

            . I am a day labourer; I work for Mr. Hardyman. I live at Upper Hslliford. On the afternoon that the sheep was taken out; I had been to Charlton; I was going up the Staines road, together with Seers.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business there - A. I had done work, I went over to Charlton; I was going round to do my horses up again; I was going home to Halliford; going round that way I saw the prisoner Turner in Mr. Wood's field, and Bishop out in the road. Mr. Wood's field is in Littleton parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw the men - A. In the Charlton-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hedge or fence between you and Mr. Wood's field - A. There was Mr. Till's fence between them and me: the field stands between two roads.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the Charlton-road; next to you was Mr. Till's field - A. Yes. and next to that was the Littleton-road. Mr. Wood's field is on the other side of the road; Mr. Wood's field is one side of the road, and Mr. Till's field the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this fence go all round Mr. Till's field - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any fence to Mr. Wood's field - A. Yes; it is in the Charlton-road, behind the fence of Mr. Till's field.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were standing there what did you see Turner do - A. I saw him tie a sheep's legs; I was about two hundred yards from Mr. Wood's field.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see at that distance from Mr. Wood's field - A. Yes; I stopped to see what they were going to do with the sheep. I saw Turner, the shepherd, drive the sheep in a corner; Bishop was in Littleton-road. Turner caught one of the sheep; Bishop had a wheelbarrow; after I came up Turner tied the sheep's legs, and after that he drove the rest away, while a strange man passed along Littleton-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When the strange man passed the road what did Turner do - A. Turner, the shepherd, came back, and looked over the bank; that was after the man had passed. Bishop had laid down; he got up just after he had gone by. When Turner delivered the sheep to Bishop, he put it over the bank, and with the assistance of Bishop he put it into the barrow; Bishop wheeled the barrow away, towards Sunbury, along the Littleton-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards speak to either of the men - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drive the sheep up Littleton, where is it - A. Just at the end of Charlton-road. He drove the sheep just by us.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the Littleton-road cross the Charlton-road - A. Yes, it crosses it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where you was standing, does the Charlton-road meet the Littleton-road - A. About an hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to them - A. No. I did not. Seers was with me.</p>

            . I am a bailiff to Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the charge of all Mr. Wood's sheep - A. Yes. Turner was his shepherd, under me; he gave me an account of the sheep every Saturday. and he did the Saturday before the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. You then learned from him how many sheep there was - A. No more than what he killed; he said, he killed one for the house on Saturday, the th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how many he had left - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember when Turner was apprehended, do not you - A. Yes; on the 24th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. After Turner was apprehended, did you count the sheep - A. Yes, the fat ones; there were ninety then; I did not count the flock sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find how many there was missing - A. Yes; on the 25th there were five missing of the flock sheep, and two fat ones. The five flock sheep I never saw again.</p>
               <p>Q. At present he is only charged with stealing one sheep; was that a flock sheep or a fat sheep - A. A flock sheep, but in good order. The three fat sheep were found previous to this one being charged to be missing; this flock sheep was never found; the five were never found; they were all gone.</p>

               <p>Q. In the field in which Fitzwalter has described, were there any other than flock sheep in that field - A. No fat sheep.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it customary for this man to keep sheep among your master's - A. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they allowed to deal in sheep - A. In many places they allow it; some do allow it, and some do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you aware of that indulgence to have been allowed to the prisoner of keeping sheep of his own - A. That never was at squire Wood's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever notice a sheep without his mark to it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master any particular mark to his sheep - A. Yes, T. W.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his flock all wethers - A. All wethers.</p>
               <p>Q. There might be such a thing as the prisoner having a sheep and you not knowing it - A. He might have it for a little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear from him that he had bought any sheep - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Bishop's Defence. I bought the sheep of the shepherd; he told me it was his own; I gave him thirty-five shillings for it; this sheep was a ewe sheep; the esquire does not keep any ewes. There was no mark on this sheep at all; all the rest were marked; and I bought some of another shepherd, a next door neighbour; I thought it no more harm of buying of one shepherd than the other. I bought the sheep of this man; I paid him for it. As I brought it home I met

            ; I took it home to my house on the Wednesday; there it staid till the Friday alive; I killed it on Friday; the skin hung in my place for a week afterwards. Another butcher of our place bought five of this man; he is a respectable butcher; he bought the five of him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270013"/>before I bought the one of him. I am sure it was not the 'squire Wood's, because there was no mark about it; besides it was a ewe sheep; I had it home by day light; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Twner's Defence. I sold him the sheep; it was not Mr. Wood's; I bought it on the road of a man. I thought it no harm to sell it to Mr. Bishop. The two witnesess, Seers, and Fitzwalter, were in Mr. Wood's cover, hunting the rabbits about; I saw them in the cover a long time; I took no notice of them; they have only mentioned it out of spite; when I was taken in custody they mentioned to Mr. Wood that Mr. Bishop brought the sheep to me; it was about twelve o'clock in the day time when Mr. Bishop fetched the sheep. Mr. Bishop never laid down at all; he came over the hedge and took the sheep; I went about my business; it was my own sheep.</p>
               <p>Bishop called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Turner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. to Seers. When he drove the sheep up in the corner, did he take any particular sheep, or did he take one by chance - A. He stood and looked at them about two minutes, then he took hold of one of the hind legs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fitzwalter. Did you observe that - A. I did not take so much notice as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. How long was it before you acquainted Mr. Wood's bailiff of what you had seen - A. About three weeks; I never gave any information until they were taken up. I only gave information after the shepherd was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason why you did not tell sooner - A. No.</p>

That lamp casts a great light, it does almost into Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; has he the appearance of that man - A. He has, but I cannot swear to him. After I had been hustled, and my fob and pockets attacked, the four men dispersed in all directions; immediately they were gone I felt in my pockets for my seals and chain; I found they were gone; my coat pocket had been cut with a sharp instrument, from the bottom to the top; I then went home under the impression that my watch was gone; my home was near. As soon as I got home I related the circumstance; I found my watch was not gone; the chain had been cut off as it were; there was not an article of the chain. I came immediately to the spot to try to find a patrol or a constable; I met Carlisle on the spot; I told him the description of the man. I learned from Carlisle that he saw the transaction. He told me that he should have the man before he slept. I was not present at his apprehension. I never saw him before Monday morning, before the stiting Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. That lamp gave you a light to discover the man; did you know his counterance or his dress - A. His dress; the clothes of the man corresponded; particularly the size, and the blue coat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday night, the 18th of September, I was near Fleur-de-lis-court; I was coming down Fleet-street when I heard the music, the mouth organ, about nine o'clock, or a few minutes after; I was in the court when Mr. Burdon was coming down; I saw the prisoner come on before Mr. Burdon; I followed him on the left hand side; when Mr. Burdon came about half way under the arch-way one shoved him behind; they began to shove him from one to another; I kept my eye upon the prisoner, and in the hustle I saw him lay hold of the gentleman's chain with his right hand; I saw him double it up together, and put it in his right hand breeches pocket, then directly there was a word spoke, they let Mr. Burdon pass down the court, and they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were there - A. There were four of them; I tried to lay hold of the prisoner, but they fastened me up against the wall, and shoved all before them; I was forced down the court, and Mr. Burdon; I tapped Mr. Burdon on the shoulder; I said, sir, do not go, you have been robbed, and at the moment after he came back I went to a place and took Matthews with me, and took the prisoner at the Golden Key, in Fleet-market, there I found the prisoner; there were seven or eight of them altogether at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. Yes, these six or seven years, at the Golden Key. I said to him, young man, I want you; he said, you b - r, what do you want. I said, never mind, I want you, and have you I will; a tall man said directly, you shall not have him; I said, I would have him. They all got up; two more City officers came in at the same time; I turned round, and said, I want your assistance. I secured him. When my brother officers came up, he had got his knuckles under my chin, and threw me on the table; my breath was almost gone, I could not call out; luckily my brother officers came up, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270014"/>Q. Was Mr. Burdon's chain and seals hanging down - A. Yes, they were. I saw Mr. Burdon come up, and knowing what they were, that particular made me attentive. I saw the chain before the hustling began; the prisoner had on a blue coat that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burdon. It is my usual practice to put the chain and seals in my pocket, and I did so that night.</p>
               <p>- MATTHEWS. I searched the prisoner. I was there at the time. The account that Carlisle has given is quite correct.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Carlisle knows nothing of me. Matthews came into the Key and pointed me out; my having a blue coat on, he told this man to swear to me; and by, a false promise of Mr. Bardon to my mother; he told her he thought I was innocent, and he would have nothing to do in it. I have got nobody to speak for me.</p>

I was desired by Mr. Hughes to give an eye to his house while he was out, before he went out of town. My house is in the neighbourhood of Mr. Hughes's; we are in an angle by the chapel. Mr. Hughes left town on the 6th of October, and his family. On the morning of the 7th, about half past six I stood at my own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your door situated with respect to Mr. Hughes's - A. My door is direct in a corner, and Mr. Hughes's running into Millman-street is a complete angle across; mine is the corner of Great James-street, and as I stand at my corner I see direct into Mr. Hughes's house if the door is open.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, at half after six, having an opportunity of looking into the house, what did you observe - A. I stood at my door, and saw a man standing at Mr. Hughes's door; there was a man standing on the steps of the door; I did not like the appearance of this man, which caused me to watch the man; I had stood about two minutes, when I saw the two prisoners at the bar come out of Mr. Hughes's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was either the prisoners the man that you saw at the steps - A. No; that was another man. I wish to observe, I first saw the third man, and afterwards the two prisoners coming out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open when you first saw the man at the steps - A. No. I saw the door open when the two men come out; I have not sworn to

            .</p>
               <p>Q. You first said the two prisoners; you mean to correct yourself - A. Yes; I saw two men come out of the house; I am quite sure Cadwallader is one of them: I believe Procter to be the other man that came out of the house with Cadwallader; I do not swear that; the reason I did not swear that Cadwallader coming out it struck me with such astonishment. The second man I could not ascertain his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you, Cadwallader came out first - A. Yes. I could not observe so much the face of the other man, but from his general appearance I believe him to be the other man. Cadwallader had a large white canvas bag; he swung it over his shoulder after he came out, and the man that I believe to be Proctor, he had a black bag. Upon their coming out I lost the third man altogether; I did not see what became of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call out to him - A. I did. I do not remember the words verbatim; what are you doing there; what have you got, and what are you going to do with the property; some such words, or to that effect. They neither of them gave any answers. Cadwallader came directly before me under the chapel; the other turned down Millman-street, and crossed over the way at the end of the chapel, as if for New Ormond-street. I must observe for a moment, I came to my door nearly undressed, with my smallclothes on, and my stockings. At that moment I did not wish to go to the prisoners, but finding they did not answer me I called out stop thief, directly. Upon seeing Cadwallader take to his heels and dropping the bag, I pursued them. Cadwallader came directly before me under the chapel, walking orderly still with the bag. Upon my crying stop thief, he took to his heels. I then pursued him. He took straight along Chapel-street, which leads into Lamb's-conduit-street; he ran up Great Ormond-street. I still continued to cry stop thief, which had occasioned a number of people to pursue. When he had turned the corner, and gone up Great Ormond-street. I then thought proper to go back, from the situation I was in; I was fearful on account of my dress. I went home and dressed myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the bag that Cadwallader dropped - A. My lad went to pick it up; I told him not, but to follow the man. I believe when I came back the bag laid in the same situation that it was dropped. I saw it. A friend of ours, his foreman came and picked the bag up; his name is

I saw taken from him a great number of skeleton keys, a dark lanthorn, two parcels of small keys, and the key of Mr. Hughes's chambers, some gold, one guinea, seven half guineas, a seven shilling piece, and some silver. That is all I know.</p>

               <p>COURT. How far is your shop, (the corner where you were standing) from Mr. Hughes's door - A. It is not thirty yards, I think. Mine is a corner shop, an oil shop. When Cadwallader was walking with the bag he dropped it where I think he was not fifteen yards off me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him from the time that you saw him, in pursuing him - A. Yes, in turning round the corner of Chapel-street, into Lamb's-conduit-street, but I recovered it again. I continued in sight of him after he turned into Ormond-street, and then I left the pursuit to others who were pursuing him.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Nunn. When my master gave the alarm I was in the shop; upon hearing the alarm I saw Cadwallader come over the crossing by Mr. Hughes's house; I went out immediately upon the alarm. When I first saw Cadwallader; he was about two yards from Mr. Hughes's house. I saw him drop the bag under the chapel window, in Chapel-street; directly he dropped the bag he began to run; I ran after him; he ran into Lamb's-conduit-street, down Chapel-street; he went straight from Chapel-street into Lamb's-conduit-street, and then turned to his right until he came to Great Ormond-street; he went into Great Ormond-street, running all the time, I pursuing him. He ran up Devonshire-street, turned the corner of Queen-square, through Boswell-court, into East-street, Red Lion-square. He was stopped by Mr. Mason. I saw him stopped by Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any persons joined you in pursuing him - A. Yes, there were a great many people pursuing him behind. I was about ten yards before them. I never lost sight of him.</p>

That man that was stopped was Cadwallader. and I am quite sure he is the man that I saw drop the bag; I am positive of it. I went to the bag, picked it up, and laid it down again. It was a white bag; it was the same sort of a bag as I afterwards saw in my master's possession.</p>

            . I am a mason. On the morning of the 7th of October, about half past six o'clock, I was at the corner of Chapel-street, in Great James-street; I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw Cadwallader coming out of Mr. Hughes's house; I saw him come out of the door; he had a parcel with him; I followed him; he went down Chapel-street as fast as he could; he took the course the last witness has mentioned, and when he got a few yards to Queen-square I got before him; I attempted to catch at him; he offered to strike at me with this weapon, this iron crow.</p>

I was under the necessity for a moment to let him go on; seeing the weapon I made way for him. He turned into Devonshire-street, through Boswell-court; I still followed him, and never lost sight of him down into East-street; in East-street a gentleman that is here happened to run across to him and stopped him.</p>

            . I am a potatoe dealer; I live in Boswell-court. On the morning of the 7th of October I heard the cry of stop thief, about half past six. I had just opened my door. The prisoner, Cadwallader, came running by; I suspected he was the man they were pursuing. As soon as I saw a mob of people running after him I upon that run after him; I overtook him at the end of Boswell-court; I made a catch at him; as I went to lay hold of him he up with his two arms, and turned round; he endeavoured to strike me. I did not perceive any thing in his hands. I pursued him down East-street; I laid hold of him, and held him until Percival and Mitchel came; I could not stop; they took him away.</p>

            . I lodge next door to Mr. Nunn's, in Chapel-street. On the 7th of September I happened to be looking out of the window about half past six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look round, and tell me whether you know either of the men at the bar - A. I did not take particular notice of them. I remember Mr. Nunn calling to a man; I heard him speak to him; I could not hear particularly what he said. I saw the man drop a bag opposite my window, in front of the chapel, about the middle of the foot pavement. I kept sight of the bag until Adams came and took the bag up; he laid it down again; then Adams came and took the bag, and carried it into Mr. Nunn's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man that dropped the bag immediately run away - A. Yes, and Mr. Nunn cried out stop thief.</p>

Yes, about half past six o'clock; I was going into the factory gate in Great James-street; I am foreman there. It is right opposite of Little James-street; it is a cabinet manufactory.

            . That bag was laying at the end of the chapel, about half way in Millman-street, I looked over, and saw the bag. I said, if that is the case I will stop him. I made over to the man; he took the flap of his coat under his arm, and set off running as fast as he could, and cried out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man - A. I rather believe it was Proctor; I cannot swear it. He ran up Chapel-street, into Lamb's-conduit-street. I picked the bag up, and carried it to Mr. Nunn's. That bag was dropped opposite of Mr. Nunn's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more bags. Where was the bag lying that you picked up and carried to Mr. Nunn's - A. It was lying opposite of Mr. Nunn's, opposite the chapel; it was a white canvas bag. I saw a black bag that was dropped in Millman-street: I did not see it dropped. It was lying on the pavement, and the man when I first saw him was about five or six yards from the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you picked up the bag you carried into Mr. Nunn's was it that you saw a black bag I saw the black bag first.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in Millman-street did you see that - A. On the left hand side, next to the chapel, on the foot pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how far down the side of Millman-street, part of it is the chapel - A. Yes; it appeared to me to be better than half way down where the bag lay.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw that at the corner of Little James-street - A. Yes, and another witness that is here saw it. I saw that at the corner of Little James-street. At that part I could command a view of both sides of the chapel, the side of the chapel in Chapel-place, and that side in Millman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The next bag you saw was in Chapel-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body with that bag - A. I saw a man coming from the bag as it were, from the corner of Chapel-street into Chapel-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not see him drop it - A. I did not; the young man pointed out the man that dropped the black bag in Millman-street; I tried to stop him; as soon as he saw me going to take him he took up the corner of his clothes and ran off; went to stop him; he took his coat under his arm, and set a running, holloaing stop thief; he went up Chapel-street, into Lambs-couduit-street; I pursued him as far as the corner of Chapel-street, and I returned back again; that man turned up as for Ormond-street; he turned to the right.</p>
               <p>Q. You, however, did not pursue him - A. I did not. I went back to the black bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it in the same place - A. Yes; there was a lad stooped for it just at the time I went up; he said, he was going to take it to the watch-house, as the man was secured and taken there; the lad is here. I looked up Chapel-street, there I saw the white bag; there was nobody at the white bag; when I went up to it I picked it up, and carried it to Mr. Nunn's. The black bag the boy took charge of. I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw run away are you able to speak to him - A. No; I rather believe it was Procter; I cannot positively speak to his person.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer; I live in Whetstone Park, Lincolu's-inn-fields. On the 7th of October, Great James-street was in my journey to work. About half past six, when I got to the corner of Great James-street, I heard Mr. Nunn cry out stop thief; about a minute after I saw Procter; I am certain I saw the prisoner, Procter; I have no doubt of his being the man; he was coming towards me from Millman-street, he was walking fast, he had a dark coloured bag on his shoulder; when stop thief was called, he dropped the bag near the post, at the chapel door, in Millman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street did he drop the bag - A. In Great Millman-street, in the street in which Mr. Hughes's house is in; he was coming in a direction as if to me, he returned back again into Millman-street; he was not gone back half a minute before he returned to the bag again, the same bag that he dropped; he kicked the bag, and stooped as if to pick it up; he turned about and saw me; he then spoke to this effect, d - n them, they have left some of their things here. The prisoner, Proctor, then went down Chapel-street; he left the bag, and went towards Lamb's-conduit-street. I went after him into Lamb's-conduit-street, and followed him into New Ormond-street; I then called, stop thief, stop him, for the first time. I saw a person of the name of Nichols, catch him. Nichols took him to the Foundling watchhouse. I then went to my work. Nichols came to me where I was at work, and told me I must go to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Nichols to know where you was at work - A. He worked in the same place. I went to the Foundling watchhouse, I saw the prisoner, Proctor, sitting there. I was certain that he was the person that I have been describing. I saw Proctor searched: on his person I saw some phosphorus and matches, with brimstone at the end; the matches were broke in half, and a piece of wax candle about three or four inches long, four plaid handkerchiefs, and a plaid handkerchief with some tea in it. Three skeleton keys were brought in by some person that is here; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the black bag - A. It was brought to the watchhouse while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the dark coloured bag the appearance of the bag that you have been describing - A. Yes; I have no doubt in the least that it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw Proctor he was coming in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270017"/>a direction as if from Millman-street - A. Yes. The reason that I knew the prisoner again, I never lost sight of him; I kept my eye upon him all the time. He turned his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he then turn his head - A. I was in his front; the prisoner was stopping at that time to the bag; he turned his head, and saw me, and returned back.</p>

I heard the cry of stop thief from different voices, Harvey likewise saying, that is the man. I pursued Procter, and stopped him; he was running when I took him. The moment I pursued him he ran; I came up to him two thirds of the way down New Ormond-street; I took him to the watchhouse at the Foundling hospital; I did not see him searched.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Wilson, Theobald's-road. On Thursday the 7th of October, I heard the cry of stop thief, at the bottom of Millman-street, beyond the chapel; then I went up Millman-street, towards Great James-street. I then came up Millman-street. I got up at the upper end of Millman-street before I came up to Procter. I came up to the prisoner, Procter, pretty near the chapel; he was on the same side as the chapel; I was on the same side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him was he walking - A. No, standing still. He had a dark coloured bag with him upon his shoulder; he dropped the bag, and walked away from it. He dropped it just by the chapel door, in Millman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him - A. He turned by the chapel in Millman-street, into Chapel-street. I went down Chapel-street after him. I then turned back after I saw somebody go after him. When I returned back again I picked up the bag where he had left it in Millman-street; a young man that is here came and took the bag out of his hand; his name is Fisher.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the watchhouse afterwards - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see prisoner, Procter, taken - A. I saw him caught hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw him drop the bag you saw him going away from it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned, and there you saw the bag where you had seen it before; is that the truth of the case - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harvey. What time were you speaking of - A. Half after six, rather sooner than later.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been telling us you were going to work, you heard the cry of stop thief, you saw the prisoner going from Millman-street, what time was that - A. It was about half a minute after I heard the cry of stop thief; the alarm of stop thief made me stop to look; I saw him drop the black bag near the chapel door. Directly the man came back, I followed him; I run as fast as I could. I thought it better for me to follow him as far as I could, until I came within one door of the chapel.</p>
               <p>Cline. It was a little below the chapel I saw the man drop the bag; when he returned to it he went up to it, and then he went away, and then it was that I followed him into Chapel-street.</p>

            . I am a poulterer; I live in Lamb's-conduit-street. On the 7th of October, about half past six, I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately ran out of the shop, and ran down Chapel-street, into Millman-street; going into Old Millman-street, round the left, I met Cline.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the same Millman-street that you have been speaking of.</p>

               <p>Fisher. I met the lad, Cline; the lad stooped and picked up the bag; the lad held the bag to me, and said this is the bag that one of the men dropped.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it in - A. In Millman-street, just by the chapel door. It was a dark bag; there was something in it, it felt bulky. I then took the bag into New Ormond-street. I offered the bag to the man that had taken the prisoner, his name is Nichols. He desired me to bring it down to the watchhouse. I did so. I took it to the watchhouse at the Foundling; I gave it to Lillywhite, the watchhousekeeper. It was in the same state as when I took it from Cline.</p>
               <p>- LILLYWHITE. I am watchhouse-keeper at the Foundling estate. On the 7th of October I received charge of Procter, about twenty minutes before seven o'clock. The witness, Nichols, brought him in, in company with Fisher, with the bag. Nichols gave me charge of him. I asked him what the man had done. He said he could not inform me; he would fetch a man that could; he heard the call of stop thief. Then he left me, and fetched Harvey. Harvey came and said the prisoner was the man that dropped the bag, I searched the bag; in the bag I found two pair of boots, and two pair of shoes. It is a black bag. It contains another bag inside. I searched Procter; I found on him gold broaches, gold lace, some cotton handkerchiefs, silver knee and shoe-buckles, a silver snuff-box, a smelling-bottle and case, two gold rings, this pearl box, with gold sleeve-buttons in it, a silver thimble, a gold chain, and a garnet necklace, a silver purse, with half-a-guinea in it, a phosphorus bottle, matches, and candle, three matches and a bit of wax candle, a pen-knife, a silver ladle for wine, a seven-shilling piece, three shillings, and a small bit of silver. Here are three skeleton keys that were delivered to me by the witness, Wilson. That key opens Mr. Hughes's street door when it is on the double lock. That is a large one; the others are two smaller ones; a pair of silk gloves, and a gold band. The prisoner, Procter, said to Harvey, when he said he was the man, he said, mind be careful that he did not speak wrong. The skeleton keys were delivered to me in this green bag. Almost all these articles were in his left hand coat pocket, and a handkerchief with some tea in it was in his right hand coat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270018"/>pocket, and in searching him, this box was dropped in the ashes at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a plumber, In Theobalds-road. On Thursday, the 7th of October, I was in Millman-street, I heard the cry of stop thief, in the morning; I saw Procter standing nearly opposite of Mr. Hughes's house. I am sure it was Procter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing picked up there - A. No; I was going back to pick up these keys, on the opposite side of the way. I saw Procter standing nearly opposite of Mr. Hughes's house; I was walking towards Great James-street, Bedford-row; I picked up a green bag, containing three skeleton-keys. That is the green bag that the last witness produced; I picked it up about three doors from Mr. Hughes's house; Procter was then taken. I saw the people in pursuit of Procter, I joined the pursuit. I went back a few yards with them; when I returned I picked up this green bag about three doors from Mr. Hughes's house, on the same side. I took the bag and the keys immediately to the watchhouse, and delivered them to Lillywhite, and there I saw Procter.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was Procter at the watchhouse, the same man that you saw standing in Millman-street - A. Yes; I have no doubt at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Nunn. Produce the things from the other bag - A. This is the bag that Cadwallader dropped: this is the white bag spoken to first; I have had the custody of these things ever since; they are precisely the same things as were delivered to me with the bag.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your house was it in a state of perfect security - A. I left a servant in it; I cannot speak to the state of the house. Most of the articles which were produced to me before the magistrate were left in a room, and locked up by me before I went on that morning, safe in my drawing room, on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me whether there was a chamber key in that drawing-room - A. There was a door-key hanging up in that room, which the constable has got here; the key of my chambers in the Temple; I had left two pair of boots, and a pair of shoes, in an inner room, not in the same room; one room opens into the other; I took the key of the inner-room into the country with me. That is the key; it was produced by Hatton.</p>
               <p>MR. HATTON. I am beadle and watchhousekeeper of St. Andrew's. The key which Mr. Hughes had in his hand just now, on searching Cadwallador, I found in his left hand coat pocket. That is the same key; I marked it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hughes. That is the key of my chambers in Pump-court; I have had it many years. I am perfectly sure that is my key; it was left in the room. The boots I knew perfectly well, by one pair having been let out in the front; the other old pair by having been worn of one side, only they are not right and left; the old shoes I believe are mine; there is a silver snuff-box.</p>
               <p>COURT. These things were found upon the person of Procter - A. Yes; the snuff-box I knew perfectly well; it shuts not quite close, there is a little elevation on the upper part of it; I have had it some years, it has been but little used; I know it. I believe it to be silver; I bought it for silver; I suppose it is worth half a guinea. A pair of silver shoe buckles, I know very well; they are worth seven shillings perhaps; a pearl-box with two pair of gold sleeve buttons in it, and an odd one, I knew perfectly well; they are worth half a guinea; the box three shillings; a pair of knee-buckles; they are worth half-a-crown, I suppose; here are some pocket-handkerchiefs, they are my common ones; there are five of them, worth half a crown; nothing else of Procter's bundle. Here is a silver wine-ladle; my servant knows it, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at Cadwallader's, the white bundle - A. This black kerseymere waistcoat I believe to be mine, and a black silk waistcoat, I knew that, it is mine; a great coat lined with silk; I suppose it is worth five pound, and five shillings for the waistcoat altogether; a pair of black kerseymere breeches, I believe to be mine; a black coat, I believe to be mine; it is worth a pound, it is almost new; another coat, which is older; I put that at ten shillings; a pair of blue pantaloons, there is a particular mark on them which I had noticed, there is a stich dropped in the front; they are worth four shillings. Here is a good many other things which I believe to be mine; is it needful that I should go through them all?</p>
               <p>COURT. No - A. This pair of pistols belonged to me when I was a Light Horse Volunteer, they are marked 17 l. the mark I had in the regiment; they are worth a pound; they are good ones; here are a pair of new shoes; the clerk can speak to them; here is a shirt with my mark to it.</p>
               <p>JEMIMA - . Q. You are a servant to Mrs. Hughes - A. Yes. On the day my master and mistress went into the country I went with them. I knew this gold locket, it is my mistress's, the broach is Mrs. Hughes's, and the smelling bottle and case, these things are all Mrs. Hughes's; these gowns I know; the gold chain and necklaces, I believe to be my mistress's.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. By Mr. Hughes's desire you were to sleep in the house while he was out of town, were you not - A. It was so understood; I did not sleep there the first night. I left the house on Wednesday, the 6th of October, about the hour of three in the afternoon, as I considered in a state of perfect security. The servant went away about seven o'clock in the morning. I was left in charge of the house. I heard the house had been plundered on the morning of the 7th; I went to the house in Millman-street about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270019"/>seven o'clock: upon my unlocking the door, the first thing that presented itself was a bed, bolster, and pillows, tied up in a bundle, in the passage, near the street-door; I then in company with an officer looked all over the house; we found a number of drawers taken out and rifled, and the property strewed about in different rooms. We went into the library, the door had been torn; the whole house had the appearance of having been rifled, and broken into, and the property gone to all intents and purposes. The new pair of shoes in Cadwallader's bag, I knew them by seeing them on Mr. Hughes's table on Wednesday, the day before. After the servants were gone I was the last person in the house. I believe them to be Mr. Hughes's, because his name is in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you whether you had or not observed the key of Mr. Hughes's chambers on the day you left the house at three o'clock - A. I did observe it particularly, the key of the chambers in the Temple; it was hanging on a brass hook over the shoes, in Mr. Hughes drawing-room. This is the key; I am quite sure of it. I had the key eighteen months in my own possession.</p>

Yes, money; one or two guineas, five or six, or more, half guineas, and several seven-shilling pieces, and some silver; the silver was in this wooden box. The gold was in a box not taken; I cannot speak positively to the money. It was different coin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hatton. I am the beadle of St. Andrews. I produce some things I found upon Cadwallader, fifteen picklock-keys; I was proceeding to search him; he said, he would give to me all; he delivered them up at the watchhouse; he was brought there, and given to me in charge. Here is a silver mustard-spoon, a pair of pliers, and a small bunch of keys.</p>
               <p>MRS. HUGHES. This small bunch of keys are mine; I left them in my house when I went into the country, and the boxes.</p>
               <p>Hatton. I found upon the prisoner, Cadwallader, a dark lanthorn, a case with a pair of scissars; a silver tooth-pick, seven half-guineas, a guinea, a seven-shilling piece, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, and four pence halfpenny in copper; that is all.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Simons. On the 25th of September. I let a lodging to the prisoner and his wife for two shillings. They came about nine o'clock at night; went up stairs, and came down; about two minutes after they said they were going out to get something for supper; they would return again. They gave me eighteen pence. He said when he returned back again he would give me the other sixpence. In the mean time they were gone I went up to get the children's clothes to put them to bed. I found the bed furniture, one sheet, a pillow-case, and napkin were gone. I directly ran out, and halloaed out stop thief, and two gentlemen laid hold of the prisoner. I am sure he is the man, I can swear to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of September I heard the cry of stop thief; I pursued the prisoner; he was stopped at Aldermanbury. I took him to the Compter. In his pocket I found a napkin; in his hat a pillow-case. I undressed him. He had all this bed furniture wrapped round him, and pinned with this large pin in his breeches and round his body. We could not find the woman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking freely all day with the woman that took me to this lodging; she took me to this house, and took the curtains down, as she said, from her bed. She begged me to take them with her to the pawnbrokers. I had not been out of the house long before I heard the cry of stop thief. I was stopped and taken. I looked round; the woman was missing. I was taken to the Compter. I did not know but the property belonged to the woman. Gentlemen, none but a madman or a drunken fool would have done such a barefaced robbery.</p>

He said, many things went away at the same time; he thought he might as well have them as any body else. I bought them myself of Mr. Rogers, at Eton, August 25th, 1811. The sale was in the year 1809.

               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Bloomfield another house - A. Yes, 151, Ratcliffe Highway, where she resided. I took care of this house in High-street, the shop and parlour, for Mrs. Bloomfield.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did Mrs. Bloomfield carry on the business of a hatter - A. In the shop and the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you go to the shop and parlour - A. I went in at the shopdoor that led to the parlour. I had not any way of getting to the stair-case: there is a door but it is locked; Mrs. Bloomfield had the key of that. Mrs. Harrison's way into the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270022"/>was the street door and passage that gave her access to the whole house except the shop and parlour, which was in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any contrivance been done for a tea-pot to pass from Mrs. Harrison to you; had any thing been arranged for a tea pot to be let down - A. Oh, no. There was a hole through which a small tea-pot might be put down. A man had danced on the floor, and made a hole. We passed a small tea-pot through that hole once. A large one would not pass through the hole. It held a pint. After the fire the hole was the size of a small man's foot. On the night of the 20th of September I went away from this house about five minutes before eight. I left Mrs. Harrison at home, her servant, and a man, a friend of hers, up stairs. I know there was a man there. She sent down for me to put a band and buckle upon this man's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went away did you clean up your apartment - A. I swept it up twice in the course of the afternoon. When I went away it was clear of any litter. There was not any straw or chips any where about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. In what apartment was the hole that the tea-pot was let through - A. The parlour, and before I went away in the evening part, Mrs. Harrison could see down into the parlour. I had a person with me. I could see light through it. I saw Mrs. Harrison was at home. I put an old petticoat in the hole that I had brought there that day, and left it in the hole when I went away at night. The hole was close stopped; it could not fall out. I put out the candle, and left it there. I had no fire all the day. I locked the door and took the key with me, and went to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention called to the hole the next day, or how soon afterwards - A. At three o'clock in the morning, upon an alarm, I went to the house. I saw the straw all about; the hole was made much larger. I was once in Mrs. Harrison's room, I put my foot in it; I hurt my foot; I drawed it out; my foot stuck in it. When I saw the hole the second time; my body would have gone throught it. In the morning my petticoat was down on the floor. My mistress is not insured at all.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know 188, where the fire took place - A. My beat goes by the door. I know the house perfectly well. I cannot say the number. I was facing the door at ten minutes before two, and five minutes before two. I was there about minutes before five; I heard a noise at the side door; I heard a child crying. I went into the passage; I saw Mrs. Harrison come out of the door, and go down the passage to Mrs. Neave. She was undressed. When I saw her in that state I thought it was prudent to walk away. She had nothing on more than her shift. I went away to cry my hour. At that time I did not perceive any appearance of fire in the house. I heard the cry of fire in about seven or eight minutes; I returned to the house. I believe Mrs. Harrison cried fire first. When I came back I saw her upon the leads over the street door, at her own window. She gave her child down to the fireman. I desired her not to jump down. I was afraid she would. I got a ladder in about ten minutes; she waited on the leads until the ladder came. I helped Mrs. Harrison down the ladder; the fire was not then extinguished. I then went down to the yard door, which leads from the passage to the kitchen. There was a fire at the foot of the stairs, somebody got a bucket of water and put it out.</p>

            . I live down the same passage where the fire happened. My husband is a sawyer. On the night of the fire, Mrs. Harrison knocked at my door just before the watch went two; she asked for a lighted candle; I gave her one She brought no candle. She said her child was very ill. Soon after this I got out of bed to give my child some drink; I saw the fire in Mrs. Harrison's house; I saw fire in Mrs. Bloomfield's kitchen; I could see it was straw in a blaze. I told my husband; he went out and gave all the assistance he could.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Atlas Insurance office. At a few minutes past one in the morning in question I came by this house; I perceived a smell of fire at that time; I walked about five or six doors; I then thought I went away from the smell. I returned. Mrs. Harrison throwed up the one pair of stairs window. She came out on the leads on the shop window, with the infant in her arms, and a servant girl with her. She begged me to save the child, for the house was all on fire. I desired her to drop the child; she did; I catched it in my arms. A ladder was sent for, and she came down. She seemed as if she was going to jump down; I begged her not, as there was no immediate dranger, as I saw. I took her to a house nearly opposite. I then went into Mrs. Bloomfield's shop, through the door, into the back parlour. I saw a fire in the parlour nearly about the middle of the floor. The floor was burnt about eight inches by five. The boards were burnt through. The floor was burning at the time I went in, but not fiercely. There was some straw in a flame: the straw was over the part on fire. I should suppose the straw occasioned that fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing besides the straw - A. I did not. There was about a small handkerchief full of straw. It did not last long in flame.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hole in the floor above - A. I did. The hole in the floor above was nearly right over the fire below. I assisted in breaking open the door that led to the stairs. I could not get to the stairs that way, the smoke was so strong. Finding the smoke so strong I shut the door again to prevent all drafts. I then went to the back door leading out of the yard into the back kitchen; I could not discern the fire for the great body of smoke. Some water was handed to me; I throwed the water on different parts of the stairs that were on fire. I extinguished the fire with about ten or twelve pails of water. That fire on the stairs was the principal fire in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it appear to you that fire had been kindled - A. On the ground, directly under the stairs. Two or three stairs had been burnt through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing combustible there - A. No, none at all.</p>

            . Q. Did you to Mrs. Harrison give a light on the night the fire happened - A. Yes; I gave her a candle and light, and in about ten minutes after, we saw a fire through our window, in her kitchen; I put on my drawers directly, and snug out fire. I went through the yard door into the kitchen; the inside door was open; the outside door was fast. I was in the house first; I saw the fire on the back part of the stairs; I believe that was made with straw and shavings, I cannot say which; the smoke was so strong I could not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the candle you gave Mrs. Harrison - A. About two or three inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back did you ask for the candle - A. No; I saw Mrs. Harrison just in the same state as when she came for the candle; she was on the leads.</p>
               <p>- PROCTOR. I am a watchman. I was calling the hour of two; I heard the alarm of fire, and I saw it was a fire; I got an axe, and broke Mrs. Bloomfield's shop door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the back parlour - A. I did; I did not find the floor on fire; then another person got in first; I was the second that entered the parlour. There was no fire in the back parlour at that time.</p>
               <p>Q Did you stop to examine in what state the floor was - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one of those that forced open the door of the back parlour, that led to the stair case - A. Yes, and upon opening that door, I said, shut it again; there was a great smother coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shortly afterwards find any thing in the back parlour - A. I did; a little loose straw tied up in a handkerchief; it laid near the fireplace; after that, I went for the fire engine, and to get water. It was extinguished without the engine working.</p>

               <p>Q. How early on the morning of the 21st, was your attention directed towards this house - A. Between three and four; I went to the house; the fire was out; the alarm had quite subsided. I examined the cellar; there had been water thrown down under the stairs. There had been certainly a fire, and outside of the stairs there had been another fire; I examined it minutely; the stairs were burned more on the upper side than the inner side. I then came up into the parlour, and discovered that a hole had been burnt in the middle of the floor, that hole in the floor was directly under the hole above, in the ceiling; there were two parcels of fire brands, that must have come through the ceiling in my opinion; one was upon the hearth-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the fire brand - A. Wood and straw; only this parcel was on the hearth-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the fire brand, you mean this - A. Yes; it is straw and turpentine wood, and the straw that I found on the parlour, was oat straw, and on removing the boards where the hole was in the room above, there was some oat chaff, which corresponded with the straw I found below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it then appear to you, that the straw had been put through that hole, and left the chaff - A. Yes; it left no doubt in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any smoke on the ceiling - A. No; not where the hole was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the ceiling of the back kitchen - A. I did; there was no communication to the fire on the stairs, with the fire in the parlour; the fire in the parlour must have came from above.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the house with Mr. Drummond - A. No; I did not go until ten in the day. I observed the floor in the parlour was burnt; it was nearly under the hole above; the ceiling was about a seven foot cieling. I have had the care of these combustibles, and I have brought them here to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the place above, to see whether there was any remains above - A. I saw there was some chaff littered about in the up stairs room; I examined the hole in the ceiling; I saw some chaff then, and some straw hanging at the end of the hole in the ceiling; it had the appearance of straw being thrust down there; upon that appearance I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the hole in the floor in the prisoner's room - A. It might be a foot by fourteen inches. When I apprehended the prisoner, I enquired of her whether she was insured; she told me that she was insured for one hundred and fifty pound; she was not at home at that time, and when she came home she said, William had got the policy; it was afterwards produced. This is it. When I examined the policy, I found it was for more than one hundred and fifty pounds. I saw her goods, thirty pound would be the utmost value of them; her stock in trade was not worth more than a pound; her stock and furniture was not worth more than twenty pound. I saw two or three candlesticks about the prisoner's apartment, but no candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine whether there were any combustible matter of turpentine - A. There were some droppings of pitch, but that might be from the links of the men that had been there in the morning.</p>

I looked at the furniture about these rooms; I thought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270024"/>value of the things at that time was not more than twenty pound.

            . Did you go in the room at eight o'clock in the morning - A. No; at nine o'clock. Mrs. Bloomfield put a broom up to shew how loose the boards were.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed on the Monday night, did you see any straw in the room - A. No; my mistress had not been gone out long before a young man knocked; I took a candle and let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. What candles were there in the house - A. Only a three-halfpenny one, which I had fetched that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it burnt out - A. No. there was half of it remaining; the young man cut it in half, he took one half, and gave me the other. I went into the front room where I sleep and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your piece of candle when you got up in the morning - A. No; when I was alarmed I saw a candle burning in my chimney-piece where I had left it.</p>
               <p>Q. At ten o'clock the young man knocked; you let him in a little after ten; where was the child - A. In bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did your mistress come home - A. I do not know; I was asleep. The crying of the child did not awake me at all. I awoke first with the smoke. My mistress called out Mary; she thought there was a fire; she and the child. and I got upon the leads. I did not hear the child cry all night. My mistress gave me the child whilst she opened the window; my mistress slept in the same bed with me; I was don't know whether she was a bed or no, I was so sound asleep nor do I know where her clothes were; when my mistress awaked me, the candle was burning in the fire-place; I don't know whether that it was the same candle; most likely that candle would not last so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that cloth that the straw is in, and turpentine wood - A. My mistress had a cloth like this; I saw it daily. I think it is the same; I did not see it on Sunday, or Monday.</p>

Yes up at the fire-place; I believe it to be the same because of the work. I saw Mrs. Harrison hemming this in my parlour; it was for a little fire-place; it was hung up to hide the deficiency of a stone; she was sitting by my side when she was working it; I believe it to be that piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her have any pieces of cloth like these - A. I had seen them fragments in the day, the fire happened on the night. I had seen in her room such fragments as these, and of this colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever borrowed this cloth of the prisoner - A. No; I never borrowed any thing of the kind of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the smallest quarrel with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any quarrel with your mistress - A. No; she had managed my mistress's business, and after that became a lodger; my mistress called that day, and sent me up to Mrs. Harrison, with her compliments, and to know when she would settle. Mrs. Harrison said, she would come down that day or next; she was quite civil.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where your mistress is - A. No. she came out before me; she said, she would be here as soon as me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have told me that Mrs. Bloomfield, and she had no quarrel - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mrs. Bloomfield does not live with her husband - A. No, sir.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that the prisoner received notice to pay her rent to her husband, and not to your mistress, and they quarrelled because she would not pay the rent to your mistress - A. I don't know it; I never heard of any dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect borrowing a tin pot in which dusters were kept by the prisoner - A. No, I never borrowed any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Arnott - A. I might have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to Mrs. Arnott in her presence, that your mistress did not care how soon the place was burnt, because she was insured - A. No, I never said such a word to any body.</p>

He told me that he dealt at the corn market regularly, and that it would be a great conveience to him, as a friend of his who resided at Staines went with him, and they horsed the gig by turns.

After the 21st of August, I went to Staines, and enquired after the prisoner. About a week or a fortnight after the bill became due, I met the prisoner at Kingston; I asked him why he did not come according to his promise, and leave the money for the bill; he said, he supposed master had got the money. I told him he had not; that he had been to Tower-street, that there was no such person as Ferguson there. I asked him where he was to be found, as master would be glad to see him; he said, at Staines. I said, it was wrong; I had been to to Staines, and enquired if Willis was at home; I was informed that he never came there; that he had left there. I then told him it made no odds where he was, my matter would find him; that I had heard he was in the rules of the King's Bench; with that he left me. He went on to town, and I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again - A. No, not after.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you parted, did any thing pass respecting any other Tower-street - A. There did; he said, that my master had been to the wrong Tower-street; he should have gone to Tower-street, Westminster-road. That was all that passed between us.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I suppose your coachman informed you of this interview with the prisoner - A. He did. I went to Tower-street, Westminster-road; it was a very dirty low street. I went to No. 9. I knocked a considerable time, the first time I went, and could make no person hear; the second time I went I saw a woman, who is in court. I did not find a Mr. Ferguson. About the middle of September, I met the prisoner on a hill in the Wandsworth-road, he was riding on horseback; I spoke to him about the bill, and told him I would not be trifled with, I would stick to him like a leaf, and when I got into St. George's Fields, I told him I had got a warrant out against him; he struck me a violent blow on my head, and got away.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, granary-keeper and corn-dealer. I have frequented the Corn Exchange thirty-six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any corn-dealer of the name of Sweet - A. I do not know him, nor ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Ferguson, a corn-dealer - A. No. I never heard of Sweet or Ferguson.</p>
               <p>MR. SCRIVENER. I am a corn-dealer. I attend the corn-market every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Sweet or Ferguson, corn-dealers - A. I do not; I have attended the corn-market these forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bunn. When you met the prisoner near Wandsworth-hill, did you enquire of him where Ferguson was to be found - A. He then described Sweet to be a horse dealer at Birmingham; he said Ferguson was to be found at No. 9, Tower-street, and if he did not pay the bill he must. He said, he took the bill of Sweet himself, in the Corn Exchange, in the regular course of business; that was when he gave me the bill first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Look at that bill; does it appear to be endorsed by the name of Sweet - A. Yes; the name of

             - A. I do; I have seen Sweet and the prisoner together several times in the King's Bench. In June last, I was in company with the prisoner and Sweet, at the Crown public-house.

On the 5th of October, I was upon the watch, but not placed with the constables; this was about seven o'clock in the evening, the usual time of the men leaving their work.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way do the men go out when they have done their work - A. They had to pass through a passage before they could go out, and there were gates to the passage; there are two gates; one at the end of Maberley's premises, and the other gate at the extremity of the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon a signal given, were the gates fastened - A. The outside gate was shut only. Sleigh was one endeavouring to get out; he ran past Mr. Stevens to get out of the yard; I seized him; Mr. Bartlett assisted me. I found this piece of cloth upon him; it was concealed under his coat; I took it from him. I am sure it is the same cloth that was concealed under his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Pray, what situation do you occupy - A. I am a cashier in that house.</p>

               <p>MR. STEVENS. I am the principal clerk to Mr. Maberley.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night in question, you consulted a plan to stop and search all your men - A. We did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270027"/>Q. Look at the cloth produced by the last witness - A. That is the same cloth that we receive on contract for government. We receive it of the Store-keeper General. It is marked S G, and the broad arrow is stamped upon a variety of places in every yard.</p>
               <p>JURY. What is the value of it - A. Five shillings and ten pence a yard, or six shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. That cloth you receive from the Store-keeper General - A. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. You return so many garments for every piece - A. To a certain quantity of cloth we return so many garments; if we have any surplus we return. If there is any deficiency Mr. Maberley purchases cloth to make good his contract.</p>
               <p>Q. You deliver out to each man a piece - A. Yes. We had near fifty cutters. The prisoner was a cutter. When we deliver it to the men they are to return as many garments as they can cut out. The pieces are given out by weight. The shreads are to be returned. We deliver it out with this kind of ticket.</p>
               <p>COURT. You deliver them the cloth by weight, therefore they are to return the weight; to make up the weight they must return the shreads - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. What does a piece of cloth weigh - A. A piece of cloth of thirty yards, or rather better, will weigh about fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of this fifty pounds you expect a certain number of garments - A. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this man ever failed to return the quantity of garments you expected - A. I cannot say. I don't know. But by the present practice we get more out of the cloth than we did, and I know that cloth to be the cloth of the Store-keeper General. There is about a yard of it. It is about six quarters wide. Mr. Maberly has no partner in this contract. His name is John.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>- BAILEY. I am a constable. On this day fortnight I was stationed at Paul's wharf, at Mr. Maberley's, just as the men were coming out; they came out at seven o'clock, as the clock was striking. As the men were coming to the outside gate I rushed upon the prisoner Asquith: he resisted as much as a man could possibly do. After I seized him I never let him go, and inside of his waistcoat I saw Trustey (the patrol) take the cloth from him. This is the cloth. I think there is nigh a yard and a half.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. How many men were there in the place when you seized this man - A. A great number of them. This piece of cloth was taken from behind the man. I saw this piece of cloth taken as he was getting rid of it from behind him.</p>

            . I am beadle of the ward. I marshalled the constable this night. I gave the general order for each man to seize his man, and to be very particular with the man they seized, and to take the property from them. I seized one man, searched him, and found no property on him. The prisoner stood near me; from him fell this piece of cloth; I felt it fall: he was the only person that it could fall from. It fell from him. His waistcoat and coat were both unbuttoned when I seized him. The cloth brushed me all the way down, and fell on my instep. The prisoner was close to me. No other person was near me by a yard and a half. I have no doubt but that it fell from the prisoner. I had many offers made me by the prisoner to let him go. He offered me a pound note. I told him fifty pound would not let me do that. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, and found more cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. STEVENS. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18131027-34-deflabel199" type="occupation">cutter</rs>

            . I am a hatter. Having occasion to call on Mr. Oakey, on the 23d of September, between six and seven in the evening, I discovered a man at the corner of Mr. Oakley's gateway, in the act of making water; he having been a carman in our employment, that caused me to have suspicion. Knowing that Mr. Oakey always had goods laying in the gateway. I immediately went into the warehouse, and mentioned to Mr. Oakey's foreman my suspicion: he requested me and one of the porters to go with him to the gateway. We went down the gateway. It was dark. I then said to Mr. Oakey's foreman, there is the bale I suspected the man was taking something from. He put his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270029"/>hand down and felt a man; he laid hold of him, and said, who is there? I knew it was the prisoner by his voice. We waited until a light came, and then we secured him. When the light was brought we discovered it was the prisoner, and that this bale had been cut, out of which there had been sixteen or seventeen pound weight taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain - A. Goats wool. Part of that quantity was put in a small bag by the side of it, the remainder was laying upon the ground. He was charged by Mr. Oakey's foreman with having cut the bale, and taking it out. He denied it positively. He was asked what he was doing there; he said, making water. We got a light; there was no wet at all. There was a sharp knife taken from him, upon which there were some particles of hair attached. I know no more; and a small particle of hair was attached to his clothes. The goats wool, or hair, is here. This is the bag and the wool.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bale had been seen whole a few minutes before. I have no doubt but that goats wool, or hair, is mine. The bag is not mine; the contents are. The prisoner had been in the habit of fetching goats wool or Spanish wool to card.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was making water two men came down the gateway and knocked me down. Mr. Oakey accused me because of that. That knife I carried about me to cut my victuals.</p>

I knew then that he must be accessary to it. I went to the pawnbrokers, and found my blankets; some that were made for the Canada trade.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 20th or 21st of March, in the evening; he said he was late of his Majesty's ship the Raisonable, now of the Namure. He said that he wanted an agent; he was recommended to my office. He shewed me a ticket of leave, purporting to be signed by the Captain. I then asked for his certificate, signed by the Captain of the Namure, laying at the Nore, He shewed me a certificate, signed Captain Rowley of the Raisonable, where he had served six years as Midshipman. That is the very paper. He said he was on leave only for a few days to see his mother and aunt that lived near West Barnet. He said further that he was quite out of money, and begged that I would let him have some in advance. He said that he had served six years in the Raisonable, that he was entitled to Buenos Ayres prize money, for service on board the Raisonable, for which he had only received a tenth; that he had received a payment for each prize. He stated further that his Captain advised him to get a respectable agent to look after his prize money; that he said he would have upwards of an hundred pound to take. He stated that he was at the taking of a number of ships on the service. He said if I would give him a list he would tell me which he had received and which he had not. I shewed him the list. He pointed out the prizes of the Raisonable; some he had been paid, and some not; he drew a line of distinction between. When I saw the number of ships I saw it would be as much as his Captain said he was entitled to. I gave him a pound. He returned the next day according to promise. I sent to Wetherby, the law-stationer, and got a stamp for the power of attorney. I got one, and filled it up for him; he told me the captain of the Namure was in town, that he left him at the west end of the town. This is the one that I filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had filled it up what did you do with it - A. I told him I wished him to get it signed by the Captain of the ship, and another officer to make me certain that he was the man. I gave it into his hand. He put it into his pocket, and said he would immediately wait upon the Captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any advance - A. No further than the stamp, and the pound the night before. He came upon the 23d, after dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the blank filled up - A. On the 22d, the day after I first saw him. He came on the 23d, at my own office, No. 4, Copthall-buildings, in the City.

I had some information that the prisoner and another woman had been selling some clothes; I apprehended the other woman first, and when I went to No. 5, Leg-alley, where the prisoner had lodged; she was gone from there; I then went to a court in Clare-market, there I found the prisoner in bed. In that room I found a waistcoat; Mr. Dunkley was with me; he said, it was his, he had had it fourteen years. I took the prisoner in custody, and likewise the woman who had purchased the things of her; the other woman acknowledged that she had purchased them of the prisoner, a coat, waistcoat, and smallclothes, for her husband. I took with me the waistcoat only; there was no other clothes there. Mrs. Homer said the things should be forth coming. In about half a hour after, Mrs. Homer, the landlady, came up to the watchhouse, and brought me a pair of smallclothes; she requested me to look in the pocket; in the pocket of the breeches, I found a duplicate of a blue coat; the blue coat and the breeches are here. Mrs. Dunkley went with the duplicate, and took her husband's blue coat out; she did not understand it. I produce the blue coat, waistcoat, and breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see your watch again - A. I came round to the spot again; in about a quarter of an hour; there was a man there that I understood to be a Bow-street officer; he said, young man, it is of no use of you standing and waiting here, he will not be here any more to night, if I would call on him on the next morning at the Yorkshire Grey, he would speak to me. On the next morning I went to that house; I asked the landlord if he had seen a Bow-street officer there. The landlord's name is Harding. He said, what do you want with a Bow-street officer; I told him that I had lost my watch; it was a silver watch, with a steel chain and key only to it. The landlord afterwards produced me the watch. This is the watch; it is mine.</p>

The prisoner brought the watch to me to sell about ten o'clock at night; he had a whip in his hand; I have known the prisoner some time; he is a hackney coachman. He said, Harding, I want to sell a watch for twenty-two shillings; I told him, I had no money to purchase watches. He turned round and went away; directly after, Henry, the prosecutor, came to me with another man, and called for a pint of beer, asked me if I had a Bow-street officer in the way, one had promised to meet him there that morning; I told him there was no one there. I asked him his business; he said, he had lost a silver watch, with a steel chain, and a key at the end of it; he said, he was a journeyman carpenter, it was very hard for him to lose it; I said, it was. I told him on the over night I had such a one offered to me for sale, perhaps I might find it out. I went then to the watering-house in Charles-street, Covent Garden; there was some coachmen there at breakfast; I told them the circumstance of Ned, the coachman; he goes by that name; one of the men said he lived in Charles-street, Drury-lane; the feeder of the horses went and shewed me the house. I went up in the two pair room; I found the prisoner at breakfast there with his wife; I said to the prisoner, Edward, the watch you offered me last night is a stolen watch.

            ; we live at No. 1, Glass-lane, Pimlico. On Sunday evening, the 10th of October, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, as near an I can guess, we had been to chapel; my husband was with me. After chapel we went to No. 44, Lower Sloane-street; on our returning from there nobody else but my husband was in my company; we were in a place called <placeName id="t18131027-47-crimeloc262">Jew's-row</placeName>

We gave way for the two men to pass; they both shoved me on that side which I had made way for them to pass; there was room enough for them to pass there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive a shove from one of them - A. I did; I had hold of my husband's arm; the shove appeared to me as if done on purpose, and my being driven against my husband, shoved my husband off the pavement down in the road; I let go my husband to save myself from going down. At that time my husband asked the men what they did it for; the prisoner, Welch, turned round immediately after the push, and twisted the umbrella out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any endeavour to resist - A. I did; I held it tight in my hand; he got it out of my hand in a short struggle between us; as soon as he got it, I asked him for it; instead of his giving me the umbrella, he struck me a blow on my face with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270034"/>his fist; that blow drove me against some shutters. My husband asked him what made him strike me. He asked him to give me the umbrella. My husband was going forward to seize the man. I caught hold of my husband to prevent him. The prisoner immediately turned round and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for endeavouring to prevent your husband from following him - A. For fear he should receive a blow. He is in the army; they are not suffered to have any marks of violence upon them. My husband broke from me, and ran after him. They ran down George-street. My husband ran down Jews-row after the prisoner, and turned into George-street. My husband returned to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there only one man run away, or both - A. Both run away. It was the prisoner that took the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them run against you - A. It appeared to me to be the prisoner by his dress and look.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again that took your umbrella - A. He was down in Jews-row, walking quietly by himself. I turned down the corner of George-street to see after my husband. He returned back to me in a few minutes; he said he had lost sight of the prisoner. I was in Jews-row when I saw the prisoner again. I had just returned back to the same place when I saw him again.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he your umbrella then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again - A. Yes, I knew him to he the man. He was at large when. I saw him. In a very few minutes my husband went up to him. I saw my husband take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same man - A. Yes. When he struck me I looked very hard in his face. I am very sure he is the same man. It was a moonlight evening. After my husband took the prisoner, he was taken to the watchhouse; he said he would fetch the umbrella if we would let him go after it; he said that in my hearing. I have never seen my umbrella again.</p>

On the Sunday night she has mentioned I was walking home with her; it was near twenty minutes or half past nine. We were returning down what is called Jews-row: we saw two men meeting of us; we gave them the inside walk, we taking the outside place just before they came to us. When they came opposite the side of us they gave a jut or a shove of a sudden against my wife. My wife came all of a sudden against me, and I went off the curb, down into a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. The effect of that jerk was to drive your wife against you, and to drive you off the curb - A. Yes, it appeared to be done designedly. I saw the men come up; my wife let go my arm to keep herself on the walk. I immediately said, what do you mean by that. I saw at the time the prisoner came up he was the inner man next my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was the prisoner that put himself in the attitude when he shoved against your wife - A. They both apparently did it together; they were either arm in arm, or close together. After I asked why he did it, I stepped forward through the dirt to recover myself upon the causeway, and before I could recover myself the umbrella was wrested out of my wife's hands. I heard my wife say, give me the umbrella. I heard her scream. Immediately I was going to make a dart to catch the prisoner, to catch the person that had the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that was the prisoner - A. I am not positive to the person of the prisoner that had the umbrella at that time. The person that had the umbrella, he held the umbrella as I supposed to strike me. My wife catched hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that held the umbrella up, that person, whoever it was, you had not so clear a view of him as to know it was the prisoner - A. I had not. To the best of my knowledge it was the same person. My wife took hold of me, they turned about and run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both the persons run away together - A. Yes, a little way. They parted at the corner of George-street. I pursued one down George-street, through Charles's-market, into Lower Sloane-street. In Lower Sloane-street I fell. In rising I saw the person I was pursuing turn into Red Lion-street; near Jews-row I lost sight of him; that run into the same street I came from. I turned back to look for my wife; I met her. We went into Jews-row, to the place where it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that you were pursuing went into Jews-row - A. Yes. We were going towards home, on my turning round I saw the prisoner coming towards me; he was upon the causeway when I saw him; he went off the pavement, and turned into the road among some people. I told the prisoner he was one of the men that had insulted us, and had run away with the umbrella. He denied it. My wife immediately came up, and recollected that he was the man that wrested the umbrella out of her hand, and struck her. I was persuaded to take the prisoner into custody by some one standing about. The prisoner turned round, and ran away. I pursued him, and another person. The other person came up with the prisoner first. I was close to him. I also laid hold of the prisoner. We took him to the watchhouse. At the watchhouse, the prisoner said if we would let him go out he would get us the umbrella; that was denied. He said he could not tell the people's names, nor the number of the house where the umbrella was. There was something said if he would tell me where the umbrella was I would not think any more about it. I said that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the man before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that man if you were to see him. Look round about, and see if you see him - Yes, I do. It is the prisoner at the bar; he had on the same dress as now, only a little apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you to spin your top what did you do - A. I could not do it myself; I gave it to another boy to spin it. He then came to me, and said, if you will come along with me I will give you a goldfinches nest and a mouth organ. He took me to Tothill-fields; my brother went with me, and another little boy. He asked my brother to go along with him; he told him if he would go along with him he would give him a bird's nest and a cage and a mouth organ. When I got into Tothill-fields, he told me to pull off my boots, to run round the cricket ground, and my brother and the other little boy. I said I would not pull my boots off; he said I should. Then he put his hand to my collar, and laid me down on my face. He laid his elbow the pole of my neck; he turned up my feet, and cut off my half boots with a clasp knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the boots fastened before he cut them - A. They were laced up and tied, and when he got up he said he would be d - d if I should not have the boots again, and if I was to meet any man I was to say he was my father; he then said I was to run round the cricket ground, and I was to have my boots again after I had ran round the cricket ground. I run, and the other boys run with me.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were running what became of the prisoner - A. The prisoner told me if I met any gentleman I was to tell them that the prisoner was my father, and he would be d - d if I should not have my boots again, and while I was running he went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go off - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what he did with the half boots after he took them off - A. He put them in his apron, and then he kept on trying to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything to him about his wishing to get away - A. No.</p>

            , SEN. I am the father of the two little boys that have been examined. I took my children to the park on the 27th; I took them to the Birdcage walk, opposite Queen-square gate. I staid with them there scarce five minutes, and I left them there. While I was staying there I heard the prisoner come up and ask one of the children to spin his top. I heard him; I did not see him at the first. On hearing him speak to the children it induced me to look round. When I looked round I observed the prisoner speaking to the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that induce you to take particular notice of his person - A. It did. I had no suspicion of the man. I went off with a child in my arms not a twelvemonth old. I noticed the dress of the prisoner: it was identically the same as to the jacket, but he had a short apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you hear what had happened - A. I went round with the child, and walked. I returned to my own house in about an hour and a half, No. 9, Upper Crown-street, about half past eleven o'clock. When I came to the door I knocked; my wife opened the door; she appeared in agitation, and said, your child has been robbed. I asked, which of them; she said, William. I called the child forward. The child was there. I received information of him. I went to Queen-square office, which was then in the same street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270036"/>Q. What parish are you in - A. In St. Margaret's, Westminster. They directed me to go with the children to the same spot where they had been robbed. I went with the children, and they directed me to the field where they had been robbed, to Tothill-fields; when I came there, I found the deputy ranger had seen something of the transaction. I could find no trace of the prisoner then. I gave my children direction if they saw him again, one was to watch him, and the other to come and give me information. That was to my own two children.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this - A. Monday, the 27th. On Tuesday, the 28th, I desired my children to go into Great Russell-street. Covent Garden; as they were going down Suffolk-steps, into St. James's-park, the eldest ran against the prisoner. I received the information from the eldest child. I pursued after the prisoner into King-street, and in Frederick-street I saw the prisoner standing at the bottom of Frederick-street; I made towards him; the instant the prisoner saw me making toward him, he walked off; he was going a quick pace; he looked over his left shoulder, saw me coming after him, he then ran off; as soon as he run I cried stop thief; the prisoner cried stop thief. I then ran after him; seeing the prisoner getting a head of me, I desired the sentry at the gateway, to drop his musquet across the gateway, so as to prevent his running through, which the soldier did, but the prisoner got through, and got into the park, and ran towards the corner of the Treasury-gardens, the wall where another sentry stands; I still crying stop thief; the prisoner continuing the same. He then made towards the Horse Guards; when I cried out stop thief, stop that man, that is the thief; I then saw a soldier move, and seized him; the soldier was going on sentry. As soon as I saw the prisoner was seized I desisted from running, being out of breath, until I came up to him. When I came up I desired they would let the children come up to see if it was the same man when the eldest came up, I asked him if this was the man that took his half boots, in the hearing of the prisoner; the soldier had him fast. When I mentioned the word to him, as soon as the child came up, he said, papa, that is the man that had my half boots. I desired the soldier to take him to Queen-square office with me; the soldier refused. I took him by the collar, and led him as far as Suffolk-steps, there I gave him up into the hands of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were shewn the place in Tothill-fields - A. Yes, I was shewn the place where it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the high road - A. No, it was in a grass field, by the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to the road - A. I cannot exactly say how near it was to the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that you are speaking of - A. Yes; I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw in Bird-cage-walk, and the man that you afterwards seized in the manner you have described - A. Yes; I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the boots since - A. No part of them; they were new boots. I had them of the maker on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your father ask you if that was the man that had taken the boots - A. Yes; I knew him again. I am sure it is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you heard of any man offering a reward for boys to go along with him - A. I did; on the 27th of September; he offered birds nests.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any birds nests at that time - A. No; that excited my suspicion. I was upon the look out from nine o'clock until near eleven; I had heard of the man while I was at breakfast at nine o'clock. About a quarter before eleven, I was looking over the garden rails; I observed a man laying down by our play ground, and three children round him; there appeared to me to be one girl, that had a white pinafore on. After they had played some time until some person was going across on the foot pavement, when the man had got a considerable distance, the child with a white pinafore got up first, then I discovered it was a boy; shortly after, the two boys got up, and the man with them; he went behind them, and placed them all of a row; I discovered two of the children had no shoes on, which struck me all was not right; I waited until the children came up; I called to them for some time; they refused to come; after a short time, the biggest of the three came up, that was Mr. Westcote's boy; I asked what that man had been doing, or saying to him; he said, nothing. I said, do not tell me a story; where is your boots; he said his father had got them. I said, are you sure it is your father; he said, yes, sir, it is; with that I walked away to my own door; after that, when I came to my own door, I saw the prisoner; he went round by the Ducking-pond, and returned towards the Horse-ferry-road; I pursued him, but did not overtake him; I said to my friend, it is a trick; he pursued, and did not over take him. Afterwards I gave Mr. Wescote the particulars of every thing that I knew.</p>

            . I have no other partner. The prisoner had been in our service for a continuance for the last fourteen or fifteen years; his business was mounting lustres with the drops. He was entrusted with the care of the drops entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. From some information that you had received, did you go to Stepney workhouse to see a girl of the name of 
               <persName id="t18131027-49-person518">
                  Emma

             - A. Yes; this day fortnight, the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after or before that you went there, that the prisoner spoke to you respecting her - A. It was on the Thursday before. He said he was afraid of the reports that were circulated about the neighbourhood would come to Mr. Bailey, or to me, that he had been stealing drops; he said, the report had arisen from Mr. Grig's daughter. I asked him how such reports could have got in circulation; he said, through Grig's daughter; he said, after he had been so many years in our service we could not suppose him guilty of such an action. I then only asked him where the girl was; he said, she was in some workhouse, but he did not know where; he gave her a very bad character, because she had robbed her father; but he did not know to what workhouse she was sent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time at what workhouse she had been sent - A. No. I believe the next day I learned from some other information.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did the suicide of Mr. Grig occur - A. On the Monday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Grig lived, I believe, in Creed-lane - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that taking place did the prisoner say any thing more to you respecting this subject - A. Yes. He said, now, things looked very black against him, but he was perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did Mrs. Grig put into your hands any quantity of drops - A. The Monday after that, last Monday; she put a quantity of drops, and made the disclosure.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the daughter, Emma, before this transpired - A. On the Saturday before, I saw the daughter, and on the Monday I went.</p>
               <p>Q. This day fortnight you saw her, and last Monday week you went to Mrs. Grig's - A. Yes; two days after I saw Emma.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the drops that were delivered up to you at Mrs. Grig's house - A. Yes, about twenty-two gross, rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. A gross of one hundred and forty-four to the gross; twenty-two gross, that would be more than three thousand - A. Above twenty-two gross.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. About forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lustre mounted when you saw them - A. Part of them was on the lustre, and part not; a part of them had not been mounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this lustre form a lustre of this kind - A. Something of that form. This is the identical lustre; the lustre was entirely formed; there were a considerable number of drops that remained over and above to mount that lustre.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's wages - A. He had twenty-six shillings a week; exclusive of his Christmas-box; his Christmas-box was six or seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your first receiving this information, did you resort to the prisoner's house - A. He was taken up last Monday; I then went to his house, No. 62, Union-street, in the Borough.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing any parcel or basket there about three months ago - A. Yes, in the evening; he brought the basket, and took some brown paper parcels out of it. He put the brown paper parcels on the back counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lodgers - A. No, not in our house. He came again the next morning; I saw him open the parcels; the parcels contained drops. I saw the prisoner put the pins in for mounting, and I saw the prisoner mount them on the back counter; he hung them round the lustre; they were all used to the lustre.

             mounted them on the lustre; my husband did not understand mounting of lustres. The prisoner mounted the lustres The prisoner came to our house often three or four times a day. I knew he was in the employ of Neale and Bailey, and that he brought the drops from Neale and Bailey. I have asked him if he was not afraid he would be found out. I asked him because my husband took them of him. He said, no; he was not afraid of taking them. He took a great many drops away from us the week before last, before my husband died. I knew there were reports in the neighbourhood about this transaction; I suspected my daughter telling; my daughter said that she had told the neighbours.

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Neale and Bailey. I am a moulder and cutter. I know some of these drops; I picked out twenty-one at the Hall, they are my cutting. I believe them all to have been cut for Messrs. Neale and Bailey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. I believe these drops to be my property, and my partner's. I never learned from the prisoner that he had disposed of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Neale. Q. Do you believe these drops to be the property of you and your partner - A. They are. I never authorized him to sell them; the drops disposed of to Stanton was a pale yellow; these are white.</p>

Yes; they keep horses in their business; the gateway to the wharf is always open, and the stable door is generally open; the sack, horse-cloth, and girth, were taken from their stable. Read saw them take them. I laid hold of the prisoner in the street. I saw him come out of the stable, and out of the yard. I laid hold of him in Derby-street; I told him I thought he had robbed the stable; he said, no. This was about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 20th of October. He had a sack on his back; in the sack was a horse-cloth, and a girth. I took him into the accompting-house, and sent for an officer.</p>

On the 9th of October, a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I had been having a little beer; I had my senses about me. This happened to me nearly opposite of Newtoner's-lane, in <placeName id="t18131027-51-crimeloc286">Drury-lane</placeName>

The prisoner and another came up; the prisoner took hold of my hat when the other picked me up. I then questioned the prisoner concerning the handkerchief in my hat; he put himself in a threatening posture; the other man run away. They came up together; they were in company. I can be upon my oath when my hat fell off my head the handkerchief was in my hat. The prisoner was a stranger to me, and when the other run away I gave him in charge of the watchman. As the prisoner was going to the watchhouse he said he had not the handkerchief, and if he had his liberty he would serve me out. I have never seen the handkerchief again; it is worth five shillings; it cost me nine shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming from the cook's shop, I saw the man laying down; his eye was cut, and his nose was bleeding. I picked up his hat. He fell down again. I gave him his hat. He said, give me the handkerchief. I said, you are a pretty one to get a man in a hobble. The man that assisted him in getting him up, ran away. He then gave me in charge of the watchman. I know nothing of the handkerchief. The prosecutor has been at my house, and offered to make it up for five shillings.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Harris's, the father of the young man. On last Thursday, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in company with Mrs. Harris and her daughters, and her son-in-law. We had been to the Old Bailey with some people that came from Harris's. On our returning home, Mrs. Harris proposed to go through Long-alley, and call at a public-house for her husband. She did. Her husband came out and joined our company, and as we were coming up Long-alley, the prisoner and a young woman were standing in <placeName id="t18131027-52-crimeloc290">Long-alley</placeName>

I waited at my father's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270040"/>door in Worship-street; I waited at my father's door until one o'clock in the morning I heard a noise; I went up to it, and when I came up it was my father, mother, and sister, quarrelling with the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner hit me, and I struck him again; with that he shuffled up a dark passage, and I followed him. He then stuck me in my side. I thought it was with some sharp instrument. I came out of this little alley; I called to my father; I said, I am stabbed. I was taken to the surgeon.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Stepney-green. I was on duty on the 20th of this month, between the hours of three and four in the morning, the prisoner was coming along Stepney-green with a horse and a cart; he was going towards Mile-end-road. I asked him what he had got in that cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to ask him what he had got in the cart - A. Because I thought he had something he should not have; he told me all was right. I was not satisfied with that. I ran after the cart. I then asked him what he had got in the cart; he said, flax. I followed him along Stepney-green about seven or eight hundred yards, or more. After following of him I asked him where he brought it from. He said, Limehouse-stairs. He told me he was going to take it to Birdcage-walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Birdcage-walk - A. One part is on Bethnal-green and the other part in Hackney-road. I followed him, and I went and acquainted Mr. Jaques, the constable of the night, of him. Mr. Jaques was in the watchhouse when I called him. The cart came very near to the watchhouse. Mr. Jaques came out of the watchhouse after him. We brought him back to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horse and cart - A. We put the horse and the property he had got, in the engine-house, adjoining the watchhouse. It was locked up there. The cart was put in Mr. Charrington's turning; the mare and the property in the engine-house. The night constable has the key of that in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a horse or a mare - A. A mare. I observed particularly that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the harness put up with the property - A. Every thing together. We never took it off. Mr. Jaques took care of the mare. I had nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. JAQUES. I was constable of the night. On this occasion I was called upon by Hollingsood, between five and six in the morning, to watch him. We went about sixty yards: I then took the prisoner by the collar, on the road. The prisoner was then sitting in the cart, driving it along the road. I caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had got in his cart. He said it contained flax and twine, he was going to Birdcage-walk with it. I took him to the watchhouse, and locked him up, as he did not give me a satisfactory account of himself. I took the property out of the cart, and put it into the engine-house, likewise the mare, and locked it up. Then after we came to the office we put the mare into the livery stable. On Thursday, Mr. Pritchard came to my house. I refused shewing him the mare that day, as the prisoner said it was his own. The prisoner was then committed. Mr. Pritchard came again on the Friday morning, and the mare proved to be his property. The mare and the harness Mr. Pritchard said was his property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cart and horse was lent me by a person of the name of Carrol, whose stable the horse was in, as I understood. We had a glass of gin together at the Basing-house. I agreed to meet him at the Nag's Head, Old-street-road. He met me there, and there I agreed for the loan of the horse.</p>

I had a pint of beer there, and when I came out the man that went in with me he was at the bar. I left him there. I went into the back room. I was told there was a man that wanted me there, the man that I wanted to see, but I did not find him. In about five minutes I left the room, and went to the front door. As I was going along the passage, about the middle of the passage I was struck by a man on my breast, that met me. He drawed my watch out immediately. I got hold of his clothes, and closed with him; in the scuffle we fell, both of us. I still kept my hold, and he was drawed to the street door; some of the people in the house came and drawed him to the street door. They opened the door, and drew him out. I laid hold of him by the legs before he was drawed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any violence offered to you while they were drawing out - A. They kept heating my hands. Several people said I should have my watch in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you hold of him by the legs before they dragged him out - A. Not above two minutes. When I had hold of his leg I perceived he had a high shoe on. I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday afterwards at Bow-street office. I described his foot on Monday, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his person in the passage - A. He took me so unawares I cannot swear to his person. The person that was down with me in the passage was the man that had my watch. His name was Brighton Cotten. I cannot swear to the person of the prisoner. I never got my watch again. I never was in this public-house before. The landlord's name is Bennett.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a bustle in the passage - A. I only saw a bustle in the passage. The passage leads from the back room to the tap. I was in the taproom; I could see the bustle, but not those that were in it. I was at that time in the act of turning a man out of the tap room that came in with Brown; he was tipsey and troublesome, and so was Brown. There were a great many people in the passage. The prosecutor went to the door; the person that was with him said that he had no watch with him when he came into the house. Brown was by; he made no reply to what the man said</p>
               <p>Brown. I am very sure I had my watch with me when I came into the house. The man that went with me he was very tipsey. The witness, Bennett, saw the seal at my watch pocket.</p>

The landlord produced the watch at the office; the prosecutor swore to it. The watch is very remarkable; the dial plate is broken. The publican is here with the watch.</p>

            . I am the keeper of the Magdalen coffee-house. On the 8th of October, the prisoner was at my house; my waiter brought the watch to me; I took the watch to the prisoner, I asked him if this was the watch that he had pledged; he said, it was. This is the watch: I have had it ever since; it is a remarkable watch, there is a bit of the face broken. The watch was pledged for thirty shillings; the prisoner said he wanted three shillings to make up some money that he had spent the day before, before he could go home; I gave him the three shillings, and told him he might have the watch again any day he pleased. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

They came in again; the boy said he must have that thread; I then served him, and told him if he had that thread he must keep it; he paid me two-pence for it. They went away, and directly they were gone away I missed the velveteen. It was a remnant of blue cotton velveteen; it was rolled up. I called my daughter down, described the children to her, and sent her out to look after them; she could not find them. On the next morning I had private information, and Donaldson, the constable, went with me to No. 10, Vine-street; we went up into the one pair of stairs, we went in, and the two children and their parents were at dinner. I knew the children; the father said he had beat his children for bringing the velveteen home. There was nothing found there. I was at Bow-street office when the velveteen was produced; I know the velveteen; there were no marks to it that I can swear to it.</p>

On the night of the 15th of October, I was alarmed by my wife; she was alarmed by thieves; my wife got out of bed; I did likewise; my wife stamped her foot on the floor to disturb the thieves, that we understood were in the house, and immediately after we sprang the rattle; the watchman came and got into the back yard; the watchman got over the paling, to a skittle-ground; my boy went to look, and let him into the house; I went down immediately afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the back of your house - A. The back parlour window was open, one window: that window had been fastened the night before, by my servant; it was opened on the inside; there was not the least appearance of violence having been used. I found an old stool and a pot-horse, they were standing by the washhouse door; they had been left in the skittle-ground; I found them removed to the washhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. By means of them could any person get access to your house - A. Yes, to a window of the room we call the lumber-room, over the washhouse side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that window open - A. No, there were no fastenings; the sash had been lifted up and put down again. I found the shutters of my bar forced.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your bar inside of your house - A. Yes, on the ground-floor, in a room in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, any person could not force these shutters, except they had been in the house, on the ground-floor - A. Impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left these bar shutters secure when you went to bed - A. Yes, I had fastened them myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270043"/>Q. Did you find any thing left in the house - A. Nothing. The shoes the watchman found outside of the door; I found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you told me your back-parlour window had been opened - A. Yes, on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the prisoner taken - A. In less than twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken - A. In a neighbour's premises adjoining of mine; I saw him directly after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In the space of two minutes before he was taken, had the watchman shewn you any shoes that he had found near the back door, or window - A. Yes, he had; that watchman's name is Swinland. When the prisoner was taken he had no shoes on</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. I had known him three years; he had been in the house four months before I took possession of it; he acted for Mr. Petrom fifteen weeks, very near four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing from the bar - A. I did not. They were disturbed too soon.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no tool to force your shutters - A. No; a person that knew my shutters might easily force them without any tool.</p>

Not on the first search; in about five minutes after the first search, I went to step from the fence in an adjoining yard, then I found him in Mr. Jewell's yard; I placed my foot upon something, I did not know what it was at first; I stooped, and discovered it was the prisoner.</p>

In the month of September last, I made an observation, the prisoner's coat was hanging on a peg in the work-shop, and while he was receiving his earnings, I put my hand into his coat pocket; I saw two skins of leather; the prisoner came back into the room; I told the prisoner what I had observed; he went down stairs again; I followed him. The prisoner returned up again; he took down his coat, and he look confused; he afterwards took the coat upon his arm, went down stairs with it, and laid it on the counter, in the back warehouse, and went into the yard; in the mean time Mr. Ticknell, the other workman, came and asked whether that was his coat; the prisoner said, it was. Mr. Ticknell put his hand in the pocket, and took out the other skin.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first taken out - A. I followed him up stairs the first time; he went then to his coat, took out a skin, and throwed it down. I told the prisoner he need not have done that, I knew it was there. He said, that was more than I could prove. I told him I had been a long time suspicious of him; I had then detected him. The prisoner said, good God, it is the first time; he then said, blast me, and rubbed his hands; he said, he did not think I would have served him so. I told him I had only done my duty, and Mr. West was made acquainted of it by Mr. Ticknell. He then said, by God, I am ruined; he then took his coat, and went down stairs, and at that time Ticknell went to the prisoner, and asked if that coat was his; he said, yes, it was. Ticknell then took the other skin out of his pocket. Mr. West then said to the prisoner, this is the way you have been robbing me; he said, it was the first time. He dropped upon his knees, and asked Mr. West's pardon.</p>
               <p>MR. TICKNELL. I am in the service of Mr. West. Mr. Smith gave me some information respecting the prisoner, Garrard; I saw the prisoner's coat upon the counter; I asked the prisoner if it was his coat; he said, it was. I found one of these skins in his coat pocket; Mr. West was present; he said, this is the way you have been robbing me. Garrard fell on knees begged for mercy, and said it was the first time; he said, he had taken it to bind some books for himself. It was near eight o'clock at night, when I found the skin in his pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a ticket porter.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August, last year, were you employed by any person to go to the house of Goodwyn and Company - A. I am not sure of the month. I was employed on the regular stand, the North side of the Royal Exchange, by the prisoner, to carry a letter and to bring back an answer. He paid me before hand. I went to Messrs. Goodwyn's accompting-house, I saw Mr. Howson, the clerk there. I gave Mr. Howson the same letter which the prisoner had given me. He opened it, and looked at it. I saw him take a paper out of the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take back any message to the prisoner - A. Yes; if there was any money owing at the house of Goodwyn's, they were to call themselves. I delivered back that message to the prisoner. The clerk gave me the receipt and the cover.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the receipt - A. I did. This is the receipt to the best of my knowledge; it was such a receipt as this. I looked at the names, and particularly at Goodwyn. I took this receipt of the prisoner. There were two of them in company together. The prisoner employed me. The other man gave me eighteen pence. I took back the receipt to the prisoner; there were then two in company. The prisoner and the other man came up to me; I told them they did not like to pay me; they must call themselves. I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not pay you - A. No, the other man paid me. The other man had no concern with me. The prisoner asked the other man if he had eighteen pence. It was a wafered letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. If it was a wafered letter it might be delivered to you without the prisoner knowing its contents. You read the receipt yourself - A. I did, on the 'Change, while I waiting until the prisoner came up. I gave the receipt back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he hand it to the other man - A. No, they walked arm in arm together. The prisoner employed me. I received the letter of the prisoner, and I returned the receipt and cover to the prisoner.</p>

I employed him to do a job for me, one in Bishopsgate-street, the other into Thames-street; he came back; for one I paid him nine pence, and the other three pence. He then asked me whether I had another job. I told him no, not at present. After that, I went to the public-house and had half a pint of beer. I went back to the warehouse. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was coming down stairs; I met the prisoner three parts of the way up stairs. As I was coming out he ran down stairs. I ran after him. He began to throw some dirt about that lay at the bottom of the stairs, and said what time in the morning shall I come to you to see if you have any thing for me to do; he said, about twelve o'clock? I said, yes, he might. He said he should not go home directly; he should go to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270045"/>wharf to see if he could get a job there. I saw no more of him after that. This was about half after five. I went to the door the next morning; I found the warehouse door open. This was about nine o'clock in the morning. I went to the desk, I found ten pound was gone; nine pound in notes, and about a pound in silver and copper. I went over to Mr. Kempster's young man, and told him of it.</p>

I then went to his lodgings, with the officer of the Compter with me, and in searching we found in the cover of a tureen forty-one shillings, seven three-shilling pieces, five eighteen-pieces, and twelve shillings and sixpence in silver. In a cartouch box we found three one-pound notes. We then went to the Compter, and asked the prisoner what he had done with the five-pound note. He told us that he had bought a pair of shoes, and had given eight shillings and two pence for them, and changed the five-pound note with the shoemaker to pay for them. We went to the shoemaker; he had paid it away. We traced the note until we got it.</p>

At Smithfield we went into a public-house and had a dram, and then he took me up to Compton-street, that is where the accident happened; we arrived in Compton-street about four o'clock; it was about one o'clock when I met him, and in <placeName id="t18131027-64-crimeloc366">Compton-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you attempt to stop him in the room - A. I should have taken him at the time, but it was not what I expected; it was quite unawares.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in the room - A. There was a woman with a child; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you ran out, and pursued him, and called stop thief, how far did you pursue him - A. Not more than ten or a dozen yards up Compton-street; I returned back to the public-house before he was taken. The prisoner was brought back in two or three or minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch - A. It is in the possession of a person who now has it. I thought at first it was a joke, and said if he would pay the expence he might go, but when he run out of the house I followed him, and cried stop thief.</p>

The prosecutor said, he thought it was only a lark, he did not wish to hurt him, if he could get his watch, and expences if the watch was damaged; the prisoner said, he and the prosecutor had been drinking all day together; the prosecutor and the prisoner were both fresh.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 14th of September, did you lose some diamond-rings - A. I did, and we lost some gold watches, they were stolen out of the warehouse; I had looked them out for an order, and that is the way they were missed; I had seen the ear-rings so late as three o'clock in the afternoon, and on the next morning, the 15th, I missed them, and the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th did your neighbour come to you - A. He did; he produced to me the ear-rings that I had lost on the 15th; in the morning Mr. Davis produced them; some conversation took place; I went to Mr. Davis's house; I found the prisoner there. I told the prisoner, that the ear-rings that Mr. Davis produced at our house were stolen the day before; I said, provided he would tell how he came by them, I would give him no trouble; he said, he could not tell. I then said, I must be under the necessity of sending for an officer; he must know how he came by them. Mr. Davis told him he thought he replied very improperly, that perhaps he did not know what situation he was placing himself in, and therefore he would recommend him to be candid, and say how he came by them; he then said, that he would; that he was to meet a man at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what man he had them off - A. No. He said, he was to meet a man of whom he had them the day before, he was to meat him on that day, at the Red Lion in Whitechapel; that is the corner of Red-lion-street, at which place an appointment was made for some more property to be brought. I rather think he said watches, I am not certain. I then told him if he would be candid, I would go with him, I would stay there to detect the property that was brought to him; this was about eleven o'clock in the morning; he was to go at two o'clock at the Red Lion public-house, to see the person again; he then begged to go by himself, as he could bring the person earlier; I refused that; I told him I did not wish to see him, but an officer; the officer then came, and we went together, to the Red Lion public-house, Whitechapel; the officer, me, Davis, and the prisoner. It was understood that the officer should be in the tap-room with the prisoner; I and Mr. Davis were to be up stairs; we waited until near three o'clock; this person never came. I told the prisoner it appeared very strange that the appointment was not kept; the prisoner said he could not account for it; he bought an old coat the day before, and he found the ear-rings in the pocket of an old coat. He was then taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these ear-rings - A Eighteen guineas; they are all loose diamonds.</p>

On Thursday, the 16th of September, he came to me between seven and eight in the morning; he produced the duplicate of a pair of earrings, saying, these ear-rings he had of a friend on Saturday, for which he gave six pounds; he had obtained the money on pledge; requesting I would take them out, as they were worth more; the pawnbroker said they were worth ten pounds, a few pounds might be of service to me, and the difference would be of service to him; I then replied, I would do it, but I never did any thing without my brother's consent, and he never was with me until ten o'clock. He went, and came again. I shewed my brother the ticket; we then sent for the ear-rings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner mention any thing else to you than the ear-rings - A. He expected the person that had the diamond ear-rings would bring some watches. He said he had the ear-rings of a friend: he paid six pounds for them.</p>

            . Q. Did you see the prisoner when he came the second time to your house in the morning - A. That was between eleven and twelve; I sent my servant for the ear-rings; the prisoner requested I would purchase them; I looked at them. I told him it was not our purpose of taking them, but to sell them, it was for the purpose of serving him, as he had left the duplicate with my brother; I told him he might sell them, and return me six pounds, which I had paid to the pawnbroker. He said, he wished I would purchase them. I told him he might wait a minute or two, I would take them to a friend of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention the name of that friend - A. I did not; I then took them to Mr. Levi; he claimed the ear-rings as his own as soon as he saw them; I took Mr. Levi to my house, to the prisoner; he was then asked how he came by them; he said he bought them of a man, he was to meet the same man again at two o'clock, at the Red Lion public-house; at two o'clock I went with Mr. Levi, a constable, and the prisoner, to the Red Lion public-house; after I had been there I came down into the tap-room; the prisoner was absent; he returned afterwards; he told the constable that he found them in the pocket of an old coat.</p>

            , No. 39, Ludgate-hill. On the 11th of October, between seven and eight at night, I went to Faint's lodging; I there saw a bag which contained two reams of paper. That paper was the prosecutor's property, I have not the least doubt of it. The paper is worth about thirty-six shillings. Faint absconded that evening.</p>
               <p>- KIMBER. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of October, after the clock had struck nine. The prisoner said he was innocent; he should not have done it if it had not been for Faint; he had put it in the waggon, and he took it to Faint's lodging. In Faint's lodging I found the paper, in this bag. I believe the bag belongs to Mr. Morgan.</p>

            . I live in Union-street, in the Minories. On the evening of the 17th of September, I had been to the Red Cow in Long-lane, Aldersgate. I had been there to take home a hat to the landlord of the house. I went there about eight o'clock, and staid there till near twelve. When I go out of an evening it is always my rule to put my chain in. I came out to make water, and I know the chain was in. On my going up Houndsditch, in my way home, I met the prisoner; she asked me to go with her. I told her to go about her business. She took hold of my arm; I shoved her away. She kept walking by my side. I thought I had out walked her, and when I came to the corner of <placeName id="t18131027-67-crimeloc382">Aldgate church</placeName>

I called stop thief; she was stopped. I have never seen my watch since. After she was taken to the watchhouse they found a watch paper. The watch paper I out myself; I knew it belonged to my watch. It was a silver watch. It was worth between thirty and forty shillings.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 17th of September, I was standing near my box, about half after one; I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor walking together; the prisoner had hold of his arm; they were in conversation together. In about two minutes after, I heard the cry of stop thief. I stopped the prisoner; she was running. I took her to the watchhouse. The prosecutor charged her with robbing him, and at the watchhouse he said she had robbed him of his watch. The officer went out and found a watch paper.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was delivered into my charge. I was officer of the night. I searched the prisoner; I found nothing upon her. I went out and looked about the road; I found a watch paper. I found no watch, chain, or seal. I shewed the watch paper to Mr. Rice, in the watchhouse. He said he could not rightly tell then whether it was his; he could tell better in the morning. In the morning he swore to it before the Lord Mayor. This is the watch paper; there is not a soil upon it; it was a dry night. At the watchhouse the prisoner denied her robbing of him.</p>

I took him to the Compter, and then I went to the house of Beachcroft and Soppitt. I produce the sugar.</p>

             told me to untie my cart; I told him I would not; he said he wanted to put something in my cart. I said he should not put anything into my cart. He called me an old sleepy fool. He brought a loaf of sugar out of the warehouse, and put it in the cart, and between six and seven o'clock at night I took it out of the cart, and took it to house, and delivered it to Hibbert. I did not tell my master. I did not know what to do.</p>

               <p>Q. You were possessed of a mould of the Centaur, were not you - A. Yes, I missed it from my premises; I bought it in November; I missed it last February. I gave a great deal of money for it. There is not a mould in the trade that will make the figure of the Centaur like it. I gave information to Bruchani; I told him that I had lost the mould. On the 13th of October I got a warrant, and went to Bruchani. The officer, in searching, found the mould. The prisoner was apprehended the same evening. The prisoner said if I would let him go, he would make up every thing to me. This is the mould that was found at Bruchani's; it is mine.</p>

            . I am a figure maker I live at Newington. I bought the mould of the Centaur of the prisoner, I gave him eighteen shillings for it. The prisoner is a mould maker; I think he can make a mould like that.</p>
               <p>MR. WORRALL. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at the White Hart, in Giltspur-street, on the 13th of September; he acknowledged that he had stolen this mould from Checkeni, and had sold it to Bruchani for eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I emplore mercy of my prosecutor; I was driven to the greatest distress; I was in a state of starvation by my prosecutor not paying me my wages; it is a ionspiracy of Mr. Checkeni to get me out of the way, he having used other tradesmen's moulds; there are many prosecutions coming against him, he knews I am the principal witness. Many times I have been down of a Saturday night when he has owed me three or four pounds, and not got any.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never owed him three or four pounds, nor am I afraid of any prosecution; it is all false what he has said.</p>

I took the watch to give it to Mr. Oxberry, Mackdonald, the watchman, seized hold of the watch; he said, give it to him; I said, nobody should have it but Mr. Oxberry. Mackdonald had hold of the watch, he took the watch out of my hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure Mackdonald took the watch out of your hands - A. Yes; I intended to give it to Mr. Oxberry. Mackdonald was stronger than me, he took it. I said, you, nor no one else should have it than Mr. Oxberry; I said to Mr. Oxberry, here is the chain and seals, Mackdonald has got the watch. Mackdonald, at the watchhouse, said he knew nothing of it; he then said he had it, and somebody took it from him. When he denied having the watch, I said I have got the chain and seals, the watchman has got the watch; he said, no, he had not; I shall charge you for robbing the man. A girl, was standing by, she said, what is this on your finger; that was the ring that parted the chain from the watch.</p>

I came up while the mob was about him; I saw a number of persons assembled at the window of a watch-maker's shop, that is the corner of Orange-street; I asked the reason of their being assembled there; a watchman said, it was a gentleman who had been dining at the O. P. and P. S. tavern, and was very much in liquor. I said, if that is the case, I must know the gentleman; I had been dining there also; the O. P. is in Russell-court, Drury-lane. I immediately looked down, and saw Mr. Fraser upon the ground; I told him who I was, and requested him to get up; with the assistance of some persons he was raised from the ground. I asked the watchman what they meaned to do with him; they said, take him to the watch-house. I replied, there was no necessity for that: there was a public-house a few doors from the place where we then were, they perhaps might get a bed there; if not, it would be better to deposit what property he had about him, and send him home in a coach; if not, they could convey him a part of the way home, as far as their best extend, and then give him in charge of two others. I also offered to reward them for so doing; I don't know whether I mentioned the sum; they said, no, and persisted in taking him to the watchhouse; I followed, and we had got into Hart-street; I think Mr. Fraser said, take care of my watch; a voice said, you had better give it to Mr. Oxberry, who seems to be the only person who knows any thing of you, and several others said, aye, do; many more persons now had come up, and I was removed from Mr. Fraser about two arms-length; a minute or two now elapsed. I saw the chain that I imagined belonged to Mr. Fraser's watch held out towards me; I had not got near enough to lay hold of that chain; some one held the other part very tight, the watch end, with a little force; I got possession of the watch-chain without the watch, no watch attached to it; there then was a scuffle; I exclaimed, I had got possession of the chain without the watch. A watchman, I will not say it was the prisoner, demanded of me the chain, and appendages, the seals; I don't know who that watchman was, as they meaned to take Mr. Fraser to the watchhouse; I there delivered it up.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know who had got the watch - A. No, I do not. A watchman proceeded to force me, I pushed him from me; I cannot say the watchman's name; two watchman seized me very forcible; we now came to the watchhouse, leaving Mr. Fraser behind, he was still in custody of some other watchmen. I deposited the chain and seals at the watch-house, in the custody of Mr. Davis, the constable of the night. A person, whom I understand his name to be Farthing, that man is here; he came into the watchhouse not in charge; he came with a number of other persons; he there accused the prisoner of forcing the watch from the chain, while he was in the act of giving it to me; he threw off his watchman's coat in a violent manner, and said, search me; a general search took place; this watch was not found. He then gave charge of Farthing, and said, he had stolen the watch.</p>

            . I was constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Fraser and Mr. Oxberry coming to the watchhouse - A. Perfectly well. Mackdonald brought in Mr. Oxberry, he said, he had got the gentleman's property; I saw in Mr. Oxberry's hand a gold chain and seals. The prisoner said to Mr. Oxberry, I'll have it; Mr. Oxberry said, you d - d rascal, you shall not; a scuffle ensued; I am not certain whether Mr. Oxberry struck the watchman, or not. After peace was obtained, the watchman held out a ring to me, he said, that was the gentleman's property; after that Mr. Oxberry handed me over the chain and seals; then a person of the name of Farthing came in, he said to Mackdonald, you are the watchman that has got the gentleman's watch; Mackdonald declared he had not; I searched him; there was not less than sixty persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270051"/>searched; no watch was found. I desired Mr. Fraser might he put to bed.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse-keeper's daughter. I was at the watchhouse this night; Mackdonald brought Mr. Oxberry in with the chain in his hand; Farthing came in, said he handed the watch over to Mr. Oxberry. Mackdonald charged Farthing and Mr. Oxberry with robbing Mr. Fraser; Mr. Fraser was brought in; no watch was found about him. Mackdonald was still holding his hand out, still persevering that Farthing and Mr. Oxberry had stolen the watch. I saw a ring on the watchman's finger; I asked what it was; he said, it was the ring that belonged to the gentleman's chain, the watch had been wrenched out of his hands, he could not tell by who.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came in the watch-house Mr. Oxberry had the chain and seals; I said, sir, this is part of the gentleman's property; therefore I gave him in charge.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw a mob; Mr. Fraser was down, I lifted him up, and Mr. Farthing took his watch out of his pocket; Farthing said, I'll give it to Mr. Oxberry; I heard the watchman say, he has taken the gentleman's watch out of his pocket. I saw Farthing hold out his hand to Mr. Oxberry, there were several trying to get the watch, who had it I don't know; the prisoner took Mr. Oxberry to the watchhouse.</p>

            . On the 28th of September, in my way home, facing the upper end of King-street, in Hart-street, I saw ten or twelve people together; I saw Mr. Fraser intoxicated, I saw Mr. Oxberry speak to him; I saw Farthing take Mr. Fraser's watch, and hand it to Mr. Oxberry. I persuaded Farthing to give the watch to the watchman; Farthing said, he did not know the watchman. I said, nor do I know you; we will soon know who the watchman is. He said, he would deliver it to no one but Mr. Oxberry, as he was Mr. Fraser's friend; Mr. Oxberry came near, Farthing extended his hands towards Mr. Oxberry with the watch; the watchman collared Farthing, and demanded the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the watchman got the watch or no - A. No, I did not see in whose hand the watch fell. I am sure Mackdonald is the watchman that collared Farthing, and demanded the watch.</p>

I went into the kitchen to take some bread up stairs for breakfast. The area gate is left open until a certain time in the day, in order to prevent dirt from coming in at the front door. It is a regular rule to lock it up at two o'clock in the day. The key is given to my master every night; he puts the key out in the morning; it is unlocked at eight o'clock, or near nine sometimes. I went up stairs to take some bread, I returned in five minutes, not more than six, to the outside; I found the door open, I missed the dish and cover, which I had left facing the pantry-door; I immediately went into the street, supposing somebody had been there, and saw the prisoner running with a parcel before him; the parcel was supported with his two hands before him; I pursued him, and overtook him in Norton-street; we saw about six hundred yards altogether, before I overtook him; when I got within twenty yards of him, I called stop thief; he then let the dish and cover fall, continuing to run as fast as he could; there were two men approaching at that time in Buckingham-street, they attempted to stop him, he crossed over; I laid hold of him, I collared him; he said, he hoped I would let him go at liberty as it was his first offence.

               <p>Q. Where was the other prisoner - A. I never saw the other prisoner. The officer, Johnson, came in, and asked me if I had lost any thing; he said, they were shop-lifters, he suspected them. I looked over the box; I missed one piece of lace: I saw the piece of lace afterwards.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 5th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning. I saw the three prisoners in Bunhill-row; in consequence of seeing them altogether, I watched them from ten o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon; they went round Piccadilly, and Bond-street, into Oxford-street; I saw Smith and Thorn go into Mr. Serivener's shop, and Williams staid outside of the door; directly they came out, I went in, and asked the shopman if he had lost any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270053"/>thing. When they came out of the shop, I saw them give Williams a signal, which gave me suspicion that they had robbed the shop; I followed them into the market, a short distance from the house; they went into a public-house in Oxford-market; they there went into the back yard of the public-house; by their going in so quick I had strong suspicion that they had got something; when they came out of there, I made them all go into the parlour; I then began to search them. In searching Smith, I believe this handkerchief dropped from Williams; I picked the handkerchief up, it contained three carde of lace. I could not discover from whom it fell; they stood close together. I believe it fell from Williams; the handkerchief contained three cards of lace; I sent for a coach, and took them to Mr. Scrivener's door; I made the shopman come to the coach. I asked him if he knew any these cards; he said, he did; they were his master's property. I am confident it did not drop from Thorn.</p>
               <p>Elleby. I know the cards of lace well; they are the property of Mr. Scrivener.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Scrivener any partner - A. He has not. There is no other shopman but myself. Mr. Scrivener was not in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. When we were taken in the public-house parlour, there were two or three women sitting there, and two or three men; the officer searched us, he found nothing; after we were searched the property was brought forward; I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I am the only the person that is guilty, the others knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After a life of honesty, I stand at your bar; this calamity involves the fate of a wife and three children. Necessity, the fatal power which generally breaks through every thing, implied me in an unguarded moment to do this, which has added to my grief; no language can express the anguish I feel, and whatever misery I may be doomed to suffer, I feel it a duty to clasp every means that present itself; though nothing can remove the remorse that I feel yet in commiseration of my hopeless family, I hope your lordship will shew some lenity.</p>

I examined the papers carefully; I found a deal of circumspection had been used; the parts of the papers that had been marked were cut off, and had been marked in another place. I selected one parcel of files, with my mark upon the files; they are a particular sort, and never sold in London; it was three dozen, marked S. W. I never sold them in London. There were several bags of nails, most of them had my marks upon the bags. After I had removed all the property away from Peake's house, I called Pike into my accompting-house, I questioned him concerning the business; he denied it at first, but when he saw I had all the property away from Peake, he began to paulter, he sent to me just before he was going to be put into the Compter; I went to him. He then told me that he had regularly sold a large quantity of goods to Peake; he said, he stole the files. He nearly enumerated all the articles I have got here; he sold them to Peake for three-pence a pound.</p>

In the evening, about half past six, I heard the prisoner unlock the cupboard; he then went out; after he was gone, I looked in the cupboard; the bottle of turpentine was gone, and the jar of white-lead also. Mr. Green pursued him, and took him, and brought him back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270055"/>with the property on him; he said he hoped Mr. Green would forgive him.</p>

               <p>Q. In the latter end of September, did you purchase some timber of Mr. Smith - A. I did; some ten fine timber, at six pounds ten shillings per load. This is the bill of parcels. (The bill of parcels read.) The timber corresponds to that bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see where the timber was taken to, you agreed with your man where to place it - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, you went into the country - A. I did; on Sunday. On Wednesday, the 29th I made the purchase. In consequence of some information, I came up to town on Monday, the 4th of October; I then went to the premises of Mr. Dagneash.</p>

When I got to Dagneash's wharf, I there saw the six pieces of timber that I had lost; which had been my property. They were the six same pieces of timber; they were placed under the wharf, under the crane, ready for landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners - A. I did;

            , the younger; this was about half after four in the afternoon. I asked the younger Dagneash, if these six pieces of timber belonged to him; I pointed out the individual pieces to him. He said, they belonged to him. I asked him if they were to sell; he said, yes, at ten guineas a load. I told him I thought that was too much; he said, he would take ten pounds for ready money. I then said, I would take the six pieces I dare say, if he would give me until ten o'clock to consider of it; he said, he would. I went home, and went to Shadwell office. At eight o'clock, the same night, I saw

I then asked them if they had a racing iron; that is a thing that marks timber; they said, they had no such thing. I then recollected that I had one in my pocket; I marked a T. upon each, that I might know that was the very timber when day light came; we then came off the timber. I asked Mr. Dagneash to give me the contents, that I might know how much money to send; he gave me the contents. This is it. It corresponded with the bill of parcels, and it corresponds with the timber I bought of Mr. Smith; I can speak with positive certainty to that.</p>
               <p>Q. In pursuance of that arrangement, did you call again the next morning - A. I did, and Hope, the officer, with me, and Nicholas Wall, my own man; I then saw

They were both close by, one heard what the other said. I asked then where they got the timber; William Dagneash said, why do you ask me this question. I told him it was a fair question, and said again, where did you get this timber; he then said, he purchased it at Chatfield and Arnott's. Before that I told him the property was mine, and it had been stolen; before that I said, if he purchased it of these people, I suppose he had a bill of parcels; all this time they were both standing together. No, he said, he did not think he had a bill of parcels.</p>

They said, it was perfectly sound, they had opened a great deal of it.

What conversation passed I cannot say, I was not present. I went down afterwards; Mr. Dagneash, the elder, and Simeon, were both there. Mr. Fox then claimed the timber; he requested Simeon Dagneash to take the timber from where he brought it. Mr Fox then said, my man is here; a man may take his own property wherever he finds it. The timber was there on the wharf, and Mr. Fox's man took it away. No objection was made on the part of the prisoner to his taking it away. I then desired Mr. Dagneash and and his son to attend at the office; they did from time to time.</p>

            's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, on the 2nd of October last, as I was coming down my timber yard, a man who is repairing a barge for me, he called out, sir, there is a man wants to speak to you. I came down to the river, the New-Cut, Limehouse: I saw a person, his name is Pennington, who is in the employ of Mr. Richardson and son; he asked me if I had lost any timber. I told him, I could not tell, I would look and see. I examined my wharf, at which there is a sharp point which goes into the river, or New Cut, where I drew up timber. I then saw a vacancy in my dock, where there were some timber missing. I could not tell the number of pieces. I I then told Pennington that I had, but I could not tell the number of pieces. They put their boats into my dock; I supposed they took the timber to put themselves over; it is a still water place. This is all that passed. Pennington walked away. I came to the accompting-house; my eldest son was there; he is clerk; my youngest son, William, he attends the loading. I said to my eldest son, Sim, Pennington says there is some timber drifted down to Richardsons, you must go and take Bill with you, take some rope and staple, and push through the lock. If any timber comes there they push it away. This was my order to my son. The timber I never saw. This was on Saturday. On Monday the 4th of October, about dusk, my son said a man has bought six pieces of timber; he says he knows you very well. I came home the next morning, one of my then said a gentleman wanted to speak to me. I said to my son, Sim, I dare say this is the gentleman that has purchased the timber of you last night, as you are the person that agreed with him, you are the most proper person to go. I then said, as he said he knew me, I had better go; however, my son went down before me. When I came near the dock where this timber laid, I said, good morning, Mr. Fox; he made no reply, but said, pray, sir, where did you purchase that timber. I was surprised. I had no doubt I purchased it of Chatfield and Arnott. He replied, you are a liar, sir; your son has sold me my own property; well you may build houses; there are many poor men transported for a lesser crime. I do not know that ever I saw the timber before. Upon a narrow inspection I saw it was not our timber. I said, upon my word, Mr. Fox, I am very sorry. He then said, villain, I will not hear it. I then said, Mr. Fox, if I have offended the

            's Defence. On Saturday the 2nd of October, my father told me there was some, timber adrift. According to my father's request I got ropes and staples, and collected this timber together. It was similar to our timber.

             made fast to the six pieces which Mr. Fox claimed as his property; then after making them fast to our wharf I went to breakfast, when one of our men called to me in the accompting-house, and said a gentleman wished to speak to me in the yard. I went out; it was Mr. Fox; he enquired of me if we had got any red pine timber for sale. I told him we had. I shewed him some in the yard; he said that did not suit his purpose; he said, these six will suit me as well as any. He asked the price; I told him ten guineas; he agreed at ten pound a load. In the evening Mr. Fox came again; I gave him the contents of the timber. The next morning Mr. Fox came again; after a good morning to each other had passed, my father came down the yard; he said, how do you do, Mr. Fox, Mr. Fox made no reply. He said, sir, where did you purchase<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270058"/>this timber. I answered, at Messrs. Chatfield and Arnott's; then he said, I suppose you have got a bill of parcels. My father answered, he did not know that he had; then he said, I have got you, your son has sold me six pieces of my own timber. My father turned to me and said, Sim, this is a bad job indeed; you must have brought this timber by mistake. He turned to Mr. Fox and begged his pardon, and said, he has collected this timber by mistake. He abused him, called him a thief, a villain. My father said, he was not afraid of the laws of his country. Then we went to the office.</p>

The prisoner was then in the custody of Lavender. I shewed the things to the prisoner at the office; he first denied taking any thing but the sponge. This apron that I have in my hand, he said, was given to him by Mr. Wilson. I then said, I suppose you have taken the other pieces; he said, yes.</p>

From information I got an officer, and searched the prisoner, Jeffreys's, apartment, No. 13, Knightsbridge; I enquired of Jeffreys for the shoes my servant had sent her, that was stolen; she denied all knowledge that any thing come whatever. I told her my information was so correct, and if she did not deliver up the property I would give her in charge of the officer. She then said, that she had but one half of the room to herself, and another person had the other half, her name was Athlick; she was not at home. I saw a box in the room with Robert Jeffreys upon it, on a plate; she said, it was her husband's box, but she had lent it to the other woman, for her use. The officer broke that box open, and the contents of that box were the articles stated in the indictment. Mrs. Jeffreys said, she knew nothing of the goods in the box, they did not being to her. The officer searched the bed, and found a pair of boots. There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270060"/>was another box in the room; Jeffreys said, that was her box; I searched that box; in it was a pair of jean shoes, my property. She said my servant had made her a present of them the preceding day, and in searching the box, I found another pair of shoes; by this time Mrs. Athlick came in; she said, she brought away thirteen pair of shoes when she called at my house, my servant gave them to take to Jeffreys. The officer took the property and the prisoners, to Marlborough-street office, and left them there. He came to my house; I asked my servant if she knew any thing of the property; she denied all knowledge. I told her I had been to a house in Knightsbridge, and found the property, and her accomplices were in custody; she said, she had taken the goods, and sent them to Jeffreys.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 16th of October, a little after eight in the evening, I was standing at the corner of Union-street, Swallow-street, the prisoner passed me with something under his coat; I ran after him, and stopped him; I took the glass from under his coat; I asked him where he got it from; he said, he did not know, he had it from a man. I took him into a public-house, and searched him. He begged hard for me to let him go, he had done it, he said, through distress, if I would let him go, he would take the glass to where he stole it from; going along to the office he said, he had it out of Bull-yard, Swallow-street. This is the glass.</p>

            . I am a watchman on Tower-hill. At half past three I was going my beat, I saw a person at different hours of the night; I observed a man lurking about; I went into my box. I blowed the light out. This man came and rubbed his hand across my box; I took no notice. I sat still until I heard him go away; I then came out of my box, and followed him; he went up to Mr. Barrs's accompting-house; I asked him what he wanted there; he said he was waiting for work. This gentleman's accompting-house had been attempted twice before. I immediately made up to the door, and when I came to the door

               <p>Q. He came out of the accompting-house - A. Yes. I ran after him about fifty yards, he then threw this large crow from him; he said the man is gone that way. I said, you are the man for me; two patrols came up; I told them if they would stick to him, I would go and find the crow. I went, and picked it up; they sticked to him. I am sure he is the same man; I never had my eyes off him; we went back to the accompting house; the goods were packed up in two bags at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What were the goods - A. It is wrote down on this piece of paper; they were removed from the inner counting-house; these things were taken from different packages. They brought the bags, and left them behind them. A trunk was broken open containing wearing apparel, and put into bags; a parcel containing different parcels of knives were removed to the door in a case; the case was directed to the Commissary General at the Indies; they were all removed from the place where I put them, from one room to another. The property belonged to me, and to no one but myself.</p>

I said, I did not like to go home as far as London-wall without my hat; I should like to have my hat; one of them said, if I would stand half a pint of gin he would fetch my hat. I agreed. The prisoner put a glass of gin to my mouth; he took a dollar from me. I put up my hand to prevent him spilling the liquor over my clothes, to lay hold of the glass. He put his hand into my left hand pocket, and took out the dollar. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the dollar - A. I don't know. As soon as I challenged him with it, his companions shoved me from one side of the bar to the other. On last Sunday morning, near Charing Cross, I saw him on the opposite side of the way; as soon as he saw me he was surrounded with fourteen young men of his companions; that was Sunday morning, the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man - A. That is the man. I had a young man with me; I looked at him; his companions called me to go to Bow-street, and get a nurse; accordingly I went; I could see no one then. In the evening I saw Mr. Nicolls he went with me, and apprehended him.</p>

I met the prisoner in Newgate-street, I said Sarah, what do you do here with this handkerchief; she said, I do not know. She put her hand behind her, and gave it to another girl. The bundle was stopped, it contained these things in the indictment. When she came to me she said she was without parents.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Whitesides. On the 5th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, these things were lost, when the street door was open. I had been sweeping the passage, I turned back to put the broom away in the kitchen. I was not in the kitchen five minutes; I heard somebody in the passage. I came out; I saw the prisoner in the passage; I asked her what she was doing there; she said, nothing. At that time the great coat and the hats were removed from the pegs; she had got them in her apron. I followed her to the street door, brought her back to the passage, and took the coat and hats out of her apron. The handkerchief was in the great coat pocket. These are the things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine; they are worth ten shillings altogether.</p>

When the person that robbed me, left me, she ran up Red Lion-passage; I went up there, and told the people in the court that I was robbed, and I supposed the prisoner had run into one of the houses; they said, no. A young man came up, and said, you had better leave this place, they are bad characters here; you had better go to the watchhouse. I went to the watchhouse; I told the constable I thought she was a Welch girl; he told me to call upon him the next morning. During the time I was in the watchhouse, they took up Abrahams; she said, she knew a person of the name of Jones, that she lived in some court in Goswell-street; an officer went with me to her room. The officer found ten pounds in notes; I can swear to their being mine. I cannot swear that the prisoner robbed me; I believe she might be the woman.</p>

             came to me: he said, he had been robbed of fifteen pounds, and he had some information that the prisoner lodged in a court in Goswell-street. I found out the prisoner's room, and as soon as I went in, the prisoner went down upon her knees. The prosecutor said, if she would give him the notes, he would forgive her. She told me if I would go down stairs, she would give him the property. I went down stairs half way; there is a vacancy under the door; I could see the prisoner take something out of the bed. I went in the room, and told the prosecutor he must give me the notes; he gave me five one-pound notes, and a five-pound bank note. These are them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure they are my notes; she gave them me, I took the five-pound note of Esdaile and Co. bankers.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker's servant to Mr. Harrison. On the 6th of October, about half past nine in the evening, while I was selling some shoes to a woman, I saw something snatched away from the door; I immediately crossed the counter, and saw a person crossing the road; I ran some distance up the street, and caught the prisoner; the prisoner threw the coat from him. I picked the coat up, and took the prisoner and the coat back to Mr. Harrison. This is the coat; it is Mr. Harrison's property.</p>

I was in the parlour, with my back towards the door; I saw the prisoner take something out of the pan; I went into the shop to catch hold of him, he then went out of the door sideways; he went out of the door, and whistled. I went into back-hill; I saw him, a cook-shop man was running after him, the man was beating the boy; when I came up I bid him stop; I said, that boy had been in our shop, and had robbed the shop. The man asked me if I saw the meat in his hand; I said, I did not; his back was towards me. I am sure the prisoner is the boy; he had something before him, and kept his back towards me. I lost a leg of lamb, a piece of salt beef, and some breast of mutton. It appeared to me as though he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270066"/>crossed the shop twice, by the marks of his feet on the floor.</p>

I saw my two pigs hanging up in the shop, quite dead. I am sure they were my pigs; I had them ever since they were a month old. I told him, they were my pigs. Elworthy said, she bought them of a strange man, he agreed to give four pounds for them, he gave a three-shilling piece earnest; the man was to come again for the money. I left a man there to see whether the man came I took the pigs away. Bye said, he was a bricklayer, he only came there to do a job; he only helped to get the pigs in.</p>

The woman of the house came up to me, and asked if all was right; I said, no; I had missed a note. I asked Holmes if she had any objection to go with me to a constable; she said, no. I could not find a constable. She wanted to go away; I brought her back. I could not trace the note at all.</p>

I changed a fifteen-pound note in the afternoon; I had four one-pound notes in change in my pocket-book; I was certain of it, because my pocket-book was never out of my pocket until I found it in her bosom in her room. She told me to lie down in the bed while she went down to get a light, and when she was gone for the light, I missed my pocket-book; when she came up with the light I asked her for my pocket-book; she took the pocket-book out of her bosom, she threw it of one side of the room; I took the pocket-book up, and looked for my notes; they were gone. I have never found the notes since. I took her down stairs, called the watch, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in her company before - A. Yes; former voyages. I never had any dispute with her before about money, as I had this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was an old acquaintance of yours; you used to visit her when you came on shore. Are you sure you did not give her this pocket-book to keep for you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He told me I had robbed him of four one-pound notes, that he had in change for a five-pound note of Mrs. Miles. I went with him to Mrs. Miles; she had no knowledge of him; she said, it was his companion that she gave change; not to him.</p>

            . About seven o'clock in the evening, I observed the two prisoners in the shop in, custody of an officer, of the name of Johnson; Johnson asked me if I had not missed a five shilling paper off the desk; I looked on the desk, and said, yes. I found a five shilling paper was gone; the officer took the prisoners into the accompting-house, and searched them, and out of Duffett's pocket, he took out a five shilling paper of halfpence together; I had seen the paper of halfpence on the desk about half an hour before the officer came in.</p>

On the 13th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, Hearne came into the shop, and bought half an ounce of lemon-peal and peppermint drops, to the amount of three-pence. The halfpence were on the desk, about a yard from Hearne. Hearne went out. Duffett came in, and asked for half an ounce of refined liquorice, as I was making up the liquorice, the officer brought in Hearne, and seized Duffett: the officer called me to help to hold the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an officer. On my coming up Compton-street, into Princes-street, I saw the two prisoners in company together; they walked up and down Princes-street together, looking into different shops; they went to the corner house, and sat upon the steps, both the prisoners; it was opposite of Chandler and Butters's shop. Hearne went into Chandler and Butters's shop, and when he came out Duffett went in; he asked for something as I supposed, and while the shopman went into the accompting-house, he took something from between the rails of the desk, and put it into his pocket; Hearne was watching him. I took Hearne into the shop, and seized Duffett. I asked the shopman if he had missed any thing off the desk; he looked on the desk, and saw the paper of halfpence were gone. I took this paper of halfpence out of Duffett's pocket. They are mostly new halfpence and penny-pieces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Butters. I believe that paper of halfpence and penny-pieces to be mine; I tied it up the evening before.</p>

            , myself. On the 22nd of January, we missed a cask of ale; I received information of it being missed about six o'clock in the evening. On the next morning we obtained a search warrant to search the defendant's house, the sign of the Sun and Punch Bowl, Long-lane; the officer told him what we had come for; we found the ale in the cellar, behind a butt; we found parts of the head of the cask in the coal cellar adjoining, with the remainder of the two heads; the body of the cask was in the cellar where the other beer was. The inside of the cask was wet with the ale; the rushes between the staves were full of ale; the hoops on the outside of the cask were rather bright, from friction of being rolled. I then searched for the ale itself. The size cask that we lost was thirty-six gallons. In the cellar adjoining it, we found the ale in another cask, with the bung out; we tasted it; I have no doubt it was our ale; he did not take ale of us. There was no other ale in the cellar like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your marks upon the cask - A. Yes; there was the name Hale, Red-cross-street. It had been nearly obliterated by an adze. I do not think the ale had been brewed three months.</p>

I told him what I came for, to search for a cask of ale, and he could save me some trouble if he would shew me where it was; he said, he knew nothing about the cask, it had been about the premises two years. It appeared to me to have been broken up recently.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 5th of October, I saw the two prisoners, they were in company with another woman, and a man; I saw them about two o'clock in the afternoon, at the corner of Jewin-street, Aldersgate-street; I followed them to St. Martin's-le-grand; they stopped there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270070"/>and conversed together for five minutes. Easton then left them for five minutes; she returned back again, and joined them again in conversation: then Smith crossed the road, and went to Mr. Roberts's house, an eating-house in <placeName id="t18131027-136-crimeloc804">St. Martin's-le-grand</placeName>

She came out of the house as if she had bought something; she joined the same parties; then Easton crossed the road, and went into Mr. Roberts's shop; she came out with something; then they all joined in conversation together. I then went to Mr. Roberts shop, and made enquiry what they had been doing, that confirmed my suspicion. I went after them; they all four were in conversation together, three women and one man, and what they had purchased they gave to the others who escaped from me; they separated; I went after Easton and Smith; I caught hold of both their hands, and insisted of them keeping their hands out of their pockets. In the mean time Easton dropped two counterfeit sixpences; I picked them up, and I have kept them ever since. I instantly took the two prisoners into a fishmonger's shop in Foster-lane, and searched them. On Easton I found two pence halfpenny in copper; on Smith two good sixpences, and a penny in copper. I received two shillings of Mr. Roberts afterwards.</p>

I heard an uncommon noise in the market; I went over to Mr. Mason's shop, on the other side of the market. I found the shutters up, but loose; one of the shutters I took down; I found the prisoner inside, sitting on the block. I asked him what brought him there; he said he was Mr. Mason's servant, he came there to sleep. I told him I was pretty sure he was not Mason's servant, I knew all the men that were in his employ; if he wanted to sleep there why did not he get the key of Mr. Mason. I took him in custody; I took him to the watchhouse, and gave him in charge of the constable, and on searching him we found a saw upon him.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. When the prisoner was brought in the watchhouse I found these tools upon him, a saw, a gimblet, a large spike, a tinder box with a candle; the tinder box had tinder in it, a flint, steel, and matches, and a screw-driver. Finding these on him, I booked the charge, and took him to the Compter.

When Mr. Mason was sent for at the watchhouse I went down with Mr. Mason to his shop; I tried the gimblet to a hole in the shulters that the prisoner had bored; it fitted, and this spike nail I fitted to the mark of the shulter at the bottom, where the prisoner had wrenched it down. Mr. Mason went with us to prefer the hill; he is since dead.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was a watchman there three years. Mr. Mason's shop is in the front of my box. The prisoner had not been Mr. Mason's servant for three or four years past.</p>

When I saw him at Union-hall he had them shaved off; now they are grown again. When he called upon me he affected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270071"/>to be intoxicated. I judged so. He said he wanted to look at some linen for shirts. I shewed him a small quantity, and he scarcely looking at the cloth, pulled out of his jacket pocket two gold pugado's and a Spanish dollar, saying, do you take such money as that. I said, yes, when we know the value of it we take it. I called

             to go and know the value of it. The boy went, and returned in a quarter of an hour. During that time he affected intoxication, reeling about as if he was tipsey. Phillips returned, and said the value of the pugados were six shillings and ten pence or seven shillings, and five shillings and sixpence the Spanish dollar. I said, reach me down a piece of cloth, and while I was looking at the cloth, one of the pugados was gone; he produced these forty-three pugados in paper, wrapped up, and while I was counting them he said, come let us go into the cabin, seeing the accompting-house. I supposed they being precious metal took them with me; he said he must have the brass, meaning the change. In the accompting-house I endeavoured to ascertain the value of them, supposing them to be good, and after calculating them I found they would come to fourteen or fifteen pounds. I had nine pounds laying on the desk; I offered him that until they were sold. He wanted the cloth or the other change to make it up. I told him I would give him no more at present, nor should he have the cloth. I moved the cloth out of his reach, as he seemed to want to take it. I gave him no more. I told him in an hour he should have the whole of the change. I then put the forty-three pugados towards him, and told him he should have no more. He would not give me the nine pounds back again, but seemed to wish to get off. I gave him a card of our shop, and told him to call in an hour; he promised me he would. As soon as he was gone I sent Nicholson to ascertain their value, and sent Phillips with him to ascertain their value, and to bring me the produce back. Phillips came back; I then found they were good for nothing. I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am land steward and bailiff of the duke of Northumberland. I reside in his premises. On the 30th of September, we had been drawing the ponds in the Commons. We collected the fish to put in the yard of the dwelling-house; they were stolen on the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity do you suppose there were of fish there - A. Of tench, ninety brace had been put in just at the time of the robbery; carp, exactly thirty brace were put in. On the 8th of October, in the morning, I came down the yard between the hours of six and seven; I came down the yard and gave the men orders. I perceived a net had been drawn, I then immediately called the keeper, and traced where the net had gone, by the droppings of the mud, as it was carried along to the Back-lane to a gate; there I saw they had throwed the net down and taken the fish out. I saw where the net had been throwed down, and the fish taken out in the night; the dew being so strong upon the grass, I followed the track across the lawn into the meadow, to a river at the old bridge that leads down to the Thames; it is part of the Old Brent; there I could see very plain a boat had been, and left its mark. I could also see tracks of men's feet where they put the net in, it being heavy; there were not less than three or four tracks across the meadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drag the pond afterwards - A. I did. I am perfectly aware that they had dragged the pond. I traced the tracks to the old bridge, and then to ascertain the loss I directed our boats to be got, and a net to drag the pond of carp. I should think about thirty brace were gone, and perhaps sixty brace of tench gone; the carp were large, and the tench small.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner fishing at the old bridge before - A. I had; he is a fisherman. In the duke's pond no person has a right to fish there. The duke gives nobody leave to fish there.</p>

On Saturday, the 9th of October, the prisoner came to me at Billingsgate; he offered me a lot of tench and carp, which he said, lay alive in his boat off Billingsgate. I bought seventy-five pounds weight of tench, at eight-pence a pound; they were very small. There were near one hundred brace, and a lot of carp. I gave him eighteen shillings for the lot. I saw a small pike, and two or three roaches, and some perches. I asked him how he came by these fish; he said, he had been employed to drag Lord Essex's pond, at Watford, and that the steward, or bailiff, had sold him this lot. He then brought the tench home in a basket, and had them weighed. He gave me his direction, Hermitage Bagley, at Teddington, Middlesex; he called himself a fisherman. I asked him if he was one of the Bagley's family, who lived at Stranham-green: he told me he was, but he lived at Teddington. I am sure he is the man that I had the fish of.</p>
