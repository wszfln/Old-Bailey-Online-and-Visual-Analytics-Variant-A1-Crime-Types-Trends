               <p>I was with the last witness when he stopped the man, these things were found upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120005"/> him, they have been at Mr. Wilmot's Office ever since, locked up; I did not hear what the prisoner said at first.</p>
               <p>(The hammer cloth deposed to by the prosecutor, by the lacing.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There never is two hammer cloths alike, the glass has a string to match it, that was cut off; I am sure it is the glass almost, I will not swear to it; I know it also by the colour of the cloth, and the make, I have looked at it before; I serve a lady with a job, it is her coach and her hammer cloth, it is not my property, nor the coach glass neither; the carriage was standing at a coach-house, at the Two Swans, which belongs to me, the things were taken from thence, I am answerable for every thing that is lost.</p>
               <p>How so? - I paid for a carpet that was lost out of the coach once before; she says she has nothing to do with it; I always understood it as my property, it is in my care always; I hire the coach-house and stable.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This latter explanation of the property being in the possession of this witness, and his considering himself answerable for it, goes a good way towards the property being his, because, in the case of a carrier, it is always so held; but I will send to ask three of the Judges, who are up stairs, and we will go on in the mean time.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Kingsland-road that evening, and a man asked me to carry it for him, and he would give me a shilling, he then gave me a groat, and they took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Did he tell the same story? - He did; there was a man at the back of him, but he did not say so while he was in sight, the man did not run, but he turned down the church-yard; the man was perfectly out of sight before he said that to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, all the Judges concur in opinion with me, that it is sufficient in point of property to support the charge of the indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. It is moveable? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Court. Then there is an end of the burglary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have windows to the front of your shop; I have not, I have a press fixed, a piece of furniture, this shew-glass projects an inch or two over the shop, it projects, in short, beyond the upright of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these things in any part of the shew-glass that projected beyond the shop, or were they in a line drawn from the top? - The extent, I believe, is above the bounds from the line of the foundation.</p>

               <p>I am a clerk in the India-house, accidentally, on the 31st of December last, between seven and eight, I was coming through St. Paul's Church-yard, and heard the cry of stop thief; I went into the highway, and saw the prisoner before me, he fell down about five yards, and in falling down he threw something from his hand, I could not distinguish what it was then, but I saw somebody take it up, and then I saw it was a cushion; it was taken to Mr. Parker's shop: I am sure it was the prisoner, he had not his hair tied then.</p>
               <p>Mr. G arrow. What part of St. Paul's Church-yard is Mr. Parker's shop in? - About twenty or thirty yards from the corner next Cheapside.</p>
               <p>The cushion that was picked up, was it in the course that the person must have taken in running from that shop towards you, or was it beyond where he had run? - He threw it on one side, I saw him fling it against the rails of the church.</p>
               <p>Was not it found on the Ludgate-hill side of him? - I believe it was found nearer Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>In the course where the prisoner had not run? - He threw it from him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you examine his hand very accurately? - I saw it was bloody.</p>
               <p>Which might have proceeded from the flints? - I cannot tell what it proceeded from.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester, another Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>I am a linguist, I know the prisoner Payne, I lived along with his mother, in Brook-street, Ratcliff, No. 114; and being informed that one Payne a waterman had been upon the river, and concerned in the robbery of these dollars; about the 16th or 17th of October, I saw the prisoner, I went with his mother to him at some house in Goswell-street, and he said he would be glad to go with me to Lynn, in Norfolk.</p>
               <p>Court. For what purpose did you and his mother go to him in Goswell-street? - Only to see him, he then asked me if he could go to Lynn.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you and the mother go to him? - As I was going down to Lynn, she thought I might be a means of keeping him out of the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What passed at Goswell-street? - On the Tuesday or Wednesday evening, we set off in a post-chaise for Lynn, in Norfolk.</p>
               <p>What did you go to Lynn for? - I went about my business, and he went with a thought, as far as I understood, to go into some foreign country or another, because he asked me if there were any Norway ships, or ships for Norway, I told him I believed there were; when we came to Lynn we went to the Rose, we continued there about five or six days, nothing passed during this time than this; I was willing to know whether he had been concerned in this robbery or no; upon this he did tell me that he had, but I could not get any thing further out of him.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him, if he was concerned in the robbery? - Yes, I asked him how they could presume to do things of this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120016"/> kind, being a heavy matter; oh! says he, when we get it into the boat we do not fear, we have always assistance to get it out again; or words to that purport.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you set out from London, how came you to know any thing about the prisoner being to go down to Lynn, or any other place? - Upon the anxiety of the mother I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Was you yourself intending to go to Lynn before? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did the mother know that you so intended? - Yes, four or five days before, the mother seemed very anxious for her son to go with me, and that gave me a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Had you no other conversation with him? - I asked him several times what he had done with the property, he told me he would give me no particular answer; he said, that he wanted to go over to Norway; I questioned him several times, what use he had made of the property, but no reply was given, only that he was concerned in it, and that he had seventeen watches left in the hands of one Woolfe, or something to that purpose, for which he had not paid him, and he damned him for that; and that he had eighty pounds in some man's hands somewhere near Moorfields, and that man had not paid him; I do not know what that eighty pounds was for.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether it was for the watches or the dollars? - No, he asked me what he should pay me, says I, I came down here to serve your mother, I did not come here for the lucre of gain, and he flung down ten guineas, which I took as a present from him, as the money was offered to me, I, like a great many more folks, did take it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. So this man told you the only thing in the world that could hurt himself and take away his life, and nothing else but that one fact? - No.</p>
               <p>Why, it is something very astonishing that he should not tell you what became of the property? - He did not, I asked him several times.</p>
               <p>You did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever read the New Testament? - I have.</p>
               <p>You remember the character of Judas? - I do.</p>

            , I know the prisoner Payne, I saw him on the 7th of October last, about a quarter past four in the morning, I was asleep in the two pair of stairs, my wife was brought to bed the day before, he knocked at the door, the nurse let him in, he came to my bedside, and waked me out of my sleep, he said, I have a hundred and thirty-seven dollars, and fourteen watches, and he asked me to take them if I would be so good, he brought them with him, and said he had some more at home; he went away, and came about nine at night, and sent for me out of the synagogue, and asked me if I would give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120017"/> him the money for them; I told him I had not looked at them; accordingly, in the afternoon, I saw them, and I paid him for the hundred and thirty-seven dollars, but not for the watches: he never told me where he got them, he said he had them, and had some more dollars left behind him as his share.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did you pay for the dollars? - Three shillings and nine-pence a piece; he told me to call at his house about seven in the evening, I went to my own house, and my father-in-law was there to see his daughter, I asked him to go with me to Mr. Payne's house, and he gave me two hundred and forty dollars in two stockings, I gave them to my father-in-law, and told him to take them to his own house till I came for them and fetched them away, then he asked me if his wife should carry them up in the city, accordingly he took two hundred more of his wife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Morgan.

               <p>Mr. Morgan. You need not answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you live with him on the 6th of October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Payne lodge in the same room with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he at home on the 6th of October? - Sir, it was a Wednesday morning in October when he was out, he came home on the Thursday morning, between five and six, I was in bed when he came home, he desired me to get up, and put my clothes on, and go with him as far as Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I am very unwilling to take exceptions, but, upon my word, this is such betraying; she says they are his children: are you married to this man? - No, Sir, I am not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you do together at Limehouse? - He went into a house in Narrow-street, Limehouse, they say it is a brewhouse, and stayed, I believe, a quarter of an hour; he came back, and brought with him a little small bag, and desired me to carry it in my apron.</p>
               <p>Is that the same house you have shewn to Mr. Vyson since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the bag contain that he put into your apron? - I saw it when I was at home, it contained dollars, I cannot tell how many; he went home just before me; it was a very small bag, there might be a hundred or more.</p>
               <p>What became of those dollars afterwards? - I desired they might not remain in my place, and he told me Wolfe was to come for them in the evening, but he did not;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120018"/> he then desired me to carry them to Goodman's-fields, to one Mary Ann, a woman he kept company with, Payne came after me in a short time, Mr. Wolfe came, and an old Jew man, and a Jew boy.</p>
               <p>Is that Moses? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What passed between Wolfe and the prisoner? - I cannot say, I saw the Jew man and Jew boy put something in their pockets, I do not know what it was, I do not know who gave it them, whether it was Payne or not; afterwards Mr. Wolfe gave me his pocket handkerchief, tied up with something, and desired me to take it to Petticoat-lane, he went with me and Payne, I carried it into a court in Petticoat-lane, and they took it from me, and went into a house and shut the door; I went the next morning between five and six, and carried the remainder of the dollars to Mary Ann.</p>

               <p>What happened on the 6th of October?</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. I hope your Lordship will be of opinion, this man is not intitled to give evidence against Jameson, because there is not a tittle of evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. There cannot be any objection to this witness's competency; the question is, how far the Jury will believe him.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not absolutely a rule of law, that accomplices cannot be examined, it is rather a rule of prudence and humanity; but wherever there is any kind of circumstance that gives an air of probability to a story, there it is for the Jury to judge of the credit; now, where the prisoners have been proved to be together in company, previous to the robbery, that is a circumstance which has been left to the Jury, and I think it sufficient in point of law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I beg leave to remind your Lordship, that she has only spoken to Jameson, Cook, and to one Miles; Miles is not here, and with respect to Jameson and Cook, I beg leave to refer to my Lord's notes, there is no evidence against either of them; Miles is not here; if they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120020"/> proved Payne to have been in the house there might have been something in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are some of your Lordships would call him first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. This witness cannot confirm any thing, or corroborate any thing against Jameson, because nothing has been proved against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Take it so, Mr. Scott, but he may be confirmed by and by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. What you say is true, that some of the Judges do take an accomplice first, but unless he is confirmed, it all goes for nothing; the only question I think will be, whether there has been any evidence that applies to any of the prisoners, because the woman's evidence goes to this, that she saw Miles and Jameson at the house; now, wherever you bring home clear evidence to one person of a fact, and you give evidence by witnesses, that that person was in company with another or two, that will be sufficient to let in the evidence of the accomplice, that the other two were present at the time of committing of the robbery, but you must have some fact that applies to this robbery, now there has been no evidence proved against Cook and Jameson as applying to the robbery; the only evidence that has been is against Payne.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. We must first hear this man's story, we are giving evidence against Payne, and your Lordship will take care to distinguish it in your directions to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. Now tell us all you know about this robbery.</p>
               <p>Dolfin. I think it was on the 7th of October, about seven in the evening, we went on board the brig Elbe,

               <p>I am a watchman, on Monday the 20th of December, I was crying five, in Broad-street, and the prosecutor called from a two pair of stairs, do not make any alarm, but go round, there are some thieves in my back yard; I called for Hall to go with me, and went to the back door, and placed him at one of the garden gates, so I went round to the other back gate of Mr. Hicks's, and there I met two of them coming out: the back gate I went to is in a court or alley, I do not know the name of it, and when I came round, the prisoner at the bar and another man rushed out of the gate, I cannot say who the other man was; the gate leads from Mr. Whiting's premises, and I cried out to Hall, here are the thieves, with that the tall one made a shove, and I had liked to have knocked him down, he was in the corner, and I knocked the prisoner down, and as he was laying upon his back, thought I, I will have one of you, I was lifting my stick at the other man, and he fired a pistol at me, I heard the ball whistle past my ear, then they both run away to the top of Butcher-row, I cried stop thief, and fell down, and the other man that was along with the prisoner, turned and ran back, he ran by me when I tumbled down, and ran up Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Not towards the prosecutor's house? - No; they then said they had got the prisoner, then I came up to him, and the man said he had got a pistol, I searched him, and took this pistol primed and loaded out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man that you first knocked down? - Yes, I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>When he was taken, was his dress the same? - Yes; I knew him before, I have seen him come home all hours in the night, and come close by my box: I found this pistol upon the prisoner, and Hall took up a crow that he threw out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no thorough-fare there but that leading to Harriett's garden and the prosecutor's? - No other. This is the loading of the pistol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. Where did you see the man that you suspected came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120025"/> from the prosecutor's first? - This man rushed out of Mr. Hicks's garden, the gardens join, it was not upon Mr. Whiting's premises.</p>
               <p>Were not other people looking about besides you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew the prisoner before? - Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at first? - I knew him as soon as I had him down, I had my lanthorn in my hand.</p>
               <p>After he got up, did he tell you who he was? - I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Did you call him by his name? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - I only took the pistol out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else in his pocket? - I did not look for any thing more after I took the pistol out.</p>

               <p>Do you know or not know, that none of the property was found upon him? - Nothing but the pistol.</p>
               <p>Was this the same man that you knocked down first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark upon him? - I knocked him down once, and he did not get up, then I made another blow to keep him down.</p>
               <p>Yet you say there was no mark upon him when he was taken? - How could there be?</p>
               <p>There was not, was there? answer the question. - Not that I know of, for he warded off the blow with his crow.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to stop and be searched? - He offered it at the Justices.</p>
               <p>He had been in your custody from the time he was taken to the watchouse? - Yes.</p>

Hall! here are the thieves; before I got to the corner I heard one pistol go off, I run by the alley, and by the garden gate I picked up this crow, as they run I suppose it dropped from out of their hands; I met the other watchman, and we went towards the street, and in the street we met another watchman, who called stop thief! his name was Hamwood, and he said, I have shied my stick at him, and he is gone on; and in about a minute they came up with the prisoner Bruce, and the man had him fast in his arms, Harris put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a pistol that was loaded and primed.</p>

               <p>I live at the orchard, Ratcliff-cross, I know the prosecutor, and I know the prisoner vastly well too; on the Sunday before the robbery I saw him at the prosecutor's shutters, he had his hand at them, as a person might do to see whether they might do or not, after I had gone down to the cross, and gone down the Butcher-row, he was standing there then, but he had not his hand on the shutters then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This alley which the watchman swears to near my house, is a very dark bye alley, but it occasioned me to go through very often on my business, the walls are very high on each side, and very narrow; there is one Mr. Brodie I believe was in company with this last witness coming from meeting, and he knows me very well, and he was coming by.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to the last witness. Was Brodie with you? - He was, I saw the prisoner, but he did not see me, I mentioned it immediately to Mr. Hyde where I lodged, Brodie has said nothing to me respecting him, I am quite positive that I saw him.</p>
               <p>What are you pray? - I am a baker, I had been at meeting with Brodie.</p>

               <p>Did you know him immediately? - I did, my watch was never found again, there was a watch found at Islington the next day, but it did not prove to be mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Mr. Cook, you did not know this young man before the time you was stopped, I take it for granted? - No.</p>
               <p>Did I understand you right, that he followed the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he come up the near side? - No, the off side, Mrs. Cook's side.</p>
               <p>He was not a minute? - No.</p>
               <p>He used expressions that very much alarmed you, for Mrs. Cook if not for yourself? - I was not alarmed, it is not the first time I have been robbed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Describe how the handkerchief was put on his face? - In this manner under the nose.</p>
               <p>You spoke as differently before you put on the handkerchief, as you do from me, so that it would seem, having heard a man's voice once through the handkerchief, you would not venture to swear to it? - I heard him speak the second time, without the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when you saw him in Clerkenwell? - I was sensible he was the person, but when he robbed me his coat was buttoned up to the top, I asked for a Mr. Brown, he very politely got up, and said his name was Brown; he said, he had no other handkerchief but this, but he had another on when he robbed me, which was afterwards smothered, and was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Was you sure of him the first time, when you saw him at Clerkenwell? - I was more sure of him the second time, when I saw him as he robbed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120028"/>When you saw him the second time, had you any doubt about him? - I might have some little doubt.</p>
               <p>Had you, Sir? - I had.</p>
               <p>Was that doubt removed when you came before the Magistrate? - It was.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand you that when you was first before the Magistrate, you was as positive that Brown was the person that robbed you, as you are now? - I was, but Mrs. Cook, after this, said to me, my dear Jem, I shall never be happy if you swear to the man.</p>
               <p>My question to you is, whether before the Magistrate you swore with positiveness and certainty, that he was the man the first time? - I did not swear at all concerning it, I was affraid to swear at that time, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>How do you mean you did not swear, you was sworn to your examination? - Then I swore he was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you before the Magistrate, immediately say he was the man that robbed you? - I did, I knew him to be the man then.</p>
               <p>Did you say it then? - I did say then, that he was the man, I knew he was the man all the way through.</p>
               <p>I must be very particular, and you will excuse me if I am so, I wish to treat you as I would every other gentleman in the situation of a witness, did you before the Magistrate, when you first saw this man, positively swear he was the man that robbed you? - I acquainted the Justice that I verily believed he was the man, I was sure when I saw the handkerchief, and saw him buttoned up, I said, I had every reason to believe he was the man.</p>
               <p>Was not he dressed on purpose that you might believe he was the man? - I know his dress well.</p>
               <p>I ask you a plain question, and I shall begin to alter my opinion of you, if you answer me in this manner; was not this man dressed for the purpose of your being able to identify him? - He was.</p>
               <p>Was not that in consequence of your doubts about him? - He appeared very differently, I had a desire to see him as he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Then before you saw him in that dress, you had not positively sworn to him? - I said before the Justice, that I verily believed he was the man.</p>


               <p>Upon your oath, before he was dressed with his great coat buttoned up, and his handkerchief before his face, did you positively swear he was the man? - I still say, that I acquainted the Justice that I verily believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. But before he was dressed, did you tell the Justice whether he was the man or not? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I told him he was the man that robbed me, and afterwards I knew him well, exceedingly well; I am sorry to say it, he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say,</p>
               <p>"and afterwards you was sure of it," was not he dressed because you had some doubt about swearing to him? - I begged it as a favour that his coat might be buttoned.</p>
               <p>Did you beg that on account of some hesitation? - No.</p>
               <p>For what reason then? - I had no doubt about it, I only wanted to see him in the situation he was in when he robbed me, that was my whole reason.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, whether previous to your having desired that he might be so clothed, you had positively charged him to the Magistrate to be the man? - I had in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Had you to the Magistrate? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>How long had the man been out of sight who had robbed you? - There was not four minutes between the robbery and their setting off, it was an hour and a quarter before I heard any thing more, I am not positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>What sort of an evening was it? - A very fine one.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had met the prisoner in a different dress in any part of the town, and in different coloured clothes, should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120029"/> you have known him? - Upon my word, I do not think I should.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the post-boy that drove Mr. Cook; I pursued after the person that committed the robbery, about three or four minutes I drove down the hill, and a man came out of one of the houses and joined me, I took one of the chaise horses.</p>
               <p>How soon did you get sight of the man you was in pursuit of? - I cannot say, I did not get sight of him till I came near Holloway turnpike, that is between three and four miles from the place where the robbery was committed, after we got sight of the person, the gentleman that was with me rode up close to him at Holloway turnpike.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you first got sight of him, that you came up with him? - Four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>I suppose you rode pretty hard from Crouch-end? - Yes, we galloped all the way.</p>
               <p>Was the man on a gallop? - Yes, I did not speak to him till he was taken, I saw the gentleman ride up close to him, but I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>How far might you be behind? - Two hundred yards, when I came up he was dismounted, and in the sign of the Fox through Holloway, at Islington, then the gentleman asked me if that was the man, I said yes, I knew him immediately when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay with your chaise? - No longer than he had the money and the watch, he followed the chaise, he was dressed in a Bath great-coat buttoned, and a white handkerchief over his face, as high as his nose.</p>
               <p>You sitting on your horse, and he at the chaise with his face half covered, could you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what did you know him? - I knew him by his coat, and hat, and horse, it was a brown bay horse, with a swish tail.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him in a different dress and without his horse, should you have known him? - Yes, I should have known him by his voice.</p>
               <p>When a man's mouth is covered, is his voice the same as if it is not? - Yes, it appeared so to me.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole are you quite sure he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you sure of him when you first saw him at the Fox? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you always said so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The person that robbed your master came up suddenly? - Yes, on the off side.</p>
               <p>There was a part of the carriage between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he turn his horse round, or come up? - He came up, his horse's head was the same way as mine, as soon as he robbed my master, I stood up in my stirrups and looked over, and he was off his horse.</p>
               <p>Court. What was he doing? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not take much notice, you pursued him in less than three minutes, when did you see the swish tail? - Whilst he was robbing the chaise.</p>
               <p>That is pretty well sworn I think, how many turnings are there between Crouch-end and Holloway-turnpike? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>There are a great many, I think I can enumerate seven or eight, was there any watch found upon him, when he was taken? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went in pursuit of of this man between two and three miles, I was twenty yards from Holloway-turnpike.</p>
               <p>When you got sight of that man how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120030"/> came you to take particular notice of him? - I was at Crouch-end, at one Mr. Wright's, Mr. Cook and his Lady came down there in a post-chaise, and he stopped the chaise and said, he was robbed of his watch and seven guineas; he said, he might be easily taken, I said, I had my horse in the stable.</p>
               <p>Court. But how came you to take notice of that man when you had never seen him before? - Mr. Cook said he had a light coloured great coat on, and a swished tailed horses.</p>
               <p>What pace was he riding when you first saw him? - He was a gentle pace just going through the turnpike, I came on smart, and came up to him about twenty yards this side the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Did he quicken his pace at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you rode pretty hard from Crouch-end? - Yes, as hard as I could.</p>
               <p>Was you pretty well mounted? - Yes; when I came up to him, I said it is very cold Sir, yes says he it is, he then mended his pace, and rode on a very gentle canter, I then asked him why he rode so hard, and he made answer and said, it was very cold, he then mended his pace faster and faster, till he rode as fast as he could, I wished for that Post-boy to come on, and the prisoner mended his pace as fast as he could and I as fast as I could, going up the rise of the hill, I cried out this is a highwayman, stop him, he went on, and I cried out stop him as loud as I could, he rode over a man and knocked him down on the long side of a waggon, he then came a little on this side of Islington Church, and then whether his horse slipt, or whether he fell, I cannot tell which, I was about nine or ten yards from him, I desired the people to hold him a minute while I fetched the post-boy, that he might be right in the person, the post-boy came up directly, and said that is the man; the prisoner was then on foot, the horse run away a little way, the horse was stopped, and put up at the Pyed Bull in Islington, it is now in the yard.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this when you came up with him at Holloway turnpike? - I take it, when Mr. Cook came to Mr. Wright's, it was twenty minutes past four, it was not five; when I came up to him it could not be above forty minutes after four, nor that; it was beginning to grow dusk, but it was lightish.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing particular when you came up along side of him? - I said to myself as I went along, how am I to know this man, and I recollected Mr. Cook said what was the colour of his coat, and about his horse's tail.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular about him or his horse? - He had a great coat, and a horse with a swish tail, it appeared to me to be a slender horse, a kind of blood horse in poorish condition.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether he was or was not dirty? - I cannot say that I took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Did the horse appear very hot? - No, he did not appear to be very hot, he did not seem to sweat when I first came up to him; he was hot when he was stopped.</p>
               <p>What condition was your horse in? - In good riding order.</p>
               <p>Was your horse hot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The post-horse was blown so he could not keep up with you? - He was pretty hot.</p>

               <p>What account did he give of himself? - Mr. Blackborough asked him how he came on that road at that time; he said he had been out as he usually did, for his own diversion and pleasure, and that he took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120031"/> pistol with him as a defence, having several times been attacked by footpads; when I took the pistol out of the prisoner's pocket, I asked him if it was loaded, and he said it was, but I found it was not.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 24th, the prisoner came down Shoemaker-row, with this cask on his shoulders, and I stopped him on suspicion of its being stolen; there were four more sailors like himself with him. I took the barrel off his shoulders, then they began to sight, and four of them got away; the prisoner run, and I run after him.</p>
               <p>Who was with you? - The patrol, about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>How came the patrol to be with you at that time? - The day before Christmas Day they came down to receive their money at that time; he had the cask on his shoulders, I took it in my arms, and put it down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Did he ever get out of your sight? - Never, I ran after him all the way to Gravel-lane; he said the other sailors gave it him to carry, and they paid him for his trouble; when I first stopped him, I asked him how he came by it, and he told me these men employed him to carry it.</p>
               <p>When you first stopped him, before they ran away, what did he say? - I asked him what he had, and he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you, when you first stopped him, that these men had given it him to carry? - He never spoke a word when I first took him, but, what is that to you? and they began to fight; I am sure he never was out of my sight, I stopped him just before my door, the cask was carried to my house, and kept there ever since; this is the cask, with some marks burnt in.</p>
               <p>Court to Righton. Look at the cask? - My Lord, I do not know it, if I saw it.</p>
               <p>You had landed this cask? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are there any more houses in Spring Gardens from which a person could come in the direction you saw Johnson? - There are other houses, there might be such a thing.</p>
               <p>Then that which you swore just now, was not quite right, that there was no other houses from which he might be coming? - There were houses on that side of the way.</p>
               <p>Now a little about the cart and horse, you keep a jocky cart? - I sell greens, and do necessary jobs.</p>
               <p>That is just the thing I was enquiring after; you are what they call a running dustman? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the number of this same cart, Mr. Allen? - I have no number.</p>

Tell your story your own way - He said, are you going with us, or is somebody going with us, that is what Norris said to Freeman, and the other said, yes; I looked through the side of the road, the vault is next the road, I saw Norris peeping, as if he was looking after somebody, and I went away into my own place again, and just gave my master a bason of tea on the shop-board as he was at work, and I saw Norris go by with a bag upon his back, full of something, but what it was I cannot pretend to say; I immediately went into the street to a chandler's shop, and heard the house was robbed; I told Mrs. Hennick what I saw, I was at the Justice's, and was sworn there.</p>
               <p>Did you hear young Norris say any thing? - Yes, I did: when I came there he was in custody, and he owned to the robbery.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He owned that this Freeman and Johnson broke the house open.</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing at all. - Norris said they broke this house open with a chissel, that they took the property of Mr. and Mrs. Hennick's, and sold it to a person, somewhere by the Black Horse, one door goes in by Saltpetre-bank, for two guineas and some silver; he said so far as this, that they would give him some money to carry the things for them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship sees this was extorted from him.</p>
               <p>Court. It was not held out to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This man says to the prisoner, if you want to be an evidence, you must swear before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you use any persuasions to induce him? - No, none at all, they wanted both to be evidence before the Justice; Norris made answer immediately -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg pardon, when I consider this man knows as well the tendency of every question your Lordship puts, almost as well as your Lordship: I remember one case, in which the evidence was this, that a person having been apprised that such a one, Thomson by name, had been guilty of a felony, accosted him in the street, you must go along with me, and he added, it will be better for you to tell the whole story; this was a person not authorised to make any promise, this man having no pretence to hold out mercy to him, says in the street, I advise you to make a discovery, and the Court said, that that should not be received in evidence; now, here, see if this is not infinitely stronger, the man in custody of the officers of Justice, is told, if you wish to have any benefit by your declaration, make it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. No, no. You say Norris and Freeman both wanted to be admitted as evidence? - Yes; then Norris said he had a prior right, because he had saved Mrs. Hennick's life, because he said Johnson and Freeman intended to put a handkerchief over Mrs. Hennick's face, and cut her throat, and he would not give his consent to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Joe the Barber present at this conversation? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - He had nothing at all to make him drunk, he had only a pint of beer, I would not let them drink together.</p>
               <p>Did the barber take a drop of drink with him? - No, Sir, the barber, nor any body but themselves.</p>
               <p>What trade are you? - A weaver.</p>
               <p>How long have you attended the Justice's Office? - Six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Are you a constable? - I attend as I do, for a livelyhood, to get a shilling when a job comes in.</p>
               <p>Oh, as a job of blood work comes in? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you are in hopes of being the successor of the barber? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you done a stroke of weaver's work since you have attended that Office? - No, Sir, I have none to do, if I had any thing to do in an honest way, I would do it.</p>
               <p>Court. When Norris said he had a prior right, he did not mention for what? - They began to speak so fast, one against the other; they were committed for further examination.</p>

               <p>Whereabout did this tick stand? - It stands upon the bench, and would be inside if the glass was in, but the glass is out.</p>

               <p>I am clerk of the parish, on Sunday the 14th of November, I perceived part of the porch was stripped of two sheets of lead; I came down and acquainted the church-warden, and about the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards, we heard a man was taken with lead, I went and saw the lead that was taken, it was cut to pieces, it was at the sign of the Squirrel, in Wingfield Plain, eleven miles from our place.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was the lead belonging to the church? - It was the same I have seen I suppose hundreds of times, and I have a piece which I found under the porch, and another piece where it was fastened to, that fits; I have swore to it.</p>
               <p>Yes, but we must know why? - Because from the nature of the lead, and it fits so exactly the fastenings, these are what I found in Wingfield Plain; these two ends, one I picked up under the porch, and the other I took from the top of the porch, and they fit the nail holes of the lead which I found on Wingfield Plain.</p>
               <p>(The lead handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me not to fit.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Chapman came to swear to his name, he denied it, and said he would not swear to it at first.</p>
               <p>Chapman. I said they were such marks as I remembered making.</p>
               <p>Did you remember these marks when you first saw the lead? - I supposed them to be the marks at the time, I do not swear to them now, I speak the truth to the best of my knowledge; I have no doubt about it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120051"/> I said I did not know, but it might be possible for any other mark to be made, I remember perfectly making the marks.</p>

               <p>When was it loaded in your cart? - I do not know; I met a couple of men, who stopped the horse and cart, they said they should not go after the gentleman, they had got me and that was sufficient; I told them where I lived.</p>
               <p>Court to Strike.

               <p>Prisoner. How can you have the face to say that? I said I was going to sell the lead; you never asked me; Mr. Strike and Mr. Milton behaved like gentlemen, I resolved them every question.</p>
               <p>Court to Milton. What did he say to you? - I was not much in his company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a countryman, I have nobody here but a wife and two poor children, that came to me in the prison.</p>

               <p>I perceived the prisoner, Hosier, frequently went out of my premises loaded with iron, I am a ship-builder, she is repairing upon my premises, and I saw the prisoner, Hosier, coming out of the ship Hope, on the 5th of January, loaded; I called one of my foremen to take notice of it; we found a considerable quantity of nails, packed up in a compact manner for stowage, I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120052"/> sent for the officers, I asked the prisoner where he generally sold these nails, and he told me -</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Council for Prisoner Hinde. Do not mention any person's name? - I came here to do my country justice, not out of rancour; our neighbourhood abounds with these people, and I know, that from four yards, we lose at least five thousand a year, from Blackwall yard and three more in our neighbourhood; I recommended the boy all I could to let me know who it was that bought the things of them, and when the officers came, I told them to be aware that I did not give them charge of the prisoner, for the boy before they came had confessed where he sold the goods from time to time; when the officers came, I thought it was better to put a private mark on the property, and permit him to pursue the same channel to sell them as before; they were not my property; he was followed by two people to the shop, that is all I can swear to, to my own knowledge; I attended at the Magistrate's, and we had a search-warrant in consequence of my oath, I presume I may say, and they brought some of the property back to me that was marked, and a considerable quantity of nails. I do not mean to say a single word to aggravate, but we really are so over-run. I one night could have taken two thieves, but I could not get a man to help me. I took the property.</p>
               <p>Court. I am sorry for it, but I am afraid it will not do. You certainly acted very commendably in what you did: it is certainly a very bad thing there should be so many people guilty of this practice of receiving stolen goods, but it can only be put a stop to by legal means; and I am afraid, in point of law, the receiver, who is the only person that is principally wanted to be come at in this case, cannot be come at. As to the <rs id="t17850112-43-deflabel223" type="occupation">boy</rs>

            , my house was broke open on Saturday evening the 1st of January, between five and six, it was dark, I was sitting in the back parlour adjoining to the shop; I heard the window break, and run immediately out of the parlour into the shop, and saw the goods going out of the window, I run from thence to the door.</p>
               <p>Was that pane whole before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the shop door fast? - No, it was on the latch, when I run to the door, I found it tied with a string or cord, I gave a sharp twitch and broke it, and run out and down the corner, I did not perceive any body there directly; I returned immediately to take the goods out of the window, and in a very short time, the person that stands at the bar was brought in with the goods.</p>

               <p>Could you observe whether there were not several persons there before you came to the spot? - I was intercepted by those men, there was no mob at all.</p>
               <p>Were there not several persons on that spot before that time? - There was no croud I am positive.</p>
               <p>But there were several persons? - Not so much as to hinder my going along.</p>

               <p>Did you observe there was a centinel? - I did, I went close by him when I came out, but at the time I lost my watch, I do not know where he was.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch go when it went from you? - No.</p>
               <p>You said just now, you was kicked by somebody who was his comrade? - They were the same people that surrounded me, they followed me out.</p>
               <p>Court.

               <p>Mr. James. I submit to your Lordship there is no evidence against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr. James. Then I submit there is no evidence to support this indictment, this is an indictment for a highway robbery, and it is of the essence of that crime, that it must be done forcibly and violently, either an actual violent assault and taking of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120055"/> property, or else an open plain direct taking of the property; had this been an indictment for stealing privately from the person, it might have been relevant, but here is no proof of force, nor of open direct taking the property; but that there was an attack in a croud, where it was natural there should be a pushing.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is for the Jury to consider, with what view he made that push at him, which Chiswick swears to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am quite innocent.</p>

Gentlemen, it was some years ago found necessary, in order to protect the mercantile part of the country, to make it a capital offence to steal from the Post-office any letter or pacquet which came there by the post; the offence with which the prisoner stands charged, is that of having stolen a letter, and which letter happened to contain in it a share of a lottery ticket, which was the principal medium whereby this letter was traced. It will be proved to you, that on the 8th of March last, a Mr.

Mr. Child not having received any answer from his correspondents, and conceiving this to be a matter of some consequence, furnished them with a description of what was contained in the letter; the consequence was, they went to the lottery-office of Messrs. Hazard and Co. apprehending that perhaps this lottery ticket might be the means of tracing this matter, and they there found, that the half ticket had been paid, but the quarter had not. Gentlemen, on the 29th of November last, this quarter of a ticket was presented to Hazard and Co. and a claim made for it, it having been drawn a prize of twenty pounds; Hazard and Co. having before been cautioned, demurred against the payment, and desired the person who brought it, who will turn out afterwards, if my instructions are right, to be the prisoner at the bar, to come the next day: he went away complaining, as is usual, that they did not pay him his money, but on the next day he did not come back. In the course of their conversation with him, they asked him his name; his answer was, that his name was Clark, and he said he had received it of a person of the name of

This information was not communicated to the Post-office as it should have been, but Mr. Hazard's people mentioning it to Wroughton, who is the letter carrier of that district, on describing the person, it occurred to Wroughton that it must be the prisoner who presented this quarter of a ticket: and upon its being mentioned to the prisoner himself on Friday the 3d of December, the prisoner said it could not possibly be him, for he had not been at Hazard's office for two years preceding; it was then recommended to him to go and state that circumstance to them; and it ought to be stated to you, for I am Council neither for one side or the other, but Council for the truth of the fact, it ought to be stated, I say, that the man did go, and Mr. Burne instantly recognized the prisoner's person, and insisted on it, that was the person that stiled himself Clark, and said he had the quarter from a person of the name of

             of Southwold in Cornwall: this matter then came to the ears of the Secretary and the Comptroller of the Post-office, and they sent for the prisoner, the younger Mr. Burne, and Mr. Brooks, another partner; and they continuing in their assurances that the prisoner was the man, their attention became more attracted, and comparing every thing together, they had the prisoner at the bar apprehended, and it has been thought necessary to prosecute him. The manner in which this sort of fraud is usually committed is this; at the Post-office there are fourteen or fifteen departments, subordinate to which there are fifteen different letter-carriers; mistakes being often<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120059"/> made in sorting the letters, the letter-carriers go again to the resorting, and that makes them so accurate as they are, you will easily suppose that a man very seldom or never secrets a letter within his own walk, because the suspicion would fall on himself, but letters pass through his hands which are not in his department, and which he ought to lay aside: in this situation the letters are, and you will see how easy it is for a man to get possession of a triple letter, which catches the eye, and particularly the eye of a man accustomed to those sort of letters: Gentlemen, you will see how these circumstances occur, you will understand that this letter was not in the prisoner's walk. These are the outlines of the proof that we have to lay before you, if they are satisfactory, and prove to your minds, that the prisoner is the person that took this letter, you will do the public justice on the one hand, and find him guilty of this offence: but most certainly, on the other hand, it is infinitely better that the public should suffer in ten thousand instances, rather than any individual should suffer in one instance, which is not fairly and justly proved upon him.</p>

               <p>Of course there were more than this one? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>You have no other way of knowing, or of stating, that that is your's but this? - No, it is 28,152, a quarter share of a twenty pound prize.</p>
               <p>Was there any entry in the name of Hazard? - I have a book in the first place, in which when I bought them was entered,</p>
               <p>"Shares bought of Hazard." I know it was a quarter of a share of twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Have you any memorandum made by yourself, and taken from the share itself? - I know it from recollection only.</p>

               <p>Your memorandum only goes to the number? - No more than the number, and that it was purchased of Hazard.</p>
               <p>Now you speak from recollection, your memorandum furnishes you with the number and Hazard's name from recollection? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have no reason to believe that you directed it to the Steel-yard that day at this distance of time, instead of any other of the various ways in which you directed to Holmer and Co.? - No, really, Sir, I have not, it was either St. Thomas's-street, on Thames-street, I cannot say which it was.</p>

               <p>My maiden name was Sterry, I am assistant to the post-master of Neath, I perfectly well remember receiving a letter from that young woman on the 8th of March, I put it into the box at the hour of one, and sent it off, there is a letter bill, and the letter was charged, but I cannot recollect what it was charged; this is my writing, that letter bill accompanies all the letters in the London bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is the postage of a single letter from Neath to London? - It was then four pence.</p>
               <p>It does not appear from your letter bill, how many double, how many treble, and how many single? - No.</p>
               <p>It cannot be traced? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you been long in the department of the assistant of the post-master? - Some years; we frequently make mistakes, we put some double that ought to be treble, and some treble that ought to be double.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state that as a matter clearly within your recollection, that on the 8th of March you received a letter from this young woman? - Yes, I received two, one for London, and the other for Cornwall.</p>
               <p>How many letters do you think you might have received in the course of that week from different persons? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>In the course of a month? - A great many; that was on a Monday the 8th of March.</p>
               <p>Did you receive a letter from her on the Wednesday? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you or not? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did you receive a letter from her on the Friday preceding it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Any other day in the course of that week? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>But these two letters you recollect; do you recollect no other letters on other days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is there so singular in this, Mrs. Gibbon, that should induce you to remember her? - I very seldom take the letters at the door, because I very seldom go to the door, I happened that day to take the letters from this girl, and Mr. Child came soon after, and asked me if I remembered it.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>I am in the inland office, I was there when the bag from Neath arrived after the 8th of March; on the 11th, I cannot tell the exact time I opened the Neath bag, it came sealed and tied, according to the common course of business; the letters it contained were answerable to the bill, this bill was in the bag, which is called the letter bill.</p>
               <p>Did the letters correspond with that bill? - They did, the number of letters corresponded, and the charge was proper, to the best of my judgment, or I should have made a memorandum on the bill; these letters are put down by the side of me, and a messenger takes them to the stamper, and they are taken and sorted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I dare say you, like others, sometimes make a mistake? - I may, probably, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Does not it happen to you sometimes to mischarge letters? - If I make a mistake it is probably in over-charging.</p>
               <p>But we who receive letters can tell you it happens the other way, they are not always over-charged; is not it a practice in the office to have something like a rivalship in charging letters? - There are such things done.</p>
               <p>That proves to a demonstration, that now and then there are mistakes made? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>After you have looked over the letters, they are taken away by some other person? - Yes, by the messengers or stampers.</p>
               <p>How many persons have access to them, and may, if they choose it, look at them? - We are all publickly at the table.</p>
               <p>So that several persons, if they choose it, may resort to the letters as they lay on the table? - It is very uncommon.</p>
               <p>Then they may secret a letter? - I do not think they could.</p>
               <p>You mean not unobserved? - I think it is impossible.</p>
               <p>How many persons are there who might, without suspicion, come and stand there? - It is very uncustomary for people to stand together at the Post-office, they are never suffered to do that, the Comptroller never suffers three or four to stand together.</p>
               <p>No, but he suffers any number to come by turns to the place where you sit? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120063"/> They may come and speak to me no doubt.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Ever since I have been in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Was he on the 11th of March employed in the Post-office? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character? - I always heard he bore a good character.</p>

               <p>Did you do any thing in consequence of that? - I went directly to Mr. Hazard's, and told them the number, and stopped payment; I am not sure whether I went myself or sent my clerk, but one of them was not paid, one was; I went to Mr. Hazard's about the first of April.</p>

               <p>I am Comptroller of the inland department in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Have the different letter-carriers access to the rooms? - They are constantly coming in to the inland office to receive such letters as are sorted to the different seats.</p>
               <p>Describe the process that is used in sorting the letters? - The letters for this town are divided into fifteen divisions, the gentlemen who are appointed sorters, sort the letters to each of these divisions, and to the best of their judgment they sort the letters to the particular walks that appertain to those seats, but it frequently happens, either<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120064"/> through want of knowledge of the street, or knowledge of the business, that they sort a letter that should be for one street into the other, and when that is done, it of course goes in common with other letters to the letter-carrier's office, there they find the mistake, and they are subdivided again to their different quarters, and if there are any mis-sorted letters, they rectify the mistake among themselves, and deliver it over to the letter-carrier who should have care of that letter; the prisoner was in the Post-office, he was one of the letter-carriers at what we call Murrell's seat, and had the charge of course to sort the letters, when they get into the letter-carriers office, for the different divisions of letters in that seat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. I think you say, Sir, sometimes the letters are sorted wrong? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that it would have fallen to this man's lot to sort this letter and send it to Thames-street? - It is impossible for me to say that it fell into this man's hands, in the nature of things it may have come into this man's hands.</p>
               <p>How many letter-carriers are there? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You have known this man some time? - Ever since he has been in the office, thirteen or fourteen years, and till this unhappy affair happened, he had an exceeding good character, and I had always esteemed him as a very honest, upright man.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing that happened after this transaction, that the prisoner was superanuated? - He was, he received eleven shillings a week in consequence of an affair that happened prior to this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. At this time he had access to the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And it might come into this man's hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In common with how many more? - Sixty or seventy.</p>
               <p>To all of whom this letter might as well have come as to him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Can you say that all the letters you received from the Post-office on that day were delivered according to their directions? - If I was on duty they were, but I cannot be sure that I was upon duty; it does not happen once in several months that I am not on duty, but I cannot particularly say I was on my duty on that day, but I think I was: there is a book in which there are some figures of my making that day.</p>
               <p>What do they import? - They were charges from Murrell's seat to us, they import, that I was present at the office that day, and if so, I can say all the letters were delivered according to their directions on that day, to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it appears from your entry, that on that day there were letters to the postage of eight-pence handed over from Murrell's seat to your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are five persons, these charges might have fell into the hands of these five? - They must by the regular couse of business come into my hands.</p>

               <p>Take great care to the answer you make to this question; are you positively sure the prisoner was the man that came to you and offered that share of a ticket to you for payment? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>How many shares was this particular ticket divided into? - One half and two quarters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been in the office? - Upwards of six years.</p>
               <p>How many persons were in the office at this time? - Upon my word I cannot tell, the office was pretty full, ten or a dozen people.</p>
               <p>All of them transacting business relative to the lottery, and most, if not all, strangers: now do you recollect the transactions about which all of them, or any of them came? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Did you tell the person who brought the share the reason why you could not pay it? - I told him there was a stop. He might be in the office about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of him from the Monday to the Friday, and then he came voluntarily to you? - He did, he told us that Mr. Wroughton knew his place of abode, and that he might be found when he was wanted; there were four or five persons belonging to the office at the time, two of them are here.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner was not apprehended till the 6th? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>At that time when he came and said that, did you entertain any doubt whether he was the person that had been there on the Monday before? - Not the least, I told him at that time I was sure he was the person.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time when it was intimated to the prisoner, that there was a suspicion that he had been at Hazard's, I informed him of the report I had heard, I recommended him to go to Mr. Bourne and clear his character, he said he would, very readily; he went directly, and desired me to go Mr. Wroughton, and beg Mr. Wroughton to go with him; Mr. Wroughton is a letter-carrier in the district of Mr. Hazard's office, he was at large afterwards and not apprehended, he was at his own house; he persisted in denying the charge.</p>
               <p>- WROUGHTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the prisoner to Mr. Hazard's, he was very desirous to go, and assured me he was innocent before he went, and upon the way, and there; he went there for the purpose of shewing himself, and that he was not the person they had said he was, and I left him there; I saw him at large afterwards, he came to the office on the Saturday, on Monday he was sent for to the office.</p>
               <p>He was not then under the custody of any constable? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Inform the Court how you came not to give information immediately when the people at Hazard's first informed you of the kind of person that brought this lottery ticket, and you suspected it to be the prisoner? - I did not suspect the man, I only said that the account they gave was something like the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Why did not you give information to the Post-office of what had happened? - That same day I told several persons belonging to to the Office, that such a report had been made; the prisoner was not an officer at the Post-office at that time; I communicated it to several of the letter-carriers.</p>
               <p>Not to Mr. Todd, or any of the principal officers? - No.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him an exceeding good character, one of whom was a West India merchant, and another gentleman to whom the prisoner had brought letters, inclosing bills of exchange and bank notes, all of which came very safe.</p>

               <p>Tell us as particularly as you can remember, what passed? - She brought them, and said she found them on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Do you know what number of them there were? - There were about two hundred.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - She asked me to buy them, I told her they were of no use to me, she pleaded poverty very much, and said she was in great distress, and asked me to give her something for them; I asked her what she asked for them, she told me sixteen shillings or half a guinea, or any thing that I would give her, as she was in great distress; I did not give her any thing for them then, they were left at my house for a day or two, and I called on Mr. Thompson on the Wednesday following, and asked him if he did not sell stamps, he told me yes; I told him that a poor woman had found some on Tower-hill, and had left them with me, and I had them to dispose of, he said he would buy them, if they were not forged and were good; I told him I knew nothing to the contrary, but the woman brought them to me, and I took them to him, and he examined them, and thought them to be good, and he said he would give me one pound ten shillings for them; I left them with him, and he told me to call again in half an hour, as he was busy then, and he would pay me; I called again in about three hours, and he was not at home, I called the next day and he paid me one pound nine shillings for them; he said after examining them one pound nine shillings was as much as he could give for them; I took the money, the woman called and I gave her sixteen shillings for them, I never saw her after till I was taken.</p>
               <p>Was you ever questioned about this afterwards? - No.</p>

               <p>I am one of the marshal-men of the city of London, I had a warrant granted by the Lord Mayor; Seabrook and I went to the house of Mr. Thompson, we searched the house, and finding these stamps which are sealed up in this paper, I took Mr. Thompson into custody, and carried him to Woodstreet Compter, these are the stamps, one hundred and fifty-three, they have been sealed up ever since; upon the information of Mr. Thompson's wife, we went to Clerkenwell, and took up Mr. Glover, and brought him to Mr. Thompson's house.</p>
               <p>Did Thompson, when he was taken up, charge Glover with any thing? - He did, he said he had them of Mr. Glover, while they went to find the prisoner, then we took Glover and the woman at the bar to the Compter together; then we went away, and about half after seven in the evening, Mr. Seabrook and me went to Wood-street Compter, and asked the prisoner for the key of her room, we searched her and could not find no key; we went afterwards and broke the door open, Seabrook with a stick pushed the straw on which the woman lay about, and found three or four parcels of these stamps amongst the straw; and Mr. Seabrook found this engine, and close by it a fly; and out of that same room, there was a door that went into the cellar, which was concealed by a grate, and there we found this press, with this screw, and a fly; this was found in the cellar, which was dug out of the solid ground. Here is a model of the press. Looking about we found more stamps where the straw was.</p>

               <p>I am a messenger to the Stamp-office; on the 2d of December, the Commissioners of the Stamp-office received information that Thompson sold counterfeit stamps, and they sent me to buy some, with Mr. Major the engraver, and Mr. Robinson; I asked for three two-penny, and two fourpenny stamps, he had only one four-penny, I took that and the three two-penny, these are the stamps; the engraver inspected them and found the two-penny stamps to be counterfeited, I and the officer went to Thompson's, we found him at home, Parrott immediately took him prisoner; afterwards we searched the book which his servant gave me those stamps out of, we found two in the book, we begged if he had any more he would deliver them up to us, and save us the trouble of searching the house; he fetched out of the bureau in a little room adjoining the shop, about a hundred and fifty two-penny stamps, which were found to be counterfeits; afterwards the constable took him to Wood-street Compter; I told him if he could tell who he had them from, it would free him from any harm; he said his apprentice should go and shew us where Glover lived, who was the person he bought them of; we searched and could find nothing more, when Parrott the constable returned from Wood-street Compter, we went immediately after Glover, with his apprentice, we found him at home in Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell; we took him to Mr. Thompson's, and after he came there, he said, he thought he could inform us where the person lived, that he bought them of; I asked him if he knew her name, and he said he did not, she told him at the time of buying them, that she lived in White-horse-alley, Clerkenwell; at the same time Mr. Glover's wife came in, and she said she would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120070"/> with me all night, but she would find the person that her husband bought them of; we went to this White-horse-alley, and enquired for a person that scoured saucepans, that was the way Mrs. Glover said, she thought she might find her, and a woman said, she thought she had been gone from there some days, but a little girl came and said, I will go and shew you where the person lives, it is the person that sells stamps; we went with the child to the place where she lodged, and going up stairs the people informed us, she was gone away from there, I told Mrs. Glover to go into the ground-floor, and enquire of the landlord, whether the person was gone from there, and where she was gone to, and if she saw the prisoner, to say that was the person, and I would take her; On opening the door, the prisoner set facing the door suckling a child, and making some silk laces; I told her she must go with me, Mrs. Glover told me she was the person, the prisoner asked me for what, I told her for selling the stamps that were counterfeits; she said she knew nothing of it, when I brought her out I made her lock the door, and put the key in her pocket; and we brought her to Mr. Thompson's shop, in St. John's-street, to Mr. Glover, and they were both taken to Wood-street Compter; then I went to the Temple to Mr. Robinson's chambers, and told him the whole affair, and that I had reason to suspect by what I saw in the room, there was something in the room that should not be there; I went back with the constable, we went first to the prisoner for the key, but she denied having it; we then went back to the room, and found the door locked, but the key was not in the place where the prisoner said she had put it; we broke the door open and searched about, there was a great chest of tools, but no stamps, but among some straw which was the prisoner's bed, I found several parcels in brown paper, which are what I gave to Parrott; after that I looked under the foot of the bed, and there I found the iron engine; in searching under the dresser and in the closets, I found a number of stamps wrapped up in a petticoat, I gave the whole to the constable; afterwards we moved a grate from a trap door, that was in the room where there was a cellar, a coal hole kind of a place, and on moving some hampers, under those hampers I found that model of the engine; we brought the things to the Mansion-house the next day; I went with Mr. Clarke one of Sir

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Coachman, be so good as to take this along with you, that in all that I am asking you, you must state what you know of your own knowledge and observation, and not what other people have told you; how long were the people that you suppose robbed your master and mistress, with the carriage? - Not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Were there three persons or two? - Two only.</p>
               <p>Were they both disguised? - Yes.</p>


               <p>What sort of handkerchiefs, and what colour? - One was a speckled handkerchief, and the other a black one.</p>
               <p>Have you always said it was a black one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never said it was brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said you did not know whether it was either black or brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say that to Stubbs? - No.</p>
               <p>I will repeat that question once more, have you ever said, you did not know whether it was black or brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Which side did your master sit on? - The left hand side, the near side on the back seat of the coach.</p>
               <p>Which side was the highwayman on? - On the near side, my master fell out of the coach, and hallooed out for a gun, he went to step upon a rail, and he tumbled down, I kept looking round all the time.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that you saw any living creature give a purse to this man? - Yes, I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Have you always been in that story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many conversations have you had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120072"/> with your master and mistress about this robbery? - None at all, only speaking to them, not to ask my master or mistress, or their saying any thing to me about it.</p>
               <p>But you have talked to them about the robbery? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>I believe they are of the description of people called quakers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They do not choose to swear about it, but they told you what they knew about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now is not your memory very much assisted by the story they have told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you believe what they told you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I thought you did; I suppose your mistress told you she gave her purse, did not she? - I saw her.</p>
               <p>Has not your mistress told you so? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that she never told you so? - She never told me she had a purse.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did she never tell you she gave her purse? - I never spoke to my mistress that night.</p>
               <p>That will not do coachee, I am not quite so young as that neither, has she told you she lost a purse that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I thought so; when did you first say you saw your mistress give the man her purse? - I said, I saw her give him a purse.</p>
               <p>Did you say it till you heard your mistress would not swear it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you said it before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever mentioned it to any human being that you ever saw the purse delivered till you knew she would not swear it? - To my master.</p>
               <p>Describe a little with your own handkerchief, how much of the man's face was covered? - So much.</p>
               <p>Do not you know him by his voice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I thought you did, that is right, you have heard him speak when he had not his mouth covered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that the voice was the same? - I swear that was the man.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, this, do you mean to swear that the voice of the man that was covered with the handkerchief, was the same voice you afterwards heard? - He could not speak so plain then.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot swear to his voice? - I can swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Now having sworn to his voice, you abandon that; he had a round hat and a great coat muffled up? - No, the coat was not buttoned.</p>
               <p>But he had a round hat? - Yes, a very little flapped, turned up on the sides.</p>
               <p>It was a round hat, and his face covered so high with a handkerchief? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>I wish you would follow the example of your master and mistress, and not swear upon such subjects; do you mean to swear to the identity of such a person, whom you never saw before, whom you did not know; was you always as sure of him? - Yes, since I saw this man.</p>
               <p>Did you swear positively to him the first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he had not a handkerchief put on at first, he had not a handkerchief put on at Covent Garden? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where then? - Why never, at no place.</p>
               <p>Did you never see this man in custody with a handkerchief on his face, any part of his face? - No, the handkerchief was not put on.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? - I never saw his face with a handkerchief on, before any Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Where did your master sit? - My master sat on the near side, with his back to the horses.</p>
               <p>How was it that you know who gave the purses? - I saw my young master's hand give him the watch and purse too.</p>
               <p>You saw his coat? - I saw his coat, and some part of his hand, and likewise I saw my mistress's ring on her finger.</p>
               <p>Was you never at the public office in Bow-street, when this man refused to have the handkerchief put about him? - I was not there then.</p>
               <p>Whose purse was it that was given out? - I saw my mistress's purse given out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120073"/>What colour was it? - A blue, a kind of sky blue.</p>
               <p>Did you know that purse before? - Yes, there were some trinkets of gold about it, or it was gilded a little.</p>
               <p>Will you swear to the gilding of the said quaker purse? - It looked like gold.</p>
               <p>What coloured purse was young master's? - Green.</p>
               <p>Have you the confidence to state that you should know either of those: purses again? - I have seen it upon the table, and I have carried it to him into the other room.</p>
               <p>It was a common green purse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Hurt was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Hurt was searched? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of watch was it you saw given? - It seemed to be a worked watch.</p>
               <p>What sort of case had it? - I do not know, I have heard say it was metal, I never had it in my hand, I knew it was my mistress's watch by the case, it is a worked watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you see that as you set on your horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know what money was in the purse? - No.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Walker, I was very near the carriage with a dung cart and two horses, I was about thirty yards off, and I saw Mr. Walker's coach stopped, and that man at the coach window, put his hand into the coach window, and then into the Lady's left hand pocket twice; and understanding they were robbing the carriage, I unharnessed a horse and rode after them, they were about two minutes with the carriage, there was another man with the prisoner, but he was at a little distance with the footman, he made him dismount his horse; I do not know what he took from the coach, I rode after him as fast as I could, I did not get sight of him till rather better than a mile, or thereabouts; I kept in sight for forty or fifty yards together, and then by the turn of the hedges I was out of sight again; I got sight of both the men, they kept the road to Tottenham High-cross, and kept up a lane that goes to Mount-pleasant; they came back again the same lane into the road, I cannot tell why, but I imagine they could not get through; they went full speed as fast as they could into Tottenham town; when they came to some trees called the seven sisters, they turned to the left hand, and a gentleman desired me to go back, and up the next lane, accordingly I did and gave them the meeting in the road to the mill; the one went over the bridge and through a toll gate, this man could not get through, and he turned upon me again, and said, if I offered to stop him, or molest him, he would shoot me dead in a minute; I told him I did not want to stop or molest him, for I expected my death; and he said damn you, for what did you cry stop thief! because I alarmed the town, and cried stop thief all the way I rode; my horse at that time making a blunder in the water, and pitching his nose in the water, and I having no saddle was almost off, and at that time he rode by me into some closes, where he was apprehended and taken by some men that were out after him.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that was taken? - That is the man in the red waistcoat that was taken; they tell us his name was Hurt, I am sure it is the man, his face was only covered up to his mouth.</p>
               <p>Can you, at the distance of thirty yards, take upon yourself to swear to the face of a man that was partly covered? - I am sure it is the man, I was not quite thirty yards off, I speak at the farthest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of hat had he? I cannot tell that upon my word, if I die for it, I do not know.</p>
               <p>But you know very well what sort of face he had? - Yes, his face was covered with a black handkerchief, either crape or black.</p>
               <p>How far was your cart? - My cart was about thirty yards off in a lane, it was just directly anent the carriage, the man put his hand to the carriage window, how far it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120074"/> went I do not know; I did not see what he took away, I saw him take his hand away; I was on the near side the carriage, the same side he was.</p>
               <p>Then his back was towards you? - yes.</p>
               <p>The persons whom you supposed stopped the carriage, went above a mile before you got sight of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many more turnings are there in the course of the road before you overtook this man? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>A good many lanes and bye-ways I believe? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Was you present when this young man was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was searched? - I was, I saw nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Were there any watches found upon him? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of any? - I did not.</p>

After the prisoner Hurt was taken, I went down and saw the mare at the Bull at Tottenham, the hostler shewed her to me.</p>
               <p>Is any body here that was present at that time? - I believe Williams was.</p>
               <p>Was that your mare? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Williams. The mare that the last witness looked at, at the Bull, was the mare that the highwayman had, I was at the taking of it, and I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court to Acksin. What horse did this man ride? - The horse that this man rode was a bright bay, with a star in his forehead, I saw him again at Tottenham; it was a mare, it was the same mare, I am clear in that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you always clear that that was the mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you always say so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any conversation with Stubbs on Tuesday or Wednesday last at Clerkenwell? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation about the mare? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any about the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Stubbs that you could not swear to the mare or the man either? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor any thing like it? - No.</p>
               <p>Dale. I have heard the coachman say that he could not swear to the mare.</p>
               <p>Acksin. I can swear to the mare.</p>

               <p>Court. What do you know about this fact? - I know nothing concerning the fact any more than you do.</p>
               <p>Did you hire a mare of the prisoner Kenton? - No, Sir, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Were you bound over as a witness for the prosecution? - I told the Justice that I could say nothing about it, I was a mere stranger to any thing of the kind; Mr. Dale came to me and asked me if I hired a horse, I told him I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Hurt? - I know the prisoner Hurt, because he was brought up in our neighbourhood, but I know nothing of this fact.</p>
               <p>When was you first questioned about this? - I think it was the Wednesday morning last, I met Mr. Dale close by my own door, I live in Finsbury, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Was you ever taken up on this account yourself? - No, Sir, one of Sir Sampson Wright's men came down to me, and acquainted me of it, and desired I would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120076"/> to the office with him, which I did; I never hired a horse of Mr. Dale but once, and that was to go in a cart to fetch some wood from Deptford.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was it that Acksin said about swearing to Hurt? - I was at the Crown, at Clerkenwell-green, we went to drink, and the coachman was in company, he was talking in what manner he was robbed, he said the highwayman had a handkerchief upon his face, as high as this; (up to the nose) I had at that time a handkerchief round my own neck, and he said it was the colour of your's, but whether black, or brown, or not, he was not positive; he said he had swore to the man, but as to the handkerchief, he could not say.</p>

            ; I saw him give out a watch and purse.</p>
               <p>A metal watch? - I cannot say what sort; I never had in my hand.</p>
               <p>What did you see? - I saw it was not gold, I saw it was a metal watch.</p>
               <p>Could you discern it was a metal watch? - It seemed to me to be a metal watch.</p>
               <p>Court. What colour was it? - Almost the colour of gold.</p>
               <p>It had the appearance of a metal watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have said, you saw a watch come out of your young master's pocket? - I saw it given out of his hand, not out of his pocket; I saw my young master put his left-hand out of the coach door, I saw some little more, some little part of his coat.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was his hand, and not Mr. Collison's? - Mr. Collison was not in the coach, Mr. Collison fell out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was your young master's watch? - I am clear it was.</p>
               <p>How are you clear? - I will swear it.</p>

               <p>Was you nearer to the man's hand than you are to me? - Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Is this a gold watch or a metal one? (Shewing him his watch.) - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen your young master's watch nearer than you have seen this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As near as that table? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court to Acksin. Describe a little more particularly about your master and Mr. Collison's getting out of the coach? - They got out of the coach at Mr. Collison's door; I was bid to stop, the first time I did not, I drove up to the gentleman's door.</p>
               <p>You did not say a word about driving up to the door? - I drove up to Mr. Collison's door, who was in the coach, I drove to his door before I was stopped; he bid me stop before I came up to the gentleman's door, and I drove up to the door, thinking it would save us; I was twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Did he come up and rob the coach when it stood at the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did you omit so very extraordinary a circumstance as that? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Relate again now how the robbery happened? - I was coming along the road going into Southgate, the young man stopped me, and said he would blow my brains out; I went up to Mr. Collison's door, and he followed me up and said, I will blow your brains out; my master opened the coach door with his right-hand and slipped down, likewise Mr. Collison got out; the man then said he would blow the lady's brains out, if she did not give her watch and money, he had a pistol in his hand and a stick.</p>
               <p>Then your master and Mr. Collison were both got out of the coach? - Yes; my master hallooed out for a gun, but we had none; the other highwayman was down with the footman.</p>
               <p>What at Mr. Collison's door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts is the house situated? - Going up Southgate-hill: then after they had robbed the coach, I drove up the hill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120077"/> to go home, and left my master and Mr. Collison behind.</p>
               <p>What after they had been just robbed? - My master came across the road, the two houses are not two hundred yards apart: Mr. Collison and my master were both out of the coach before the young gentleman and my mistress were robbed; I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Rand. Whereabouts was this coach robbed? - Just by Mr. Collison's door.</p>

            , &amp;c. Taking it that the evidence in this case was free from all exception, it seems to me, with great submission, that they have not proved the facts necessary to support this indictment: suppose they had laid it to have been a robbery on the person of Mr. Walker, and taking from him a watch, the property of a person unknown, and it had been proved to be his watch, or any other person's it would not have sustained the indictment. According to the evidence, it proves no one fact which calls upon the prisoner to answer to the charge, and to fix the having made an assault: it depends in the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Walker, and their son, and Mr. Collison, who are Quakers, and the footman, who it seems will not swear to the prisoner, though he is not a Quaker, it depends on the evidence of this Acksin; first, as to the assault, says he, he came to the coach in which Mr.

Now, my Lord, here is no property found on this man, here is none produced, not a single article; then it rests on the evidence of a man, on which it does not become me to make any observations. Says he, I saw the watch given out; says he, it was a watch with a worked case, by the which I suppose he meant a chased case; it is clear he did not mean to describe the watch which is the subject of the indictment, for if there was a threat, the Jury must be convinced there was a taking by this threat of a metal watch from the person of Mr.

            : says the man, I do not know it was a metal case, otherwise than I was told; and in order to try it and to see whether the Jury can by possibility depend on the evidence of that man, I gave him my watch; why he cannot tell whether it is gold or metal, nor can the Gentlemen of the Jury: then, my Lord, is there evidence to go to the Jury on the indictment which charges this man with this specific offence? I submit there is not; and I submit, that metal to this purpose is contra distinguished from gold.</p>

               <p>Court. You are aware of the general form of distinguishing it in the indictment, when contra distinguished from gold, it is universally stated of base metal, then consider whether the word metal is not a general word, comprising all metals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I take it to be a leading rule of all criminal law, that there must be certainty; if a man is charged with stealing a gold watch, he knows what he has to answer; but a man is charged by an indictment, that he had stole a metal watch, says he, I can prove gold or silver, but if they state it generally metal, why I am to take in all the metals that ever were in the bowels of the earth. If it had been clearly upon evidence to be a gold watch, it would not have been a proper description of it; and I contend, that the Jury cannot upon this indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120078"/> have any evidence that can satisfy their consciences, either that the watch was the watch of Mr. Walker, or that it was a a metal watch as described in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. You have had ground enough in this case, Mr. Garrow, to intitle you, in point of law, to observe upon the evidence by a side wind, which you have done very sufficiently. It is not in practice for the prisoner to know the precise charge against him; if it was, your objection would be decisive, and it would be an unanswerable reason why it should be described, in which case it might be doubtful: but in this case, there is certainly evidence enough to go to the Jury, and it will be for them to decide, whether they are sufficiently satisfied from the evidence of Acksin, that this was Mr. Walker's son's watch, and that it was a metal watch; and he swears to his belief, founded on what he saw at the time, and these will be circumstances for the consideration of the Jury. But with respect to your first objection, I am most clearly and decidedly of opinion against you in point of law, because I do not hold it necessary that there should be a distinct and personal threat upon every one, but the stopping a coach with several persons in it, is putting every person therein in fear. I shall leave it to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Who are you? - I am butler to Mr. Graham.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, there was a very great crowd in the passage, and yet no man to the right but him? - No, there was a great crowd to the left.</p>
               <p>Was the crowd all on one side of the passage? - I got to the right, having a person to my left.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say in such a crowd as this, there was no man but this man? - I caught the prisoner's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Was there any crowd at all? - There was a great crowd.</p>
               <p>Have you always said that you caught this man's hand in your pocket? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120080"/>Did you say so there? - I did, I am sure I said so there.</p>
               <p>Did you let him go? - The constable secured him.</p>
               <p>Did you not let the man go? - I let him go so far as the crowd pushed him away.</p>
               <p>Did you ever seize hold of him when he was near you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you lose the keys at the time? - I did.</p>
               <p>You caught his hand in your pocket, but you did not catch the keys in his hand? - I did not, I could not get hold of his hand then.</p>
               <p>Did not you repeatedly promise the man, if he would give you the keys you would let him go? - Yes, he said he had not got them.</p>
               <p>You let him go immediately? - I did not let him go immediately, I had hold of him a good while, I let him go to feel in my pocket, and it was turned inside out; I felt to see whether I had the key left, as to the money, it was no object; I put eight shillings and six-pence in my pocket. The man never used any foul language.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know of this gentleman where the keys was found? - They were brought to me by the constable.</p>

               <p>The keys were found two hundred yards from me, I have subpoened the man who picked the keys up, and he will not come; this gentleman challenged me, he was going down with a lady, I happened to be of one side of him, he laid hold of my arm, halloo, says he, I thought he thought I was getting before, says I, what are you about, Sir, he immediately let me go to get a good place; he came after me again, and laid hold of me; says he, I have been robbed, and you must be the man, you was next me; says I, for God's sake do not mention it; says he, give me the keys, says he, I will swear that you are the man, right or wrong; I asked him what alarmed him, he said my being next him: I was taken and searched, I had half a guinea, and two shillings and sixpence, he said he thought one of the sixpences found in my possession was his, and he could almost venture to swear to it; the Justice advised him not. When the man brought the keys up to the office, they were found at about two hundred yards from me; he said, there is no occasion to bind this man over. I have sent for this man that found the keys, and have not been able to get him; it was above two hundred yards from where I was taken.</p>

             came to me in the morning, and he said George, I have found a watch, he gave it me, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - He was a prisoner till he was released.</p>
               <p>Beckwith. Between five and six on Wednesday evening, the 29th of December, the prisoner came to our house, that was after the house was broke open, he said he could inform us of the person that could give a discovery of the robbery, I went with him to the public house, there was his brother, we took him before Justice Wilmot, the prisoner declared in my presence, that he gave the watch to his brother.</p>
               <p>Court. But that brother is not here, to shew that was the watch he gave to him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had another man taken up, that was released by the prisoner's confession; it was not signed, there was no pen, ink nor paper.</p>
               <p>What did he say before Justice Wilmot? - He said he concealed himself in the house.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell him it would be the better for him to confess? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was his inducement to confess? - It was open free confession, he said he concealed himself about six in the evening, in the cellar, and after the man was gone to bed, he went into the parlour, he heard some watches going, which lay on the mantle-piece, and that induced him to take them; he did not go into the shop, but wanted to go out, he then went out, and left the door open after him.</p>
               <p>Was he threatened if he did not confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have to say as far as this, I was in bed and asleep at my father's house, at half after eight that night, and did not get up till eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. I take it to be an established rule, that confession without some circumstances is not sufficient, unless he should confess it again at the bar; if any of the property had been found about him, or he had been about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120084"/> the place or the house at the time, or had had any knowledge of the place; but the mere confession of a crime without any one single circumstance to corroborate it, is not sufficient.</p>

               <p>I took the two prisoners into custody, and there were duplicates found on each of them, one of Mr. Price's duplicates, and one of Mr. Millar's, I found Price's duplicate in the pocket of Remnant.</p>
               <p>Court to Payne. Does that relate to the two waistcoats you have produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Millar. This is my duplicate.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I believe that other might not be out of Mason's pocket, but the other I am sure I took out of Remnant's pocket, but I might be mistaken in the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mason. You took but one duplicate from me? - Yes, I took three.</p>

               <p>One pair of breeches I took from the prisoner Mason, on the first of November; here is a coat pledged by Mason, I knew him before by the name of Mason, he pledged these in his own name; here is a waistcoat that was pledged on the 30th of October, I am sure the coat was the 25th of October, and pledged by Mason.</p>
               <p>Mr. Naylor. I know the waistcoat and breeches, I had the lace made on purpose, and the buttons and the coat I am pretty sure of, I cannot swear to the black breeches; these things were in the out room on the night I went out.</p>
               <p>Where is the hair dresser that you found? - He is gone away, I had no suspicion of the hair dresser at all; Remnant was clerk to Mr. Cracraft, the attorney.</p>
               <p>What is Mason? - He did live with Mr. Cracraft, I believe he is the son of an attorney, and clerk to an attorney; Remnant opened the door, says I, your name is Remnant, and there was a woman there, and I said you are his mother, he said no, upon the duplicates being found upon him, he knew where the shop was, the people at the shop said, they knew him very well, and should have taken a gold watch from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The writing was upon thin paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The ink spread a good deal? - Yes, but I know it was mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Mr. Millar. Where have these waistcoats been since the time that you took them in? - In the warehouse.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - They have not been brought down since the 25th of October last; I know they are the same waistcoats I took in of Mr. Lee, I have no other waistcoats of the same kind that I know of.</p>
               <p>Were they the same tickets? - The duplicate that is pledged in the name of Mason was found upon Remnant.</p>
               <p>Mason. There has been several arts and menaces made use of by Macmanus to get confessions from Remnant.</p>
               <p>Court. They have not been made use of.</p>

               <p>Have you at any time since found any of your property in any body's hands? - Yes, two spoons in the custody of a pawn-broker in Old-street, his name is Hoskins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. These two spoons, found at Hoskins's in Old-street-street road, was in consequence of the confession of the prisoner? - One of of them was, I should not have found out where it was without the duplicate which I found in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The woman told you that one of the spoons was pawned at the pawn-brokers? - I went to search for a tea-spoon, and found a table-spoon.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the parish of Clerkenwell, I keep a public house opposite the new Sessions-house; on December the 24th, the prisoner came into my house for a pint of beer, with a little girl that was tried yesterday for some lace; she had a pint of beer, and in going out she had a sort of a ragged apron on, and I saw one of the feet of these castors hang out of her apron; I asked her what she had there, she said it did not concern me, I said, I insisted on looking at it, she refused, I put my hand in and the cruets were all loose, and this handle out; she said she was going to Cow-cross to have the rims altered, or something thing of that kind, and she said she bought it of a woman coming along, who offered it her for two shillings; going to the Rotation-office I walked about a yard before her, and she attempted twice to make her escape from me.</p>

I shewed them to Mr. Allen, and he said he thought they were counterfeits, and I stopped her; Mrs. Flint desired the woman to be detained.</p>
               <p>What made you think them counterfeits? - I knew them to be counterfeits by scraping the edges of one of them, and they were all of the same coin.</p>
               <p>What became of the woman afterwards? - The woman remained in the shop while Mrs. Flint sent for a constable; the constable did not take charge of the woman, I cannot say why.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120097"/>Did he refuse to take charge? - The woman was searched in my presence, I went with her and the constable up stairs, and when she was searched in the counting house, they found no bad money upon her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You take a great deal of silver, I have no doubt, Sir? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You suspected this to be bad, because, as you tell us, the heads were all the same way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the course of a day you take a deal of bad money? - We do. (The money produced.) It has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to swear that was the same money the woman gave to you? - So far as this, I am confident she paid me three shillings the first payment, our family were at dinner, and Mrs. Flint always takes the money out of the till when she goes to dinner, there was only one shilling in the till, and I put that three shillings to it, and I went to the other side to serve her with the other things, and when I took the other six shillings, one being in the drawer before, I would not be positive which of those three it was that was good; but she might give me one good one among the first three; the other six were never mixed with any other money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say you take a great deal of money in the course of a day? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Vernon, I have seen all these shillings before, and I decided by day-light that they were bad, I can swear to them now.</p>
               <p>You are sufficiently acquainted with money? - I am perfectly clear that they are counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You said you had seen them by day-light, and you then decided they were all counterfeit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, if these had been given to you as change for money at the play-house, would you have taken them? - Certainly, I have taken much worse.</p>
               <p>And you are very conversant on the subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>However you have taken much worse? - Certainly I have.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. From what circumstance are we to infer that this woman knew these to be counterfeits?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I will save Mr. Silvester the trouble by saying a word or two in a case that certainly does not require a word; for in order to convict the prisoner you must be satisfied of this, that she, perfectly well knowing that these shillings were bad coin, and with a view to impose that shilling to the witness as a good one, she did offer it to him in payment: Gentlemen, you have heard from every body, and even from that young gentleman, whose judgment I did not think fit to trust to, and whom I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120098"/> chuse to trouble with an answer; and I am sure that before the next Sessions, if this woman is convicted on such evidence, I shall not have the honour of attending this Court, for I am very free to acknowledge that this very morning to a hackney-coachman who brought me hither, I tendered some shillings in payment much worse than these, and I trust the Court will believe me, when I say I so tendered them without knowing they were bad: Gentlemen, I need not inform you, for his Lordship will do it much better, that it is not from the accidental circumstance of a man's uttering two or three bad shillings in payment, or even from his having two or three more about him, that you are to infer he is an utterer of bad money, knowing it to be bad: Gentlemen, the punishment in this case if the prisoner is convicted, is, that she shall lay in gaol for a year, and I am confident that there are none of us who have attended here, and who know the situation of that gaol of Newgate, who know the miserable situation of the wretches that are confined there, thatwill feel any sentiment but compassion, for anybody who has lain in a gaol only one night; and I am perfectly satisfied that you will not, you cannot, I am perfectly satisfied, that you dare not commit that poor woman, and that unfortunate infant, to have its education in the gaol of Newgate, on evidence on which every one of you, every man who now hears me, might long since have been committed to Newgate: Gentlemens in your hand, I leave the poor prisoner, perfectly well satisfied that your verdict will be an instant acquittal; I will not insult you in calling any evidence, I will leave her in perfect security in your hands, and not say one word more to procure the acquital of a person, who certainly ought not upon such evidence to have been brought here at all.</p>

             called on his recognizance, he has not appeared; he was the person we wished to get at; and I am afraid that the circumstances of this case are so particular that it will be impossible to affect either the man at the bar, or ultimately to get at the great offender; the person at the bar has been abandoned by the man that has now absconded himself; and I confess I am somewhat at a loss, whether to look at the prisoner with indignation or approbation; with indignation for having committed this crime, by the instigation of the wickeder party, or with approbation for his open confession of it: but however, I can only give evidence of his own assertion; I shall therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120099"/> be in the correction of the Recorder, whether that be or be not evidence sufficient to meet that charge; if it be, then I shall proceed to state to you the nature of this crime, and the manner of its being committed, to the prejudice of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Court. You open this with great fairness Mr. Fielding, and you apply to me; is not the prosecutrix herself a witness in the cause?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, she is an interested witness, inasmuch as there will be a motion for a new trial.</p>
               <p>Court. This prosecution is conducted with great fairness and propriety, and it is my duty to state my opinion in the present stage of the business: therefore, if you have no evidence to disprove what the defendant swore on the trial, except his own declaration that it was false; I am clearly of opinion that the Jury cannot in point of law find him guilty.</p>

This indictment seems to me, to contain no charge under the act of Parliament; it is not every idle tale, by which a man can prevail upon good nature, either to give or lend him money or goods, but it must be a pretence, which if true, ought to gain him credit; as if a beggar comes and tells me a false story, if he says, he has a wife and ten children that are starving; whereas in truth he never was married in his life: this prosecutor has nothing to do but to bring an action for the watch.</p>

               <p>Did you hear him say any thing? - I did not hear him say that he had a hand in it; he said that he was sorry for what he had done; the knife was found under the bed; when I knocked him down, I did not see him throw it away.</p>
               <p>Was he told what he had done, did any body tell him? - Yes, they told him he had cut Stockton, and he said he was very sorry that he had cut him.</p>

My man Butt can tell you that I had two more witnesses, King and Tanney, one was the turnkey, and the other a watchman, and they are both dead; I have the smith here, I thought that room the securest in the house; the prisoner went to Ostend.</p>

               <p>I am one of the turnkeys to Mr. Kirby, I know this room, the prisoner took out the middle bar that Mr. Lillie had put there the day before.</p>
               <p>Court. The middle bar was taken out? - It appeared to be drawn out by a chissel or small crow, and laying in the room when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then it was very insecure, what length was it? - The nails were between three and four inches, and the crow eightteen inches; the wood was very strong; it was a crow with a flat top. I was at Mr. Daly's room at eleven, he answered me, and about a quarter before one I was in the lodge, and I was alarmed by a watchman, that a cord was hanging down in the street; it was a cord tied by many knots, I thought it was not a cord strong enough to let such a man down, it was some cord tied together; we went and broke open the door, the cord was fastened to one of the under bars, I found Mr. Daly was gone, and this bar laying on the floor; it was clear the man got out of the window by moving the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it possible to extract the nails with a crow, because it is charged in the indictment as a crow? - The edge of it was sharp like a knife; Mr. Bellis was in the room twenty times before the bar was put up, he used to come every day.</p>

               <p>I was in Wood-street Compter.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that young man coming to see you there? - Yes, different times, he was there a prisoner at the time I was there; he came to see me, but as for bringing me cord or a crow, he never did in his life; the cord was brought me by a man in St. Giles's, and the crow by a man that was there, that is gone to America, and he took the crow with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I thought you was a scoundrel before I called you, now you have convinced us of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I meant by my cross-examination, to have brought out the same answer that he has given in Court.</p>
               <p>Court. He would not have appeared in a very favourable light in coming against this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. To be sure, as his friend served him, he has served his friend.</p>
