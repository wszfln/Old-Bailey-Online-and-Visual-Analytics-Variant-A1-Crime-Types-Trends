I am the wife of Lewis Isaacs, a linen-draper, of 4, Hoxton Street—about January 31st Blackalley came in for a pair of socks, price 2 3/4d., and gave me a half-crown—I bent it, gave it back to her, and said that I would not have it—I think she said that her daughter took it for lemons—she paid me with good money and left—I afterwards picked her out at the station from five others.</p>

Sergeant Williamson and I have had the prisoners and several others under observation—I saw Collins in Central Street, Blackfriars, on February 19th—we followed him to Shoreditch, and to Burford Court, Hoxton Street—he entered No. 5, and went upstairs—the front door was wide open—he went to the first floor front—there are two floors, and the two rooms at the top were unoccupied;</p>

               <p>there was a broad landing, and we concealed ourselves there, crouching down and keeping observation on the rooms below—I saw Collins and Blackalley enter the first floor back room, which was occupied by Smith—I did not see Smith, but I heard her voice—they were going backwards and forwards to one another's rooms, and I saw Smith three times—we kept observation about three-quarters of an hour, and hearing strange people about, we went away—that was Tuesday—I had seen them, all three, in company for five weeks before, at the Bear public-house, Oxford Street—on the next day, about 2 o'clock, we returned to the house with Sergeant Baldock—we all three went to the landing, and saw Collins and Black-alley enter Smith's room; they must have been in the house when we arrived—Blackalley left, and went into the front room; I then for the first time heard Smith's door locked from the inside—Collins was then inside—shortly afterwards I heard the jingling of coin on the table or floor, and a few minutes after that the door was unlocked, and Collins left the room, saying, "Five o'clock"—he left the house—the sergeant entered the back room, another sergeant followed, and I brought up the rear—Smith was sitting at a table, and in front of her were 19 counter-feit florins on the table, and one was in her hand; they are all of the same date—I searched the room, and on the fire-place I found this mould for florins (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Smith had a file in her other hand—she made a state<lb/>ment—Blackalley was brought in, and Sergeant Baldock entered what she said, in his book—Collins returned about 5 o'clock, and I said to Badcock, "That is the man; take him back to the room"—we were then at the bottom of the stairs with the women—we took them all to the station, and they were charged with being in possession of the mould and the counterfeit coin—the charge was read over to them by the inspector—they made no reply.</p>

On February 20th I was with Cox and Williamson at Burton Court, Hoxton—it is a small house in a retired, quiet neighbourhood, and you can hear sounds very well—we were on the top landing—I heard nothing—I went down to the back room, first floor—later on I went into the front room, where Blackalley was, and conveyed her to the back room—I have here a note which I made at the time—after Sergeant Williamson had said that they would be taken in custody, Blackalley said, "I have two rooms on this floor; about five weeks ago I let this one to Ann Williams, her" nodding to the prisoner Smith, "for 3s. 6d. a week. I am a widow, and live in the other room, with my daughter; I have seen her," nodding at Smith, "making money every week she has been here; I saw her making some to-day; it is nothing to do with me"—Smith said, "How can you <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on me like this, when you know as much as I do; you can't say you don't"—I was</p>

               <p>standing near the street door about 5 o'clock, when Collins came back, but where I could not be seen by anyone till they got inside the door—Cox said, "That is the man that was in the room just now"—we took him upstairs—he was very much surprised, and wanted to go out at the back—Sergeant Williamson told him he was charged with being in possession of counterfeit coin and implements for making it—he said, "I have never been in this room before"—Smith said, "How can you say that? Do you think I am going to stand it all? You know you were here, and made these things yourself, to-day"—Collins made no reply.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190103250022"/>
               <p>and found she was in a very thin and emaciated condition; her skin was extremely dirty, and her clothes were very dirty and scanty—she was slightly knock-kneed, her back was bruised, and she was slightly pigeon-breasted—I think the bruise on the back was the result of direct violence—she had very little hair on her head, and what she had was verminous—there was a large scab on the left side of her head, about 2in. above the ear—the right eyelid and the skin round it were discoloured, and also the bridge of her nose—there were sores on her head—they may have been caused by the filth or by a blow—she was very cowed—I had great difficulty in getting her to answer any questions—I think the bruisings and marks were all caused at different times—she had slight symptoms of chest disease, but not, in my opinion, sufficient to cause the emaciation I saw—she was apparently about nine years old—I did not see her weighed—I do not think she was quite up to the average height—the average weight of a child of her age and height would be about 601b., or a little more—her condition would be noticed by anybody; she was a wretched object—I went to the house with the inspector, and saw the room in which it was said the child slept—I agree with the inspector as to its condition—sleeping there would be likely to be injurious to its health, because of its dirty condition—I saw the other children; they were in a fair condition of health, but not over clean—there was great difference between them and the other child—my impression is that the child had been starved and very much neglected; that would account for its condition; disease would cause it, but the evidence of disease was very slight—I found symptoms of slight bronchitis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 31, Great St. Helen's—on November 17th, 1899, the prisoner called at my office—I knew him before as Baron de Lussan—he asked me to make him an advance on the Fraser mortgage, which he brought me, and to which was attached this letter from his wife—(<hi rend="italic">Authorising the prisoner to deal on his wife's behalf with the Fraser mortgage in any way, which had been taken up by her.</hi>)—I read the deed through, and he explained it to me—a policy of insurance was referred to—he said his wife had it, and it was still in existence—he said the mortgage had been taken up by his wife, and she had paid ₤268, but it had never been actually legally transferred to her, and that steps were either being taken, or had been taken, to have that done—he also handed me a bill, dated September 25th, 1899, drawn by Alfred de Lussan for ₤250 on Henry E. Beckett, of 6, Northumberland Avenue, and accepted by him at four months' date—he said that Mr. Beckett was a man of substance, and the security was good—I advanced him on that day ₤50, on November 24th another ₤20, and December 1st ₤30—I have the cheques here; they are endorsed by him—I believed the mortgage was genuine, and that his wife had taken it up—I regarded the bill as a genuine one—I accepted the prisoner's representation that the policy of insurance was extant—I should not have advanced money upon the security without the existing life policy, because it is not an</p>

               <p>absolute reversion, it is a contingent reversion—this charge was prepared upon the prisoner's instructions, and brought to me on December 16th by him, as having been executed by his wife that morning at the Hotel Metropole—from that I believed the lady had purchased from the prisoner's mother her life interest under the father's will, and that she was in possession of the reversion—I advanced another ₤25, and subse<lb/>quently other money—he said his wife had the deeds, and that they would come on presently—I believed that the bill accepted by Mr. Beckett was not paid; it was returned—I saw Mr. Beckett—he went bankrupt—the prisoner went bankrupt in January, 1900—I did not get judgment till March, 1900—Beckett went bankrupt a month or so after I got judgment—I had notice of the defendant's receiving order—I have not got anything at all so far—when I was lending the prisoner money I did not know he was an undischarged bankrupt—I learned of it, as a fact, about the end of January, 1900.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I ever saw you was, I believe, in December, 1898—I made an advance then of ₤100; shortly afterwards, I believe, I paid ₤12 12s. for you—I received those moneys back with costs.—I have been to Woodcroft Castle once—I had the lease in my possession—I give receipts when I am asked for them whenever I receive money—I have acted as solicitor for you and your wife on and off till January, 1900, but I acted more for your wife—I got a knowledge of your affairs—I do not recollect giving you to understand that so long as a certain amount of business was brought to me, if a small advance was wanted, I was prepared to make it—we acted for you to a considerable extent—we acted for you against the Capital and Counties Bank, and a writ was issued—I did not see your wife in January, 1900—I advanced you ₤186 10s. in cash, I believe, on property in Hyde Park Terrace—I advanced you money on your wife's signature—the costs and interest in the Hyde Park Terrace property brought the sum up to ₤294 10s. 5d., which amount we received; there was over ₤100 in costs—I gave a receipt for that amount—I got the money from the first mortgagees—we do not keep a letter-book, we have too many letters; they are kept on files—in June, 1899, I acted for you in the matter of Willcox—you instructed us in the action, and we did our best to defend it—you never said a word about your bankruptcy—I only met a Mr. Cowell two or three times—I recollect the matter "<hi rend="italic">Re Brown</hi>"—you did not discuss your bankruptcy then—we acted in "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Morris"—I did not see you then; you saw my partner—the subject was mentioned to me afterwards, and you denied the bankruptcy—there was a charge against you of obtaining credit without disclosing your bankruptcy—I asked you if you had been bankrupt, and you said No, and that it was a mistake about a half-brother of the same name—we got written instructions, signed by you and your wife, authorising us to act as your solicitor in a matter "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Wright and Fairer," and to receive the letters from Mr. Cowell—you saw me many times upon that matter—I think my partner met you in the Law Courts, and was introduced to your wife—we got the papers in November, after some difficulty from Mr. Cowell, who was acting for you—I have read them, but not at that time—I cannot say if your bankruptcy is alluded to in them—to the best of my</p>

               <p>recollection, it is not—I have not got them here—the money paid by the Capital and Counties Bank was not actually paid till January 3rd, 1900—I have no recollection of having made an advance without any security—on October 12th, 1899, there is an advance of ₤15—I do not think the ₤12 12s. is on any security—the advance of ₤186 10s. was made before I received the notice from the third mortgagee—my opinion is that you knew the securities on which you were asking me to advance money were worthless; of course at that time I did not think them valueless—there was another security given me in the shape of some shares in the Wood-ward Electric Company—I declined to have anything to do with that—I did not advance any money on it—you might have said on November 17th that you wanted to consult me about the Fraser mortgage, but that it was too long to enter into then—I do not remember it—I said it was no security to me as it was then—I do not think we discussed Beckett's position—I asked you if he was worth the money, and you said, "Of course, he is a man of money"—I do not remember you saying he lived at Blackheath, in a house for which he paid ₤200 a year—I know he was a director of the Electric Company, and it is quite possible you told me so—I know you referred to Mr. Littler as thinking highly of it—at some time or other I had a transfer from your wife in the Gelong Company that is worth about ₤5—the Randreef is another security altogether—if I had recovered the money from Beckett it would have covered your wife's indebtedness to me—I should have held the deed in trust for your wife—considerably more than ₤270 was owing to me—I did not prove for more because I should have had to pay for the bill and for the taxing, and I should be in the same position as I am in now—I should not charge you when making you advances, and there would be no record in our books of your having called—I did not know that Mr. Rubenstein had any interest in this till these proceedings—you did not disclose it to me at that time—you did not say he had the original charge—I do not remem<lb/>ber you writing me a list of the property connected with the Fraser deed—you told me what the property consisted of—you never said that if the property was nursed the security would right itself—you never said that if the advance was carried through, Mrs. Baker would vacate Grenville House, and it might be let—the security was not worth more than ₤200—you wanted some<lb/>one who would let you have some money, but not in a lump sum, you wanted several small advances—I intimated to you that a fraud had been committed on me—that was towards the end of January—I never impli<lb/>cated your wife in the false pretence, if it is one—it is quite possible that I intimated to her that you had committed a fraud on me—I said no steps would be taken against her—you may take it that I acted as your banker—you did not continually pay sums of money to me—you gave me ₤100 to pay the rent of Woodcroft Castle—I paid it away—I was paid ₤52 3s. 6d., which repaid me for an advance I had made to Mrs. Baker—I received ₤100 from the landlord of Woodcroft Castle for a surrender of the lease, which money was accounted for to your wife—I advanced ₤11 on May 11th, but not to you; it was to your wife—what she did with it I cannot say—I know I declined to have any more financial dealings with you—it is quite possible that you came to my</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I know now that the prisoner was bankrupt in 1893—that was prior to the deed of July 5th, 1895—the cheque for ₤15 for expenses was returned, marked "No account"—I attached no security to the shares in the Electric Storage Battery Company—I did not know of the prisoner's mother's bankruptcy when I advanced the money—I never knew at what date his mother was alleged to have transferred her interest under the father's will to the prisoner's wife—I never saw any document transferring the interest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shop assistant to James William Higgs, of Barnham Street, Limehouse—we sell boots, alpaca, and things of that sort—on Thursday, February 7th, I shut up the shop to go out to take orders from 2 to 4.30—I did not put the shutters up, but I locked up the premises—everything was in proper order—I passed the shop about 9.30 p.m.—I next went to the shop at 9.30 the next morning—the padlock of the side door was on the doorstep, and unlocked—I had a key to the side door—the shop door is opened from within—the side door was shut, and I had to open it with the ordinary key to let myself in—I picked up the padlock, and went into the shop—I saw overcoats on the ground, and a model was knocked over—they belong to Mr. Higgs—I counted five overcoats; there ought to have been six—I went upstairs—24 boots and one odd boot were missing, also some grey worsted cloth and some alpaca—the value of the things missing is 35s. to 36s.—I told my master as early as possible—some of the goods produced are my master's—our private mark is on the ticket on the stuff and on the boots—this mark means 7s. 8d.—I put some of the marks on—this one is mine.</p>

About 8.20 on Friday, February 8th, I was in the Whitechapel Road on a tram—I saw English with a sack on his left shoulder on the pavement, with a man I know as Harris—I got off the tram, and followed them to the corner of Commercial Street—I lost sight of them, but saw them again on the top of a Bloomsbury <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> going in the direction of Bloomsbury, a few seconds afterwards—I jumped inside the <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> and rode to Hanbury Street, Old Street—Harris got off the 'bus after it crossed the City Road; the prisoner rode on—I stopped in—the prisoner got down, and went up Hanbury Street, with the sack on his shoulder, at a rapid pace—I followed him into League Street—he was knocking at No. 3 when I told him I was a police officer, and should like to know what he had got in the sack—I am referring to notes taken at the time—he said, "Find out," and threw the sack on the pavement—I caught hold of him—he struggled—I said, "I want to know what you have got"—he said, "Two rolls of cloth"—I had to hold him as well as the sack—I said, "Where did you get them from? Satisfy me where you got them from"—he said, "I bought them of two dealers in Commercial Street"—I said, "You could</p>

               <p>not have done that, because I followed you myself from White-chapel Road in the same 'bus as you came in with Harris"—I asked him if he could convince me that he got them from dealers—he said, "No"—I told him I was not satisfied with his explanation, and should take him into custody for unlawful possession—he said that he did not know Harris, and afterwards that he did, and said, "We buy stuff together, and we are partners"—when I charged him he said, "I bought them of two dealers in Commercial Street."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have since ascertained that the prisoner has kept a stall in Chapel Street for six or seven years—he sells mostly boots—he lives at No. 3, Leek Street, with his mother—he said, "I do not know Harris"—what I said before the Magistrate may be right, that he said he knew nothing about Harris—I have been looking for Harris—Harris is a <hi rend="italic">fence,</hi> who buys goods—he has been convicted twice—he has been home five or six weeks.</p>

On February 21st, about 8 p.m., I was in Aldgate, and saw six or seven men, with Lemore, who I knew by sight, not by name—Payne was there with four others—Lemore and the gang he was with were all dressed respectably, and the gang Payne was with were dressed shabbily—French was with Lemore's gang, standing at the door of a public-house—I went for assistance, met Young, and called his attention to the two gangs—I was in plain clothes—I also spoke to Sergeant Magger and to Clements, a uniform man, who watched them till I returned—about 8.45 both gangs went in and out of the George public-house, as if they were looking for somebody—they then went into Leadenhall Street, met the prosecutor, hustled him into a doorway, and at that moment the electric light went down—I called to Young, and just as I got within a few yards of them one of them called out, <hi rend="italic">"Skip,"</hi> and they all ran away, some towards Essex Court and some to Billiter Street—I followed Lemore and another—Lemore was the last—I caught him by his coat-collar—he resisted, but Young came up—his coat was undone, and his hand was in his inside pocket—I told him I was a police officer, and he would be charged with knocking a man down at the other end of the street and robbing him—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Skid;</hi> you know it is not my business; you are taking a liberty"—I said, "I am taking no liberty"—he said, "You have made a mistake"—I said, "I have made no mistake; I have seen you"—I had seen him standing over the prosecutor at the time of the robbery—he was dressed as he is now, but he had a mackintosh—he said at the station, "You have made a mis<lb/>take; there is no mud on his coat; how can he have been knocked down?"—there had been mizzling rain—in his jacket pocket, which he took his hand from, there was 18s. in florins and half-crowns—the prose<lb/>cutor was sober—I watched French three-quarters of an hour—there was an electric light outside the public-house and three street lamps—next day, from what I was told, I went to the George Hotel and saw French with a friend—he had spectacles on, and was reading a paper, which he put down as soon as I went in and went to the other end of the counter, and then went out—I followed him, and told him I should take him for robbing O'Keeffe in Leadenhall Street—he said, "I do not know where</p>

I have never made a mistake over a prisoner, to my knowledge—there was not another man there who might be mistaken for Lemore, because Lemore is dark and the other man fair—the two gangs went together to the prosecutor, and made about a dozen, not 20—when they got to him the electric light flickered down and went up again before they went away—the whole thing only took a few seconds—I was about 20 yards off, on the opposite side—I took Lemore about 200 yards from where it happened, and in the same thoroughfare, in the entrance to Sussex Place, not round a turning—two or three others went down Cree Church Lane, and I passed the top of the turning and followed Lemore and another—Lemore was not coming up Sussex Place—I cannot be mistaken.</p>

Both gangs hustled the prosecutor at the same time—I saw French at that time—I did not see him touch his pockets—about 12 men were round the prosecutor—I paid attention to Lemore, and Young came behind me—when I arrested French he said, "You have made a mistake; I never left the house all day long; I was drunk, and went home in a cab, and never went out next day"—I found in his pocket a half return ticket for East Ham—this was the Thursday, and he said that he was drunk on the Wednesday—he called people at the Police-court to say that they saw him out on the Thursday—I put down in writing what he said—(<hi rend="italic">Reading:</hi> "I have made a mistake. After I went home on the 20th, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did not leave home till next day, for he was ill.")—I did not put down the exact words—I put that down at the station after he was charged—what he said did not happen on Thursday, the 19th—another half return ticket was found on him for the 22nd, the day I arrested him, Friday—they are exactly similar, only different in dates—the other ticket is for Tuesday, the 19th.</p>

On February 21st, about 8.30, I met Pearson in Aldgate High Street, by Duke Street—he called my attention to a group of men by the George Hotel—he went up the street, and I followed him into Mitre Street, and saw French—I did not know him by sight—I observed him about half an hour, and had a good look at him—I got round a corner where they could not see me, but I could see them quite plain—they moved into Leadenball Street, and a few minutes afterwards I heard a shout, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground in the doorway of an unfinished building, and the gang running away—it was not dark; it had been raining, but it was quite clean where he was—I next saw Lemore on the 28th at the Mansion House—I am quite sure he is the man I saw, and the other two prisoners also—I saw them a minute or two after I picked the prosecutor up.</p>

I live at 41, Harley Road, Kentish Town—I have no occupation—on Saturday, March 2nd, I was in Drummond Street between 11 and 12 p.m.—I was surrounded by five or six men, who put me on my back in the road, and my watch was taken from my waistcoat pocket—it was silver, and there was a gold chain—it was worth ₤4—the chain was broken—I got up and gave information to the police—to the beat of my opinion, the prisoners were two of the men—I had my hand cut, and suffer from nervousness from the fall if anyone comes near me—I am 55 years of age—the attack was momentary, and the men ran away—on March 14th I saw Roberts at the Cock, in Seaton Street, about two minutes' walk from where I was attacked—I was with Sergeant Wilson, who took Roberts into custody—I afterwards saw Hanafin at the station in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shoreditch Road, Birmingham—I am the managing director of the Perambulator Company, Limited, formed for the purpose of selling furniture and bicycles, but chiefly per<lb/>ambulators—the prisoner was engaged in June last, under this agree<lb/>ment, as our agent, at ₤2 a week and a commission of ₤5 per cent. on orders, the agents' pay, and railway fares; the receipts to be remitted within 24 hours without deduction, and the agreement to be determined by a three months' notice—up to December he received over ₤70—we supplied him with furniture—that has been paid for—we kept a stock-book of the articles sent to 91, Worship Street—we called it our London house—the prisoner also had a stock-book there to enter the articles he received—that was at first sent to the works, and we entered the articles—on August 10th a gentleman's and a lady's bicycle were sent to him, and on August 23rd some sociable fittings to turn them into a sociable bicycle, of which this is a photograph (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—we sent bicycles first to the Agricultural Hall, and then to the prisoner at Worship Street—on August 13th a brass bedstead was sent, and another on August 20th—they first went to the Show—in November I gave notice by letter to quit the premises at Worship Street, and on December 14th I went there and saw these articles—there were several cycles—I counted them roughly—I arranged with the landlord to continue the tenancy for another 14 days from December 16th, as the goods were too many to pack—I saw the prisoner that night at Euston Station, and told him that I had taken the shop on for another fortnight, and the things might remain there till further orders, but it was my intention to have them packed back to Birmingham—he asked if he could warehouse them at Mile End, where he had a shop—I said, "No; cer<lb/>tainly not," as I knew there had been too much trouble there—then I went back to Birmingham—I had seen the goods about a month before that—I was present when Mr. Cronin and my son were finishing attaching the fittings to the bicycles on August 31st—I never gave them to the prisoner; I had no power to do so—they were the company's goods—on December 15th I received a telegram from my landlord, in con<lb/>sequence of which I wrote to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">The telegram stated that the prisoner had given up the Worship Street warehouse, and would stock them at Mile End.</hi>)—after that I went to his shop, 267, Mile End Road, and endeavoured to see him, but did not succeed—I wrote and told him I was coming—I again wrote him, and made other attempts to find him—I received this letter of December 20th from him—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had sent some of the goods back, but declined sending any more till he had received a receipt for what he had sent, and something was done about his expenses.</hi>)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190103250046"/>
               <p>—I next saw him on January 4th, when I had come from Birmingham, at Euston Station—I told him I must have all the goods back, and that I was very much annoyed that he had taken them away, and he signed the pencil undertaking produced, that he would send them back within three days, also a quantity of goods invoiced to him—I said, "I suppose you cannot get crates very well here; we had better send some crates up to pack them in," and for the bedsteads you want strong crates—I there-upon telegraphed for crates to be sent—crates were sent—we did not get a single perambulator, or bicycle, nor the sociable fittings, but we got some trumpery articles of the value of from 3d. to 6s. each, worth in all about ₤6, out of property worth ₤104—the only other things we have received were 24 rugs, which were produced at the Thames Police-court—we sent him about ₤400 worth altogether—after January 4th I returned to Bir<lb/>mingham, came to London again, and went to Mile End Road three times—I could not see him, and he was not to be seen at the shop then—I obtained from the Police-court a search warrant—I received letters from him, including this letter of February 3rd—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was sued for rent; that he had a judgment against him for ₤90; that his home was taken possession of; that he had to go to Chelmsford to see the Sheriff; that he would file a petition,</hi> "putting all carriages of yours and mine on sale or return, on approval from you; so you will be fully covered for all accounts outstanding; you must not say the goods are invoiced to me, or they will go as assets"; <hi rend="italic">and that he would send a list of goods for collection.</hi>)—under a search warrant of January 6th I searched his shop—I found no bicycles, or bedsteads, nor the sociable fittings—I have never found out where they have gone.</p>

               <p>Walthamstow—I gave you permission to take the sociable to Leytonstone, but not as a present—I have spoken to you and written to you about re<lb/>turning the bicycles—one letter is of September 5th, and you wrote to us, "We have only two ₤6 7s. 6d. ladies' machines here," and that they were damaged—I do not know what has become of the two bedsteads, the two bicycles, and fittings—they have not been accounted for—you wrote on February 6th, saying that the bedsteads had been sold for ₤12—I proved for ₤70 before the Receiver, but it should have been ₤122—ours is one of the most flourishing companies in Birmingham—the total value of the goods returned was about ₤26, and ₤6 14s. of things sold to you—the bicycles and bedsteads were in the charge originally made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The rugs returned after three hearings at the Police-court were worth about ₤4—they were part of the charge—the value of goods in the list as to which there was a mistake was ₤3 3s.—I never gave him the two bicycles—we sent in an account showing the prisoner had overdrawn on his commission account ₤39 3s. 9d. up to December 24th—nothing was done since—the commission account was made up to the end of October—only 15s. 6d. was earned in October—this account shows that he owes us ₤112 14s. 7d.—we have given him credit for everything he has paid out of pocket.</p>
