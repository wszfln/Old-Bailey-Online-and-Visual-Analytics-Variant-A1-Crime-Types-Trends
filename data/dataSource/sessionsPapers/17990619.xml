How long afterwards? - A.About the 9th or 10th of April, it was on a Wednesday, I saw eight of these wether sheep at Mr. Field's, a butcher, in Whitechapel; I immediately knew them to be my master's property, by some of the brand R B being visible, and some not in the middle near side; there was one large horned sheep; the horn was particular, it was what they call a reek sheep, which are subject to have thicker horns; I can speak particularly to that, and I can swear that all the others were Mr. Beckford's property; I saw the large horned sheep in Mr. Field's pasturing-place.</p>

             as I was going to Cheshunt; I drive a team; I met him between Enfield-highway and Cheshunt; I know him very well; I knew him before, that made me speak to him then, or else I should never have thought of speaking to him; I had known him a year before that, because he lived in the neighbourhood; he was driving sheep in the road towards town; I do not know how many, I cannot guess or say how many there were, because I had no thought about it; I did not observe whether they were marked; I asked him where he was going with them; he said, to Smithfield; I asked him whether any body was with him; he said, no; it was Wednesday; I cannot exactly say what hour it was, it might be nine or ten o'clock, or thereabouts</p>
               <p>Q.(To Willis.) What time did you miss the sheep? - A. Wednesday morning, about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Ivory.) Did the prisoner tell you where he had brought them from? - A. He said, he had brought them from Hitchin, out of Hertfordshire; I apprehended him afterwards on Whitsun Monday, between Barnet and Enfield.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days afterwards was it that you saw him the first time? - A. A long time, that was in March, and it was Whitsun Monday I took the lad; I cannot tell how many days it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in service when you apprehended him? - A. He was along with a one-horse cart and a load of goods when I took him.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TAYLOR sworn. - I live at Ponder's-end; I remember seeing the sheep on the 20th of March, at the back of a field of mine upon the common, about eleven o'clock; there were nineteen sheep, they were wether sheep, and there was a B plain enough, but I cannot positively say what the other mark was that was before it; it was on the near side, about the middle: I did not see the prisoner at the bar at that time; I saw some lad with them in the evening; I was at a distance; I cannot say I should know him, I was a hundred yards distance in my own field; he was in a smock frock; it was near dusk; I did not see him do any thing, he was only by the side of the sheep; I saw them the next day till the evening again; I moved them from the side of my field down the common, and I saw a lad in the evening move them away; it appeared to be the same lad I saw before, he was dressed the same, as near as I could guess, with a smock frock on, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You don't speak to the prisoner at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Ponder's-end is nearer town than Cheshunt? - A. Yes; Ponder's-end, from Cheshunt, is about three miles.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Ivory.) At the time you saw the prisoner on the 20th of March, how was he dressed? - A. In a smock frock when I saw him; what he had else I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - I am pen-man to Mr. Payne, who is a salesman in Smithfield-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; he drove several lots of sheep in Mr. Spencer's name; I have known him, I dare say, four or five years; he has been in the habit of bringing sheep for Mr. Spencer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Good Friday, the 22d of March, his bringing any sheep to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he bring any to you? - A. When I came down from Islington, they were in the pen; he told me he had nineteen sheep for Mr. Payne to sell; they were in Mr. Payne's pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had them to sell? - A. No, he said they were for Mr. Payne to sell; he brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190004"/>them himself about six o'clock in the morning, it was light; there were nineteen, I always tell them for my own safety; I did not observe the mark; there was a brand on the near side, but it was a very blind brand; I can read a brand when I see it; I did not observe the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more than one? - A. It looked like two.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition were the sheep? - A. They were in stock, not fit to kill, he did not inform me whose sheep they were; when I saw my master, I told him of it; the prisoner was present; the prisoner delivered them to me, and I delivered them to Mr. Payne, in Smithfield-market, the same day, not above three quarters of an hour afterwards; I was not present at any conversation that took place between the prisoner and my master about the sheep.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a salesman in Smithfield market? - A. Yes; I asked my man where the sheep were; I looked at them, and handled them, there were about nineteen or a score of sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you made the enquiry, did the lad appear? - A. In a very few minutes; I went to him, and asked him how Mr. Spencer came to send such sheep, for it was robbing him to have such sheep in the market; the markets were so low at that time, and the sheep not fat; his reply was, that they were his uncle Walker's, and he had so many sheep, and the keep was short, that they must be sold. I never saw the sheep till then; I am not a buyer of sheep, I sell them; I sold them for this Mr. Walker whom he told me was his uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. Without further enquiry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see the letter W on them? - A. No; we don't look at the brand one time in twenty; that is the way I usually do business; there is not one in ten that does it; we have no business to look at them; I did not examine them, our business is to look as to the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Robinson). Did the prisoner say any thing to you about Spencer? - A. I thought they came in the name of Spencer, as he had brought many lots; I told my master I thought they were Mr. Spencer's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Payne). You did not look for W? - A. No; I looked for no letter; I did not see any letter upon any of the sheep like B; if I was to say I did, I should tell you a story; I told them, and sold them according to my price, I had no notion of their being stolen. I sold them to a Mr. Collier of Romford; I can tell how many sheep I am to sell when my man tells the number, I could not tell before; I sold nineteen to Mr. Collier of Romford, of the Wiltshire kind; they were wether sheep; one had a thickish horn, I did not see any letter, we go on and do our business all in an instant; I have seen Mr. Collier to-day, he is in court, and subpoenaed as well as myself. I gave the lad an order to my book-keeper, upon a piece of paper, for nineteen sheep, at 24s. per sheep; I don't know who paid the lad the money; 24s. was the value of them on that day; my character stands pretty good, or I should not return between seventy and eighty thousand a year.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher, in Aldgate High-street, commonly called Whitechapel: I bought some sheep on the 1st of April last, at Romford, on a Saturday, they were eighteen wether sheep there was a brand on the near side, and a mark of oakum on the rump; there was one particular skin that was not defective, that was marked R B on the side, it was one of the sheep bought of Collier; there was one of them a thick horned sheep; there was a country drover, I called to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190005"/>him, and told him there are eighteen sheep at Mr. Collier's, you bring them up, which he did; he brought them up to Mile-end; and my drover brought them home; I am satisfied the sheep I had delivered to me were the sheep I purchased at Romford; I examined them, and I observed the thick horned sheep among them, and they were all red oakum'd down the rump; before any enquiry took place, I had killed ten; the skins were gone and sold to the tanners; I sold the whole together when I sold them; I was not at home when Mr. Willis came; then there were eight remaining, and the thick horned one among them; that was the Saturday after the Thursday I spoke of; since Mr. Willis has seen them, I killed the others; I told them I would keep one of the skins, but my servant gave it to the sell-monger with the others; I did not know any thing about it; Willis saw them on the Thursday, I took him to the stable myself; they were along with a great many more sheep, and he pointed them out himself; then I said, those are the sheep I bought of Collier; says I, we will draw them out, there were eight; he recollected the thick horned sheep very well.</p>

             sworn. - I am in the service of the prosecutor: I am a Custom-house watchman; I was going down to the Custom-house, on the 30th of May, Thursday, in the evening, about six o'clock; I turned out of Thames-street, and up a gateway that leads up to the Custom-house quays, and I saw a man coming from the Hull crane, where the Hull vessels unload their goods; I saw him coming with the linen under his coat, some Irish sheeting; I did not stop him then, but the manner of his coming gave me a suspicion; I let him pass me, and I followed him till he came into Thames-street, and then he set off running up Water-lane; I cried out stop thief; he run about five yards, and then dropped the linen; he was stopped by two watchmen near Syms's coffee-house; he was brought to the quays, and gave but a poor account of himself; he said a man gave him a shilling to carry it to some house.</p>

               <p>- CALVERT sworn. - I command a vessel; the linen was landed by a company of ticket porters; it was a rainy day, and could not he forwarded home; I imagine if it had been totally lost, I should have been accountable for it; I took it under my charge again.</p>
               <p>William Green, a constable, produced the linen.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Calvert). Is that the same linen? - A. It looks like the same linen; the pack was cut open, and there was just room for such a bundle as this.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't be too positive at first - say whether you can positively swear to him? - A. I can positively swear to him; I saw him twice, and had a full sight of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What bundle was this you had? - A. It was a coat, stockings, and shoes, in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you tell your master you had lost the bundle? - A. I don't know what it was o'clock, my master did not come home till late, he was out at supper.</p>

               <p>Q. They were striking you, and they attempted to rob you, and pull this bundle from you, how came you not to cry out to the coachman? - A. I had not that thought.</p>
               <p>Q. You really did not call to the coachman? - A. No, I did not make any noise till I got up; they only pulled me from the coach, and I fell down; I got up again, and ran after them, and then I called out.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Excise, I was in company with one Hughes, on Sunday, who is an officer; I had been to see him on duty, and after duty he came with me, it might be between the hours of five and seven; we came into Hyde-street, Bloomsbury, I proceeded from Hyde-street to Castle-street; I don't exactly know the hour; as we were going along Castle-street, two men, the prisoners at the bar, passed us, with a bundle under each arm; the first of my perceiving the prisoners was in Castle-street; I pursued them to Dyot-street, St. Giles's, No. 27, marked with chalk only; I don't know that it is the number now, I saw them go in, and I pursued them close to the door; I was within three or four yards of the hindermost man, and should have caught him had he had a dozen yards further to run, the hindermost man was the tallest; they both run, but the other was considerably before; I pursued them to the door, where a girl attempted to shut the door, but I prevented it, I stood between the door and the door-case, or jam, as they call it, they began running the moment they passed us; they were rather running when they did pass us, but they saw we noticed them, and they then run as fast as they could. I staid in the frame of the door, when my friend holloaed out "Day, don't go any further, for you will be murdered;" for I had out-run my friend; with that I made a pause, and drew back to him, which might be the space of half-a-dozen yards; I then saw a man coming, Cummins, and some other people running down the street, he ran into the house; I drew up to the door again, considering myself in more danger than I was before, I did not go into the house with Cummins; while I staid contending with my friend, I heard a noise in the house, a holloaing, and tumbling three or four stairs down at a time, like a scuffle; by that time there were several people collected together about the door, I pressed through them, and went towards the stair-case, the prisoner, Duggan, and the man whom they called Cummins, came falling down the stairs together, one over the other; I then perceiving that Cummins was endeavouring to take the prisoner, I assisted him, and received a violent blow, I don't know from whom, but either from the prisoner or from Cummins; they got the prisoner into the street, I was rather stunned for the moment, I don't know what became of the other prisoner; but after some little scuffle in the street, the other prisoner was brought by some other persons; they took them to the watch-house, and took charge of the bundles; there were two bundles, one was a silk bird's-eye handkerchief, and the other was a white napkin, or handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time was this? - A. Between the hours of five and seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190008"/>Q. When you came to this house did you enter it at all? - A. I went to the threshold first, where a girl attempted to shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in at all? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in the house? - A. There was a girl who attempted to shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have staid at the door of the house? - A. But a very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. A few minutes? - A. I consider I was there but a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any back yard to the house? - A. I believe there is, I have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a wall broken down, through which the prisoners might have escaped? - A. I really don't know, there was a back yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other men might have been in the house, you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoners in Castle-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw their faces? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at Bow-street, you never saw the faces of the men, only their backs? - A. I really said at Bow-street, I could state the facts, and undertake to swear they were the two men; it was my friend that said he could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Hughes knows no more than you? - A. No; he says he don't know that he should know their faces.</p>

My father was a plaisterer, and this man was a bricklayer, and he does this for nothing but spite.</p>

               <p>Miller. The gentleman at Bow-street declined saying that he said he could not swear to the paper, or tell whether it was in the book or his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor). Q. Did you say so at Bow-street? - A. I could not say whether it was in the pocket-book or not, but the paper is mine, it might have got out of the pocket-book, I had put it in some time before; when I first had it I put it in, it was given me by a little girl; I cannot swear whether it was in the pocket-book at that time; it was a jacket I had on, and it was on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Sharpless's defence. I worked at Mr. Kelly's, in the Strand, a coach-harness-maker, I had left there about a fortnight before, and I saw this young woman; we got into a conversation together, and were coming down home, when we were stopped.</p>
               <p>Mansell's defence. I drive a hackney-coach, night-work; I was going up to Newman-street, as I had some money owing me there; I did not know these people before; I saw them before me forty yards, and seeing a row, I goes down, and Crocker lays hold of me.</p>

             sworn. - I am master of the workhouse where the prisoner was supported, in the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster; I have a dwelling-house there, and dwell there as the master; nine o'clock is the latest hour for locking up the paupers, and the prisoner was locked in the ward No. 15, the ward he was making his escape over; the prisoner was locked up in the evening in his ward; I was informed by the pantry-man there was a robbery committed, and I went to the spot, and Giles, and the witness were in the garden, the garden gate was locked; when I came up, he was in custody in the garden, there was no communication with the house; I saw the property taken from him, which was a ball of woollen yarn; I did not examine from what part of the premises it had been taken till next morning, then I examined the door, and I found all fastened as before, except the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find how the warehouse, where the yarn had been deposited, had been entered? - A. Not till the next morning; it had been entered by pulling down a board that fastened up a window, through which he put his arms, that was the way the entry was effected, there could be no other way; it was taken out of what we call the spinning-shop; I was in the garden at half past eight o'clock, and every thing was very safe then; there was no ladder in the garden then, and no window open whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. After a person had entered the workhouse, could he have opened the windows in the way you speak of? - A. Yes, they slide backwards and forwards; there was the mark of a person's feet in the garden, and he could get into that house by pulling down a board, and he could undraw the window; all was secure when I left it, because I walked backwards and forwards there; the value of the yarn is eighteen pence; they were arguing about the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing about it, had you made him any promises or threats? - A. No; they were arguing about it; I said I believed it was three pounds; and he said it was three pounds and a quarter, or three pounds and an ounce; he was in the habit of balling those yarns.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he came from the wards, what did he do? - A. He must come into the back yard, where they are all locked up, and pull down a board, and go through the window into the shop; he was caught upon the top of the house, and was then making his escape: he took a small ladder out of the work-shop to get upon the tiles, he then could get into the street; he could have made his escape by going over that room very easily; the roof was next to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What interest have you in the house? - A. I am master of it, I have a salary for taking care of it, the parish pays the rent; I do not occupy the whole house myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the profits of the manufacture? - A. The parish.(

I cannot swear to him, I never saw the man before or since to my knowledge; I saw the watchman with the blanket; to the best of my knowledge they are mine, there is no particular mark, I did not go up stairs to see whether the articles were missing; I went down, and then we took the man in soldier's clothes to the watch-house, on suspicion of stealing the clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take up the blanket, or any thing? - A.No, I got them, he did not; he did not make any claim to the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing with the property? - A. I cannot swear he chucked them out.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came out of the house, did he take up the property? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He brought me an old guinea, for I had it in my hand, and looked at it; and after that, his master gave me his knife.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Jones.) Q. Did you ever offer any money to this man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No guinea? - A. No; I had not a thought of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Trebel never gave you any money for it in part of purchase? - A. No; I know no more about it only fetching it away.</p>

I was going home about ten o'clock on Saturday night, I was a little in liquor I own; I was going along the side of the wall, and a man came running by me, and almost knocked me down, I heard the cry of stop thief, and I walked on; I had not walked above ten yards when the coachman came up, and said I had got his coat; your coat, says I, it is on my back if I have, for I have no other; says he, I have lost my coat, and he took me to his master's house; I told him to take me where he liked; after that they took me to the watch-house; this good lady said, at Hatton-garden, there were other persons passing at the time, and she could not swear to me.</p>

               <p>ROBERT JOHNSTONE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you robbed on the 17th of May? - A. On Friday the 17th of May, I was walking down the Strand, about one o'clock, and just as I was crossing <placeName id="t17990619-15-crimeloc85">Hungerford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17990619-15-crimeloc85" type="placeName" value="Hungerford-street"/>

                        targets="t17990619-15-off83 t17990619-15-crimeloc85"/>, I felt something like a hand in my pocket, and knowing I had a deal of property, I put my hand, and missed the pocket-book; I turned my head, and observed the prisoner at the bar crossing the street, and entering into a court, I think it is called Church-court, the other side of the Strand; I pursued him into the court, and seized him by the shoulder, I shook him very severely; says I, it is you that took my pocket-book; says he, upon my honour, sir, you are mistaken, I am no such person; I gave him another shake, and he let the book fall; I did not pick it up, but my son, a lad who was there, had a smaller hand than I, and he took it out of a grating, and handed it to me; here is the pocket-book, in my right-hand; the notes were upwards of one hundred pounds value, and I have not the least doubt of it being my property. There were two gentlemen present, whom I never saw before, and who attend here to prove the fact.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time was this? - A. It was, to be certain, between the hours of twelve and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that in Church-court there were no other persons walking up and down? - A. I mean to say there was no other person near the prisoner and I when I accused him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the pocket-book? - A.Upwards of six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark that you know it by? - A.There is a memorandom in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in it at the time? - A. I presume it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it? - A. I am pretty certain it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Having had it six months, it is a little the worse for wear-is it worth more than eight-pence, or ten-pence? - A. The notes are worth a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Independent of the notes? - A. I think it is worth a shilling.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see the book in the prisoner's possession? - A. I did, I saw him drop it; he dropped it in this manner, (describing it); I recovered all my property.</p>

Last Saturday, the 15th of June, I went out about ten o'clock among my customers, and I told one of my servants to pour off six hundred weight of tin bar; upon which, when I came home, the man said, he was short; the prisoner was not by; the man said, there was six pounds missing; I asked, where is Longstaffe? says he, he is just gone out; I sent after him, and he was brought back from where he was, and he came into the yard; I said to him, Longstaffe, I have suspected you a long time, I miss some metal, and I think you have got it; I missed about five pounds and a half of tin bar; upon which he was walking off again, I followed him just round the accompting-house; he wore a pair of trowsers and an apron;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190017"/>says I, stop, I will see whether you have got it about you; he took up his apron, says he, I have got the metal; upon which, I saw the end of this bar sticking out of his breeches, wrapped up in brown paper, upon which, I sent for an officer, who took them out; he wanted to take them out himself, but I told him to stop; it is poured in a mould; it weighed five pounds and a half, what was taken from him; it costs ninety-seven shillings a hundred, about ten-pence halfpenny a pound; I value it at four shillings, and I am satisfied it was mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You can take upon yourself to swear it was your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear it, from the circumstance that but few persons had such metal as you had? - A. Not above three make it.</p>
               <p>Q. If there are two or three in the trade who make such sort of property, and cast it in moulds, I should like to know how you can distinguish that to be your's? - A. Every man's moulds differ.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that round about this great town there may not be moulds of the same dimensions? - A. There are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that? - A. Yes, positively.</p>
               <p>Q. However, two or three persons might have such bars as these? - A. No, no person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying there were two or three persons having such moulds? - A. There might be persons having bar moulds, but mine is smaller than their's.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other people who make tin bars? - A. I believe there are two or three more.</p>
               <p>Q. They may have such moulds, may they not? - A. I don't think there are such moulds in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear they may not have such? - A. There are not, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there are not? - A. I have not their moulds into my moulds; that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. But we are to try whether you are right? - A. I don't come here with any evil design; I have a number of men about me, and I am bound to do this.</p>
               <p>Q. If other persons, three or four in the trade, deal in the article you deal in, they may have moulds that you have not seen, though you may swear they are your's - I want you to satisfy the Jury, why you are enabled to swear to this particular mould? - A. There is not another mould in the trade that this bar would sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the other moulds in order to form that conclusion; because there are but few in number, have you seen their moulds in order so to judge, whether they are different from your's? - A. We have only one mould maker, and I had mine made in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>Q.Does he make moulds for other people? - A. He may.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know he works for other persons? - A. I can say it was poured into my mould, and that is enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You shall give an answer whether he is employed by other persons? - A. I am not certain whether they were not made under my own roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they were? - A. I believe they were cast by Mr. Horseley, somewhere at Hoxton; if I made a pattern, and sent it to Mr. Horseley, and said, make me a mould to that pattern, he would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see another pattern of the same sort and dimensions? - A. No, I never did; they are cast a great deal larger.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that other persons, having occasion for light moulds, may not have had them cast? - A. If I was to talk till to-morrow morning, I can only say this was cast in my mould; and I have been a great sufferer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is there any mark upon your tin bar, your private mark? - A. No, there is no private mark; because, perhaps, in the course of a day, we pour three or four ton of bar.</p>
               <p>Q. He was off the premisses when he was stopped, and came back with the metal upon him? - A. He said, to me, I have got the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the metal you took from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the moulds in Court? - A. No; they are very heavy.</p>
               <p>Q.After you found this metal, did you fit it to the mould? - A. I did not; here is a salt-cellar that I can swear to be mine, it is cast in a mould that I have; he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. You weighed the whole six hundred weight, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned back, can you swear that this, which is said to be found on him, is the same metal you had weighed? - A. I cannot tell,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190018"/>I did not see him take it out of the scale, I cannot say; it is the same sort of metal.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen such metal before? - A. Yes, in one other place.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not particular to your master to have such metal as that - any other person may have such metal as that? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I took it out of his breeches; this salt-cellar was in his coat pocket; as I was taking him to the Justice, he informed me he had taken it only to try an experiment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was servant to Mr. Yates, to make regulus: Mr. Yates some time ago desired me to put some of this kind of tin into my composition, to make it better; last Saturday that ever was I went to work, Mr. Yates had very bad coals, I got one pot of doubles, but it turned out very bad, I could not get on very well, but I did get on single upon this tin; Mr. Yates told me to take any of this tin to put into the metal to bring it to a proper bearing, as I told you before; he told me to take it out of the shop when I wanted it; I took it with me because I would not leave it in my shop, for fear it should be taken away.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Yates.) Q. Did you give him leave? - A. My Lord it is not true; regulus consists of antimony and tin cuttings.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give him any authority? - A. No; he had no business in the shop where it was, he worked in a separate building; a month or two ago, he said, I will take a little bit of tin, and put into the regulus, which he did, and says he it does better; I cannot say whether he put it in or not; however, he had no authority from me to take this.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. No person walking past could see it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along the street, and two boys asked me to go into the shop and ask what was the price of a pair of stockings like mine; I said, my stockings were not big enough for them; they said, they had a brother as big as me, and my stockings would sit him; I went in, and asked, and when I came out, they gave me a shilling, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190019"/>things to carry for them, and told me to say they were my father's; I was going along, and this gentleman stopped me; and I said they were my father's, and how that two boys gave them to me to carry; they both run away, and left me, and the gentleman took me before the Justice. I have one witness, my father is not here.</p>

I went on the Saturday before it was due, and told the young Count I had brought a note of twenty-five pounds; he then said, I am not of age, I shall not pay the note; I went up stairs to him, and says he, I did not give my note; says I, will you be kind enough to write your name on a piece of paper, which he did; says I it resembles this note; the old gentleman, the father, was going to take me by the collar, and put me out of the room-upon my soul it is true - I wish I had that bit of paper now.

             sworn. -Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you lived with young Count Wedel as his tutor? - A. Yes, I did; at No. 34, Wimpole-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you well acquainted with the hand-writing of the count? - A. Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether the acceptance is his hand-writing or not? - A. According to my best knowledge it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it or not? - A. I have not the least reason to believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it not to be his? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it, in your knowledge, resemble the Count's hand-writing? - A. I think not; there is a resemblance in every hand-writing, I cannot go so far as to say there is no resemblance at all; I can only say, it is a hand-writing entirely different from his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. (As delivered by the interpreter from the prisoner.) He says, that Count Hermendt Wedel had business with him about six months ago; he lent him money; he lent him a draft, which was honoured the first time; William Marshall knew it perfectly well, and a gentleman in Court. Count Wedel came to him, and told him he was in want of forty pounds; he took him to his friend, who lent it him; on the morrow this note was paid to his friend: Count Wedel can write three or four different hands, fearful his father should know his hand-writing: after that he lent Count Wedel twenty-five pounds, and the note which he paid him he gave to

            : Count Wedel denied it being his signature, and so he has been arrested in consequence of that note. Count Wedel has three or four different signatures, fearful of his father being displeased with him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marshall.) The prisoner says, he gave you a note at another time? - A. He did, my Lord, it was fifty-nine pounds, drawn on Count Wedel, and paid at Thellusson's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Count Frederick.) The witness has said, your brother has two or three manners of signing his name; do you know any thing of it? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Nitcsh.) Do you know any thing of Count Wedel having two or three methods of signing his name? - A. No, my Lord, only one that I know of.</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The prisoner says, he supposes the Count never alters his hand-writing before the persons of the house, or before the persons that are with him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marshall.) Was the first note drawn by Count Wedel, or upon him? - A. I am not sure whether it was Count Wedel or his father it belonged to, it was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was drawn upon him or by him? - A. I don't know whether it was upon him or his father.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell who was the drawer or the acceptor of the 59l. bill? - A. No, I took it from the Danish Ambassador's house.</p>

             not to present the note to the Count before his father, for that his father would be displeased.</p>
               <p>Marshall. It is exactly so, and he told me the Count's mother would send money from abroad to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190021"/>pay the note; says he, perhaps it may not be paid then, but in a few days after; that the money might be sent by his mother from abroad.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Were father and son both present when you presented it? - A.Both in the dining-room, and were going to put me out of the window, because I said, it was exactly like that he wrote on the piece of paper: the son was even so exasperated, that he threatened to throw me out of the window, and I was obliged to call for assistance. I would give a guinea if I had that bit of paper now that I asked him to write his name upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the young man did not refuse to pay it before he was in a rage? - A. There was something of that sort, I was then in the passage along with the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing of that sort - did you hear it? - A.Upon my soul, I did; says he, I cannot pay it, I am not of age; and I told the servant I would keep it till he was of age; I had not produced it, but told him I had it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When he saw it, he denied it? - A. Yes.</p>

            , Esq. Member of Parliament, who lives in Upper Harley-street; I have left him three days; I know the prisoner perfectly well, and I know the Count and his brother by fight; I have seen them at the prisoner's house repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any money transactions between Count Hermendt and the prisoner? - A. Somewhere about the latter end of November, or beginning of December last, I was writing out a bill of fare for the prisoner, and I think, he came and took away the pen and ink from me; these gentlemen were in another room, and were there for a considerable time; after having been there some time, I heard very high words, as if they were in anger with each other; I was called in; the conversation was then in French; the young gentleman wished to change it; the prisoner called me in, and the gentlemen changed the conversation into French; some part of the noise of words I had heard were in English, and when I was called in, it was turned to French immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sufficiently acquainted with the French language to tell us, whether there was any conversation about cash or notes? - A. I am not conversant in French, but, as far as I do know, I am almost certain there was a conversation about money transactions; there was one thing particular; there was another person in the room, whom I did not know, and who ought to be here; he was brought in as a witness by the prisoner; the prisoner was present, and that young gentleman; I asked the cause of all this; he said, it was concerning the note and pocket-book that was lost during the time he was with them, but he could not tell the manner in which it was lost; it was a note for ninety odd pounds; this person was called upon, who said, he had seen the note, and advised them to make another; they wrote another as a substitute for that which was lost; that was the ground of the quarrel; afterwards, however, every thing was quiet, and the gentlemen came to the adjoining room where I had been writing, and they told me they had been angry on all sides, but they had settled it, and hoped I would say nothing about it, and made me a present to hold my tongue; I received two shillings to keep the secret.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Count Frederick.) You have heard what that witness has said? - A. The whole is a swindling piece of business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you a servant in the prisoner's house? - A. I was not, I went merely to assist him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Dupont? - A.No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever called yourself so? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you then been acquainted with the prisoner? - A. Not quite so much as three months, about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse with him? - A. Yes, almost every day, for five or six hours.</p>
               <p>Q. As you went to assist him, did you take your orders from him? - A. I might do as I pleased; I did it merely as a friend, not as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a regard and friendship for him? - A. I had, in consequence of a friend of mine knowing him longer than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you converse? - A. But indifferently, I not understanding French, and he not English.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not understand what he said to you? - A. I understood at times what he said, and at times I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you understood him, were not those the times he talked English? - A.Certainly; he talked English so far, that after I had been there some time, I understood him, but not so well at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he converse with his customers, in English? - A. He did, but in bad English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse with him on every subject? - A. On matters that might occur about the news of the day.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he did not understand you when you spoke in English? - A. He improves in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what occurred, in any other language? - A. I spoke a little in both, but very imperfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190022"/>Q. Did you understand French when you went first? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, in what language did you converse with him? - A. I could not very well converse with him; there were people in the house that understood English better than him, and they acted as interpreters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ any body to interpret for him? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the usual practice? - A. In general it was: when I did not understand him, I applied to those who did; every conversation that passed between us must be very imperfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he cannot talk English very fluently? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was capable of stating that examination in English? - A. I don't think he could comprehend the true sense of it, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you here when the Magistrate was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you now swear he was not capable of of understanding that in English? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present when you were called into the room? - A.Those two gentlemen, the prisoner, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell his name? - A.Probably the prisoner may tell, I do not know, I never saw him but twice, and both times at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. It passed about December? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not his name Dupont? A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not hear him called Dupont? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He had some name? - A.Most undoubtedly</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought him there? - A. I don't know, I believe the prisoner; I think once I saw him come in, and once he was in the room when I entered.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay? - A. One time, I believe, about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared like a foreigner? - A. He was not English.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to pledge your oath you did not hear him called Dupont? - A. To my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever called by his name when he was there? - A. I don't recollect he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not introduced as Mr. Dupont? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not called Dupont? A. I had no suspicion of any thing of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. What suspicion have you about his name being Dupont? - A. I don't know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he was not called Dupont? - A. I think he was not, but I will not take an oath.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he call upon? - A. I believe the prisoner went out with him about this dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he been before? - A. I cannot tell; it was concerning the note they conversed; I could not comprehend exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since that man went into the country? - A. I don't know, I was at Bath, but I have heard he is out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination of the prisoner? - A. I never saw him since his commitment till yesterday; I was in a confined situation, being in service.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear he was in prison A. I cannot say exactly say when it was, but I think it was in February that I heard he was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go him? - A. I could not go, I was at Bath; a friend of mine wrote to me, and mentioned it in the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to him? - A. I had a respect for the man, and I wished to see him.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to know he was in Newgate? - A. He wrote by a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in town? - A. About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive information from your friend he was in Newgate? - A.Ever since I have been in town, but I was contined; I received information the very day he came here; I never called or saw him till yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call in consequence of any desire, or on your own suggestion? - A. He desired to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention this circumstance to any body, or whatever you have heard of those two gentlemen, and about the note? - A. I have mentioned it to every body I know, and that knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you mention it first? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it directly? - A. Yes, after my understanding it was a forgery; I had too good an opinion of the prisoner to believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see any note written by those gentlemen? - A. I did not see the note my self.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore they wrote a note? - A. They came to me for ink.</p>
               <p>Q. They were advised to write another? - A. That is as I am informed, I did not see the note; every thing was carried on privately.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is only from information that you knew upon what subject they were talking? - A. Principally by information.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you upon what subject they were talking, and upon what subject they met? - A. The prisoner told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to be secret? - A. That gen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190023"/>tleman; he said, there had been a dispute, and hoped I would take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know you before? - A. They had seen me once or twice in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they employ him in the confectionary way? - A. I don't know that they did; I think not, but cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they ever conversed with you before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They gave you two shillings to keep a secret? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you heard any secret? - A. Not that I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk French, or join them in conversation at all? - A. No, I promised I would not mention it, and I would not now, except to save the man's life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you publish this story to every body you knew? - A. You asked me if I knew of those transactions you mentioned; I said, I did; it was not for the transactions, but for the quarrel I received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not receive the money to keep the money transactions secret, but to keep the quarrel secret - was that the reason? - A. I don't know really, it might be for both.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Count Frederick). Do you remember the transaction the last witness has mentioned - you have heard of the bill of fifty-nine pounds said to be given by your brother - do you happen to be acquainted with that transaction? - A. Yes, I was; my brother's name was not upon the note; the bill was drawn upon Thellusson, and came from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose was that note put into the hands of the prisoner? - A. It was a commission, we intended to pay him the money; the debt was only forty-eight pounds, but there was a commission, ten pounds, and we gave him the difference.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom was that debt due? - A. We promised not to tell; if the prisoner chuses to mention it, he knows that it was none of our debts, but some body's else; it was neither myself or brother's, but a commission.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about a bill of ninety pounds? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of losing a pocket-book? - A. If you will give me leave, I will state that. About six weeks before that, he sent a letter, inclosing a promissory note; he sent a letter written in English, and a note, requesting an acceptance, saying, he could get the money for it; and that in the course of six weeks he should get the money; we signed the note for him at six weeks, upon which, some days after the six weeks were elapsed, he came with another note of fifty-eight pounds, upon which we asked him to give us back our note: we frequently went to him to get our note back, but he always had some excuse, saying, he could not get it, the gentleman would not give him the money for it, and would not let us know where it was, which made us suspect it would not be returned, this was after the six weeks: then we happened to want some money, and we asked him if he would lend us forty pounds for a little while; he said, yes, he would; then he said, he would certainly give it us, only he had spent some of it, about ten or twenty pounds; he said, he knew a gentleman who would lend us forty pounds; we went to that gentleman, and told him we would be very much obliged to him to get us forty pounds; about twelve o'clock the gentleman came with about thirty pounds, or something near; I believe he mentioned some name that commenced with an H; we asked him to make up the forty pounds; he then made up a story that he had lost his pocket-book; after this we went away, and we promised we would return it the same evening, about eight or nine o'clock; we came to the prisoner's house to Mr.

            and returned the thirty pounds, and he returned the note, and we gave him a guinea; we begged of the prisoner not to detain our note, he always having some excuse; at last we heard he had offered to sell it for a much less price than the value of the note; we asked him about it, and he swore he never shewed the note to any body; we heard he presented the note: after that a gentleman came and told us he offered to sell the note to him; we told him that we would call that person for a witness, and that we knew he had the note in his house; he then got in a passion, and swore that the note was not in the house, and that if he had it, he would return it; this was the dispute about which the other witness spoke: we told him we would take him up if he did not return it, upon which he called in that gentleman, and we thought it right to call the other gentleman who told us he wanted to sell the note; he fetched him, and at last he went up stairs to a little garret, and brought us the note out of a pocket-book: after this, we told him it was a swindling piece of business, and we could have had him taken up and punished, but we would pardon him, if he would promise not to do any thing like is again; he said, it certainly was the first and the last time that we should find him out in any thing like it; when we went away, we gave him two shillings, as a water, not to mention that we had a quarrel with his master, for that it was all settled: we went to Bath, and, in the mean while, he forged this note; we went to Bath immediately after this dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home when Marshall brought the bill to your brother for payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your father there when he first came? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190024"/>A. No, my father was not, but my brother went down to the butcher and told him.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Tingle: I remember the prisoner coming to my master's house with the delivery-book, I cannot say that is the book: On Wednesday, the 15th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the room at the back of the shop, Mr. Tingle was with me, Williams came in, threw the book on the counter, and made a remark on the coldness of the weather; he went immediately down the steps, and I observed he was intoxicated, for he appeared to be so; immediately as he had gone out, I went into the shop to serve something, that took me up but a few minutes; when the person went out, I observed the lid of the book to stick up, I had the curiosity to open it, and found a letter in it, with the seal upwards, broke; I turned it, and found it was directed to Mr. Jeffryes, Salisbury-square, Fleet-street; I made Mr. Tingle acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter? - A. I believe it is, but I will not undertake to swear to it, because I put no particular marks to it; I observed the direction of it; when I took it into the room, Mr. Tingle observed the seal broke, and the direction; he opened the letter, and in it was a piece of paper; he opened it, and it was a Shaftesbury and Salisbury Bank-note; he then read the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? - A. I believe it is, but I will not attempt to swear to it, because I put no particular mark on it, it is just such a note; I did not see the prisoner again till the next morning, some time after nine o'clock, I cannot say how long after; he had been there before in the morning, but I was not there: the first words he said were, "now, about these breeches;" he had desired me to shew him patterns, and measure him; he then asked if I had found the book; I told him I had just come in, and would look for it, and I pretended to be looking for it among the goods; Mr. Tingle went to the Post-office; he urged me to look for the book, and told me there was a letter in it: he said nothing more than that there was a letter, and for God's sake to look for the book, or words to that effect; I told him if he would call again, I had not a doubt but he would hear of the book: he called again, I think, between eleven and twelve, and asked me if I had found the book, and had he not left it on the counter the evening before; I said, why do you want the book; says he, there is in the letter a Salisbury Bank-note of ten pounds. I asked him if it was a letter he had been directed to deliver; he said, no it was a letter he was going to take back to get it allowed; he said, for God's sake, don't let any person see it, because I would not have it lost for a thousand guineas. I thought he appeared very much agitated the last time, because it might be owing to his being a feeble old man; I cannot pretend to say how his feelings were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say it might arise from his being a very old man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very drunk the night before? - A. very much so.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not endeavour to hide the book - he put it, as he usually did, upon the counter? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. No endeavour to conceal it? - A. No, not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning he had called before you saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted to take it back to have it allowed? - A. He said that the third time of coming.</p>
               <p>Q.Allowed what? - A. I understand by saying allowed, the letter had been over-charged, and he was taking it back to have it rectified.</p>
               <p>Q. He was anxious it should be found, and looked for? - A.Very so.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been in the neighbourhood long? - A. I have not been in the neighbourhood myself more than seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at all concerned in the management of the receiving-house? - A. Mr. Tingle entrusts me in the afternoon at four or five o'clock to see the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, at your receiving-house, to which the postman brings the book, it has not happened before that you have had letters directed there which happened not to be in the delivery of the person who resorts to your receiving-house? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this letter came to be delivered in the division the prisoner was concerned in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have know him as long as you have been there? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, unfortunately, he drinks hard at times? - A.Very so.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, a mistake would be more likely to happen to an old, infirm, and drunken man, than to a person who is steady? - A. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. In what condition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190026"/>was the letter? - A. The seal was broke, and that side towards me: he ought to have delivered it on the Tuesday, but did not till the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Tingle). You said Davis brought you the book - did you observe any thing in the book when he brought it? - A. Yes, a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it directed? - A. To Mr. H. Jeffryes, Salisbury-square, London; I cannot swear to the letter, there is no mark upon it, it was like this; I opened it in the presence of Davis, the seal was broke; I found in it a ten pound Salisbury and Shaftesbury note; I cannot swear to it, I did not mark it, it was such a note as that; I read it over, and I believe that to be the letter; I remember the contents of it; I immediately put it in the book again, and I put a mark upon the book in the presence of Davis, and that is the place I I marked it in; I took the letter with me to the post-office, to Mr. Stone's office; he was not in the way, and I brought it back and locked it up till eleven o'clock the next morning; I saw the prisoner the first time he came, about nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect, which was rather unusual for him to come at that time; he asked me for the book; I told him, I did not know of it; he came round the counter to look into the drawer for it, and turned over all the books, and it was not there; I made some frivolous excuse that Davis was out of the way, and the book was mislaid; it was then locked up; he wished particularly for the book; he did not say there was any thing in it: I was in the back room, and saw him come in twice afterwards; he came in, and was asking to be shewn some patterns, or to be measured, or something of that kind; I heard him; he wanted particularly the book; I heard him say it was a letter that was overcharged to be allowed, or something of the kind; I delivered it to Mr. Stone on Thursday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have been acquainted with the prisoner some time? - A. Yes, I have known him for sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him to be often intoxicated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. An accident coming to him would be more likely to happen to him than to any person almost? - A. I make no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not add, that he was anxious to get the letter, that he might return it? - A. That he might get it allowed at the post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he wished to take it back, for that it was a letter given to him out of his delivery? - A. In mistake he put it into the delivery-book, instead of putting it into his pocket-book, I heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the book left in any place concealed? - A. No, on the counter, thrown carelessly down.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbett. Q. You, I believe, are inspector of the letter-carriers in the post-office? - A. Yes; I was attending on Wednesday, the 15th of May; I knew the prisoner, he was at the Post-office that morning, and was employed as a sorter of paid for and franked letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain to us into how many divisions London is divided? - A. Twelve; the prisoner was employed in division six.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, in that division? - A. Yes, but it is not in the district of the prisoner's delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his duty, when attending there as a sorter? - A. To take no letters but his own; if he has letters, not in his own district, he should put those letters to those to whom they belong.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he had an opportunity of taking a letter that belonged to another? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that London mark, and see whether you can tell when it came? - A. The 15th; the post comes from Marlborough in one day; there was no carriage to be paid by the person who received it, because it is post-paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand it is the duty of a sorter, in his particular division, to take only those letters which he is to deliver? - A. No other; if he should chance to put his hand upon another, he should hand it over.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask, whether, in point of fact, in the post-office, men have not taken accidentally letters out of another division than their own? - A.There has been such mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, we have heard, was a drunken man? - A. Rather so, but I never saw him intoxicated on his duty in the office; he was not intoxicated in the morning the letters were sorted.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the coach is not changed from Marlborough to London? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190027"/>Mr. Abbott. Q. You say, it sometimes happens that a letter gets into the hands of a carrier it does not belong to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the duty of that carrier? - A. If he has not an opportunity of delivering it to the proper carrier that day, he should bring it the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How long had he been employed in the post-office? - A.Sixteen or seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing back a letter that had been given him by mistake? - A. It is impossible for me to say.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what you know of the prisoner, and the note in question? - A. To the best of my recollection it was on the 9th of May, the prisoner came to me; however, to make sure, it was the day before the persons were tried for the murder last sessions; he came into the shop, about six o'clock in the evening, and looked about him; at last, he asked me what I called that; I told him, beef; he run his hand over it, and asked about how much four ribs would weigh; I said, between twenty and thirty pounds; I supposed he did not want so much; he never offered to agree for any price, or the weight; I put the hook into the beef again, and took no more heed of him than being a stranger, I left him to compose himself; he took himself out of the shop, and came back again between the hours of eight and nine, I am not particular to half an hour, it might be two hours and a half; I was behind the door, he knocked, and I asked who was there; he said, it is me; I let him in and he said, he had much difficulty in finding me only, he asked if I had parted with the beef; I took it down, and says he, I should like a piece about here, what will that weigh; I said, about twenty pounds; upon which I asked him how much he wanted; he said, about twelve pounds; I cut twelve pounds and a quarter bare weight, I did not charge him for the quarter; he said he had got ne'er a cloth; I think I said I would give him a sheet of paper; after the beef was put up, he desired me to put the price down, it came to seven shillings and sixpence; he got into conversation, and asked me whether I sold rumps of beef at the same price; he then offered to pay for the beef, and pulled out of his pocket two sixpences, two farthings, and a locket; he held one of the farthings pretty close to his eye, and said, I thought it had been half-a-guinea; he then put his money into his pocket, and pulled out a pocket-book, he opened his book, and laid it on the counter; I saw it had in it a five pound note, and another two pound note, beside the note he gave me; says he, can you change this; I said I would see; I took it to the public-house hard by, and I said, I think I have got a bad customer; I did not ask for change, but I asked for their judgment; I formed my judgement that it was a bad note; I did not offer the bad note, but I came back to the shop, and told him I could not help thinking it was a bad note; says he, God bless me! he looked at it at a distance, and said, it is a good Bank of England note; I asked him to go with me to the public-house, and one person said, the name at the bottom was not some man's hand-writing, that was all the objection they made to it; the remark I made, was, that the mark at the bottom looked newer; when we got to the public-house, the company seemed to be of opinion it was bad; I took up the five pound note which he had produced, and which I supposed to be good, and put it into my pocket, and told him, I should hold him in custody till such time as he proved where he got them. He did not give any particular account where he got them at that time; he pointed at some gentleman who knew him, and not wishing to hold an innocent man, I went to the gentleman's house, to Mr. Deputy Pinder, Ludgate-hill, he said he knew him; I went, and the gentleman was not at home; he then desired me to go to the Kings-and-keys, in Fleet-street, but I objected to his going there, my friends agreed to take him into the Hole-in-the-wall, in Fleet-street, and for him to send for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190028"/>any person that could give an account of him, or who he was; he sent for an old gentleman, who did know him by name; there were a great many people in the house, and he made a vast complaint that I had robbed him of the notes, and that I wanted to swear his life away; and the people began to say I was doing wrong by holding the notes, and that I should have an action against me; so in consequence of that, I went up to the watch-house, and got a constable, and gave him in charge; he was taken, I believe, to the Compter; having delivered him to the constable, I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note, and say whether it is the same? - A. I have not the smallest doubt but it is the same, because I made a private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When he came the last time it was night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And not much light in the room? - A. Only one candle on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light that a man, where he stood, might by change take out a farthing, and suppose it to be half-a-guinea? - A. He stood as near as this to the candle.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said it was a bad note, he immediately exclaimed, with a great surprise, it was a good one? - A. He said it was a good note.</p>
               <p>Q. But you afterwards told him it was a bad note? - A. I did not tell him it was a bad note at first, I told him after I came back to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. He went to the public-house? - A. Yes; I would not let him do any otherways.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refuse to go? - A. No, he did not.</p>

             sworn. - I am the constable who took charge of the prisoner, and conveyed him to the watch-house; I searched him at the watch-house, and in the search, I found a two pound note, some gold, two guineas I believe; and afterwards I found, in a bit of a leather sob, seven duplicates, two rings, and locket; and many other things, which I had no business with; I kept the locket, the two pound note, a one pound note, and a five pound note which the butcher gave me; I cannot positively say how much money, I think it was two guineas, two half-guineas, two half-crown pieces, a shilling and a sixpence; I had the five pound note of Bunyan; the prisoner declared it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him the next morning to Mr. Winter's house? - A. I did not; he was taken before the Lord-Mayor by another officer; he said he had a great many accomplices, and they must all swing together, and that he was a dead man; that was all he said to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What had you said to him before that? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two half-guineas upon him? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one? - A. Yes, I am sure of that,

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are one of the clerks of the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, and tell me whether the signature of "Watts" is your hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are authorized to sign notes for the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you signed that, of what value was it? - A. A one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. It now appears as a two? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in every respect the same as that you signed, except the value? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been altered? - A. Here has been several lines taken out; the one pound notes are enclosed in straight lines, this has angles to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the alteration of the two instead of the one appear to have been made? - A. It appears as if it was cemented in by gum, or something of that kind, one piece is put in the room of the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. GARNETT TERRY sworn. - I am the engraver employed by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, I engrave the plates for the one and two pound notes; this was a one pound note off a one pound plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the plates of the two pound notes differ from the plates of the one? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, from your knowledge, guess how that has been executed? - A. A bit of paper has been gummed and cemented in, and it has been altered by a composition, either by Indian ink or common ink, not from engraving.</p>
               <p>Q. The Bank-notes are always engraved? - A.They are always engraved.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you prepared to say that is a forged Bank-Note? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Watts.) Is this Mr. Willis's handwriting? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his Christian name? - A. I think it is John, it is his handwriting; they don't always write alike.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Filding. Q. Are you a clerk in the house of Messrs. Winter and Kay? - A. Yes; I remember the time when the prisoner was brought to the office, I took down, at the time, what he said; he was brought on the 10th of May, and after giving an account where he served his time, and what business he followed, he said, he resided at Wandsworth, where he had resided about two years and a half; I asked him where he got the note he offered to the butcher; he said his wife took it about a fortnight ago, when he was from home, in the shop, of a Frenchman; we sent for a man of the name of Cuthbert, who had taken a bad note; his wife was in Mr. Winter's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190029"/>house at the time, he did not know his wife was there, but when he did, he said his wife knew nothing about the note, that she had not taken it in the shop, but that he knew from whence it came, and all about it, and that he would make a confession; this was the second conversation; after Cuthbert had seen him, I told him his wife was in the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had not said any thing to induce him to say this? - A. Certainly not; he said he would not make any confession except upon condition of pardon, for that he could make important discoveries, with respect to the Bank and with respect to the Post-office also, but he would not do it unless upon those terms; and if it could not be promised him now, he would reserve it when he should stand in need of it, and then he would barter for his life; he requested to see me in the prison, but he only stated to the same effect; I went with the officer and searched his house, we found a quantity of things, but I did not bring any thing away; I saw many mixtures of Indian-ink, but I did not bring them away, as I thought the prisoner was in the habit of using them in his business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Thursday the 9th of May, as I was going along, I saw some meat at the prosecutor's door, I asked him the price, and walked in; it might be between seven and eight o'clock; I called again, and ordered as much as, I believe, came to seven shillings and sixpence, and he packed it up; I put my hand in my pocket and had not silver enough; I then pulled out my pocket-book, and asked him if he could give me change for a two pound note; he took it, and went away, and was gone about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, during which time I was talking with his wife, and if I had been conscious of guilt, I could have escaped; he returned, and said he did not believe it was a good one; I requested him to go and know the reason why they thought so, and I went with him; on coming in, I pulled the note but of my pocket-book, and some others; there was a young man took hold of the note, and said, he would positively swear it was not Charles Watts's hand-writing; upon that, I concluded he belonged to the Bank, but his appearance did not bespeak it; while the people in the house were examining the notes, he called the prosecutor to him, and said, distinctly,"stick close, stick close, a d-d snug thing;" I began to be alarmed for the safety of my notes; it was a common public-house, in the tap-room, quite in the lower order; I was recommended then to send to some creditable person who probably would give a more satisfactory account of me than I could of myself; in consequence of that, I mentioned Alderman Pinder, they said he was not an Alderman; he lived within a few doors of me when I kept a house in Pilgrim-street, and now lives at no great distance from me; upon being told he was out of town, I requested to go to Mr. Harrison's, in Fleet-street, where the Wandsworth coach goes from, and where I had sent a number of parcels; however, they refused to go there, and we went to the Hole-in-the-wall; upon that, I sent to Mr. Barrett, in Shoe-lane, and he came; there were a number of gentlemen present who conceived me to be ill-used, and they asked the prosecutor if he knew what he was about, and knew the consequence; he then declared, before the company, he had not taken me into custody; that was a second time I had an opportunity of escaping; however, the constable of the night was sent for, and I was taken to the watch-house; I was searched, and in the right-hand pocket there was found the silver he has mentioned, and two farthings, I thought there was half-a-guinea, but I had left it at home; and in my left-hand pocket was a sob, or more properly a watch-maker's bag, in that was some gold, a crown-piece, and some pawnbroker's duplicates, all wrapped up in a one pound note, just about enough, as my wife said, to pay the interest of the pledges; I had received the money having had a bill become due, they represented as if the money was separate from the other in my pocket; it was all done up in this leather sob; that money was appropriateed to get the things out of pawn; the things were taken from me, and I was had to the Compter; in the morning, I was bad to the Solicitor of the Bank,(I hope you will excuse me, because I expected the Counsel to do all this for me), who appeared a gentleman, he asked me of whom I had taken the note; I informed him my wife had taken it in the shop, of a gentleman, apparently a foreigner, that he bought a silver pencil-case; my day-book will shew the different articles and prices, and that she gave him change out of the note, and he went away. He and Laurie put a variety of curious, I may say, impertinent questions to me, to all which I cheerfully replied; after which, he mentioned several names, and asked me whether I was acquainted with a number of curious names, particularly Peake; he said, that twelve or fourteen were in custody for forgeries on the Bank; I declared I knew none of them; he talked of the liberality of the Bank, that they would provide for me and my family, if I would but bring forward my accomplices; I declared I had none; he said, it is no use to say you have no accomplices; he then went to a cupboard, and took out a parcel, and shewed me several notes, and asked me if I knew them; I did not; they said, we know; so, come, you may as well confess. I know nothing of the note now in question, or any of the others. But<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190030"/>now, come, come, you may as well confess, and provide for yourself and family for life. When I found they would not believe me, as I had told the truth, I replied, "as you know so much more of the matter than I do, you may set down what you like;" they talked of sending me away to prison, I was afraid they would not take very good care of me; and I told them, if I see how well you behave I shall come forward, and tell you something to your advantage; they would not believe any thing when I told truth. I was taken to the Compter, and was confined in a small room, or dungeon, from Friday morning to Monday noon; several times Mr. Laurie came, and I wrote several notes, which were all opened; he came to me, and said, you may as well confess, and we will take care of you and your family. On Monday morning, about noon, I was taken before the Lord-Mayor; as for the note, I know nothing more of it than that my wife took it in the shop; and as for the behaviour to my wife, it was scandalous to a degree; when I was taken into custody, I sent for a man, but he did not come; my wife was with me in Giltspur-street compter, it was about nine o'clock, I think, she went out for to get one or two people to appear for my character; at my examination she was searched in as becoming a manner as her situation required; but on her return, she was ordered into custody, and was sent to the house, by a very impertinent little scoundrel, Mr. Laurie; my feelings for myself are nothing to what I felt for her; from the office, I saw her hauled through a yard between two constables, and two or three other gentlemen, as I supposed them to be; she was shocked at the idea, and requested to have one of her own sex, as she was some time gone with child.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not to the present question, I cannot hear that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have related every thing; I should wish you to hear me out.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the ill usage of your wife it is nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As for the note, my wife took it in the shop, which any tradesman here might do; I suppose a number of gentlemen on the Jury entrust their wives in their shops, and I hope they will feel for my situation; it is impossible for them to tell a good note from a bad one; she took it, and never thought of such a thing as its being bad; she did not know the man she took it of, and it is impossible to find him, he being a stranger to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the 25th of April last, I received a warrant from the Lord-Mayor, who ordered me, and Mr. Holdsworth, to proceed to Gravesend to execute it; we went down in the evening, and arrived at Gravesend about nine o'clock; I went to the Post-master, and shewed him the letter I had in my possession, addressed"Ketland Cotterill, to be left at the Post-office, Gravesend." I explained to him the business; in consequence of that, Mr. Holdsworth and I went there about eight o'clock the next morning, the time the bags were to be opened; we there waited in a room behind the Post-office, which had a window that looked into the Post-office, till near twelve o'clock; nobody having called, and thinking it would not be right to stay from London any longer, I sent Mr. Holdsworth to the Mayor, to get the warrant endorsed and made special; while he was gone, the prisoner at the bar came in, a few minutes before twelve; he asked the Post-master something, what he said I don't know; I apprehended him, and found this pocket-book, which contained a letter, I marked it; this is the letter; in that letter there was a bill for 400l. which is not in this indictment; I then asked him what he had done with the bill which that letter contained, and with the letter which this bill was contained in; he told me the letter this bill was contained in he had destroyed; but as to the bill that was contained in that letter, which I found in his pocket, for 307l. 5s. 6d. he shook his head, and said, "I have done very wrong, but my heart is not so bad." We took him into custody, and brought him to London, and lodged him in the Compter; I asked him how it came in his poffession; I said nothing to induce him to tell me; he said, it was entrusted to him, with several others, by some merchants at New-York, desiring him to put them into the Post-office as soon as he arrived in England; except that, he said, he had put some of them into the Post-office; he said nothing else respecting the bill to me.</p>
               <p>- HOLDSWORTH sworn. - At twelve o'clock I went to the Mayor at Gravesend, I was not present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190031"/>when the prisoner was apprehended; I saw him in custody, and the other Marshal said to me, keep him in custody, while I go on board a vessel at anchor off the town, where he has a chest on board, I will get it on shore; I did not say any thing to induce him to tell me, but when he was alone with me, he said, with the accent of a foreigner, "I have done wrong, I have wrote a name not my own, let me go, and I will leave England immediately, and never enter it again; if I stay, I know I shall hang," that is all he said; I heard nothing more, except in the course of our passage to town, he observed, he found the letter that the bill was inclosed in on the cabin floor of the vessel; I won't swear he said on the cabin floor, but that he found it in the cabin I will say he told me on my oath; I was present at the examination before the Lord-Mayor, which was taken in writing.(Letter read.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you one of the firm of Ketland, Cotterill, and Son? - A. No, by no means, only brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that letter from your clerk? - A. I did not, it lay upon my desk; the moment I came in, and this bill and letter were delivered to me, I discovered it to be a forgery, knowing the hand-writing of all the parties; I am in the habit of corresponding with them, and know their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the hand-writing of Mr. Ketland, or Mr. Cotterill, or the son? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they accept bills in the way that is accepted, or endorse them in the way that is endorsed? - A. Never; I never knew an instance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon discovery what did you do? - A. I went to Rowlett and Co. upon whom the bill is drawn; I went to Mr. Schneider afterwards; and then I went before the Lord-Mayor, and got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. The indorsement is, "Pay to Ketland, Cotterill, and Son," - there is an erasure of "and Son" - The very first moment you saw it, did it appear as it is now? - A. Exactly as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. It never appeared Ketland, Cotterill, and Son, at full, without erasure? - A. They were the correspondents; it immediately alarmed me, from knowing there is no such firm.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say there is no such man as Ketland Cotterill? - A. I never heard of one.</p>

               <p>- sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Walsh, at Gravesend, who is inspector of the aliens. The prisoner arrived on the 23d of April; he came on the 23d, and I had some conversation with him; he asked me to be so kind as to write a letter for him; I asked him whether he could not do it for himself; he told me he could not write English; I asked him what he wanted to write; he told me he had a Bill of Exchange, which he wanted to be accepted and discounted; I asked him to whom; he would not send it; he told me he did not know yet; I asked how much it was; he told me, 307l. 5s. 6d. I wrote the letter for him, this is the letter I wrote, I did not write the direction; it is addressed to Mr. Schneider, I see; I don't know who signed it, that is all that passed.(Letter read).</p>
               <p>Gravesend, 24 April, 1799.</p>
               <p>Addressed to Messrs. Schneider and Co. London.</p>
               <p>Sir, I take the liberty to send you the inclosed bill of 307l. 5s. 6d. to get it accepted as soon as you please, and as I am in want of cash, I shall be obliged to you to get it discounted, and remit me the cash and your answer, directed to me at the Post-office.

               <p>THOMAS JOHNSTON sworn. - I act as Postmaster, at Gravesend; I once saw the prisoner at the bar before; he applied to me on the 25th of April to know if there was a letter addressed to Ketland Cotterill, to be left at the Post-office; I had one in my possession at that time, delivered to me by Mr. Hollier; I told him, if he would walk in, I would look; when he came in, I bolted the door, and made a signal we had agreed on before he came, and took him; I heard him say, after he had been searched, he was very much afraid that for the crime he had committed, he should hang up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing about the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp contended, that the charge could not affect the prisoner, inasmuch as there was no evidence that the bill was not endorsed as it stands at present by the drawers at New-York, but the objection was over-ruled by the Court.</p>

               <p>LYON LEMAN, a German, sworn. - Examined by means of an Interpreter. Q.Whether he resides at Hamburgh? - A. I dwell in Hamburgh; I have known the prisoner and his father during the whole time I have lived in Hamburgh, twelve years; that young man had always an honest name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his having been afflicted with any disorder in his senses at any time? - A. I heard he was deranged in his mind; I heard he had been attended by physicians.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a young man of respectable connections?</p>
               <p>Mr. Schneider. I admit he is a young man of very respectable connections.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by an Interpreter. Q. How long has he known that young man at the bar at Hamburgh? - A. From eight to nine years; I never heard any thing to his disadvantage, but always favourable.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he knows of his having had the misfortune to be disordered in his senses at any time? - A. I am perfectly convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A. Once, in a walk at Hamburgh, I saw a number of people collected, and I asked what was the matter; I went to the crowd, and saw this young man between them, and some people holding him fast, because he wanted to jump over into the water, called the Elster; he was about jumping into the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be a person deranged in his senses? - A. He did, and it was generally so known.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you know of his having been attended by physicians to cure him? - A. I believe he was, and if I recollect well, one of the physicians' name was Wolse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I have the certificate of Dr. Wolse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it that he was in that situation? - A. I cannot determine; it is about three years ago that he was under the care of physicians; it is about two or three years since I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was not sent to New-York for the benefit of the sea air? - A. His father and me being neighbours in the country, his father complained-</p>
               <p>Court. That is hear-say evidence.</p>

It was taken out of the kitchen last Tuesday, I saw it just before; I had been looking up the linen for washing; it is here; I went into the room adjoining the shop, and I thought I heard the door go; I went to the head of the stairs, and saw the prisoner with these things in her apron, I saw her at the kitchen-door; she came out, and shut the door after her, but had not taken her hand from the door; I went down and asked her what business she had there, and what she had in her lap; she said, why; what business had she? I told her I did not know she had any; I asked her what she had in her lap; she said, why; what had she? I said, I supposed she had something of mine; she said, she had nothing of mine; I insisted upon seeing; I took hold of her, and called out for a person who lodges in the first floor. She was apprehended; I took the things from her, they are my property, they are the same things, I had seen them before; my house is a lodging-house. She told me they were not mine; but afterwards she did not say any thing about it.</p>

I would wish to ask him whether he took my clothes away or not out of the room; he says, he found the spoon in my pocket; he took my clothes out of the room while I was a bed? - A. We found them in his pocket, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190036"/>he was in bed, he saw us take them out; his clothes had not been taken out of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. They took my clothes out of the room, and brought them back again, and said, I had stolen two spoons; I know nothing of them; I happened to he drunk, and that serjeant enlisted me; it is all out of spite; the captain approved of me, and they took me before a Justice, in Queen-square. and he would not swear me in, because he said I was drunk, and wished me to go to bed; they took the clothes out of the room when I went to bed, and, in the course of an hour or two, told me I had taken the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hazard.) Did he go to bed before the property was found upon him? - A. That part of the spoon was taken out of his pocket before he went to bed. <rs id="t17990619-29-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not in a state of mind to know what I was about, therefore, in consequence of that, I did not suppose it could be any injustice to any person, as I really did not know what I was doing of; I have no witnesses just at this moment, not knowing my trial was coming on; I should have supposed that Mr. Harrington, knowing my father and myself, would not, therefore, have brought me here, and when he takes sums of money, as he does from my father, or have come forward in such a way; my witnesses will be ready to come forward on Saturday, some respectable witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harrington). Q. Do you happen to know his father? - A. I served him about fourteen years ago, and from that time I have never seen him. When the prisoner was a boy, I believe I have seen him; I did not wish to bring him here, but wished to get him abroad, and he would not go.</p>

             sworn. - I was sent to watch the prisoner; between the Old City-road till he got to Islington, he took salt out of full sacks and put it into an empty one; I was in the road a little distance from him, I don't know whether he saw me or not, I was behind him; I went home and told my master of it; that is all that I know.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Bowley.) What did you do upon the information you received? - A. As soon as Salkeld returned, I went out to meet the cart as it came home, and I met it just by Hermes-street, Pentonville, it there stopped, and the carman got out and went up Hermes-street; while he was there I ran by, and went down to the turnpike to hide myself; I staid there five or six minutes, when he returned with the little youth at the bar, he got into the cart, and laid this bag and salt on the boy's back, then he went his way; I followed the bag of salt up Hermes-street; and the little boy, when he got to his father's door, threw down the bag, and afterwards pulled it in, and I followed him; there was no one in the shop but his mother, and two or three children. I took them up, and carried them to Hatton-garden; I have nothing to say against Robinson the elder, any further than that it was in his house where the salt was carried.</p>
               <p>Tuck's defence. I had lost my direction, and this was the first little boy I saw, and I asked him if he would take the salt home till it was called for; the salt, nor sack neither, was never Mr. Bowley's, it was laid upon my cart by a man who was to have met me there for it.</p>
               <p>Robinson's (the younger) defence. I was at play, and he gave me the salt to take in doors.</p>
               <p>Robinson, the elder, called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mr. Bowley.) Q. Do you know whether there was any deficiency of falt delivered to the customers? - A. In one of the sacks there were twenty-four pounds deficient; the man sent word of it to our house before I got home; it is impossible for me to swear to the sack, because there is no mark no it.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Osborne.) How much did it cost you? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190041"/>A. Two guineas and a half; I bought it of Mr. Black, in the parish of St. John, Wapping; I know it to be mine, for here is my name, and where I live, on the dial-plate; I have had it about six months.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pritchard.) Did the prisoner tell you how long he had had it? - A. No, he did not; he said, afterwards, he received it from a soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In the first place, I was a customer to this gentleman's master, the pawnbroker; I used to pledge things there; I pawned a watch there twelve months ago; says I, you had a watch of mine for 1l. 11s. 6d. which cost me five guineas; there was a man coming by that saw me buy the watch of a soldier, and a woman; they were both groggy, and I asked the price of it, and the soldier said, a guinea; the woman said, she would not sell it; I walked off, but the soldier called me back, and said, I should have it; I bought it for fifteen shillings, and thought I could not be hurt if I had it raffled for.</p>

On the 15th I received a letter from Mr. Rogers; there was a warrant issued against the prisoner, and, on the 16th, I went to see if he was at home; I was going past the Gun and Star, in Petticoat-lane, when he came out and called after me; I went up to the Gun and Star with him, and he went backwards into the yard; we had some conversation respecting the country: he told me he had been down with some goods, and if he had not taken a few queer half beans and a few whites, he should not have had money to have brought him home: he shewed me a pair of shoes he had upon his feet, which appeared to be new, and those shoes, he said, he had passed a queer half bean for as he came from Gravesend; that he had passed one other queer half bean beside that for shoes when he was in the country, and had but one left, if I would take it, I should have it for three shillings; I gave him three good shillings for it; I have got the queer half bean; I went immediately to Shadwell, to let the officers know that Solomons was at home. I sent from the George, just by the church, for Rogers, and told him what passed, and shewed him the half-guinea; then we went to Elby and Riley, at Whitechapel, at a public-house near Red-lion-street; I went down to Solomon's house, he was gone out; I went down present when he was apprehended; the Gun and Star is within twenty yards nearly opposite Solomon's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know whether the Gun and Star happens to be in the City of London, or County of Middlesex? - A. I am informed it is in the City of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had the conversation with Solomons, there was a warrant against him? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he acquainted of it? - A. I don't know that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there to induce him to sell the pieces, which you charged him afterwards with having sold the half-guinea? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. By which he would be prosecuted? - A. Yes, I hoped so, because I should be a sufferer.</p>
               <p>Q. You went merely for the public good? - A. And my own good too; I went by order of Rogers the first time; I never was promised to be paid any thing; I meant to ask his Lordship for my expences; I did not know whether I was to be paid by the Mint or the Court; there is no doubt but I expected to be paid for my time.</p>
               <p>Q. These gentlemen do not know you quite so well as I do; I think you were examined here yesterday, and the prisoner was acquitted on your evidence? - A. He was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this line of an informer, for the public good? - A. I never was an informer before, I have given evidence in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion? - A. Naval stores, and other things, and stealing sugar from the lighters.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a Trinity-officer? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not what I ask-Are you not dismissed from being a Trinity-officer? - A. I was what they call set aside for a while.</p>
               <p>Q. I will help you to your own term, suspended? - A. There were a good many at the same time; I never asked for my situation again.</p>
               <p>Q. What line are you in now? - A. I keep a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides being employed by the Mint? - A. I am not employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house? - A. The corner of Warwick-street, Golden-square; I have been in it eleven weeks to-day, in the parish of St. James; I kept a public house, the Durham-arms, Hackney-road, and was there seven or eight months; before that I was working in the India-house, as a labourer; I have belonged there nine years.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you are a publican, and labourer in the India-house? - A. Yes, when I like to go.</p>
               <p>Q. And give informations? - A. I never gave them information.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you keep a public-house, and are a labourer in the East-India warehouses? - A. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick by it? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that the India Company never employ publicans? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that? - Yes; I mean to swear that there are a great many keep public-houses as well as myself in the India-house; I knew the prisoner before this for three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Rogers sent you? - A. Yes; he asked me to go, and said, he did a good deal of business, and asked me whether I could get any of them; I said, I would try; I don't know that the prisoner knew there was a warrant against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about selling a bell that was in the Public-office, and whose it was? - A. One morning, about three o'clock, I brought some things there, and they let it fall on my foot; I advertised the bell, and it was not owned; the bell laid in the office a considerable time, and Mr. Staples says, Hill, what are you going to do with this bell; I said, I would get some person to buy it; I said, I could get a guinea and a half for it; he said, I am satisfied if you get a guinea and a half; I cannot tell just now how much I sold it for, I believe it was upwards of three pounds; I did not put it all in my own pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190044"/>Q. Who did you divide it with? - A. I gave part at the office, to the treasurer, Mr. Skeene, the man who takes the money for all warrants, he put it in the book; I knew Mr. Kirk, I sold him the bell for three pounds and up wards, I cannot say how much above, it is a good while ago; it might be three pounds five shillings, eight, or ten; I swear to the best of my recollection it was not more; it may be a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate? - A. No, I did not, or any body at that time; I told them when I paid the money; I know I paid the Magistrate half the money I had for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them the truth, that you sold it for three pound eight, or three pound ten? - A. I don't know that I told them; I did not know I should be asked such a question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them you sold it for a guinea and a half? - A. The Magistrate sent for me, and said, you have sold the bell, for a couple of officers have been down to know; I gave half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. I believe next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you tell them you had sold it only for a guinea and a half, though you had sold it for three pounds fifteen shillings? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not say so? - A. I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you actually sell it to Mr. Kirk for three pounds eight shillings, or thereabouts? - A. I sold it for thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, to some person in the office, you sold it for a guinea and a half? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Staples send for you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you to swear to the fact, that you had sold it for a guinea and a half? - A. He never asked me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to swear it? - A. I never did, or ever said I would.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ROGERS sworn. - I am one of the Police-officers at Shadwell: I applied to the witness, Hill, to use his endeavours to get one of the false coin, and the Magistrates were informed of it; I proposed it to him, and in consequence of what he told me, I apprehended Solomons on the 17th of May last, at the Gun and Star, in Petticoat-lane, which I believe to be in the city; I am sure of it, because the landlord told me so, and shewed me his licence; he was in the passage with three or four other men, and I desired him to come back into the back parlour; he went with me, I closed the door, and told him I had a warrant against him for felony.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him what fort of felony? - A. No; he instantly put his hand into his left-hand waistcoat-pocket and pulled out this paper, and dropped it at his feet, containing four counterfeit shillings, which I picked up, and put in my pocket; I told him he should go with me before the Lord-Mayor, as I was in the city; he said, he would rather go to Shadwell-office; when I was taking him out, a City officer came and told me I had no right in the City; he was taken before the Lord-Mayor, who sent him down to Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he dropped the shillings were they in a state to pass? - A. Yes; and unless a person was a very good judge, they would take them; I have kept them in my pocket which has rubbed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. After you, and the last witness, were examined yesterday, the Jury acquitted the prisoner? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us all you recollect about it? - A. I don't recollect any thing farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occur to you to make any search of the prisoner? - A. The other officer, Mr. Elby, searched him, he found six shillings and sixpence, and a half-guinea, which I returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that Riley was present, and searched him? - A. No, he was not; Elby made the search in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect stating, yesterday, that no body was present? - A. I stated that when I went first into the room nobody was present; Riley followed me in; I called to him to go over and apprehend Barnett's wife; and I desired Elby, as soon as he came in, to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state that? - A. I left it to Elby to state it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There was nothing found except the four had shillings-were they mixed with the good ones, or separate? - A. No; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled the paper out, and the pocket turned inside out, it was not in the same pocket; they were kept separate from the other.</p>
               <p>Q. The bad money he attempted to get rid of, but not the good? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>(Mr. William Parker proved the pieces to be counterfeit).</p>
               <p>(James Parrott proved the Gun and Star to be in the City of London).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am totally innocent, I never saw the man before; on the 17th they apprehended me, they all came together, and never was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember buying a bell of Hill? - A. Yes; I believe it is a year and a half ago, it was a good sizeable bell; I am a ship-chandler, and I believe I paid him three pounds odd for it, I am sure it was three pounds; I know no more.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CUMBER sworn. - A. I am office-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190045"/>keeper at Shadwell: I remember a bell being sold by Hill to Kirk; I am not positive whether it was sold by the order or consent of the Magistrates; he did not say what he sold it for at that time, I was sent by Mr. Staples to know what he had done with the bell; I went to Hill's house, and he came up, it was the next day, or day but one; I think he said he sold it for thirty shillings; he said it was to a captain of a ship, and I went along with him; I did not observe Mr. Staples make use of any expression; I went with Hill to King James's Stairs, and he told me he had sold it to a captain of a ship, but I could not find out the captain, he did not say any thing about the price; I returned to the office, and went from the office down to Mr. Kirk's; Hill was not by then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that thirty shillings was the price? - A. I understood as such; I don't remember any thing taking place between Mr. Staples and Hill about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Staples putting any question to Hill relative to what he could swear to be the sum? - A. There was something of the kind, but I cannot say; I was just coming out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't know what passed? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you think he said he sold it for thirty shillings? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have all been guilty of the crime of purchasing bad money for the purpose of bringing people to justice? - A. I certainly have, and I thought it my duty so to do; I did last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the reason of Hill's being dismissed from the Trinity-house? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>JAMES-CHARLES SANSUM sworn. - I was present at the apprehension of the prisoner: I saw some searching, but they might search him when I was not there; I saw no bad money, but I saw some good, I believe there were sixteen or seventeen shillings; I went into the room immediately after them; I don't pretend to have seen all that passed.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surveyor, and live in Long-lane: On Wednesday about a quarter before one o'clock, as I came down Holhorn-hill, I saw three men, whom I remembered, one of which was Barnett; I have known him for five years, and the other I remembered, as I had seen them about Smithfield; Kemp, and another not taken, was on one side, and the other close behind; he went a little way out of the path, and Barnett came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them accost Webber? - A. They appeared to be talking to him; he was not quite at the bottom of Holborn-hill so far as the Market, he was going towards Smithfield, just by the post; his left-hand pocket was a little bit open, and I saw Barnett's hand go into it; I saw the motion of his hand come out of it, I could not see what he took out, but he put it into his pocket, and it laid star, like a book; before he put his hand into his pocket, he touched a bundle which Webber had under his arm, and he put up his hand to adjust it, and at that instant I saw Barnett's hand go into his pocket; Immediately Barnett went away, and coughed; one of them followed, and coughed also; the third turned round and looked, giving a cough, he walked on two or three doors further, and then he left them; two of them went down Fleet-market, the third I did not see go; Barnett put his hand in the pocket, but it was either Kemp or the other that had the conversation; I went immediately to Webber, and asked him if he had lost any thing; I told him he had been robbed, and I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190046"/>with him to Hatton-garden, and described the persons; I was out of town on Thursday, but I found them in custody on Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Kemp.) Q. It was Barnett's hand in the pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was the other prisoner, or a person near the place, that coughed you don't know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was about one o'clock? - A. A quarter before one.</p>
               <p>Q. That part is narrow, is it not? - A. Yes; and not free of passengers.</p>
               <p>Q.Would it not be as well to take hold of the collar when a person fees a robbery? - A. I was not near enough.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you off? - A. About seven yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Any persons between you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Possibly the hand that was put into the pocket might be some other persons; his back was towards you? - A. Yes; I know him as well as I know my child, but I never had any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you did not collar him? - A. No; I went to the man, and asked him if he had lost any thing; I only saw the hand go into the pocket, and take it out, and put something into the side-pocket, button his coat, and walk away.</p>

               <p>- COTTRELL sworn. - I opened the door when Mrs. Adams alarmed me; the things were in the closet, they were packed up in a bundle; I saw her take the knives and forks out of her pocket and convey them into the bundle she had packed up. (The property deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going out to Kensington to enquire for a day's work, and I met a woman who told me there was a woman who could tell me of one, I went to make enquiry and forgot the name; I went up into this house, and was really saint, and very ill, I put my hand to the door to support myself, and the woman came out and asked me what I wanted; I told her Mrs. Riley lived there; she said I came to rob her; I made answer, I had no property about me; immediately she made an alarm, and that woman came up, and a young fellow; I asked her to let me go; then something dropped off the chair, and he took up some knives; they took me up, and took a pair of boots, and stockings, and other things, and produced at Bow-street, but the parcel has increased very much since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say you saw me put my hand in my pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come into the shop while we were there? - A. Only the woman with the pie.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the note up before? - A. I only touched it with my hand, so, and laid it down on one side to give change.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon yourself to say you saw me take it out of my right-hand waistcoat pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- CHIPPINDALE sworn. - Last Saturday I asked Mr. Grant if he could give me change for a one-pound note; I put it down by him, and he gave me change for it; we went out, and were going down the street, when Grant says, I have not got the note; I returned with Coe; I asked Mr. Grant, says I, you had some raspings here, what have you done with them; says he, I have put them into the counter; says he to Coe, I think you are the rogue, and have got the note; no, says he, I have not; says he, you had better produce it; says the other, I think not, you had it to take the number; in the course of that a woman came in with a pie; I am sure, before she came in, there was no note on the counter, I am clear of it; upon this Coe put his hand to the side of the pie, and said, this is the note that lays here, I am sure, and brought it up; says Grant, let us look at it, there are three sixes and a five.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Whether the woman did not come into the shop while you were there? - A. Yes, she came in while I was standing by the counter, after the note was disputed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I not there at the same time? - A. Yes, you were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in along with this man to get change for a note; he laid it down on the counter, and, as Mr. Grant says, he took and laid it on one side; a person came in with a pie; after he got the change, I stopped for him, and Mr. Chippindale asked me whether I would walk down the next street, and have something to ear; we were going along, and Mr. Grant said, I have not got the note; good God! says Chippindale, I laid it down on the counter; says I, go back again; I went back again with him, and the note lay by the side of the pie.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Chippindale.) Q. Did you see me take the note? - A. I saw you give it to Mr. Grant by the side of the pie-dish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We went away, and had something to eat; I was very much vexed, and I went back, and said, I feel myself very much hurt at your treatment, as if I had taken the note; after, words ensued, and he said he would take me before a Magistrate; he was very warm, and in a great passion.</p>
               <p>Chippindale. I did not see him take the note out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Grant then made use of very scur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190049"/>rilous language, and said, if I did not go about my business, he would take me up, which he did, and I was taken to Queen-square.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Chippindale). Whether Grant took me by the hand? - A. I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say he did not take his hand from the dish? - A.Apparently he took it from the side of the pie.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that note was restored was it before the man was taken up? - A. I suppose near upon an hour; the prisoner and I went to get something to eat; the prisoner returned back, and spoke to Mr. Grant upon the accusation he had made; he said, he was very much hurt, and he returned of his own accord; he did not go to Mr. Grant's house, but to the public-house within two doors.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I cannot say I saw either of the prisoners there, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an Irish woman, and travel about with your character in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in place? - A. Yes, in Mrs. Goodwin's service, at the corner of Portland-road, as a servant of all work.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the note? - A. I had received it only a day or two, I had seen it in the morning before I went out, and the money too.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you lost it before you got to Portman-square, or after, you cannot say? - A. I know I could not lose it only where my pocket was cut.</p>

             sworn. - I produce the pocket-book, money, and note. On the first of May, I had been up to Lady Montague's; there were a great many people; I stopped there till about three o'clock; I and Mr. Perry went down Portman-street, and overtook those two persons, in company with another man; I said to Perry, there is old Razor; I stopped him, and put my hand into his(Cosby's) right-hand coat-pocket, and pulled out that book with the note in it, we took them to a public-house, and searched them, and found some silver about them; I have not got the silver, I returned it to them again; I have got two-and-sixpence marked that was not sworn to; Perry searched the other man, and a knife was found upon him, and some silver; it was a very sharp cutting instrument; they were all talking together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.This cutting-engine is what is vulgarly called a knife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A pen-knife too? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing unusual for a man to have a penknife in his pocket? - A. No, if they are not open as this was.</p>
               <p>Q. The silver was produced to the woman, and not a shilling sworn to? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How far were you and these men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190050"/>from the rails of Montague-house? - A. About two hundred yards; there was nobody in Portman-street when we apprehended them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street, I was in company with Croker; I examined Strudd, and found some silver upon him, and these two knives; they were in a slash pocket, by the side of his thigh, open as they are now. (The purse was deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Strudd's defence. I met this man, I had not seen him for some time; we were going to have something to drink, and all of a sudden these people came up, and said, we must go with them; they took us in, and searched us, and took the money and knives from me, and they gave me the money at the Justice's, but kept the knives; as to the rest, I know nothing about it; I never saw the woman, or knew any thing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you charge him with a highway robbery at that time? - A. He picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Answer the gentleman - did not you charge him with a highway robbery? - A. I don't know what it amounts to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Upon your oath, was not the charge for a highway robbery? - A. I did not know what it was.</p>

               <p>Court. If you do not answer it directly, I will commit you? (The question repeated.) - A. I do not recollect that there was any thing said about a highway robbery; I charged him with having picked my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate tell you there was no pretence to say this was a highway robbery, and did he not commit him only for a grand larceny? - A. I believe there was something of that sort mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say there was no pretence for charging it as a highway robbery, but if you insisted upon it, he must commit him for grand larceny? - A. That is what I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, you knowing there was a reward of forty pounds, have thought fit to make it a highway robbery? - A. I beg pardon, I am as poor now as I was then; I never gave it a thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by your direction it was made a highway robbery, or was it done from your statement? - A. I did not say it was a highway robbery; I did not know what they might call it; I have stated the facts I have done here; I said nothing about the highway robbery; I never found the pocket-book since.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Magistrate there were fifty pounds? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a single bill accepted by any tradesman in London, or by any man in this country? - A. Yes; it was mentioned in the public papers; they were made payable to a friend of mine, in Holborn, William Welch; I had not known the prisoner before; I had not delivered the bills to any body; they were accepted by a very respectable tradesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Webb? - A. He is a farmer; I believe he lives in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he take up his lodgings in your house? - A. Yes; I don't know how long; about a fortnight at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the country does he live in? - A. I don't know; he lives down by Ealing, or Acton, or somewhere there.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he is a farmer? - A. Yes, he has told me so; his father and mother are lately dead.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, is he a farmer? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you believe he is a farmer? - A. Yes, as long as I have known him; when he came to town, I have said, send me a load of hay; I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you charge the prisoner with having robbed you of fifty pounds worth of duplicates? - A. No; I dare say forty pounds, and I am afraid I shall lose four or five pounds by it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates might there be in this forty or fifty pounds? - A. They were all in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. In what pocket was the book in? - A. At that time I had put it in my coat pocket; I had this coat on; I had not a side-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, are you able to ascertain a single article that had been pawned by you? - A. I say now as I said before, I dare say the things cost me forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, could you ascertain, or did you, a single article that had been pawned? - A. In the course of five minutes, I could tell you the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked this question before the Magistrate, and were you able to give an answer? - A. I said, the things cost me forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now able to mention to me a single pawnbroker your things were with? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate ask you? - A.Upon my word and honour -</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you tell the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, since that time, gone to the pawnbrokers, to desire them to keep them for you? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you know of the 40l. reward? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190052"/>Now I understand you; I think nothing at all about it; I don't suppose it would amount to it.</p>

             sworn. - I am in the farming business, and lodge with the last witness; As we were going down the road just this side John-street, I was a little behind him, he turned round, and said, I have catched a man's hand in my pocket, and have lost my pocket-book, and he said, that was the man that had got it; I made answer, and said, why don't you lay hold of him by the collar, why don't you stop him; another person comes up and catches me by the right arm, and attempted to strike me; there were two of them, one of them struck me with something, but I cannot say what, whether it was a knife or not, but it cut me through the coat and two waistcoats, and cut my bowels; he did that with his left-hand, and directly he jumped round and struck me with his right-hand in the neck, here, it is not well yet, it is under the burr of the ear, and off he fet. As Mr. Hazel was discoursing about this pocket-book, the other struck him; and I directly says, are we to be murdered, why don't you cry out to the watch; directly I holloaed out, watch, and Hazel likewise; I said, why don't you lay hold of him; with that he laid hold of him, and held him till the watchman came; he said, this is the man, I give charge of the man, I have been robbed; I told him that was the man, and the watchman took him to the watch-house; I did not know I was wounded at first, I put my hand, in this manner, and took it away all over blood, I found then I was injured by the blow; we went home, and got a doctor to dress the wounds. Mr. Hazel went down to Marlborough-street the next morning; I was not able to get up, I could not stir out of bed for a week or ten days; the Magistrate delayed the time, he was examined twice at Marlborough-street, thinking I should get pretty well, to attend on the Saturday, but I was not able to get out of my bed; no blows were given by the prisoner till after the pocket-book was stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say, the Magistrate did not think sit to commit him upon the first and second examination? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But he afterwards committed him? - A. That is what Mr. Hazel told me as I lay in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Hazel? - A. I have known him these ten years by name, nothing further.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I thought you said you lodged at his house? - A. I did not lodge at his house, I lodge at No. 16, in another street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you known him or not? - A. I have known his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been acquainted with him? - A. I have been acquainted with him so far as to have a pint of porter with him, but never any dealings.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you or not always lodge in his house when you came to town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If he has sworn that he has perjured himself, has he not? - A. I have not, I have a lodging of my own.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About twelve o'clock, as I was in John-street, I heard a noise in Oxford-street, of calling watch; I made up to it, and saw the prisoner in Mr. Hazel's hands, he delivered him to me; he said he had robbed him of his pocket-book, and ruined him, for that he had a great deal of property in his pocket-book; I searched him, but did not find any thing upon him, no knife, or pocket-book, or any thing.</p>
               <p>GERRARD SCAWEN sworn. - I am a watchman, and was the second man that came up to the others, I was far from the place where it happened: I ran up, and saw this man struggling very hard to get away from Hazel, upon which I laid hold of him, and the other watchman laid hold too; he was searched, but nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You swear he struggled to get away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought you from Ireland, did you run away? - A. No. I have done nothing to make me leave it.</p>
               <p>Q. You hope for a share of the reward, don't you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent of the crime laid to my charge as any of you gentlemen; I was coming from my aunt's, and those men were walking with two women of the town, and both very much in liquor; as I went by them, he knocked himself against me; holloa, says he, what did you do that for; and charged me with picking his pocket.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are perfectly satisfied of the innocence of the young man. <rs id="t17990619-54-verdict305" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am the Custom-house locker of Messrs. Keymer, and Co. The prisoner was working there in the coopering way; I saw him coming down stairs out of the warehouse; he said he was going out, and by that means I touched his hat, and thought there was something in it; he said he had some coffee in it; I desired him to put it out, which he did, and there were four pounds six ounces of raw coffee; after that, I kept hold of his collar till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He admitted he had the coffee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober? - A. I cannot say; but when he was before the Lord-Mayor I rather thought he was in liquor; he was remanded; I think it was two hours before we took him to the Lord-Mayor.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: The prisoner was given into my custody, about ten o'clock, I was sent for; I was taking him to the Compter, and going up Dowgate-hill he desired to go into a public-house; I told him we was not far from the Compter, and he might go there; he wished to go in at the corner of Bridge-row, and we went in, he wanted to go to the necessary; I told him I did not know whether I should allow him to go; I said, I believe you have more about you; says he, I have; we went into a little back room, two gentlemen came in, and we did not think proper to examine him there, we went down stairs, and he unbuttoned his breeches, I held my apron, and he let the coffee out from his breeches; it was loose in his breeches; he was rather stupid in liquor, he hardly knew what he did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - The things were pawned at Mr. Purse's, London-wall, we suppose, by the prisoner, the ticket being found on her; I don't recollect taking them in, nor can I swear she pledged them; they were pledged in the name of Frances Robins; two of the pledges are of my writing, but I don't recollect her.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS BAILEY sworn. - I am a constable, and apprehended the prisoner on the 13th of June, at Mr. Bennett's house, at eight o'clock in the evening; I found thirty-one duplicates on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. All I have to say is, the morning I was taken, I went and redeemed a pair of sheets belonging to Mrs. Bennett, as I had warning to go; I did pledge the things at the time I had the room; I was going to leave the room on the Tuesday, and to replace all the things, I went and fetched a pair of sheets in the morning; I went to Oxford-road to make a friend to redeem the rest before I left the lodgings; I thought Mrs. Bennett would have been so good, if I would pay a week's rent, to wait while I could pay the rest.</p>

Daniel says, I do, where did you get it? I said, that man has just taken it from your cart, and likewise some feathers; I believe there were two lettuces, some marshmallows, and some hysop; he went about thirty yards to the Sheep-pens and set himself down as close as he could to the ground; I pointed to him, saying, there he is behind those pens; then he jumped up and began running; he turned the corner into Chick-lane; before I could get there, his coat was off, and he was in a coal waggon; I pointed out to the prosecutor, that is the person; he pursued him into Long-lane, and desired the waggoner to stop, as he had a thief in the waggon; he refused, and whipped the person who requested it; the prisoner at first took up a broom for his defence, and after that he took a shovel, and drove the people round the waggon; I did not see him do any thing to the prosecutor; he then jumped out of the waggon, and went across Long-lane to Cloth-fair; I stood to watch the coat that was left in the waggon, and then he got into Long-lane again; I procured the coat, and pursued him as far as Aldersgate-street, and caught him; I saw him stopped by the coach stand; I am sure it is the same man that took the handkerchief.</p>
