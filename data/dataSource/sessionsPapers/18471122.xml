                  </hi> I live at 3, Redgate-court, Minories. On Saturday evening, 18th Sept., my little boy was playing at the window—I saw the prisoner approach him—I was much alarmed, as he had caused him a serious hurt a month previously—I went to the window, which was a little open—he had a piece of something in his hand, and said to my son, "I will take the big side of this and thrust it down your throat, and you will not be able to say much"—I threw the window up, and said to my son, "Henry, come round to the door, and I will let you in"—and I said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by coming and insulting me and my child continually, as you did on Wednesday last, when you followed me down the court, and alarmed my baby very much by screaming in my ears, why do you do so? you promised the Alderman you would not"—he used very bad language, and threw the remains of some fish which he in his hand, in my face—my son approached the window, and said to him, "What do you mean by this? why come near our house? we don't insult you"—he thrust his fist in his face, and asked what he had to do with it—I went to the door to let my son in, and he thrust the door open, and caught me between the wains<lb/>cot and the door—my son came to my protection and put him out, a policeman came up, or he would have torn me to pieces if he could.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Smith, a printer, of Cock-lane, Smithfield—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Se<lb/>pulchre—the prisoner lodged with us for five years—I kept my money between the mattress and the sacking of the bed—she has seen me put money there, and take it from there—I kept it in a little black pocket-book—on Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 10, I took out four half-crowns, which were loose on the sacking, but the pocket-book was there—the prisoner was in the room—I left her there, and told her to lock the door, and bring the key up to me—she did not bring it—I sent the girl, Rogers, down—she came back with the girl, and gave me the key, and then went out with my daughter and another person—the prisoner borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me before she went out—I saw her go—it was about four o'clock in the afternoon—she did not return—at four the next afternoon, I looked at the place where my money was—I had never left the place then till then—I missed two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I said to the girl, "I have lost two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes"—she said, "Mrs. Jones has got them, I know"—I had had</p>

I fetched ten quarters of oats, and a bushel of tares, from Paul's-wharf, for him, on 20th Oct.—I got to the granary with them about half-past three o'clock—I took five or six sacks into the granary and laid them down—I did not shoot them—I took my shovel, as I had got a heap of oats to move—I was up there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I could not then see the cart—my master came and spoke to me some time afterwards—I did not miss a sack—I had fetched twenty from Paul's-wharf; and there were but nineteen.</p>

I went to my granary on 20th Oct. in consequence of something that was told me—I counted and missed one sack—I went to Mr. Blake's stable with the policeman, went up stairs, and under about three-parts of a truss of hay I found this sack, turned inside out, with oats in it—I sent the officer to my granary for a sample of the oats that had just come in, compared them with the oats in the sack, and I be<lb/>lieve they were mine—the sack was marked with my name—Hawkins had no business with my oats—I do not know him—I know Key, as servant to Mr. Blake—I had not sold any of these oats to Mr. Blake.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Bath. I was in London on Lord Mayor's-day, and went into King-street, to see the procession start—I stood by the side of Hibbs, and saw the three prisoners—one of them did something to me, and I went for a policeman—before I went I saw Morden strike Hibbs on the head, and his hat went over his eyes—he had a stick, which was taken away—I cannot say by whom—there were thirty or forty people there—he had a brown paper parcel in his hand—I did not see him do anything with it—I saw him prostrated to the ground—Shires was the principal person in that, he struck at him with his fists—Cummings was the second or third from him—I returned with a policeman, and found Shires still there, but not the others—I found Morden in custody at the station—the policeman took Shires—Hibbs came to the station, and said one of the principal men had a green front to his cap—I went with him into the cell to see Morden—I said, in his hearing, "That is the man"—he gave him into custody—I was outside the house when the policeman came out with Shires—I then followed to the station—Hibbs went at the same time, and I heard him charge Shires—I did not see Cummings taken.</p>

                  </hi> I am an artist at Vernon-place, Pentonville. On Lord Mayor's day I was in King-street, and received a caution—I saw Hibbs coming through the crowd—he was <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> several times—Morden and Shires both struck him on the hat—he came from the mob and stood by my side—the mob followed several other gentlemen, and then got sight of Hibbs again, and all the prisoners struck him several times—I saw Cummings there—a signal was given by a whistle, and "Oh!" and "Here he is!"—they struck anybody who had a hat on—they made free and <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> any one—there were thirty or forty of them—when they struck Hibbs a second time he lifted up his stick and gave Shires a severe blow in the face—I cannot say whether it made it bleed—the mob beset us all round—I saw Hibbs pulled into the passage of a house by main force by the gentleman belonging to it—I stood some few minutes, and was then pulled into the next house—I was robbed—I gave Morden in charge—he was taken to the station—Shires was after<lb/>wards brought there by a policeman—Hibbs said, in Shires' presence, that he could swear he was among the crowd, and that he was one that struck him and buffeted him about—I saw Cummings at the station door—I identified him, he was taken, brought in, and confronted with Hibbs, who said he could swear he was among the crowd.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I am an artist, living at Pentonville. I was near Guildhall on the morning of Lord Mayor's day, waiting to see the procession start—I had an inside pocket to my coat, in which was a pair of gloves, a penknife, and a purse containing 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was a great crowd and con<lb/>fusion—during the scuffle with Mr. Hibbs I heard my coat tearing, and felt a pulling at the skirt—I looked down, and found the lining of the coat com<lb/>letely torn out with the pocket—it had been quite sound before—it must have taken a good pull to tear it off—as I looked down I saw my pocket in the prisoner's hand—I laid hold of it, and pulled it several times—he would not loosen it—at last I managed by main force to get it from his hand, with the contents just as they were taken—he had <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> me several times before that, during the struggle with Hibbs—he did nothing to me at the time I was struggling to get my pocket from him—I received a blow on the cheek from him a minute or a minute and a half before—a policeman was sent for—I kept my pocket in my hand—I was pulled into the doorway of a house next door to where Hibbs was pulled in—I kept my eye on the prisoner all the time, and directly the policeman came up I gave him in charge, and handed my pocket to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> I am a comb-manufacturer, and whalebone and bristle<lb/>marchant, at 88, Leadenhall-street. Skinner has been in my service twelve years—he is a'packer—the packing is generally done by woman—up to Christ<lb/>mas last I manufactured combs—I have not done so since—it was Skinner's duty to select all the damaged once, whose teeth were not perfect, and put them by themselves—they are what are called wasters—he had authority up to Christmas to sell those—it was his duty to make an entry of those sales in a book called the till book—since I have left off manufacturing combs I have supplied the retail trade by purchasing of the manufacturer—I took stock last Christmas—on 13th Nov. some 3 1/2 inch wasters were produced to me—these are them—if at Christmas last, or before then, any such articles had remained in my stock they would have appeared in my stock-book, which is here, and there are none such in the book—since I have ceased to manufacture, it has been the practice to return the wasters, if there were any, to the manufac<lb/>ture who supplied them—it was Skinner's business to select and apportion the combs which since Christmas I have bought of the manufacturer—the perfect combs are packed in dozens, with which I supply the trade—I have been a manufacturer for many years—I have looked critically at these combs produced—in my judgment they are not wasters which have been spoiled and damaged by the machinery—I feel confident they have been wilfully broken by hand—if these had been wasters, the teeth would be cut instead of being broken—I have one here that is a waster by</p>

               <p>the failure of the machinery—this other one has the teeth broken—I can state on my oath that these have been wilfully broken by hand—It was Skinner's duty to be at the warehouse by eight o'clock in the morning with another person, but in consequence of the other not attending to his duty, Skinner was left alone in the morning—this is the till-book—here is no entry of any sale in it since Christmas till Saturday, 13th Nov., when there is, "Wasters, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on that day, being of the Hebrew persuasion, I allow no business to be done, except wagons are drawn into the yard—Skinner knew it was my habit not to do business on that day—it was strictly for<lb/>bidden—I when to the warehouse that morning, about a quarter before ten o'clock—when I got there I saw the till-book with this entry in it—the ink was quite wet and pale. I know noting of Mahony.</p>

Can you tell by the appearance of these combs whether they have been long in stock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not longer than six months—they are ivory—they do not become discoloured by keeping—the small sizes are not our manufacture; the large sizes are—it was not the prisoner's duty to sell wasters if any body else was there, but if he were alone he did—if any comb became accidentally broken it would became a waster—it is quite impossible that twenty-four of this size could be broken by accident—breaking them would reduce the value of them very consi<lb/>derably—in their sound state a dozen would be worth 3 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in their pre<lb/>sent state five dozen are worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if these had been genuine wasters, I should have complained at the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being taken for them—they are worth more than that—there had not been an export order sent out three weeks previous to this transaction—there are orders in hand, but not for combs of this description—it would not be necessary to lay by a great many for exports—the orders are sent to the manufacturer for the sizes as we want them—Skinner and Davis took stock at Christmas—I am speaking of representations made by them—it was done under my supervision.</p>

                  </hi> I am a grocer at Hounslow—the prisoner was in my employ for about two months—he kept a shop in a very small way as well—in consequence of suspicion, I went with Sergeant Jacques to the prisoner's house, and found some brushes, knives, and other things mentioned in the indictment—the prisoner had access to them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these brushes were in my stock—I had not sold them to him or anybody—I had not sold these two tins or this butter-stabber—they are mine—before we went to the house I accused the prisoner of taking a quantity of candles—he said he had not—I asked why he did not purchase his candles of me—he said because I did not sell them cheap enough—he said "I give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen, and you can't sell me them under 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I purchased them at Mr. Hedman's, in town"—we went to Hedman's—the prisoner was not present, but I told him afterwards that I had asked Hedman if he had purchased a quantity of candles of him, and that Heddman said he had not—he said he had purchased them there—I never went there with him—just as we got to his house, he said to the sergeant, "All the candles I have in the house are hanging over a rail on the counter"—we searched the house, and found about 10lbs. of candles in a cupboard behind the counter, and candles hanging in the shop besides, and in the bed-room, these brushes, and some scented soap—the policeman went down-stairs—the prisoner said, "I know I have wronged you, and hope you will forgive me"—he said something similar at the station, and again afterwards—I believe the whole of the property found to be mine—it is worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I dealt in things of the kind, and had not sold him any—I can speak positively to several of them.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the employment of Messrs. Bissell, of Tipton, and am captain of a boat which is used for the conveyance of iron upon the Grand Junction Canal, from Tipton to London. On Friday, 29th Oct., I had a loaded boat on the canal, drawn by one horse, going from London towards Birmingham—when I got near to a place called Dawley-deep, I saw two boats coming in a direction from Birmingham—I was at that time driving my horse—it was about six o'clock in the evening—it was not over dark, it was dusk—my wife was steering the boat—I know the prisoner, but can't say how long he has been on the canal—it is the practice for any boat going form</p>

               <p>London to Birmingham to keep the road to Branston—the boats coming into London should drop their line and let the other boats swim over their rope—the horse drawing the boats from London should go on the canal side, and the horse drawing the boat towards London should keep the hedge side, drop the line, and let the horse pass over it—the prisoner was with the second of the two boats, which was thirty or forty yards from the first—I passed the first man's boat in the right way, when I met his horse he turned my horse over the line and dropped his rope in the correct way, his horse keeping the hedge side of the towing-path—that was a boat called the <hi rend="italic">Thistle</hi>—the prisoner's boat was the <hi rend="italic">Wellington</hi>—when I met him, his horse was against the water's edge—that was its wrong place—there was not space enough left between his horse and the water's edge for me to drive my horse on the inside—he did not stop his horse—I <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> my line over his horse's head, and then my line was in its right place, exactly as if my horse had gone over his line—his line was under mine—if the had stopped then and sunk his line, my boat would have gone over it as it did over the first—he did not stop—I called out to him loud enough for him to hear—I hooted fro him to stop his horse, and he did not—the rope by which the boat is drawn is attached to a small mast, which you cannot pull forward, but a little thing will pull it back—that is to enable the rocks to fall off—the prisoner's line loosed my from the boat, swept the deck, and made fast to my wife who was steering—the line fastened round her wrist and pulled her completely out of the boat into the water—I do not know what became of the prisoner—he did not stop to assist in getting my wife out of the water—my wife died on the next Friday night—her name was Ann Bridges.</p>

                  </hi> I am a constable, at St. Katherine's Docks. On 8th Nov., about a quarter to three o'clock, I was at the principal entrance—I had received information—I saw the prisoner going out, stopped him, and asked what he had about him—he said, "Nothing particular"—I said, "You must walk with me to the lodge—he did so—I asked what he had in his pocket—he said, some wool which he had drawn from different bales in the ware-house as a sample—I asked if he had any paper about him to show how</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220051"/>
               <p>he came by them, or a pass to pass it out—he said he had nothing of the kind, and that he was in the trade—I found wool in his pockets and hat, two pounds and three quarters, altogether—it was loose, not in a wrapper—his hat was as full as it could be, so that he could get it on—I turned round to the door to inform Superintendent Mumford, and the prisoner then attempted to destroy part of the wool by throwing it on the fire—it is known to the trade that persons cannot take anything out of the Dock without a pass.</p>

                  </hi> I am superintendent of the Dock Police. I went to the Police-office in the docks where the prisoner was—he said he obtained the wool from the wool-floor, from six different bales—he after<lb/>wards said he had taken it (or some) from Brown's warehouse—that is not in the docks, I believe it is near London-bridge—he afterwards said he had taken it from the London Docks—the rule in the docks is never to let any articles that are warehoused go out without a pass—persons in the trade know that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do sales of wool take place in the docks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, in Mincing-lane—wool is not sampled till after the sale—the parties come with a catalogue, and then attend the sale, and buy from their remarks in the catalogue—they feel the wool, and then put it back or drop it in the avenue—that does not become the sweepings of the warehouse, there are men appointed to pick it up again—if they took any away I should take them into custody—there was a sale approaching—it is probable two or three hundred persons had been there that day, examining, not sampling—I do not allow samples of wine to go out without a pass—I require one for all articles, however trifling—I do not know whether there are different sort of wool here.</p>

                  </hi> I am deputy warehouse-keeper of the wool warehouse in the St. Katherine's Docks. When wools are landed they are placed in the warehouse—we afterwards receive orders from the merchant to sample them—the brokers then classify and lot them for public sale—the brokers have samples—the buyers examine them by catalogue, but are not allowed to take sample till they are sold, when an order for sampling is obtained by the purchaser—people in the trade know that none is allowed to be taken before selling—I have frequently seen the prisoner there—I saw him on this occasion in the warehouse close by the bales of wool—I thought his pockets were bulkier than they ought to be, I followed him down stairs and gave in<lb/>formation to Walley, the store-keeper—I have examined this wool—it is of various kinds—there were such wools in the warehouse—I decidedly think it formed part of what was in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he say something about samples from Mr. Brown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Brown is a warehouse-keeper, and houses wool for public sale, the same as the Dock Company do—a portion of this wool might have come from Brown's as well as from the docks—there were fifty or sixty people in the warehouse, but the prisoner was last—people do not finger a little and take it away as a sample to my knowledge—it would not be allowed—only brokers take samples—a sample is one or and a half pounds from each bale—if there were 1000 bales to sample, the broker would</p>

               <p>be entitled to one pound from each, he would take 1000lbs. of wool—he would be obliged to produce sampling orders for it—wool is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the prisoner had two pounds and three quarters.</p>

                  </hi> I live in the Strand. On Sunday evening, the 10th of Oct., I got out of an omnibus in Gracechurch-street, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I had a gold watch in my waistcoat-pocket, fastened with a gold chain round my neck—I had seen my watch a few minutes before—when I got out, Curtis came up to me at the corner of Lombard-street—I forget the observation she made, but I went along Lom<lb/>bard-street, and she followed me to the corner of Nicholas-lane, which was twenty or thirty yards—she was with me a few minutes—she then ran away and immediately Hancock appeared—he said, "Halloo" in a sort of alarm—I said to him, "I thought you were a policeman"—he said, "No"—he left me and I discovered that my watch was gone, but not the chain—I gave a description of the prisoners to the police—I next saw Hancock in custody at the station—he had been apprehended from the information I gave—he is the man—Curtis I recognized in Newgate—the swivel of my watch chain was very loose—the watch could be detached from it by a snatch.</p>

                  </hi> I was acting as stoker on board the <hi rend="italic">Cricket</hi> at the time of the explosion—I had been so for about three weeks—the prisoner was then acting as engineer in charge of the engine—he came there after me, and had been acting about a fortnight at the time of the explosion—I have noticed two lines that were attached to the end of the safety-valves, they were there all the time I was there—I have seen those lines pulled—I have seen the iron nails or spikes, and have seen the lines hung over the spikes—I never took notice of the two spring-valves—I never noticed any steam escape by means of the spring-valves—I have seen it escape by means of the other valves, which had the weights on them—those weights shift from one end of the lever to the other, like a steel-yard—during Heasman's time the weight was always in the same place, about an inch from the end—I have seen him pour oil into the spring-valves, but I never saw act—on this morning the boat made four trips from London-bridge to this pier before the accident occurred—this pier was the conclusion of the trip—Heasman was in the engine-room while the passengers were landing—I was in the cabin—I saw Heasman after we got to the pier, before the explosion—he was then just coming out of the engine-room as I came out of the cabin—he was on deck—I did not see him go on to the pier—he stood by the larboard paddle-box—I believe there was then no one in the engine-room—I remained near the paddle-box until the explosion took place—he remained there also—just before he came out of the engine-room, I heard a noise like some one trying the water, turning one of the taps in front of the boiler, to ascertain that there was a proper quantity of water in it—the noise I heard was the noise of water passing—I was on deck about two or three minutes before the explosion took place—Heasman was standing by me all that time—I did not notice whether there was any steam blowing off at that time—when it blows off it makes a considerable noise—I have not been used to engines of a low pressure—I had seen the lines attached to the levers on that day—I might have seen them when we were at London-bridge—I recollect the steam blowing off the last time we left London-bridge, while the vessel was lying alongside London-bridge wharf—the trip from there to the Fox-under-the-Hill takes about six or seven minutes—I do not remember hearing it blow off after that—the lines came down direct from the levers into the engine-room—there were no pulleys.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to Mr. Joyce, who made the engines for the <hi rend="italic">Cricket.</hi> They were finished, I think, in July, 1846—the boilers were made by Mr. Trotman—I continued superintending their working, under Mr. Joyce, for six months after they were fixed on board the <hi rend="italic">Cricket</hi>—that is the usual practice—the minimum pressure at which these engines were intended to work, was 45lbs. per square inch, and about 60lbs. the maxi<lb/>mum, to be regulated according to the position of the weight on the levers—if the weight was at the extreme end, the pressure would be 60lbs.—one is loaded at 60lbs. and the other at 66lbs.—there is a difference in the two, the weight on one of the levers is above, and the other below; the one on the top could not be placed underneath, in consequence of its being in the way under the pipe—that accounts for the difference between the two—as far as regards one of these safety-valves, 60lbs. would be the utmost pressure at which it could be used, unless an extra weight was put on—there were two other valves, called "Salter's spring-valves;" they are similar; they are screwed down to act the same as a weight—they opened at 80lbs., I think—it is marked on the index—according as you screw it up or down, you affect the action of the spring, and tighten or loosen the valve—the engine was brought down to Mr. Joyce's place, at Greenwich, on the evening of 3rd Aug. last, for some repairs—the boilers were then examined, and one new tube put in, and several of the others repaired—the wearing out of those tubes is not at all unusual—the breaking or wearing of those tubes is of no importance to the stability of the boiler—they frequently leak, perhaps through not being properly cleaned—they are occasionally burnt a little, and leak at the ends; but that is not of much consequence—they require looking after occasionally—on the boilers being repaired on the 3rd of Aug., they were subjected to</p>

               <p>the hydranlic test, at a pressure of 150lbs. on the square-inch—they bore that well—the vessel resumed her work on Sunday, the 8th, I think—the valves were all looked at, repaired, and put in order, in acting condition—when the engine was fixed, there were not intended to be any lines to the levers of these two valves—they are not at all necessary—if the engineer were desirous of knowing whether those levers were acting properly, he would go on deck—we tested the boilers occasionally, when they came down—they were not tested at the maker's, I believe—they were tested after they were put on board, at the same pressure, 150lbs. to the square inch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was long after your attention had been called to this supposed bulging, that the boilers were tested to the extent you have mentioned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was some time afterwards—the experiment was repeated exactly three weeks previous to the accident—I think if one value had been opened, it would have allowed sufficient steam to get out to prevent the ex<lb/>plosion—the balance-value were intended to act at a pressure of about a pound or two more than the others, at about 65lbs.—one of the levers would act at 60lbs. and the other at 64lbs., five or six.</p>

                  </hi> I am an engineer, at Greenwich. I contracted with Mr. Smith for building the <hi rend="italic">Cricket</hi>, and supplying the machinery—she went to her station on 4th July, 1846—the machinery was made under my superin<lb/>tendence, except the boilers, which were made by Mr. Trotman, who is a boiler-maker—the boiler was tested, after it came from Mr. Trotman's, by my people—I do not attend to all the details myself—for six months the whole was under my guarantee; at the end of that time it was handed over to the proprietors, formally, and by letter—at the time the boiler was sent home there might have been a slight convexity in the front plate, but very slight indeed, if any—no boiler is made perfectly true, that is, not so true as another piece of machinery—there might have been a convexity of one-eighth or one-sixteenth of an inch; there was such a convexity—I think I noticed it previous to its going in—I should say it is not usual to place cords at the end of the levers of safety-valves—I do not think we have ever supplied them—if the valves were properly cleaned by the engineer, I should not think it necessary to use strings or pulleys to lift them—it is the usual duty of the engineer to take charge of the valves, and see that they are pro<lb/>perly kept clean—I saw the wreck after the explosion; about a ton and a half of iron was thrown from the boiler through the stern of the vessel, and was lying in the river, about forty yards from the vessel—I had not myself ascer<lb/>tained the strength of this boiler, nor was I present when my people did it—I should certainly think that if on 7th Aug. it was capable of bearing a pressure of 150lbs., that a pressure of 60lbs. would not have thrown a ton and a half forty yards, unless there had been a great deterioration of the boiler, which I am not aware of—the working pressure if this boiler was, I believe, from 45lbs. to 55 lbs. on the square inch.</p>

               <p>iron—there are several kinds of iron used for the purpose—Low-moor iron is by some persons considered the best—there is a difference of opinion about that—I do not think it is the best for this purpose, it is more used for fur<lb/>naces—this was the best Staffordshire iron—I believe it was the best iron, because it was contracted so to be—I know where it was bought, and the price paid for it, and a very experienced man purchased it, and used it—I have seen a portion of the iron since the explosion—I believe it was the best iron—I am speaking of the tube-plates—the whole of the part where the tubes go in was made of the best iron—I believe the other part was made with as good iron as could be used, save and except the Low-moor iron—I should say the front plate of the boiler was made of iron of the best quality—I do not see any other way of making boilers than with a flat face—if it was practicable to dome them at each end perhaps it might be better, but I conceive it would be impossible to make the tubes tight if they are made convex—I have since seen the exploded and the unexploded boilers—I should say the rivets were made as they ought to be—I think they were large enough—I do not profess to be a practical boiler-maker—all the rivets that I saw, properly filled the holes—the tubes through which the fire passes, and the metal containing them, should be fastened at the back with a stay—I do not recollect the number of holes there were there, nor am I aware that only one of the holes was bolted—it would be wrong to leave any of them unbolted—this boiler was held by the front plate principally—there is one stay here, and one at the back, with the number of bolts, whatever it may be—I believe those are all the stays—if these tubes were charged with flame, and left uncovered by water for five minutes, the heat would no doubt be considerable—if water was suddenly thrown upon the tubes so heated, it would produce a very considerable supply of steam, and would have a tendency to produce a great expansive power—the heat would beget steam, and that steam would, of course, cause pressure—I sup<lb/>plied the <hi rend="italic">Ant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> with machinery—I did not supply pulleys to the valves of those vessels—to the best of my recollection the pulleys were put after<lb/>wards by the engineers, for their own convenience—I have no recollection of their being supplied by us—I believe we have not supplied them to any steamers.</p>

                  </hi> I am chief engineer and inspector of machinery to the Admiralty. By direction of the Board of Trade, I inspected the wreck of this vessel after the explosion—I made a careful examination of the remaining materials of the boiler—I saw the outside part of the boiler lying at a con<lb/>siderable distance from the vessel—from all I saw, I think I can form a tolerably accurate judgment of the force that was employed to produce the explosion—I should say the explosion did not take place at a less force than 130lbs. on the square inch—it might be more—I think it must have been at least that—I saw the remaining boiler—that must have been exposed to the same degree of pressure as the one that exploded—the flat plate in front of that boiler was considerably bulged, I think to the extent of an inch and a half, it was damaged—I subjected it in that damaged state to a pres<lb/>sure of 136lbs. on the square inch—if either of the valves had acted at a pressure of 65lbs. or 66lbs., I think the explosion would not have taken place (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>) if the vessel were to have <hi rend="italic">careened</hi> for any length of time, and these tubes were to have become red hot, it is quite possible that steam, or an explosive mixture, might have been generated so fast as to have caused the accident; but if such had been the case, the boiler would have borne marks of it afterwards—I saw nothing about the boiler which showed that the tubes had become red hot—I think it quite possible that the explo<lb/>sion might have taken place under those circumstances, although all the valves were in healthy action; but if the iron had been very hot, and had become cold by the action by the water, there would have been an appearance of oxydation on the outside of the tubes—I found no such oxidation on these tubes—I think this explosion took place from the pressure of steam generated in the ordinary way—if the vessel had been lying at the pier of eight or nine minutes without steam blowing off. that would in my opinion be suffi<lb/>cient to account for the accident, or very nearly so—the blowing off of steam in a high-pressure engine makes a greater noise than from a low-pressure engine—there was nothing in the appearance of the remaining parts of the</p>

               <p>boiler to show that the valves were not in healthy action at the time the explosion took place—two of the valves of the unexploded boiler seemed to be quite right—they were to all appearance quite right—if the boiler did not burst under a pressure of 130lbs., and the valves were calculated to rise and act at 60lbs. or 65lbs., the action of the valves must have been prevented.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WEBSTER.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that the action of all four valves must have been prevented? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—it would be a very great defect in the construction of the machinery if three out of four valves had never, or very seldom acted—my attention was not called to the state of the valves in the exploded boiler—I do not recollect any one calling my attention to the fact that the valve in the exploded boiler was stuck fast and could not be removed—I heard of it afterwards—Mr. Hughes was there—I am not aware that his attention was called to it—Mr. Hughes was employed with me by Government—after I heard of it from some other person, a person called on me to say that he had called Mr. Hughes's atten<lb/>tion to it, I asked him whether that was so or not, and he said yes, but he attached no importance to it—I did not apply my attention to the subject after that, it was too late—I expressed the opinion that there was nothing in the appearance of the valves to indicate that they were not in a good state of action previous to the explosion—I have never noticed steam escaping without making a noise—I do not imagine it possible—the noise is made by the steam itself, not by its passing through the pipes—if no steam blew off, that would be quite sufficient to account for the accident—the temperature of the tubes when uncovered with water would depend upon the length of time they were exposed to the action of the fire alone—they would become red hot if exposed long—they might become very considerably heated without being red hot, and be of a temperature that would generate steam very rapidly, much more rapidly than in the ordinary working of the boiler if covered with water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give any ides of the increased rapidity with which steam would be generated under such circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly come to figures, but I imagine that the quantity of steam generated under such circum<lb/>stances would by no means be what one would suppose at first sight—if only the upper row of tubes became red hot, I apprehend that the quantity of steam that alone would generate would not be very great, because the tubes are very thin, not more than one-eighth of an inch thick; and if they were raised to a very considerable temperature, the quantity of heat they would impart to the water would not very materially increase the pressure of the steam, not anything in my opinion likely to cause explosion—if two rows of tubes were uncovered with water, the generation of steam would, of course, be double—persons going on board and coming out of a vessel would keep it <hi rend="italic">listed</hi> for a short time—if it was kept on one side for some time, the effect would be to fill one boiler with water, and rather to empty the other—the effect to that would be that the tubes in the empty boiler would be exposed to the fire without water on them—it is not improbable that the vessel should heel over to a certain extent—a great number of the tubes might, perhaps, become bare of water—the model produced shows the thing better than anything—by putting it to any inclination you like, you will see how many tubes are bared—it would depend upon the height of the water in the boilers—I think it quite impossible that nearly all the water in one boiler would be transferred to the other—if there was a very small quantity in the boilers, a small incli<lb/>nation would allow the whole to run in—it would not flow so readily as in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220074"/>
               <p>the model—I do not know how large the connexion is made here—I imagine it is much larger than in the actual boiler—this line represents the ordinary water line—the tubes are confined between the water line and the red line and the top of the furnace door—I have here a drawing of the boiler (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>ducing it</hi>)—these three dark marks are the three gauge-cocks—by placing this stick across, you will see here the exact inclination which the vessel would assume in order to allow the water to flow from one boiler into the other—such an inclination as that, would not leave any of the tubes uncovered with water, and would produce no mischief—it is probable if a vessel were inclined in the way suggested, that several of these tubes might have been exposed to the fire for some time, clear of water—I think the pressure of steam would be the same in both boilers if there was a perfectly free com<lb/>munication—I imagine that a twentieth part of the size of the pipe of com<lb/>munication would allow the extra quantity of steam to pass from one boiler to the other—I can conceive no difference of pressure could arise from that cause—there is no possibility of the steam-pipe being stopped with water, unless the communication between the two boilers was closed I see nothing which could prevent the steam from having the same pressure—I cannot conceive such a state of things—it would necessarily follow that the boiler which con<lb/>tained the less water would contain the more steam—the steam could not become surcharged with heat—if one boiler was short of water, and the tubes were not covered with water, steam would increase very rapidly in a very short time—I did not say that in that state of things the steam would increase very rapidly in elastic force—I apprehend that would not increase the elastic force of the steam—if the tubes were altogether bare, and the same quantity of water remained in the boiler, the steam would not be generated any faster—if there was little water in one boiler, and the other was empty, steam would increase more rapidly in the empty boiler, but there being a communi<lb/>cation the pressure would be the same in both—that would of course depend upon the rate at which the steam could travel from one boiler to the other—this is the first case of explosion I have had to do with—I have heard of a great number—there is a considerable difference of opinion among scientific men in accounting for these explosions—I have never heard of an explosion taking place when steam has been blowing off—it is quite possible that a very small quantity of steam may be blowing off and yet the boiler explode, if the aperture through which the steam passes is not sufficient to let out the steam as fast as it is generated—I have heard it stated that the pressure, as indicated by the gauge at Waterloo-bridge, was 25lbs., but I should doubt the fact of the steam being at that pressure at that time—supposing it to be so, the elasticity of the steam could not in the one minute occupied in getting from there to the pier increase to a dangerous extent—even if the tubes had been clear of water, I do not think that would have increased the elasticity of the steam sufficiently to have burst the boiler—if by the tilting of the vessel the tubes being bare of water acquired a considerable temperature short of red head, it would cause a sudden generation of steam; but that would be quite insufficient, in my opinion, to account for the great pressure which the steam must have had—some persons imagine that explosions arise from the generation of gases in the boiler—a few persons entertain that opinion—the character of the water has nothing to do with it—the steam would have the same quality, whether the water was dirty or clean—I am not aware that the character of the water would affect the theory you allude ✗valve with a weight on it, the other was carried away</p>

               <p>with the exploded boiler—the remaining valve would have lifted at a pres<lb/>sure of 66lbs. on the square inch, supposing the weight to have been at the extremity of the lever—the engineer can tell whether the steam is blowing off at a valve or not, by going on deck he could have lifted with his hand the end of the lever, and made a rough guess at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if he was down in the engine-room, on looking at the steam<lb/>gauge, and the state of things there disclosed, had he any means of knowing the state of pressure as between 40lbs. and 66lbs.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except, as I have said before, he had pulled the string we have heard so much about, and that had caused the valve to lift, that would show that the steam was getting up—the pulling of that string would cause the valve to lift, if the pressure of steam was nearly equal to the pressure on the valve, it would release the valve—if the object of proving a boiler is merely to see that every thing is tight and proper, I should be quite satisfied with proving it at double its working pressure, having only that object in view—I think that the working-pressure of a boiler should not exceed one-tenth, I will not say of the absolute strength of the boiler, but of its calculated strength, sup<lb/>posing it to be made of the best possible materials, and without defect of any kind, a kind of boiler which of course you cannot get—I think a pressure of 66lbs. constantly, would be dangerous—I never saw a high-pressure boiler like the exploded one—I consider it an objectionably-constructed one—I have heard the witnesses describe the way in which the boiler had been used by Clark—the tying down of the safety-valves would weaken the boiler, supposing that the steam got an elastic force beyond the 66lbs.; the valves might be tied down without that result being attained—I think the course pursued by the previous engineer, Clark, would weaken the boilers and render them dangerous in use—the course of testing to which they were subjected would also be likely to weaken them; it would be a choice of evils, perhaps—it is quite impossible to estimate the effects of the various causes—I think a constant pressure of 66lbs. would be dangerous, even if proper care had been taken of the boiler—the valve that was loaded at 66lbs., was, I think, the valve of the unexploded boiler—I was not able to ascertain that owing to the way in which the weight on the unexploded boiler was placed, the valve could only open a very small way; because when I first saw the vessel, the deck, and every other part in connexion with the boiler, was blown away—I never saw the steam-chest—the area of that valve is nearly five square inches—if the valve could only open to the extent of one square inch, from this weight coming in contact with the top, it would be a great defect—I should desire each valve to open freely to the extent of half-an-inch—I think one square inch would have allowed all the steam that this boiler could generate to escape, that would be under the ordinary state of things, when the tubes were covered with water—I should not apply that ob<lb/>servation to the state of things if the tubes were hot from being uncovered with water, and water thrown upon them afterwards; that is a state of things hardly to be imagined, a large amount of steam would then be gene<lb/>rated in a short time, but I do not think the steam would generate so fast as to make it dangerous from that cause—I think the engine-driver was per<lb/>fectly justified in keeping the weight at the extreme point of the lever, unless he received direction to the contrary—that would be 66lbs, on one lever, and 60lbs. on the other, unless the captain ordered him to slacken his pace, or rather it is the simple pressure of the steam in the boiler; the captain I imagine would not interfere in that matter—I consider the engine-driver would</p>

               <p>be perfectly justified in working at 66lbs. continuously—when I saw the remain<lb/>ing Salter's valve, several days after the accident, the index then pointed to a little more than 20—that indicated a pressure on the boiler of 40lbs.; whether it was so at the time of the accident or not, I cannot tell—if it was in the position in which I saw it, it would lift at about 40lbs.—I had no means of ascertaining that as a fact—I do not know whether the boat was then in the custody of the police, there were police-officers about there when I made my examination—the heating-surface in these boilers was about as much as in ordinary boilers of that power, it was sufficient to generates steam rapidly—if all the valves had been properly in operation, the steam never could have accumulated in the boiler to a dangerous extent—they should all four have lifted at the same pressure, at or under say 60lbs.—I do not like spring balances at the end of a lever; I should prefer weights, although spring balances are commonly used—there was one peculiarity about this which I think was probably calculated to mislead an engineer; namely, that the index on the spring balance did not, as it usually does, show the same as the pressure of steam in the boiler; that is to say, if the Salter's balance indicated 20, the pressure of the steam on the boiler would be 40lbs.; that is not the usual way in which these things are put on—I should think it most likely that the prisoner did not know that fact—I never saw the mercury-gauge, that was blown away and destroyed—the express object with which the mercury-gauge is put there is for the engineer to consult it, and see what the pressure is—I found the front plate of the unexploded boiler bulged—I also examined the stays, there were only two, and they were both broken—those stays were altogether insufficient for the purpose of sustaining the front plate—I consider it very objectionable to have steam-pressure brought on a flat plate in the way in which it was on this boiler—you can calculate the pressure easily enough; but the entire pressure of steam in the boiler was borne by the front plate, which I think is objectionable for the purpose of sustain<lb/>ing the pressure of the steam—when the pressure comes upon a flat plate of that kind, the strain in the direction of the plate in the surface is enormous when the least bulging takes place, that is on objection to it—if the plate did not bulge at all, if it were not perfectly rigid, the strain in the plane would be enormous, beyond any calculation—when it bulges at all, the pres<lb/>sure comes in the middle, somewhat in the way in which it does on a musical string—a very small pressure at right angles with the plate will bring the great pressure in the plane of the plate—I do not think that plate was suff<lb/>cient to sustain the weight of 60lbs.—upon certain assumptions, I calculated what the pressure of steam would become in five, ten, and fifteen minutes, supposing no steam had been permitted to escape during that time—the pressure of steam in five minutes, I believe, would be 90lbs., supposing the boiler had been in proper operation, and a sufficient quantity of water in the boiler, but steam not permitted to escape, and that the pressure of steam was 50 when she came alongside the pier, then the pressure at the end of ten minutes, I take it, would probably be 130lbs. or 140lbs.—I should consider the front plate insufficient, irrespective of any consideration of that kind—all the safety<lb/>valves communicated into one pipe, and all went up into the funnel and escaped with the smoke—the area of that pipe leading into the funnel was less than the united area of the safety-valves, but enough to allow all the steam to escape which would be generated by the boiler—the greater the pressure the smaller would be the pipe necessary to carry it off—I examined the boiler, and proceeded to test the materials—I took pieces of the plates</p>

               <p>that were rent, they were three-eighths of an inch thick—I took strips of them and tested them in the usual manner—I tore them asunder—the aver<lb/>age mean pressure which they bore was 17 tons on the inch—strips of Low moor iron will bear 21 2/3—some of these plates were laminated—iron of good quality may be laminated by accident—it is a matter to be guarded against as much as possible—these plates were separated in the manufacture—they were of two thicknesses instead of one, the parts had not been properly incorporated—I found that lamination in some of the parts where the fractures took place—the iron had become a little thinner by wear—I tried some common plate, and that bore about the same as the iron of the <hi rend="italic">Cricket's</hi> boiler—I think that neither the quality of the iron or the work<lb/>manship of the boiler were such as ought to have been placed in a vessel of this kind—some of the rivets did not fill the holes—they were generally too short to make a good rivet—they were not insufficient in thickness—I do not attribute the explosion wholly to the deterioration of the boiler by wear—if the boiler had been stronger there would have been of course less chance of explosion—I also examined the unexploded boiler—I apprehend that that was subjected to the same pressure at the time of the explosion—I found that it leaked—I have never expressed an opinion that the exploded boiler might have been inherently defective—of course it might have been defective, but from my examination of it there was no reason to suppose so, except in point of construction, and those other matters to which I have referred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated several points in which you consider the construction of this boiler was open to objection, did you take those cir<lb/>cumstances into your consideration, when you arrived at the judgment which you say you formed from an inspection of the wreck, that this explosion did not take place under a pressure of 140lbs. or 150lbs.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I formed the opinion that the pressure must have been at least 130lbs. chiefly from the fact of the unexploded boiler bearing that pressure—that result is not at all affected by the original defective construction of the boiler—it is the business of the engineer in charge of a steam-vessel, if three out of four of the valves do not act, to put them in order, and to see that they are in order—in the Navy the engineer is responsible for the general management of the engine, but in these boats, the <hi rend="italic">Cricket</hi> for instance, the engineer would be considered the solely responsible man for a matter of this kind—I think it would be no evidence of negligence on the part of the engineer that he had worked the lever at a pressure of 66—I think the bare fact of the weight being there, would be an authority for him to do so—two of the valves would no doubt be ample if they were in good order; indeed I have no doubt that one, if in good order, would have been sufficient to have prevented the explosion; but it is not for an engine-driver to judge of those matters, he ought to have them all in good order, because if he trusted to one, and that happened to get out of order, an accident of this kind might occur—a continuous pressure at 66lbs. would not be free from danger—I do not think, from my inspection of these boilers, that the period had arrived at which danger could arise from using the boilers at that pressure—I think they might have run some time longer without an accident, but when they became injured by wear then I think it would become very dangerous—these boats are built very nearly <hi rend="italic">crank</hi>, which causes them to oscillate—the weight of one person going on board would cause some incli<lb/>nation—on the passenger quitting the boat, or going into the centre of it, the boat would assume its original level, and so it would oscillate from time to time—if</p>

               <p>by the tilting of the boat some of the tubes in one boiler were bared of water, that mischief would terminate on the boat recovering its horizontal position; the water would instantly cover the tubes again—that would be the case each time the boat recovered its position—the degree of inclination necessary to expose any of the tubes in the boiler from the water, would depend upon the height of the water in the boiler—it would be impossible to expose all the tubes, if there was a proper quantity of water in the boiler—it is the duty of the engine<lb/>driver to see to that—the water coming from the water-cock immediately before the explosion would indicate that there was a sufficient quantity of water in the boiler—if there had been any generation of explosive gases, I should have expected to find oxydation on the tubes—I found none—I believe that on explosive mixture was formed, but that the explosion was occasioned by the pressure of steam of the ordinary kind—it was eight or ten days after the accident that I saw the spring-valve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first go to the vessel.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 7th Sept.—my chief reason for considering that the pressure was 130lbs., is from finding that the other boiler bore that pressure afterwards—the pressure on both boilers must have been the same, the steam having a free communication from one to the other—it is scarcely possible to suppose, looking at the nature of the material of which the boilers were composed, that the one was inferior to the other; the strength would be uniform—I put a pressure of 136lbs. on the unexploded boiler, and found it sustained it—I do not know that it had that pressure at the time of the accident, but I assume that it must have had at least as much as that to have exploded the other boiler—that is assuming they were of equal strength, and that the other would not have exploded at a less pressure; but I should mention that this boiler did not absolutely burst at that pressure, therefore I think it must have borne at least that pressure to have exploded—if the other boiler had been considerably weaker I should have been able to have detected it by, looking at the materials, because the whole of the front of the boiler was blown out, and it was a part of that very front which I tested in the manner I have described—from what I saw, I formed the opinion that the pressure must have been as much as 130lbs. throughout, it might have been more—I formed no opinion from the distance that the metal was blown—I do not think that material—I imagine that to be scarcely within the limit of calculation, because the pieces of the boiler which exploded, carried away with it the whole of the deck, tore open the end of the vessel and went to a considerable distance beyond, therefore the mere dis<lb/>tance to which it was thrown could not show the pressure employed in throwing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could a pressure of 60lbs. have caused that propulsion of the ton and a half of iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is really a question which I cannot answer—the unexploded boiler was considerably injured, so as to be unfit for its purpose—the escape of steam would make noise enough for a person on deck to hear it—it makes a very great noise—if the steam was blowing off as it should blow off, there would be quite noise enough to be heard by any person in the neighborhood of the vessel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain the proportion which you state is to be observed between the calculated strength of the boiler and the actual working power? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider that if the calculation be founded upon the strength of a boiler, supposing that materials to be without defect, and of the best possible quality and workmanship, which of course you cannot obtain in a work of this kind, then I say you ought not to use that boiler at a pressure of more than one-tenth</p>

               <p>of what that calculation would give—if you to work a boiler at a pressure of 50lbs. on the square inch, your calculated strength ought to be 500lbs—you must allow the pressure of any material to be something more than one-third of the breaking weight—if a piece of iron is calculated to bear three tons, you could not safely put more than one ton upon it, and I think you must allow something like a third for the wear and tear of the boiler—the plates of a boiler put to this kind of use wear thin, and certain parts become injured; I think you ought to allow another third for that, which makes it one-ninth, and I have calculated it at at one-tenth—the part of the boiler that gave way was too weak; but the shell of it I find, having just made a calculation, would have borne ten times the pressure it was intended to work at—the front of this boiler was the weak part of it—a flat surface of that kind held to the boiler only by its circumference, is ill calculated to sustain a pressure—I can only tell what pressure that front plate would bear, from the experiment I made upon the unexploded boiler, which bore 136lbs.—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some pieces of iron produced</hi>), these are portions of the exploded boiler—I did nothing with the other boiler except making the experiment—I tried it, and found it was of the ordinary strength—to the best of my knowledge, it was in a perfect state as a boiler.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Edward and Charles Kitchen. On Monday, 18th Oct., I saw a hammer in a drawer in the shop counter, near one of the windows—it was the first article that laid in the drawer, and was the only hammer of that size and description in the shop—there was another, but it was smaller—on the morning of the 19th Oct., I was coming down stairs, and saw Morley behind that counter in a stooping position, close to the drawer where I had seen the hammer—he appeared to take something from the drawer, and conceal it about his person—he went out shortly after—I went to the drawer and missed and hammer, which I had seen there the day before—I gave information, and on 30th Oct. went with the policeman to Hedges' premises in Crown-street, Soho—I saw Hedges' wife and son at the shop—his wife left the premises, and one of the policemen was directed to follow her—soon after, the son came out, and I went with him to 4, Falconbridge-court, to a house or apartment which I believe belonged to Hedges—Mrs. Hedges, or the woman who passes as his wife, said it was their place—I saw this hammer there, under some linen on a large table—it is the same I had seen in Mr. Kitchen's shop—it is one of a peculiar description.</p>

Kitchen—I am positive of it, it has our private mark on it—they have tried to erase it, but could not manage it—it is a very difficult job—we went over the stock-book and missed two hammer-heads of this description.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 114.) I searched Hedges' shop and found two packets of nails wrapped in brown paper behind the counter, under some baskets which contained old iron and other things—I also found these pieces of brown paper—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found some jars full of nails, and behind some old bottles on some shelves some more nails in paper—after I had done searching the place I told Hedges I was going to ask him some questions, and he need not answer me without he liked—I asked him where he got this pro<lb/>perty from—he said he bought it of a young man, but did not know his name—I asked if he should know him again—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he kept a book—he gave me one—I was looking in it and could not see the entry—he said, "There is no account of these things there"—I said, "Don't you know you are obliged to keep an account of all you buy"—he said, no, he had heard of it, but he did not think he was obliged to do it—I took him to the station—he gave his address, 4, Falconbridge-court—while I was in the shop, his wife and son and the officer went away—I asked him where they were gone—he said he did not know, he supposed they were gone home—I said, "Where is that?"—he said, "No. 4, Falconbridge-court"—I went there, but the hammer had been found before I got there.</p>

                  </hi> I am a house-painter, at Stewart's-rents, Drury-lane—I heard that Hedges was desirous of selling his business, and I went to inquire about it on Thursday evening, 14th Oct.—I had not known him before—while I was in conversation with him, Morley came into the shop and asked Hedges if he bought nails, pointing to the window, and said, "I think you have a quantity in the window"—there were a quantity of loose nails there—Hedges said, "I do"—Morley asked him what he gave a pound for them—Hedges said 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Morley said, "That is not enough"—Hedges said, "I can't give more, I sell them myself at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I cannot say whether the nails in the window were ticketed or not—Morley then produced some nails—he said he was a hawker, and had several odd lots—the loose nails were then weighed, and weighed one pound and a half—he then produced four or five brown paper packages of different sizes—they were not weighed—they were bought by the package—he could feel that they were nails—he paid 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the loose nails, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the packages.</p>

It is my duty to grant register-tickets to applicants—these tickets produced were granted by me—a person applied to me for them who I believe was the prisoner—he came with the master of the ship—I delivered one ticket to the party, and kept the other at the office—this is dated 18th April, 1847.</p>

                  </hi> I am a master mariner at North Shields.

                  </hi> I am clerk to the Assistant-Registrar in London. On 22nd Oct. the defendant applied to me to have a ticket—Captain Nicholas Stevens was with him, and his father, and Mr. Anthony a colonial agent I believe—he produced two indentures for enrolment, one of them was left in the office—we cautioned the boy to speak the truth, and put the question to him—I objected to give him the ticket that day, because I found he had been bound to his father—on the 25th the whole party appeared again and produced the cancelled indentures by which he had been bound to his father, and this indenture, by which he became bound to Stewart—I then asked him his Christian and sirname, and whether he had ever had a register-ticket before, or ever been registered before—he answered, "No"—I then asked when he was born, and his birth-day, in order to get his age—he gave the day he was born—I asked him whether he had ever been to sea before—he said he had not—thereupon I granted him this ticket which is attached to this indenture, and I kept one—I handed this one to the captain—it is the captain's duty to keep the ticket while the boy is in his service, and return it when his apprenticeship is over; but tickets of others, who are not appren<lb/>tices, he returns at the end of the voyage.</p>

               <p>inquired at the dock of Mr. Humphreys, the head inspector of the gate-keep<lb/>ers, at the Baggage Warehouse, and at the Queen's Warehouse—I have seen Mr. Taylor since at the Court—I do not know that information was given to him which he is here to swear to; I have seen him here—the least thing that happens ought to be reported to the inspector—if anything was reported to him it would be his duty to give information to the police—I said I would make the prisoner pay dearly for these things—I said I would take him up—I did not say I would give him in custody if he did not pay for them—he did not offer to go down to the docks with me when I made the appointment—I went to him first on a Friday—he came over on Saturday to go to the docks; I met him, and he took me to Mr. Foster, who, I think, had some of the things—Foster said he knew the Custom-house officer who was on board the ship when she was discharged, and that he knew something about them; but I believe he got me away on purpose to keep me from meeting Smith at the dock till the dock was shut—Foster then took me to look after Rose—he took me to two or three houses, where the people shut the door in his face—Mr. Taylor's name was not mentioned by either party—I will not be certain whether Smith was going with me, but I told him he had better go to the docks—I was to meet him at the Baggage Warehouse—I went, but he never came—I swear that—no: I promised to go to the dock with him, but he never came to go with me—he and Taylor did not offer again to go with me to look after Rose—I think that the vessel arrived again in June this year—I was present when an application was made to postpone the trial on account of the <hi rend="italic">Grecian</hi> not being here, but that she would be here in June—my reply was that she could not be here till Sept.; I knew it was impossible if she made the voyage as she always did, as she had to go from Bombay to China—she is away now—she was here in June—I was chief mate nearly five years—I do not know whether they are two odd stockings that I have had put in this indictment—the washerwoman used to come for the things to be washed at Canton—she came for a good many people's beside mine—my things have sometimes been changed at the wash—I went before the Magistrate six or seven times before I could get the prisoner committed for trial—two or three days after he was committed, the carpenter of the <hi rend="italic">Grecian</hi> arrived—I was told that he went before the Magi<lb/>strate to tender his evidence, but it was too late as the depositions were taken.</p>

In consequence of information I received from Mrs. M'Dowall, I went to the St. Katharine's Docks to the ship <hi rend="italic">Grecian</hi>—the new captain was on board—I saw the steward, and asked how Capt. M'Dowall was—he said he was as bad as he could be to be alive—I asked what things he had of his on board—the said only a sword-stick and five bamboo canes—the vessel had arrived about two o'clock in the morning; this was between three and four in the afternoon—I said, "Mrs. M'Dowall has received a letter from Capt. M'Dowall saying he is better, and has a few things on board"—I took the letter out of my pocket, and read the part which concerned him—it was about the two shawls, the flowers, and some toys for the children—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I sent everything on shore to the agent at Hong Kong"—I went into the</p>

M'Dowall lived—I said, "I can't exactly tell you, but I will take you round and show you"—when he saw him, he said, "Capt M'Dowall, I never thought of your things till this minute"—he after<lb/>wards said the cupboard was broken open, and some things were stolen.</p>

                  </hi> I am a wife of William Anderson, of Deptford—I have known the prisoner about five years—in the summer of 1846, he came to lodge at my house—he said he had been home two days—he afterwards brought seven or eight boxes of artificial flowers, as near as I can recollect—he showed some of them to me; some were afterwards found—he said the ship had been robbed in the docks, and he had lost two white crape shawls,. which he had brought over for his cousin; from the place where they had been bat<lb/>tened down—he said nothing about Capt.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you sell the flowers before the battening up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is, I gave them to the prisoner—I sold some to Capt.

                  </hi> I am single, and live at 1, St. Swithin's-place, Chapman-street, St. George's in the East. I employed the prisoner—I sent her on 29th Sept. with three pairs of trowsers to Mr. Clark, whom I work for—she came back, and said it was too late, that she did not receive either money or work—I went myself next day, and afterwards saw her—she asked me to stop a bit and I should have my trowsers—I went with her to her mother's, and she asked her mother to release them from pawn—I gave her into cus<lb/>tody—she had no business to pawn them—these are them.</p>

On 27th Oct., about nine o'clock in the morning, he gave me three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I wrapped them in a piece of paper, and put them into my pocket—I remained in the parlour until about a little before twelve, when the prisoner was paid—I saw Mr. Ryan pay him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some gold—he said, "There is a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the rest I will give you in gold"—I did not notice the amount of the gold—the prisoner did not give any change—Mr. Ryan put his name on the back of the note—I saw a receipt written, and given to Mr. Ryan; and immediately after that I asked Mr. Ryan to lend me his pencil, to take the numbers of my notes—I took them out of my pocket, went into the other parlour, and made this memoran<lb/>dum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the numbers were 3871, 3872, and 3873—I took up a piece of paper, rolled the notes up in it, then went into the other parlour, and returned Mr. Ryan his pencil—my baby screamed, and I threw the notes down on the breakfast-table, carelessly, and went to see what was the matter—I returned in a about a quarter of an hour, and Mr. Ryan was the gone, and the notes were not on the table—the breakfast had been cleared away some time when I threw them there—I sent the servant after Mr. Ryan—in about a quarter of an hour I saw him, and communicated my loss to him—these three notes are mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the night before the prisoner ordered some food of a person passing by, and rang the bell—Mr. Ryan went out immediately, and asked if he had money to pay for what he had ordered—he said he had not a farthing in the world.</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mrs. Merritt, of 32, Commercial-road. The prisoner lived there—he generally came home about eleven o'clock at night—I expected him at that time on this Monday evening—I was up till twelve o'clock, he had not come in then—I left Mrs. Muggeridge waiting for him—I did not hear him come home—at a little past seven next morning, I was cleaning the step, and he was going out and spoke to me—he was very tipsy indeed, he could scarcely walk—he came home again about twelve o'clock that day, he appeared very tipsy then—I think he went to sleep in a chair—he seemed rather poorly—he had some tea—I do not know that any vinegar was made use of—I saw him go out at five o'clock, he was quite tipsy then—I had never seen him so bad as that before—I did not see him again till I saw him at Clerkenwell prison on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Stinton, as linen-dra<lb/>pers and mercers, carrying on business in Vere-street, Oxford-street—in Oct. last, the prisoner Simons was in our service, and had been so for about two years and a half—she was saleswoman in the clock department—we make up good from silk, satins, and other materials—it was her duty to cut out those things for the purpose of their being made up—by those means she had access to our general property—we took stock on 20th Feb. last, and then found a large deficiency—we had no suspicion of Simon then—on Tuesday, 19th Oct., in consequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Brown, one of our assistants, I called Simons into the hosiery-department, where Brown was engaged, and told her I wished to see a dozen pairs of cotton stockings that had been taken from that department a few days previous—she told me she had had none—I sent for Brown, and told him that she denied having had any stockings from that department—he told her he was positive he had given her the stockings—she said, "Oh, yes, I remem<lb/>ber them; but I brought them back to the department"—he said he was perfectly satisfied they had never been returned—I then asked her who she brought them back to—she said she did not know, she laid them on the counter—I then told her that I wished to see six pairs of white silk stockings that she had taken from the same department—she stated that she had them to get marked, and that she brought them back to the department—I told her that I was afraid she had been robbing us to a very large amount, and that she was a very bad girl—I was then given to understand that she had taken some property to a Miss Rourke's, and I went there with Mr. Brown—I did not take Simons—she was not then in custody—I found some of my property at Miss Rourke's, which Brown brought back—in consequence of what I discovered in going to Miss Rourke's, I gave Simons in charge—she was searched at the station—I was not present—her boxes were afterwards examined by Alison, the constable, who took her into custody—on searching her boxes I found other articles, which I claimed—she had previously told me that some portion of the stocking she had taken would be found in her boxes, the others she had given to a woman who had the care of her child—that was after I had returned from Miss Rourke's, but before she was given in charge—she had before that begged that I would look over it, in cones<lb/>quence</p>

               <p>of her child—I told her I would not—I saw Alison take from her box some letters, and this piece of paper produced, bearing the name of "P. D. Hickman, Esq., 18, Lincoln's-inn Fields, Holborn"—after we had been before the Magistrate at Marylebone Police-court, I went to 33, Welbeck-street, where one of Simons's sisters lived—I then went at 18, Lincoln's-inn Fields, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—up to that time I had no knowledge that I should find any of my property there—the housekeeper opened the door—I inquired for Mr. Hickman, and was told that he was not at home—I did not leave my name or any message—the female prisoner had then been remanded—I went to Mr. Hickman's again, about half-past ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, with Alison, the constable, and a servant from 33, Welbeck-street—I saw the housekeeper again, but did not see Mr. Hickman—I inquired if they knew a person of the name of Simons, or Simmons—I left my name and address on that occasion, and a message that Ann Simons had been robbing us to a very large amount—I believe that was all I said on that occasion—I did not say I would call again—there was another examination before the Magistrate on the Wednesday—I was at<lb/>tended by my attorney, Mr. Lloyd—Mr. Hickman was not there—a Mr. Wathen attended as Simons's attorney—I now know that Mr. Wathen is Mr. Hickman's attorney—Mr. Hickman himself told me so—I went to Mr. Hick<lb/>man's chambers again on the Thursday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock—I went with him—I had before that been at the Police-office on that same Thursday morning, and was introduced to Mr. Hickman there, by Mr. Wathen—he told me there was a large quantity of goods that he wished to give up to us, which he had no doubt belonged to us; that he had forced the drawers that morning, and found them—we then called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and myself, Alison, and Mr. Hickman, went to Mr. Hickman's cham<lb/>bers—Mr. Wathen did not go—in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, Mr. Hickman told me that the first time he met Ann Simons was in Holles-street, about two years ago, that he afterwards wrote to her and made an appointment with her, and that he had known her since that time—he told me he had paid off a mortgage for her father which had cost him 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and altogether he had paid 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her father—I told him I was surprised to hear that she had a father alive, as she had always given me to understand that she had no father living—he said that she had, and he believed him to be very well connected—I asked him if he was aware she had had a child—he said he was not, that his firm belief was that he had her to himself—when we got to Lincoln's-inn Fields he took us up stairs into his apartments himself, and pointed out the goods, which were in two large bundles on the floor—he pointed to the drawers, and said they had been taken out of those drawers—they were drawers in a wardrobe in the bed-room—there were two bed-rooms—he said Simons had slept at his chambers on the Saturday night previous—he did not say with whom—I asked him if he was aware she was in our employment—he said he was, that she frequently came down there of an evening, and that he allowed her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day for <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-hire—I asked him if he was not very much surprised at receiving such an immense quantity of goods from a young woman, knowing that she was in a situation—he said that she had always told him that she had paid for them, that she had a salary of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that her perquisites made it 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—her salary was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a years, and I should say her perquisites were not more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the whole time she was with us—she boarded and lodged in the house—I told Mr. Hickman the salary she had, and he seemed very much surprised—I then recognized a waistcoat that Mr. Hickman was wearing—it has been taken possession of—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said she gave it him—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220129"/>
               <p>asked if he had had any others—he said, yes, he had—I recognised it by the material, and told him I had no doubt that the stuff was stolen from our shop—he said he had no doubt it, that Ann Simons brought it to him, and told him that she had got it from Marshall and Stinton's, that it was a rem<lb/>nant and cost very little—that was the first he mentioned to me about any pre<lb/>sents; he said she gave it to him—I then asked him if he had any more, and he said he had eleven other waistcoats from the prisoner Simons, which were made up—they were not produced on that occasion—he pointed out a great many things in the room as having been received from her as presents—an easy chair, a bronze dog, a cigar-case, a very handsome plant on a pedestal, and a gold chain—those were the principal things that he pointed out at that time—he afterwards pointed out other things—a list was made of the things he pointed out (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I did not make it out, but I have no doubt this is a correct list of the things he said he had received as presents from her—there was a bird-cage and some birds, a flower-pedestal, a glass-case, some pocket-handkerchiefs; I believe he said eighteen—he produced them—they were cambric, and unmarked—there was a gentleman's short sable boa, a lady's silk dress, and some chair-covers, I do not know how many—he represented the silk dress as being a present from Simons to one of the servants—there were some table-covers, a crimson velvet cushion, and a chintz bed furniture lined with yellow—(<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER,</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you some time ago compound with your creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—we stopped payment about five or seven years ago, I am not certain which—I am sure it is as much as five—we paid every one 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, with in<lb/>terest—eighteen months was given us, and we fulfilled our engagements at the end of that time—Mr. Stinton has the care of the books—he is assisted, of course—we had always taken stock twice a year previous to out stopping payment, and once a year latterly; but for the last two years, twice a year, on 20th Oct. and 20th Aug.—we only took stock once in 1846—I am certain of that—it was on 20th Aug.—We next took stock on 20th Feb., 1847, and again on 20th Aug.—I am not aware that I said we took stock in Oct.—if I did I was mistaken—on all those occasions Mr. Stinton had the superintendence of the books—we have continually missed portions of our stock—I cannot say the exact time we first did so—on taking stock we found we were deficient of our usual profits—we found that more particularly in the last twelve months—we have missed things that never could be accounted for—we missed stock previous to that, but we cannot prove what particular stock we were deficient of—we were deficient of our profits—I am speaking of the amount of stock—we have missed profit—it is impossible to tell what part of our</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first time you ever saw Mr. Hickman was on Thursday, 21st Oct.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came with Mr. Wathen to the station-house—I think it was about half-past ten or eleven o'clock—Simons was not then at the station—I was sent for, and found Mr. Hickman there—Mr. Stinton fetched me—Alison and I were at the house in Welbeck-street—we went from there to the station—Mr. Wathen was there with Mr. Hickman—we went afterwards to Lincoln's-inn Fields in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Alison, I, and Mr. Hickman, were all three inside—part of the conversation I have repeated was while we were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, before we arrived at Lincoln's-inn Fields—it was not while in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that I put any question to Mr. Hickman about giving the girl money—there was a conversation about the father—I do not recollect that I asked him any question about money—I do not recollect how he came to tell me about giving the father money—I have no recollection of what led to that conversation—on arriving at Lincoln's-inn Fields, one of the servants opened the door—to the best of my recollection it was the same person that had opened the door when I was there before—we proceeded up stairs immediately, and went into the sitting-room first—the bed-room opens into the sitting-room—the door of the bed-room is about in the middle of the room, I think—I should say a person could not come in at the door of the sitting-room, and pass into the bed-room, without being seen by a person sitting at the table in the sitting-room—you cannot get into the bed-room without going through the sitting-room—the table was exactly opposite the bed-room door—it would, of course, depend very much upon what part of the table the person was sitting at—we passed from the sitting-room into the bed-room—the housekeeper, Mrs. Burdon, was present—we found one bundle in one room, and one in the other, one in each bed-room—there are two bed-room—the chest of drawers and wardrobe of which I have spoken, were in the first or front bed-room—one bundle was in that room, another in the back bed-room—there was a bed in each room—Mr. Hickman took me there for the purpose of seeing the things which he said had been takes out of the drawers—I did not notice that he had the waistcoat on when he came to the station-house, but he had no opportunity of changing his dress before I noticed it—he did not point the waistcoat out to me—I recognised it, and said to him, "The material of the waistcoat which you now have on came from our house"—he said, "Yes, it was a present from her," and that she said it was a remnant from Marshall and Stinton's, and it cost very little—the price of it is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it was not a remnant—I do not know how much it would take to make a waistcoat—it might be sold at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—we consider them remnants when they are not of a dress length—the price would depend on the length—it might be one, or five yards—if it were two yards long, we should offer it at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard; that would be the lowest price for that material—I should think there is about three quarters of a yard in a waistcoat; that would be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the boxes—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to them</hi>)—this one was locked—I did not see a strap and seal to the other—the things which were in the bundles have been put into these boxes—the things produced were found either in the boxes or the bundles—these brown waistcoats are made of what we call Tassore silk—it is an Indian silk—there are eleven made of that stuff—it is half-a-crown a yard—it would take about a yard to make a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that you had some conversation with Mr. Hickman, about giving Ann Simons money; was not the question you put to him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220133"/>
               <p>whether he gave her much money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put that question to him in his room, and he said he did not give her much money—he afterwards stated that he gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for her <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-hire every night she came—I do not recol<lb/>lect whether he repeated in the room what he and previously stated in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with respect to the mortgage, or the money he had paid for her father—he might have done so—did not understand that he had ever seen her father—when I called on the Tuesday night I did not leave my name or my business—I called again on the Wednesday, at half-past ten o'clock—Mr. Hickman was from home—I stated what my business was, and about an hour and a half or two hours after, Mr. Wathen called on me—Mr. Hickman did not tell me when I was at his room on the Thursday, that some of the things were at the wash—some things that were said to have been at the wash were afterwards delivered to Inspector Tedman—I should say my observation as to whether he was not surprised at receiving such presents from a girl in Simons's situation, was not made with reference to the things he said she had presented to him—I should say it was made both before and after he had pointed out the presents—he made the observation in the bed-room, after we had taken possession of our stock, and likewise in the sitting-room afterwards—it was made in both rooms—he had pointed out the things received as presents when I made the observation—the bird-cages, birds, plant, cigar case, the bronze dog, and the watch and chain, are not my property—these cambric handkerchiefs are 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—I believe there are eighteen of them—the two pieces of velvet, which he said he had not had made up because he did not like them, were about a yard and a half each, and worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I also found a brown velvet waistcoat made up, which he said she had given him, that is bout the same value—there is about a yard and a quarter in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe that Mr. Hickman gave you every facility for searching every part of his rooms, and assisted you in discovering whatever property there might have been there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; he requested me and the officer, on a subsequent occasion, to search every part of his rooms, to ascertain whether there was any other property of ours that had not been produced—I said it was quite unnecessary—I believe that was on the Monday after—I had a glass of wine with him on the Thursday—I do not recollect just as I was going, his calling me back, and saying, "Why, you have forgotten to look in her work-box"—be did not point it out to me—the workbox had been examined long before that—I swear he did not call my attention to it, and say I had omitted to search it—I swear we had examined the box before—he did not say so to any one else in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it that Mr. Snellgrove would have any interest in the losses? Just explain the arrangement at which he is with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has a fixed salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and when we take our stock and balance our books, he has the option of taking 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, or one-eighth of the profits—it is usual to give mangers an interest in effecting good sales, for the purpose of increasing the profits of their principals—if the profits do not amount to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year at one-eighth, then he receives no additional sum beyond the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the profits of the year amounted to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would then only receive the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—persons in our establishment were allowed to purchase goods at cost price—they used formerly to purchase of any of the young men, but during the last nine months, if any person in our employment purchased any goods, it could only be with the approbation of Mr. Snellgrove—formerly a bill used to be made out for them, and it was stamped by the</p>

               <p>clerk at the desk with a stamp which we use as a receipt-stamp—while Simons was in our serviced I was not aware that she had a father living—I have since found out that she has—he keeps a small inn at Gumley, in Leicestershire.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Marshall, and have been a member of the firm since its commencement, which is about ten years—neither I or Mr. Marshall reside at the house of business—I live at Cricklewood, beyond Kilburn—the female policeman was taken into custody, on Tuesday, 19th Oct., in consequence of a communication made to Mr. Marshall—she was called into the shop, and some questions were put to her—after she had answered those questions she was taken into custody, and taken to the station—after that the officer returned, and went up stairs with Mr. Marshall and myself, and examined her boxes—one box was locked, and the other unlocked—I saw the things taken out of both the boxes—there were some letters found in one of them—the policeman took them out—this envelope was found among the other things in the box—I did not attend at the police-court on the first occasion, I think that was on the Tuesday—Mr. Wathen called on the Wednesday; I saw him—he called again on the Thursday, and on that occasion I saw Mr. Hickman at the door in company with Mr. Wathen—he remained at the door while Mr. Wathen came in and spoke to me—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—I then accompanied Mr. Wathen and Mr. Hickman to the Police-court—on the way, I asked Mr. Hickman if he knew anything of the prisoner Simons having a child—he said he did not believe that she had one, or that he did not know—I first heard of her having a child from herself, on the morning of the robbery—I had never heard it before from anybody—she said it in the shop—no one was present but myself and her; Mr. Marshall had gone out after some of the things—he had not put any question to her before that—I think he did when he came back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What led to her stating that she had a child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said to her, "Miss Simons, I always thought you had some property"—she said, "No; I have none beyond 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week (I do not know which), which is for the support of my child"—I did not make any observation on that; I only expressed my surprise—I made some exclamation, but what it was I do not know—I was perfectly surprised at it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first become acquainted with Simons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On her application for a situation, in April, 1845—I swear upon my solemn oath that I never knew her before April, 1845—she then applied to me in the shop for a situation—I do not think any one was present at the time—she came into the shop—I was at the desk at the end of the shop—there are about twenty shopmen and shopwomen in the shop—I do not think I can call to mind anybody that was in the shop at the time—I am not certain whether there was anybody present who is now here, but I should say not—I engaged her, subject to her reference proving satisfactory; and upon its proving satisfactory, I did engage her—I did not consult my partner as to taking her into our employ that I remember—it is not custom<lb/>ary to do so—I have employed others without consulting my partner—I generally have the engagement of persons in the house—I engaged Madame Louise—I consulted Mr. Marshall, in that instance—I know Mrs. Cole, a dress-maker, in Argyll-street—I went to her as Simons's reference—on that occasion, I asked Mrs. Cole to become a customer—it turned out that she had been a customer before, which I did not know at the time—she only had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220135"/>
               <p>a few things, and was in our debt—I think she only had one transaction, after I engaged Simons, I sued her for that money—I do not know what has become of her—it did not then occur to me that it would be prudent to in<lb/>quire still farther about Simons, inasmuch as Simons herself said we had better not trust Mrs. Cole—she did not say she was not trustworthy; she said I had better not trust her—that was about a month after Simons was in our house—it did not then occur to me that it would be prudent to inquire still further about Simons—I was present when Simons was first accused, when she was questioned about some stockings, and when she was given into custody—I should say half an hour elapsed between her first being accused and her being given into custody—she staid in the shop in the interval—I was at the desk, and she was close to it—I came away from the desk—I do not know that I was standing by her for any length of time—she was standing there—I do not remember that I stood beside her—I will not swear I did not—I was at the desk, and she came and stood at the door, if I remember right—I went up stairs—I did not meet her on the stairs—I went up stairs because I wanted to prevent her going up—I did not talk to her on the stairs—I went up after her to prevent her going into her bedroom, because whilst my part<lb/>ner was out he did not wish her to go up stairs, or to have any communication with her boxes—I went up stairs, to prevent her going to her boxes—I did not follow her into her bedroom—she did not go into her bedroom—I lost sight of her, and I believe she turned into the water-closet, but I cannot say—I came down again, when I found she was not in her bedroom—I should think I was not away from the shop a minute—I did not see her return to the shop, but she was down in the shop when I got there—I had looked in at the door of her bedrooms, which was open, and seen that she was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, Sir, mind what you are about; upon your oath, did not you desire her to go up stairs, and when on the stairs ask her to give up to you all notes that you had written to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my soul, I never spoke to her—on my oath, I did not—I never wrote to her in my life—I never wrote to her in the shop on slips of paper, and put them into her hand, and said, "Mind that"—Barker was turned away in consequence of a note found in Simons's possession, and because we found his wife was making cloaks for other houses—those were the only reasons—I asked the young men in the shop whether any of them had seen me take improper liberties with Miss Simons, or too familiar with her—Barker said he had not seen me do anything of the kind—he did not say he had seen me looking wickedly at her, and her at me—I swear that—I do not know whether Barker is here—he has been sub<lb/>pœned by us, I believe—I should like to explain this more fully, he said that he thought she had looked at me very singularly—he did not say that I had looked at her—I did not on that occasion lift up my hands and beg him, for God's sake, not to repeat it, lest it should come to Mrs. Stinton's ears—nothing of the kind passed—I live at Crickelwood—I was never robbed in going home, nor ever complained of being robbed—I was not stopped by anybody, and have never said so—I have never ridden in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Miss Simons—I swear that most positively—I know Miss Webb, of 2, Barners-street—I do not remember getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Miss Simons, at the stand opposite Marylebone-lane, and being driven by John Kiddle, No. 1693, to the corner of Berners-street—I will swear I did not—I swear I have never been driven in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Miss Simons in my life, or in any carriage—I have always managed the books of our establishment—we sometimes take sock every six months, and sometimes every twelve months—we</p>

               <p>have taken stock twice this years—I am not quite certain whether it was twice or not, in 1846—I think it was in Feb., 1847, we first discovered a deficiency of stock—I should say we were then about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I had an impression that Miss Simons was possessed of property—I really do not know what induce me to think so—I never asked her to lend me any money—she never advanced me any money—our firm had been in some difficulties some tears before she came into our service—I am not aware that we were at all straitened when she came to us—I do not know that when she first came into our service, she had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she never told me so, and I do not believe that she had—I really do not know what made me think she had property—it was an impression I had received by report—I never met her at a ball—I met her once at a party—she appeared in a blue glace silk dress—I did not recommend it to her as being well adapted to her complexion, and request her to have it made up—I should think the party was shortly after last Christ<lb/>mas—nothing particular impressed her dress on my mind—I should think there were thirty or forty people, altogether, at the party—with the exception of my wife and Mrs. Marshall, I do not think I can tell you what any other lady wore on that occasion—I think Miss Simons had a bouquet—I did not afterwards tell her that I was sure some gentleman had given her the bouquet—I have no recollection of mentioning it to her afterwards—I would not like to swear I did not, nut my impression is I did not—I swear I did not quarrel with her on the suspicion that she had it from a gentleman—the policeman took the letters out of her box—nobody assisted him—I did not—I did not read one—I am sure I did not take any into my hand—I did not assist in taking anything out of the box—I do not remember that my partner did—I think it was the policeman entirely—the policeman had the whole of the let<lb/>ters.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever met by any person walking in George-street, Hanover-square, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, with Simons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—I never walked with her at that time in the even<lb/>ing in George-street, Hanover-square, nor in the neighbourhood of Manches<lb/>ter-square—I have never walked with her in the evening, nor ever walked with her in my life—I believe her sister, Elizabeth Simons, is here, subpœ<lb/>ned on the part of the prosecution—I never wrote to Simons—I never wrote her a note, recommending that she should have the blue glace dress made high up on the neck, as she was poorly—nor sign it, "Yours, affectionately, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN STINTON"</hi>—I did not say to the prisoner, when I saw her up stairs on the day she was apprehended, that it was a bad job for her, and a worse for me—I might have said it was a bad job, but I have no recollection of saying anything of the sort—I did not say it was a bad job for me—I saw the boxes when they were first found in her bedroom up stairs—I went up stairs with her—once of the boxes had no lock, and was opened without any difficulty.</p>

               <p>had been sent to Miss Rourke's—it was arranged before he left, that Simons was not to be allowed to go up stairs to her bed-room before he returned—it was in consequence of that that I followed her up when I saw her go up—the ball that has been spoken of, was at a neighbour's of the name of A belnhite, near Kilburn—it was a children's party—Mrs. Stinton invited the prisoner, and another young women from our establishment accompanied her—they were taken there, and brought back by Mr. Snellgrove, the head of our establish<lb/>ment—I do not know whether Mr. Marshall noticed the blue dress or not—there was nothing particular in it which accounted for my looking as it—I do not know whether it was from our establishment—my wife was dressed in a velvet dress, and Mrs. Marshall also—I do not remember how the other young woman who went from our house was dressed—on my solemn oath, I never in my life took any improper liberties with this young woman.</p>

S." on it—I had seen that for some time standing under the bed—the day Mr. Marshall came, Mr. Hickman took it out—I very seldom cleaned the room, my servant did—I did not call Mr. Hickman's attention to it—I think he pulled it out on the Thursday morning—it was locked, and was forced open by the policeman—it was found to contain silks, and a variety of things—the outer door of the house was always closed on Sunday—there is a back staircase—Miss Simons only went up that on one occasion that I recollect—I showed her up—this black box was brought to the chambers on Sunday, 3rd or 4th Oct.—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man bring it as far as the door—Mr. Hickman was out of town at the time—my servant, Riley, I believe, took it up stairs—I afterwards saw it under the bed—Mr. Hickman dined at his chambers occasionally—he was very punctual and regular in his payments for anything which he had, he never seemed to want money; and, with the exception of his acquaintance with Miss Simons, he was correct and regular in his conduct and habits—after 19th Oct., when Elizabeth Simons came, Mr. Hickman always sent for me, or one of the servants, before he went out of a morning, to say where he was going, and where he might be sent for—he desired me to let anybody that came, search everywhere, whether he was at home or not—he first gave me those orders on the Wednesday evening, after Mr. Marshall had called—he waited at home till ten o'clock next morning, for the purpose of seeing anybody that might call—his usual time for going out was nine o'clock—not a single thing was disturbed in the chambers, or removed, before Mr. Marshall and the policeman came on the 21st—I do not know of anything having been at any time removed from the chambers by Mr. Hickman since I have been housekeeper there—I was pre<lb/>sent the greater part of the time When Mr. Marshall and the officer were looking at the things—I saw Mr. Hickman fetch the work-box, I cannot tell where from—the officer had a bunch of keys with him, and he opened the work-box with one of them—they merely opened it; but Mr. Hickman wished them to look further, and they saw some lace—I did not see any of the other keys on that bunch tried to any drawer or trunk.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Stinton, as silk-mercers and drapers generally, carrying on a large business in Vere-street, Oxford-street—the prisoner Ann Simons was in our service for two years and a half, and was employed in the cloak-room, among other things to cut out goods for the purpose of having them made up—to the time when these discoveries were made, I was not aware that she had a father alive—I never had any conversation with her about her father; but I always understood, from the whole of our establishment, that she had no father; not from herself. On 19th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220167"/>
               <p>Oct. last, in consequence of discoveries I made, I gave her into custody—we have at various times missed large quantities of silks, lace, hosiery, gloves, shawls, ribbons, and other things—from circumstances that transpired, on 22nd Oct. I went down to Gumley, near Market Harborough, in Leicester-shire, to the house of the prisoner Benjamin Simons—he keeps the Har<lb/>borough Arms there—I arrived there about ten or half-past ten o'clock at night—I told him that they my name was Marshall, and I wished to speak to him pri<lb/>vately—he said he did not know the name of Marshall—I said it appeared to me a very extraordinary thing that he did not know the name of Marshall; that his daughter had been living with us for three years; that she had been in the country, for her holiday, last Christmas, and that I had been told that her holiday was spent at his house—he appeared to be very excited, and said it was a hard thing that he should be accountable for what his daughter had been doing in London, 100 miles away—I had not then told him what his daughter had done—I told him that he appeared to be a most unnatural parent, that he seemed to care so little about it—I then told him that his daughter had been robbing us to a large amount, and that I was in search of a hair trunk, that his daughter Ellen had brought down there, and left in the back bedroom—he declared most posi<lb/>tively that he had not seen such a trunk—I told him it was useless to deny it, as his daughter Ellen had given me the information, and told me where I should find it—I told him at all that had passed between me and Ellen, and asked if he had any communication from London—he said he had not—I described the sort of trunk I meant, and said without he gave it up I should apply for a search-warrant—he said I might search without one—I then inquired of him and some other persons who were in the house at the time, for the address of the Magistrate—I did not get it, and went across the road to a cottage, and knocked the people up to inquire where the Magistrate lived—I got his address, and went to him—I had no constable with me at that time—I went into the back bedroom before I left the house, but saw nothing there—I went into two bedroom, but did not find the trunk nor anything that I could recognize as mine—there was a stout gentleman there, named Buzzard, who, when I was making inquiries about the trunk, called Simons on one side, took him by the collar, and said, "Ben, Mr. Marshall appears to have a very straightforward story, if you know any-thing about the truck described, or any of Mr. Marshall's property, or if you know where it is, I entreat you as a friend to give him up the property, and give him any information you can"—he can stated he knew nothing about the hair truck or any of our property—on going to the Magistrate he gave me a search-warrant, and sent his servant with me to call the constable up—I then returned with the constable to Simon's house and searched it—that was about half-past twelve at night—he was sitting drinking and smok<lb/>ing the whole of the time—we searched the whole of the house, the drawers, and all the outhouse—Benjamin Simons kept saying that he had no pro<lb/>perty of ours, and knew nothing about it, and was <hi rend="italic">jeering</hi> me very much the whole of the time—he said he would go with me to London and help me to search, if I would pay the expenses up to London—there was a derision in what he said, and in his manner as well—it was said in an <hi rend="italic">offhanded</hi> sort of way—we found several things in some chests of drawers in each bed-room, which I could identify as having been ours—the greater part of them had been worn, and were of great value when new—they were not the things I was in search of—there were several small shawls, a silk dress, a lace bonnet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220168"/>
               <p>and various articles of females' wearing-apparel, some new linen for pillow-cases, which I recognized, and a piece of new material for a dress—I and the officer brought them down into the kitchen where the prisoner was sitting, and I told the constable to take him as my prisoner, that I had sufficient to trans<lb/>port him—I was very angry—he seemed very frightened and agitated—the constable at first did not take him, he said he would have another pipe of tobacco first, and sat down—he was a special constable—I then told the men who had driven me over from Leicester to take the harness of the horse, for I was determined to stop there till the morning—Simons then said, "I suppose you do not want to do anything to me if I give you up the hair trunk"—I told him it was the trunk that I wanted—he said he wished to speak to me outside the door, alone—I told him that anything he had to say must be in the presence of the constable—we all three went outside into the yard, and he refused to say anything—we then returned into the house, and he said, if I would allow the constable to go with him he would give him up the truck, to which I consented—I remained in the house, and he and the constable went out together—they returned in about ten minutes with the hair trunk—I saw it in the yard—this now produced is it—I then inquired of Simons if that was all he had got of our property—he said it was—I asked if he had the key of it—he said he had not—I asked if he was certain it had not been opened—he said he was positive it had not been opened since it had been brought down by Ellen—he did not say when that was—he then called me on one side again, and asked if I would write to the Magistrate to say that my firm belief was that he knew nothing about the hair trunk that I had found in his house—I said that I felt bound to write to the Magistrate after his kindness to me in giving me the search-warrant at the late hour, and to tell him what had transpired—I ordered my chaise, the trunk was put in, and I took it to Lei<lb/>cester—I there examined it, and in consequence of what I saw, and did not see, in it, I set out for Gumley again in less than ten minutes, taking the same two men with me—Gumley is fifteen miles from Leicester—I went to the house of the Rev. Mr. Abthorpe, the Magistrate, and Simons came to me there—I told him that he had not given me up all my property, that I was certain that he had a large quantity more concealed—he said he had another large chest, and if he gave it up he supposed the Magistrate would not do anything to him—the Magistrate said he could not hear of anything of the kind, and sent for the constable and gave him in charge, with the goods contained in the hair truck—we then proceeded to Simon's house, and on the road he said it was a very large chest and very heavy, and that he would be bound I should be satisfied with the contents, if I would let him escape—I told him that I had no power to do so, that the constable had him in charge and the property—we then went to his house; the Magistrate followed us, and told Jesson the con<lb/>stable not to let Simons escape, or any of the property be taken away—when we got to the house Simons spoke to the constable, and told him where he would find the chest—I did not hear what he said—he called the constable aside—the constable went and got the assistance of another man, a horse-dealer I believe, and in about ten minutes they returned with a large oak chest—Simons was not with them—his wife gave me the key—I am not positive whether it was in his presence or not—the chest was placed in the parlour, and I unlocked it in the presence of Simons and the constable—a piece of silk handkerchief laid on the top, which Simons laid hold of and wished me to give him—I said I should do nothing of the sort—he was perfectly sober—it was about eleven o'clock in the morning—(<hi rend="italic">the oak chest was here produced</hi>

In July last I was living at Madame Devy's, in Grosvenor-street—in the middle of July last I received this hair trunk from Evans—in consequence of a communication that he made to me from my sister, I took the trunk to my father's house at Gumley—I did not receive the key with it—I cannot say whether my father was at home when I arrived—I did not see him directly I got into the house—I saw him during the time I was there—the trunk was deposited at his house—I could not say which room I left it in, because it was removed into two rooms during the time I was at home—when I first went, it was taken into my bed-room—I staid at home a month—I do not think it was in my bed-room when I came away—I took off the cord myself, at my own instiga<lb/>tion; I do not know why, I did not want it—the box was locked—I did not open it—I saw the oak-chest there—it was standing in the bed-room in which I slept part of the time—my mother was not well, and I slept with her during that time—the chest was in her room—my father and mother gene<lb/>rally slept together—about three months ago, after my return from Gumley,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220172"/>
               <p>my sister Ann handed me a key, at Mr. Hickman's—I believe it was the k✗ of the oak-chest—I was to keep it—she gave it me to take care of—she gave me not reason why—I had seen the oak-chest at my father's, and I knew that my sister had possession of it—it was in my father's bed-room—when she gave me the key, she said, "You will take this key, and take care of it for me"—I knew what key it was—she gave me no reason why I was to take care of it—she said it was the key of her box at home—she did not tall me what was in the box—I kept the key for about two months, until I knew my sister was in custody—that was on Tuesday evening, the 19th—I sent for my brother Nicholas, I think, on the Thursday evening, about seven of eight, and delivered the key to him—no one had told me to do so—I told him to take it to my father's, and also to tell him how ill my sister Elizabeth was; that I did not suppose she would live the night through—I also told him to say my sister was in custody—I did not say what for—to the best of my recollection this is the key (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> I am a son of the male prisoner. On the morning of 23rd Oct. last I received a key from my sister Ellen—I did not know who there my sister Ann was in custody then or not—Ellen told me to take the key down home, and give it to my father—I went down that same day, found my father at home, gave him the key, and said, "This is the key of one of Ann's boxes"—I did not tell him what had happened to my sister—I did not know that she was in custody at that time—I knew that she was charged with robbing Mr. Marshall, but I did not know that she was in custody—I told my father that.</p>

                  </hi> I am a seaman. The prosecutor has been living in the house where I do, and the prisoner also, for a few days—he and the prose<lb/>cutor came in on 29th Oct., between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening—they were both a little the worse for liquor, but not to say beastly drunk—the prisoner was not so drunk as not to know what he was about—they were sitting down, <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> each other, and having words—I had occasion to go into the back yard, and there was no one in the room but the mistress—when I came in, the prisoner and the prosecutor were both stripped, and had a knock or two—the mistress told me to tell them to go out—I ordered them to go out and fight, or else not at all—they sat down, and still had words—the prisoner then got up, and went up two flights of stairs, and was there, I suppose, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the prosecutor then wanted to go to bed; and the mistress said, "No, sit down, and let the man get to sleep, and there will be no more quarrelling"—she took the prosecutor by the jacket—he got from her—she gave me the candle, and said, "Go up with him, or there will be more fighting"—I went up with him—I had the candle and candlestick in my left hand, and was pushing him up with my right hand—when we got up to the landing I saw the prisoner standing—words took place between them, but I did not take notice what—I tried to get them apart, and to shove the prosecutor along—I saw them strike at one another, but I cannot tell whether they hit one another—I kept breaking them off—I think the prisoner struck first, because I was <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> the prose<lb/>cutor along—he was highest up on the stairs—he was behind me, and struck over my right shoulder—I did not see any knife on the first or the second blow. but at the third blow I saw the knife in his hand—I saw the blood and I <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "Murder! murder!"—the prisoner was sober enough to run down stairs—I went down with the prosecutor, and the policeman was just come in—the prisoner was sitting down by the end of the table, and was going to</p>

I saw the prosecutor on the night of the 29th Oct., at the station, bleeding profusely from an incised wound over the nose, which had nearly taken off the end of the nose—there were two wounds on the left side of the upper lip dividing the lip, and an incised wound on the left arm, which was not very deep—his flannel waistcoat had been divided with the incision—I dressed the wounds, and saw they were going on well—I think I saw him again two days afterwards—the wounds were healing then—this clasp-knife would have caused the wounds.</p>

                  </hi> I am a jeweller, in partnership with Mr. Thoms, at 43, Ludgate-hill. In Jan. last, the prisoners Gardiner and Holiday came to our shop—Holliday said he wished to look at a liqueur-frame and a cruet-frame, that he had a commission for Hamburgh, and if they suited him he would purchase them—he said they were to be sent to Theberton-street, Islington, to be enclosed with other things that were to be sent to Hamburgh—I showed him some articles, and he selected a plated liqueur and cruet-frame, worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the two—the two prisoners conferred together, and it seemed to me as though Holliday required the approbation of Gardiner before he concluded the purchase—he gave me this card—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Thomas Holliday and Co., Commission and General Merchants, London, 6, Pinner's-hall, Old Broad-street")—I packed up the things, and sent them to Theberton-street, by Paton—next day Holliday called again alone, and said that he had a further commission for a gold-watch and gold-guard—he said that the gentle<lb/>man who was with him when he purchased the frames was connected with one of the wealthiest firms on the continent, and that the frames were for that firm, which was Schulkhauser, Brothers, and Co.—he showed me this card—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Schulkhauser, Brothers, and Co., Merchants, London, 38, Moorgate-street")—he said that that firm owed him a large sum of money, and that if I would allow him to have the gold-watch and guard he would obtain a bill from that firm for the payment of it, including the payment for the frames purchased on the previous day—I said that would be a matter for consideration, in the first place I must make inquiries respecting this firm, which I did, and ascertained that that firm, as well as Holliday and Co., were swindlers—I think this was about 7th Jan.—Holliday came again on that day to inquire if I was satisfied—I said I had not been able to ascertain com<lb/>pletely, to my own satisfaction, who that firm was—the result was, that I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220180"/>
               <p>not let him have the watch and guard, not being satisfied with the solvency of the firm—five or six days after, I made inquiries at Pinner's-hall and The<lb/>berton-street, for Holliday and Co., and found that they were gone from both places—I afterwards made inquiries after Schulkhauser and Co., and they were also gone—my attention was called some months afterwards to the ac<lb/>count in the papers of some persons who had been taken before the Lord Mayor, in consequence of which I went to Giltspur-street prison—I saw fifty prisoners there, and out of them I selected Gardiner and Holliday—I saw my cruet and liqueur-frame produced before the Lord Mayor, from Mr. Boyee's, the pawnbroker.</p>

What tools do you mean, I don't understand you?"—Mr. Crauch said, "Oh, you must know what I mean, it is about those tools which Gardiner and Holliday have got from this chest of mine Mr. Bond for shipping, and which they are now offering for sale"—Cusell stammered a bit, and then said, "What shall I do for my money?"—Mr. Crauch said, "We had nothing to do with his money," and asked what money he meant—he said money he had advanced on them—Mr. Crauch asked what he had advanced on them—he said he could not tell exactly—he admitted that he and his friend Mr. Loup had advanced 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as near as I can recollect he gave us to understand that he had advanced 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.., and Loup the other 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Crauch, Cusell, and 1, then went together to Gardiner and Holliday's office—we saw Holli<lb/>day, who said Gardiner had gone to Ramsgate, to purchase a vessel—Cusell said he must be paid, and he went away to fetch his friend Loup—we were to wait till he came back with him—we waited about twenty minutes or half an hour, and finding he did not come back we went in search of him to Loup's office, in Aldermanbury—they were not there—we went back and found Loup and Cusell at Holliday's office, with Holliday—Gardiner was not there—Seager was in the outer office—Loup said that if the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he advanced was paid he had no objection to the goods being given up—Mr. Crauch had not mentioned to Loup the circumstances under which the goods had been obtained from me—a good deal was said—Mr. Crauch said in Loup's presence, that the goods had been obtained for shipping, and they were evidently trying to sell them for anything they would fetch, and if they were not given up, or the money paid, we should go before the Lord May or immediately—this was about 16th Aug.—it was then agreed that I should receive my tools back upon Gardiner and Holliday's paying Loup the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently got my goods back from Johnson and Day—I had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get them back—I was some five days waiting before I could</p>

                  </hi> I deal in rope sometimes. On 19th Aug. Loup's clerk came to me—I went to Loup's house—he told me he had some rope to sell, which was lying at Fresh wharf—I said I would go there with him, and see it—I went and saw it next morning, and offered him 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for it—he did not state what price he wanted—he said, "If my principal will take it I will deliver it at your warehouse, and of course you will pay me the money"—I said, "Of-course I will"—I returned to the warehouse, and in the afternoon he brought the rope in a cart—there was 22 cwt. 2 qrs., 24lbs, less, 24lbs, short weight—it came to 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after I paid him he said he had another small parcel would I take that—I said I had no objection—on 23rd Aug.

I bought twelve coils, weighing 13 cwt, at 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which came to 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not yet paid him for that—it was all new rope—I have sold it at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., subject to a discount—I have made ten per cent. on what I have sold—it was packed as for shipping when I saw it, with mats on it, marked with a diamond as stated in the invoice.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the Coach and Horses, at Greenwich. It is my dwelling-house—on 19th Oct., about eleven in the morning, I left in my bed-room, on the third floor, a watch, a chain, two brooches, and a ring—the watch and chain were on the mantel-piece, and the brooches and rings on the table—I left the door shut, but not locked—I went up again about five in the afternoon, and they were gone—about ten in the evening the witness, Evans, called on me and produced the watch and chain—this now produced is it—this gold brooch is also mine; it was given me by Mrs. Matthew—I know the prisoner by sight—I gave 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch and chain, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the brooch, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ring.</p>

                  </hi> I am a town-carman. On the evening of 8th Oct. I received from my wife this order for the delivery of seven pockets of hops from Pickle-herring wharf—I gave it to my man, James Lynch, on the morning of the 9th—the prisoner came to me that morning, and asked if I had got the hops out—he afterwards told me they were to be delivered at the Brighton-station, in Dean-street, to wait for orders—I carted away the seven pockets</p>

                  </hi> I am a cap-maker, and lived with my family in this house, in the back room first-floor—I, my wife, and children, were at home when the explosion took place—it sounded like the pop of a gun—my win<lb/>dow was open, and smoke came in—I took the child up in my arms and opened the door, and the moment I opened it the flames and smoke rushed up to my face—I put the child in some one's arms, jumped out into the yard, and they threw the child after me, my wife jumped out, and when I came back I found her lying on her back in the yard—after that I con<lb/>veyed her through the passage—after I jumped through the window I heard three different reports, the same as the first—the prisoner came into the yard and said, "Oh my God, look at my hands!"—I did not notice whether his hands were burnt—I knew the two boys—I have seen the prisoner's brother Robert at work there, filling the squibs with gunpowder, I believe—the prisoner has been sitting at the window when I have seen Robert mak<lb/>ing squibs—I did not see Robert after I got out of the house—I saw the other boy, James Vincent, come out at the back door—he seemed to be burnt—the shirt on his right shoulder was burnt—he got over into the next yard—I have seen the prisoner rolling papers for crackers—I spoke to him once on the subject, two or three weeks before the explosion—I said, "Sup<lb/>pose they were to explode"—he said, there was no danger of that, he always worked them damp—he gave me a cracker to feel, and it was quite damp—on the Tuesday before, I saw the prisoner let off two squibs in the yard, and then Vincent came and let off another—on the Thursday, the day before the explosion, he let off a lot of what I think he called Roman candles—one was much larger than the others, and he exploded a lot of gunpowder on the window-sill, which filled my room with smoke—about a fortnight before that I saw him put a quantity of squibs on the side of the hen-house, in the yard—I did not see what he did with them—on the Tuesday before the accident I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, he was worse than a child—my wife is not here—she was burnt a good deal, and has been confined to her bed a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Duke-street, Southwark—the prisoners lodged at my house—on Wednesday morning, 27th Oct., they came home at twenty minutes past one o'clock—they had not been at home all night—I let them in—they did not go into the room up stairs—they stopped and went out again in five or ten minutes, leaving the door open from that time till day-light—I was called up into their room about a quarter before nine, and found between eleven and twelve gross of boxes of matches, some in a white cloth, and some thrown about—I gave information to the police, and they took the matches and the prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many beds were in that room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five—seven persons slept in the room that night, all working-men—the others were all in bed—I know the prisoners went back after they had been in—I went into the room to call one of the men to get up at past four o'clock, and then the prisoners were out—my street door was open when I called the man up—I never knew the prisoners to be out at night before—the others are in bed from ten to eleven—no one is out afterwards, unless they tell me they are not coming in that night—these matches were done up in paper—there was a white cloth round some, and an apron round others—one was undone, the paper was broken, and they were loose about the room.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Ashton, a licensed victualler, of Bride-lane. On 2nd Nov. a tall young man came to the bar and called for a pint of beer—he gave me half a sovereign—I tested it on my finger; it was good—the prisoners came in at the other door—Howard asked for a glass of port wine and a glass of porter—she threw me down a sove<lb/>reign—I gave her the half-sovereign I took from the man, and said, "I will give you 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the till"—she said, "Oh dear me, how light this is!"—I said, "It is a good one"—she said, "I would rather have silver a great deal"—I said, "Nonsense, it is good"—Mr. Mitchell said, "Here is silver," and gave her four half-crowns—I rung the half-sovereign on the counter, and am prepared to say it was a good one—Mr. Mitchell had not examined the half-sovereign before he gave her the silver—the moment Howard had re<lb/>ceived the four half-crowns the prisoners left—as soon as Mr. Mitchell took the half-sovereign he pronounced it to be bad—he showed it to me—I wrapped it in paper, put it on a shelf, and afterwards gave it to the officer.</p>

I think it is good; do not give the gentleman the trouble to change it"—Howard said, "I think it is light; I would rather have silver"—I took the half-sovereign, went to the station, got a policeman, and gave the prisoners in charge—Howard wanted to take the half-sovereign out of my hand—she said, "Let me look at it"—I said, "No, you have seen it before"—I had know the man who came in before, and I should know him again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi>249.) On Friday, 12th Nov., about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a cart standing in Cross-street, Horsleydown—Clark was standing at the back of it—I saw a sack, containing something is it—I went into Fair-street, and watched Clark—he went to Mr. Phillips' shop, remained there two or three minutes, came out, went to the cart, and took the sack into Phipps's shop—it had about a bushel and half of some<lb/>thing in it—I saw him go through the shop into the back parlour—Phipps was sitting at the table in the parlour—Clarke remained two or three minutes—he put the sack down, and came out—I remained outside a few minutes, them went in, and asked Mrs. Phillips if she had any corn brought within the last hour into her shop—she said she had not—I asked her if a man with a white smock-frock who walked lame, had brought anything there—she said he had not, but she knew that man—I went into the back parlour, and saw this sack there—I asked her who brought it—she said she did not know, it was brought when she was putting the children to bed—I asked her what time she put the children to bed—she said an hour and half age; that when she came down she saw it there, and did not know who put it there—Clarke had taken it in about three minutes before—I have shown this sack to Mr. Shott—it bears his name—it contains about a bushel and a half of beans, oats, and chaff.</p>

I lost a copper, and on the 8th Nov. I went to Hyman's shop—I saw him, and gave him notice that my house had been broken on the night of 5th Nov. and a copper and the gate-bell, the keys of the doors, and the brass furniture from the doors had been taken—I asked</p>

                  </hi> I live in Garrett-lane, Wandsworth.

I went with Povey to the house in Garrett-lane, where Stepney and Moggeridge lodge—they were together in bed—I took Stepney into custody—I saw a basket at the side of the bed—I asked Stepney whether the whole of the contents of that basket was her property—she said, "Yes"—I found in it some ribbon, several trifling things, and this pair of scissors produced—I asked if they were hers—she said they were, and said whose did I think they were—I saw Shorlin in Stepney's presence as soon as I got out of the lodging-house—I asked him to describe his scissors—he described them, in Stepney's presence, as being very old and loose in the rivet—he had not seen them then—they corresponded with that description—I took Stepney to the station, and afterwards searched the room.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Ford, a cabinet-maker, of Brook-street, Lambeth.

                  </hi> I am foreman to Thomas Henry Maudsley and others, engineers—Brian was in their employ. In consequence of suspicion I watched him on Thursday, at dinner time, to Taylor's, a marine-store dealer's shop in the Upper Marsh, Lambeth—I saw him take something from his person, which was put into a scale, weighed, and then thrown under the counter by Mrs. Taylor—next day, at twelve o'clock, I watched him there again, and between twelve and half-past five, I got a constable to go with me—he went into the shop, and took possession of something—I immediately followed, and when I got in, Taylor said to the constable, "Do you call that lead?"—he said, "I do"—Taylor said, "It is zinc"—he was asked if he had bought any other articles of the man before—he said, no; he did not know that he had ever seen him in his shop before—Brian had taken the lead from his person—the policeman asked him where he got it—he made no reply—I believe it to be Mr. Thomas Henry Maudsley's and Joseph Field's.</p>
