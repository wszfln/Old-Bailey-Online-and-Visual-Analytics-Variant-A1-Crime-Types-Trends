I am a member of the firm of Merriman &amp; Pike, solicitors, of 25, Austin Friars—we keep an account at the London Joint Stock Bank, Princes Street—the prisoner was in our service—he came to us towards the end of June, and left towards the end of August—he was cashier and book-keeper—it was his duty to take charge of the cheque-book, and to fill up cheques and the counterfoils—I have the cheque-book here, which was in use at that time—it was our practice to draw cheques, payable to a letter and number—the number would be the consecutive number in the cheque-book, and the letter would correspond with a book that we keep, which is practically our cash-book—we begin with the letter A, and go on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187105010004"/>
               <p>through the alphabet—when the prisoner was there our cheques were drawn to the letter I—we do not use J—this cheque purports to bear my signature, of the firm—Mr. Merriman also signs for the firm, but our two signatures are quite different—this is an imitation of my signature—it is not written by me, or by my authority; no part of it—I know nothing whatever of the transaction of 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stamp-duty—it is one of the cheques out of this cheque-book—I find a page of three cheques missing from the books, coun<lb/>terfoils, and all—I have no doubt whatever that the filling up of this cheque is in the prisoner's writing—I produce a number of genuine cheques, filled up in the writing, while he was with us, also this account and letter—these two letters and agreement produced by the officer were sent to the prisoner, signed by me, in the name of the firm—the prisoner's salary was, I think, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> With very few exceptions, the counterfoils are all in the prisoner's writing, or that of a previous clerk—some are in ray writing, and some in one or two clerks in the office, but comparatively very few—no doubt the person who filled up the counterfoil would also fill up the body of the cheque—I have not the smallest hesitation in saying that the body of the forged cheque is in the prisoner's writing—he came into our service on 27th June, and left on 22nd August—the signature to the cheque, I should say, having regard to the general character of the writing, might well have been written by the prisoner—I can't go further than that—to me it is not a good imitation—I have no doubt it would appear so to a stranger not familiar with my writing, but I never wrote so nervously and shakily—it is a good general imitation—it would deceive, probably—the whole manage<lb/>ment of cash matters, as to bags, receipts, and payments, drawing cheques, and everything, was under the prisoner's control; therefore, whatever was thrown about the office, I should regard as carelessness—I don't know of bags lying about—I don't mean to say that I have not seen a bag on the drawers, or on the prisoner's table—I have, of course; in the ordinary course of his business, it would be so—we have ten, eleven, or twelve clerks in the office.</p>

Merriman &amp; Pike, and was so when the prisoner was there—I sat in the same room with him for the first few weeks—I had opportunities of seeing his handwriting—I believe the filling-up of this 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to be in his writing—I saw him fill up the greater portion of these twelve cheques that have been produced—I was in the habit of sending to the bank for the pass-book—I think after 9th January I sent for it first about the 16th; it was the practice to send for it once a week—it was then I discovered that the firm was debited with this cheque.</p>
               <p>

I live at 25, Southampton Row, Bloomsbury—I am a lithographer—I have made handwriting my study for a great many years—I have looked at the cheque for 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also at the other cheques and documents produced, and I have no doubt whatever that the filling up of that cheque is in the same handwriting as the filling up of the other cheques; and also in the same handwriting as this account—I rather think that the signature to the cheque is an imitation of the signature to one of the letters written to the prisoner by Mr. Pike—it bears more resemblance to the signature to those letters than to the signature to the cheques—the lower part of the figures "3" and "5" in the amount 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the forged cheque are terminated in a very peculiar manner—they are formed very deliberately, and terminate in dots—both of those figures occur in the cheque of 26th July, 1870, for 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they are terminated pre<lb/>cisely in the same manner—the figure "5" occurs also in the cheque of 27th July, 1870, and the termination of that figure corresponds—the figure "3" also occurs in the cheques of 30th July, and 3rd August, and that corresponds with the "3" in the forged cheque—and not only are the figures terminated in that peculiar manner, but some of the letters also—the capitals "S" and "T" in the forged cheque are both terminated in the same manner as the figures, after the same plan—there is a peculiarity of the writer to dwell upon those terminations—although he writes rather a free hand, yet those particular terminations seem to be slowly done, even to forming a dot at the end—in the cheque of 28th July, 1870, the capital "T" in the word "Two" is terminated very nearly in the same way—and also the "T" in "Ten" in the cheque of 5th August—the "d" in "pounds," in the forged cheque is terminated in rather a peculiar manner, the tail being thrown close over the other letter; the "d's" lie down on the other letters which precede them—that is a common way of making the letter "d"—still there is something peculiar in the closeness in which the tail lies over the line of writing—it is in the word "hundred"—I should say I made a mistake—the same peculiarity occurs in the word "referred" in the letter of 15th August—the "T" in "Tier" terminates in the manner I have pointed out—the abbreviation for the word "and" occurs I think eleven times in the various documents written by the prisoner, and in every instance, without exception, it is joined to the word which follows it, as in the forged cheque—in the dating to the forged cheque there is no stop after the name of the months, or after the figures of the year; no punctuation; and there is no punctuation to any one of the cheques—that is an unim<lb/>portant point, but it is one among a number—the letters "oun" in the word "pounds" are very characteristic, finishing with a dot before it so connected with the next letter—and in every one of the cheques the "i" is formed in the same way—the word "fifteen," in one of these cheques, and in the 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, perfectly agrees—I speak without any doubt what<lb/>ever on the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have spent some time over these documents—I should be very sorry to form an opinion involving a man's character without—it took me some time to arrive at a conclusion, undoubtedly—it took me very</p>

               <p>I little time to arrive at the conclusion, but I kept on, to be assured that I was well warranted in giving evidence—I would not give evidence without a very careful examination—there are other experts besides me—Mr. Netherclift is one—he and I have differed; in the celebrated Ryves case I our opinions were diametrically opposite upon a number of documents—I was not examined in that case; it so happened that the case broke down before it came to my evidence—Mr. Netherclift is a gentleman of some eminence as an expert—one of us must undoubtedly have been mistaken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The Jury in that case thought Mr. Netherclift was mis<lb/>taken—his evidence broke down, and it was not necessary to call me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, my office is at 15, King I Street, Cheapside—I have known the prisoner about four years—I have I frequently seen him write, and know his handwriting well—I was clerk in the same office with him two and a half years, at Mr. L. H. Evans', an I accountant, in Goleman Street—the signature to this 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is most decidedly not the prisoner's writing—I had a desk in the same room with him, and during two and a half years I was perpetually having his writing before my eyes—looking at it again, I should say, as I said before, most decidedly it is not his handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't say when I heard of the prisoner being in custody—I heard that he was in custody at the Mansion House—I went there—I was not examined as a witness—Mr. Beard appeared for him, I believe—he did not see me there—I never passed a word with Mr. Beard—I went there as a stranger—I did not see this cheque before I got into the box—I beg your pardon, I did; that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Beard's clerk</hi>) had it in his hand at the Mansion House, and I simply looked at it, just a glance, not enough to enable me to judge about it—I judge of it from my ex<lb/>perience of his handwriting—I have had more experience of it, I imagine, than any witness that has been here this morning—I was of the same opinion then as I am now, although I never had it in my hand—it is not a bit like his writing—I can't see it—if it is his writing, he is a very expert hand at disguising it—it is twelve months since we were together in the same office—I left in June, and went into business for myself—I see a cheque here of 30th June, 1870, with the word "fifteen" on it—I don't see the slightest similarity in the two cheques; the man who wrote the one could not have written the other—I am simply giving my opinion to the best of my knowledge and belief, having had great experience in his writing—the formation of this "f" in the "fifteen" in this cheque I could swear to amongst a hundred thousand—in my judgment the two "fifteens" are not a bit alike, it is a different style—the "oun" in "pounds" is such as I should make myself—I don't see anything particular in it, the angular point of the "n" is something that ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would make—the general construction of the letters is not alike—I left Mr. Evans to go into business last Christmas—I have not been on intimate terms with the prisoner since that, I have never seen him—I considered that he had treated me in a very unbusiness like manner, and I was not friendly with him—I have seen him about the streets—I have not seen him actually with a pen in his hand for the last twelve months—he has a brother, he came to Mr. Evans' office once—I should not know him—I believe his family are residing in Ireland.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 25, Belmer Street, Commer<lb/>cial Road East—about 12.15, on Sunday morning, 26th March, I was in Osborne Street—four men came up to me, and amongst them the two prisoners—Middleton had hold of my shoulder, and stood at the side of me—I saw his ace distinctly—the public-house lamps were still alight—Mur<lb/>phy took my watch out of my left waistcoat pocket—I had a steel chain, with a cent, piece on it—he took the lot from me—I saw Murphy distinctly, and picked him out of eight or nine men, at the corner of the street, a quarter of an hour afterwards—after they ran away I communicated with the police, and as we were going down to the station Murphy was standing at the corner of the street, with eight or nine others—I went and caught hold of him and said "This is the man"—the police came up and took him—I saw Middleton on the Friday following, at the corner of Mary Street, White<lb/>chapel,</p>

               <p>with three men—I followed them down the Whitechapel Road, and along Commercial Road, until I came to Sidney Street, where I saw a con<lb/>stable—Middleton was about twenty or thirty yards ahead of me—I pointed him out to the policeman, and he took him into custody—they did not use any violence to me, they only held me behind—I am perfectly certain they are two of the men who were engaged in the affair.</p>

I am Chief Inspector of the Detective Department—on the 25th January, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to 36, Bedfordbury, where a man named Pearce resided—he occupied two rooms on the first-floor—I saw Pearce, and after having some conversation with him I went into his room—I found the prisoner there, sitting at the table with a dirty white handkerchief in front of him, containing a quantity of chains, some of which I produce—he had hold of a chain, and at his side was this bottle of aqua fortis—he had the stopper in his right hand and was testing the chain as I went in—I said to him "Joe, I did not expect to find you here "—he said "Somebody has done this for me "—I told him to stand on one side, in a corner, and I then asked Pearce to account for this property—he said "Joe brought it here "—the prisoner said nothing to that—it was property which was afterwards inentified by Mr. Zucher—I searched the room and found a green baize bag full of cigars, and by the side of it was a carpet bag containing several cigar tubes and pipes—I asked Pearce to account for the possession of those—he said "Joe brought them "—the prisoner said nothing to that—the house is let out in tene<lb/>ments—the ground-floor is occupied as a greengrocer's, the back is a machinist's shop, which trade Pearce carried on—on searching further I found a large meerschaum pipe, twelve compasses, and a great variety of things—I sent for a constable, who took the prisoner away, and about ten minutes afterwards I heard that he had escaped—he was not apprehended till a fortnight ago—I then went to Bow Street and told him the charge—he said "Somebody has got this up for me, and very well"—he never gave any explanation where he got the articles from—I had seen the prisoner go into Pearce's house on the Monday, and also on the Tuesday previous to my going there—he had not anything with him that I saw.</p>

About 1.30 on this night I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" as I was at the bottom of Royal Avenue Terrace—I ran through a short square, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and Ireland apparently rising from the top of him, and Whiting, when I got close to him—he jumped to his feet, and ran in an easterly direction—there was another man also who ran away in an opposite direc<lb/>tion, and escaped—I secured Ireland, and handed him over to a constable—I pursued the third man for a considerable distance, but lost sight of him, and I then returned to see that the other two did not escape—I produce a watch and chain, which was picked up by Stagg, in my presence, 5 yards or 6 yards from where the prosecutor lay, and in the same line, that Whiting ran—the prosecutor was the worse for liquor—he was able to walk</p>

Hill, of Helston, and the agreement was witnessed by Mr. Spencer, the managing clerk—I subsequently sent a letter to the defendant, requesting him to give up possession according to this agreement—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in answer—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was put in and read; it contained the</hi>

I am a cabman, of 38, Bedford Row, Stepney—on the night of the 29th, a little after 12 o'clock, I was in the bar, and all at once I saw the prisoner jump up on the side of the bar, and make a rush at Mr. Bunkin—he endeavoured to get through the hatchway, and in protecting himself he put his hand up—the prisoner got his thumb in his mouth, and eventually Mr. Bunkin held his hand up with a piece bitten entirely off, and bleeding—the prisoner had been drinking, but was certainly very far from being drunk—he was not sober, but he was perfectly able to understand what he was about.</p>

I am sixteen years old—I recollect the day when this affair happened—it was Easter Monday—about 12 o'clock in the day I was with Donovan and Hunt, and two or three more, near the "White Hart" public-house—we were playing—Hunt had a piece of wet worsted stocking—he hit me in the face with it—I picked it up again, and threw it at him—Mr. Winsey was passing by, and it hit him on the leg, somewhere about the shin—I begged his pardon, and took no notice, and walked straight on—about five minutes after, I went home, and when I came back I heard that the two prisoners were taken—I did not see Mr. Winsey knocked down—all I saw was the stocking thrown; it was meant to hit Hunt, and and it hit the prosecutor on the leg—it took place just outside the door of the White Hart.</p>

On 19th April, from information I received, I watched Davis—I saw him about 6.45 in the evening, in Crutched Friars, with a hogshead of sugar in his van, which he had received from the Great Northern Railway Company's place—the van belonged to Matthew Orchard, a carman—I followed the van to the comer of Gray's Inn Road—he stopped there, and went into a public-house—he came out with two other men, and they all three got into the van, and went up Gray's Inn Road, and up Euston Road, till they got to Chapel Street, Paddington—on their way through Gray's Inn Road, Davis and one of the others got up on each side of the van, and looked round occasionally—the third man was under the tarpaulin, which was raised up, as if he was working under<lb/>neath—the tarpaulin covered a cask of sugar—when they got to Chapel Street, they met Broom, with a trolley belonging to Peter Priestley—it is used for carrying hogsheads of sugar—Broom drew his trolley round behind the van, and Davis brought a bag out of the van, and put it on Broom's trolley, and Broom covered it up with a tarpaulin—after the bag was transferred, they went on to Praed Street, about 100 yards, with the van and the trolley—they went into a public-house there—Davis came out with one of the other men, and drove off—I followed Broom and the other man in the trolley, to the corner of Three Colts Lane, Cambridge Heath Road, Bethnal Green, where they stopped at a public-house—the other man went away—I went up to Broom, and said I should take him, for being concerned with others, in stealing a bag of sugar—he was not in sight of the trolley at that time—he said he knew nothing about it—I said "There is a bag of sugar on the trolley"—he said he knew nothing about it—I then drove the trolley to the Seething Lane police-station, and sent Broom in a cab, with two other constables—I took possession of the sugar—it weighed 1 cwt. 19lbs.—I afterwards went with another officer to Mr. Orchard, the carman's place, in George Yard, Whitechapel—Davis came there about 11.30 at night, and I took him in custody—I found this piece of tin in his van, and spoke to him about it—I have a sample of the sugar here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

The prisoner is my husband—we have four children—I have been obliged to leave him, on account of his cruelty—this is the third time he has been taken up—I live at Battersea—on 27th March, about 4 in the afternoon, I went to my sister-in-law's, at North End, Fulham—while I was there the prisoner came in—I sat in a chair, and he came by my side—he did not speak for a minute, and then he said "Well, Mrs. White, how are you?"—I said "I am quite well, thank you, and I hope you are the same"—he sat for a minute, and I said "I can't think why you follow me about like this; I am afraid to go out to go to work; I think at least you can manage to do for yourself, if I have to work to support the children"—he said "Let me look alt the baby," and put his arms out—I said "No, not with my consent; you have said that the child does not belong to you, but I know that I am the mother and you are the father; I want no more to do with you"—he said "I want you to come and live with me"—I said "Never," for I had suffered so much from, his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hammersmith—on 27th March, about 7 p.m., I was called to the police-station, and examined Mrs. White—on the left side of the cheek was a scratch about an inch long—on the right side of the neck, just below the ear, another smaller scratch—along the jaw-bone, from the angle of the jaw to the chin, were several small scratches—beginning at the middle of the neck, going down just above the breast bone, and extending down the left side was a scratch, 81/2 inches long—there was a scratch on the left fore arm—the left thumb was cut just below the joint, from side to side, so that it would be about three-quarters of an inch long, having a flap of about half an inch—the top of the forefinger of the left hand was slightly cut—the pulp of the middle finger was cut through from side to side—the right thumb was cut through obliquely to the bone, the whole length of the pulp—and the middle finger was cut through at the root to the bone, two-thirds round the circumference of the finger—there was great loss of blood from the cuts on the middle finger of the right hand and the thumb, but not from the neck, they were only scratches—in my opinion the wounds must have been caused by a knife—I can scarcely conceive that any other thing could have done it—the scratches on the neck might have been done by a pin or anything else—the end of this knife would produce similar scratches—the wounds on the hands were troublesome to heal—she was not under my charge afterwards—she called one day to show them, but I did not pay much attention—I referred her to the parish medical officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I have an office at 20, Coleman Street—I reside at Epping—in the early part of last year I had made some advances to a person named Feist—the prisoner came to me with another person, about October or November last year, and entered into a conversation in reference to Feist—in consequence of that I took him into my employment as clerk—he told me that Mr. Feist, to whom I was advancing money, was forging bills of sale; that most of the bills of sale were fictitious, and that no one knew about them but Feist and himself; and unless I took him out of Mr. Feist's hands, and employed him, and took an office myself, I should lose all my money—he was in Feist's service at that time—Feist has since paid me every farthing, but at that time I believed the prisoner's state<lb/>ment—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and took an office in Coleman Street, where he acted for me as clerk and appraiser—I took out an appraiser's licence for him—he recommended persons to me to whom advances were to be made, and prepared the bills of sale—I placed entire confidence in him—I was very little at the office myself—about the 2nd February I remember his making a representation to me about a Mr. Dyer—he said that Mr. Dyer lived at the address on the bill of sale, that it was a very nice house, and very good furniture, that the man was very respectable, that he had made every inquiry; and had been to Perry's private inquiry office, and ascer<lb/>tained that he was a man in good position, and I was quite safe in letting him have the money—he said he had seen Mr. Dyer, had taken an in<lb/>ventory of the furniture, and that was a correct copy of it—he showed me this bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it me as a registered bill of sale: (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd February, signed by John Dyer, of.</hi> 18, <hi rend="italic">Wilton Place, St. John's Wood, civil engineer, and contained a long list of articles of furni<lb/>ture.</hi>)—This is in the defendant's writing—also the attestation to Dyer's signature—at the bottom there is a signature to a receipt of Dyer's, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., witnessed by Barrell—I gave him a cheque for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Dyer—that was on the faith of the representation that he made to me as to the respect<lb/>ability of the house; having seen Dyer and the matters contained in the bill of sale—I believed that Dyer was in existence, and his furniture also—I believe the endorsement on this cheque to be the prisoner's writing—I also saw him in reference to a bill of sale of a person named Charles James Dixen, of 288, Essex Road—that was on the 10th February—he said an advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was wanted, that he was a respectable man; that he had made inquiries at Perry's office, that he had taken an inventory of the furniture, and that it was well worth the money, and that I could not be wrong in lending it—he said he had been to 288, Essex Road, had seen Mr. Dixon, and taken this inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he also gave me this as a</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police in this district—on this Sunday afternoon Mrs. Battersby was brought to my surgery—her face and hair were covered with blood, and her clothes also; she was very faint—she had four scalp wounds; they were to the skull, to the bone, and there were a large number of smaller wounds—I can't say that either of the scalp wounds were dangerous in themselves, unless erysipelas had set in—there were two deep wounds penetrating to the left bladebone, upwards—on the head and shoulders she had fifteen wounds, besides those on her hands—she appeared to have been struggling with her hands; in fact, she saved her life by means of her hands—they were wounds that might have been inflicted by such a knife as this—they were about an inch deep, and about an inch wide—I saw the prisoner at the Court, on the Monday—at that timo he was mad—I think it was not the madness of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens;</hi> some persons call it so, and most do so when it occurs from drink; but the man was as mad as possible when I saw him on the Monday—I did not see him on the Sunday—it was a tem<lb/>porary madness—I can't say whether he is liable to a recurrence of it; if he exposes himself to the same exciting cause, he is very likely to have it again; but I think not without.</p>

               <p>—Woolnough said "I have had nothing to do with it; my son had to do with it, and I will settle with your father," and he told him to go off his place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Plough Road, Rotherhithe—on Saturday night, 25th March, I was called in to see the deceased—he was in a state of collapse from some internal injury—there were no external marks of violence—he died on the Wednesday morning—I made a post-mortem examination—the cause of death was rupture of the bladder—that would produce pains in the lower part of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know that any fall would cause rupture of the bladder: the person must fall in a peculiar manner, so that something shall impinge on the region of the bladder—the injury must have occurred shortly before I saw him, which was about 8.45—it might have occurred an hour before, or a half or quarter, not much longer—there may be a single instance where the bladder has been ruptured, and the person has not known it for hours afterwards, but generally it is not so—in this you allude to, the rupture was so small that the whole extravasation did not take place at once—there is evidence of such a case in Dr. Taylor's work—I examined every part of the body of the deceased—the fiver was not ruptured, it was discoloured at the edges; that did not betoken that the man was a hard drinker, but that he did drink a little, not necessarily to excess—you would have hardening of the liver in hard drinking; a bladder distended by drink would be more easily ruptured than one in a natural state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Shortly after an accident of this kind I should expect to find a person cold, in a state of collapse, with excessive pain in the abdominal regions, and tenderness on pressure—the time within which that would take place would depend upon the quantity of extravasation that had taken place—in this case there was three-quarters of a pint found in the peritoneum after death—the rupture was a considerable one—I could get the end of my little finger into the hole—he died of peritonitis, produced from extravasation of the urine—the kidneys did not act after I saw him—no urine was drawn away when we passed the catheter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 53, King Street, Cornwall Road, Lambeth—I went to see a brother workman, on Saturday night, who had the small-pox, and when I left him I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went up Friar Street about 12.30 on Sunday morning, and was surrounded by a lot of costermongers, who put me in a pen, as they do sheep, and <hi rend="italic">cross-buttocked</hi> me across a barrow—Carr was one of them—he got his hand on my head, and pressed it against a barrow—Salter's hand was across my chest, and Bennett said "Don't leave the b—, kick him in the head "—I believe. Bennett was the man who kicked me on my head—I had not known them before, but am quite sure they are three of the men who attacked me—they took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my inside waistcoat pocket—I cannot say which</p>

               <p>took it—they left the pocket empty—I became insensible, and they all left me—I believe a policeman found me—I gave information to him, and saw Salter on the Monday morning, on his own door-step—I at once iden<lb/>tified him, and gave him in custody—next day (Tuesday) the sergeant took me to the lock-up, where there were twelve men, and I picked out Bennett from among them—I am quite sure he was one of them—I afterwards picked out Carr at the police-court, where he stood between twelve and thirteen others—I am certain he is one of the men who robbed me, by the scar on his left cheek—I noticed that when I was robbed, and had men<lb/>tioned it to the police.</p>

I had nothing to drink at home—I was perfectly sober, and not reeling about in the least—I had only had a little drop of beer—I do not take spirits—I might have had one or two pots, not more, because I know my money would not run to it—I was thrown on my back on a barrow of whelks—Salter is the man belonging to the barrow—I have had a pint of beer to-day.</p>

I am an attendant at the asylum—the prisoner came to me on 4th April, and said he had scalded Morley—he asked me to fetch the doctor, and I went for Mr. Ward—I saw the deceased in bed—he was scalded on the left arm and back—there are regulations for our guidance as to the temperature of the baths—as a general rule it should be from 90 to 96 degrees—some of the patients are bathed once a week, and others oftener—the deceased was not a refractory lunatic—the taps were not in good order, and we had to use all the force we could to turn them on and off—it was the prisoner's duty to turn the water off, and' ascertain the temperature, before the patient got into the bath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If a man should say that the water was too cold, I should ask him to get out of the bath, whilst I let more hot water in—a patient has never complained to me of the water not being warm enough—I might put my hand over the inlet hole, to ascertain if the water was too hot, and if not, I might let in a little more without requiring him to leave the bath—the inlet is under the man when in the bath, so that the hot water, if turned on, would mix with the other water at once, and the taps which supply the hot and cold water are about five or six inches apart, at the foot of the bath—the taps worked badly for about six months—I have found great difficulty in turning them off when the water has reached a proper temperature, and it has continued to flow notwithstanding all my efforts to stop it—there has been no alteration in the taps since this affair happened, but a fresh key has been bought, in order that we may turn them on and off more easily—the new key will fit on the taps further, and will not slip off, as the old key did—it gives us greater mechanical power over them—the prisoner was always very attentive to the patients—the deceased did not like any other attendant to do anything for him except the prisoner—he used to call him "George"—there are not always two attendants in the bath room—I have never known lunatics to get in before the proper time, notwithstanding the care used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the junior medical officer of the asylum—on 4th April, I was called in to see the deceased man, Mulley, and examined him in the prisoner's presence—I found an extensive scald upon the back, another on the inner side of the left forearm, reaching from the palm to the elbow, and others at the back of each ankle, or rather, each heel—the scald on the back extended from the bladebone of the left shoulder down to the buttock—a greater part was on the left side—there was considerable shock to the system—he was cold and shivering when I saw him—he recovered from the shock the same evening, but on the 13th he got markedly worse, and I expired from bronchitis—I had seen him previously to the scalding, and he was not then suffering from that complaint; at any rate, not from acute bronchitis—he might have had chronic bronchitis, as I believe he spat a little at times—I made a <hi rend="italic">pout mortem</hi> examination of the body, in con<lb/>junction with Dr. Biggs—I consider that death arose from bronchitis—it frequently results from scalding—there was a little congestion of the mem<lb/>branes of the brain, on the right side, which might have been produced by the scalding or the bronchitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had recovered from the shock, but not quite from the scalds, at the time of his death—the skin had not recovered—I do not think the shock to the system was the severest part of his injuries—he did not seem to be susceptible of pain—the scalds, as I have stated, had not quite healed—there was a large slough in the centre of one of them—he would suffer most from the shock in the first instance—there were more patients suffering from bronchitis at the time—it was a common complaint just then, and was attributable to ordinary causes—if the deceased, in this instance, had been liable to catch cold, he would have got bronchitis—if I had not heard of the scalds I should have attributed it, in his case, to the ordinary causes—bronchitis set in on the fifth or sixth day after the occurrence; but he got markedly worse towards the 13th, when he commenced spitting a good deal—he was treated for bronchitis on the fifth day, by the superintendent—it set in, I believe, immediately after the scalds—it may come on from a week or a fortnight after a person has been scalded—I know nothing of the baths, although I have seen them frequently.</p>

               <p>in other parts, and consequently not quite so susceptible to heat—I attribute the scalding of the deceased to there being a fresh influx of water let into the bath during the time he was bathing—from the position of the scalds I assume that the deceased was put in the bath the wrong way, with his back to the inlet—he might hare been turned a little more to one side, and probably would put down his hand as soon as he felt that the water was too hot—he might try to lift himself, or stand up as soon as he could—that is the only way I can account for the scalds being where they were—he was a very feeble man, and his constitution was breaking up fast—I should think he might have got out of the bath, as he was able to walk about his ward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident physician and superintendent of the asylum—on 4th April I was called to see the deceased—he was lying on a bed, in a small room, suffering from a scald, which extended over the greater part of his back and left forearm, on the inner side—I agree with the last witness as to the position of the scalds—I attended him regularly until the 11th, and was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in my opinion acute bronchitis was the cause of death, and that it was the effect of a scald—if he was in the bath at the moment hot water was turned on, he would be scalded instantly; I should say before he had time to get out—there is only one inlet to the bath for both hot and cold water, but the inlet is supplied by two pipes, the hot water on the left and the cold on the right—they both unite with a main, which forms the inlet alluded to, and which is 53/4 inches from the bottom of the bath—the diameter of the pipe is 11/4 inch, which would give a pressure of 10lbs. to one square inch, both for hot and cold water—there are regulations put up in every bath-room—the heat of each bath ought to range from 90 to 96 degrees—there are special orders against the water being of greater heat than that—from 125 to 140 degrees of heat would scald—some portions of the body, particularly the back and belly, would be more susceptible to scalds than others—the skin is more sensitive there—after seeing the deceased, I asked the prisoner how he could be so culpably careless as to turn on almost boiling water against the back of the patient, or words to that effect—he replied that it was done thoughtlessly, accidentally, or unintentionally, I forget which; that he had done it thoughtlessly, and did not mean to hurt the man—I said if anything happened to the patient, he bad laid himself open to a charge of manslaughter—I think he did not reply to that.</p>

               <p>of the water in the boilers—the water varies in heat according to the fires that are kept—the accident happened a little before I in the day time—baths are given, up to bed time—this was a cleansing bath, because the man was dirty—there would be no object in moving the man about—the taps run into what is called a Y piece—I should think there is a dis<lb/>tance of a foot and a half between one tap and the other—there is but one inlet, so that hot and cold water enters from the same place into the bath—the to comes along the 1 1/4 inch pipe on the left—I think it was necessary for his back to have been towards the inlet for him to have been scalded in the way he was—he was not injured in the front at all—I am positive about that—if he was there when hot water was let in with a rush, he might be scalded before he could get out—his legs and his belly, I think, would have been scalded first, which was not the case—I do not think it possible that the rush of water could have gone round the bath before it mingled with the water in the centre, and not have scalded his legs and belly—it is possible the tendency of the pressure would be to send the hot water more to the left than to the right—I think the hot water must have struck upon his back directly—I have tried the effect of a rush of water in this particular bath, and I find that it goes down the centre—I do not think that a column of water projected with force into the bath would go along the left side of the bath without mingling with the water in the centre—water of 110 degrees of heat would not produce scalding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for his heels being scalded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The water might have been forced on to them, or he might have drawn up his legs in order to get out of the bath; but all this is mere conjecture—there is a waste pipe of two inches in diameter, and an exit pipe at the bottom of the bath—the waste pipe is simply to prevent the water over-flowing the sides of the bath, and so making the place in a mess—the ordinary depth of water in a bath is five inches, and the time for filling it about a minute—no alteration has been made in the baths since the accident—they are new ones, and do not require alteration.</p>

I am pay-clerk at the stone-yard of the workhouse of the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, in Upper Kennington Lane—it is my duty to pay the men for the work they have done—the calculation is made between 4 and 5 o'clock—I pay each poor person half in money and half in bread—there are tickets given, marked from "1" to "10," and the amount of bread given is struck through the number—they are filled up with the name of the person to whom the ticket is given, and we strike out the num<lb/>ber which the person is to receive—there is "1," "2," "3," "4," "5," and so on, on the tickets, and if the person is to receive two loaves, you strike</p>

               <p>out the "2," and leave the others standing—I also make an entry in this I book, at the time I deliver this ticket, of the amount of bread and cash paid to each person—when the order is delivered to the party entitled to receive it, it is his duty to take it to the bread distributor, at the work-house, and he gets the amount of bread marked on the ticket—I know the prisoner—he was at work in the stone-yard on 23rd March last, and he did work entitling him to an order for one loaf, and I gave him an order on that day for one loaf—I have an entry for one loaf in the book—I crossed I the "1" out on the order, and wrote the prisoner's name, and put my own initials on it, and gave it to the prisoner—I only intended him to receive one loaf on that order—on looking at this order I find that the figure "2" has been struck out instead of the "1," and the figure "1" nearly obliterated—I did not strike through the figure "2" at all—I struck through the figure "1"—on the original order he was entitled to receive one loaf—I can just see where the old mark is through the figure "1," it must have been got off when the mark was wet.</p>

I am a guard in the service of the South Western Railway Company—I was the front guard on the evening of 1st January in charge of the goods train which left Nine Elms at 6.25—the train consisted partly of trucks that were to go to Portsmouth, and partly to go to South<lb/>ampton—there were forty-two trucks—it was rather a heavy train—the proper time for arriving at Woking was 8 o'clock—it arrived there that night at 8.10—I should not suppose the train would go more than eight or from that to twelve miles an hour between Woking and Brookwood, as it is a very steep gradient; 1 in 326, from Woking up to Brookwood, or not so much as that—having to stop at Brookwood to put in milk, the train would not be able to go away from there more than at the rate of three or four miles for 200 or 300 yards, and then the speed would accelerate a little—between Frimley and Farnborough the pace begins to increase, because after you pass the Five Arch over Bridge, which crosses the line just before getting to Frimley, there is a decline then towards Farnborough—I saw the trucks, including the one in which the bacon was, before the train left Nine Elms—they were all properly covered up—it had the appearance of everything being in perfect order—when we got to Woking I passed part of the way down the train until T met my mate, who goes in the hind van—he looks at the hind part, and then we change over, and go up the 6-foot ride to see that everything is correct—all was correct at Woking, to the best of my belief—the truck where the bacon was, was eleven or twelve trucks from the front van—that would be in the front part of the train—I think there were about eleven Southampton waggons, and then came two or three Portsmouth ones—we arrived at Brookwood at 8.30, and left at 8.33, after taking in six or seven cans of milk, which we had to put out again at Farnborough—we arrived at Farnborough at 8.52, and remained there five minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and am brother-in-law to the pri<lb/>soners—in January last year we lived at old Mrs. Bedford's cottage—I live at the opposite end, under the same roof, but not the same house like—I re<lb/>member seeing some bacon at the house one Sunday morning—on the Satur<lb/>day night before that, I was at the Rose and Thistle, public-house, about 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoners there—Warren Barnard, their nephew, came in while George was there—I stayed till the house was shut up—Barnard was not there while both the prisoners were there, only George—they went away about 10.45—John did not come there that night while I was there—I am quite sure about that—I have never said that John was in the tap-room—I stayed till the house was shut, and then went home, and went to bed—I got up at 4 o'clock next morning, and went milking—I did not see either of the prisoners that morning—I came back about 9 o'clock—they were then at home, having their breakfast—I saw some bacon in a barrel; there were about eleven flitches, I believe—the prisoners were not doing anything with it then—before I left, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon; to go milking again, I saw them putting some into a sack; one was holding the sack, and the other putting the bacon in—I don't know what became of it—I saw Barnard that Sunday morning before I went out at 4 o'clock—he was in the prisoner's room—he was not there when I came back, and I have not seen him since—the bacon was not there when I came back from milk<lb/>ing—I spoke to the prisoners about it, and they said they had put it away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the bacon on Sunday evening, at 9 o'clock; not Sunday morning; it was my mistake—I never mentioned this matter to the police till I was asked about it a few weeks ago—if I had thought there had been anything wrong, I should have mentioned it—I heard nothing about any bacon being lost—the house where the prisoners lived is their mother's—Barnard and George were in the public-house together about three-quarters of an hour, on the Saturday night, talking together—it was in the prisoners' room that I saw Barnard on the Sunday morning—the prisoners have the same room—there was no one 'there with Barnard—he was there alone—the prisoners were not there—when the prisoners said they had put the bacon away, I did not know what they meant by it—I did not think there was anything extraordinary about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of Police at Frimley—on 11th January, 1870, I went to the Rose and Thistle, at Frimley Green—I saw the lad Heath there, who gave into my custody four fides of bacon; it was wet and muddy, as though got out of a ditch—when the dirt was removed I saw that it was branded "Shaw &amp; Son"—Superintendent Potter afterwards came and claimed it—on 14th March last George Bedford was given into my custody by Potter and Newland—he asked me what I believed would be done to him; would he get three or four years—I told him I did not know what he had done—as we went along to the station he said drink was the cause of it; he had got a glass or two, and Warren Barnard had come to the public-house and taken him away to the railway bank, and took away the bacon to Bedford's house, and when he saw what he had done the following day, he took it down and buried it in</p>

               <p>a ditch, near the railway—the spot where the bacon was found was pointed out to me by Heath; it was about 120 yards from the railway—there were the footmarks of two persons convenient to it, near the railway bridge, leading in the direction of Bedford's house—the prisoner George asked me how many sides of bacon there were—I said "Eleven lost, and four found, making fifteen," and he said "There was only twelve."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of the London and South-Western Railway Police, at Waterloo Station—I received informa<lb/>tion of the missing bacon on the 3rd January, 1870; I went to Farnborough Station, and from there to the house where the last witness lived, and there found four sides of bacon, in a dirty, wet state; it had, no doubt, been lying in the water some days—I examined each side, and found they were all branded "Shaw &amp; Son"—I met the witness Heath in the meadows near the railway, and examined the place between the spot where the bacon was found and the prisoner's house—I first examined the line, and I found two places on the gravel where something heavy had fallen; one on the bridge spoken of, and the other from 30 to 50 yards off—I then traced heavy footmarks from the bridge, across a meadow, to the prisoners' house, and also from their house backwards and forwards—I did not know, at that time, that the prisoners lived there—in consequence of what I learnt, I went and saw George Bedford, who was then in the Company's employ, working in a gang of four or five—I asked him whether he had heard any<lb/>thing of the bacon robbery—he said no, he had heard about bacon being found in the ditch—I asked whether he knew anything about it—he said "No "—I then asked whether he had any relation, or knew anyone employed at Woking or Nine Elms—he said "No"—I pressed him upon that point several times, as to whether he had any relation there—Warren Barnard was at that time employed by the Company, at Nine Elms, and was on duty there on Saturday night, 1st January, till 6 o'clock—in March, 1871, in consequence of information received from a prisoner in Horsemonger Lane Prison, I met Superintendent Newland at Farnborough, and went with him to Frimley, and found George at work on the line—I said "Bedford, do you remember my speaking to you last year about the bacon robbery?"—he said "Yes"—I said "And you informed me then that you had no relation at Nine Elms?"—he said "Oh, yes"—I said "I want you to go to your grandmother's with me"—I understood it was his grandmother, we went there, and as soon as the door was opened, his sister and mother were there, and he said to them "Do you say that I stole the bacon?"—his mother said "No, I did not say so; I told you when you brought it here that it should not stop here, and that is all I know about it"—I then asked the sister to point out to me, in the presence of the prisoner and his mother, where she had seen the bacon—this was in consequence of what she had previously told me—she took me to a small hovel, just outside the back door, and said "There "—I asked her how many sides of bacon she saw—she said, at first, she could not say, but afterwards, she should think about ten—I asked her</p>

               <p>what became of them—she said she did not know—I then asked George what he did with it—he said "We buried it in a ditch, at the bottom of the garden "—I asked him to point me out the place—he said it was no use, as the ditch had been cleaned out since; the bacon was gone, he did not know where—I asked him whether he had seen Barnard on the Saturday night, the night of the robbery—he said yes, he had, and said other words, but I cannot exactly think of them now—he said he had not seen him since that night—I then went to look after John, and found him about a mile off, at work in a field—Newland, who was with me, called him, I can't exactly remember the words he made use of, but John said he knew nothing of the bacon robbery, he was a-bed at the time it was brought to his house, until the Sunday morning—he said on the Sunday evening he and his brother George put it into sacks, and carried it back on to the railway, and left it there, and what became of it afterwards he did not know—he said there were eleven sides.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live at Camberwell—on Friday morning, the 21st April, about 2 o'clock, I was at the corner of Parliament Street—I parted with a friend there, and then went over Westminster Bridge, in the direction of Camberwell—I was accosted by a female just as I got over the bridge—I shook her off and went a little way further, when another woman came up to me from behind and swung herself round in front of me, and said "You have soon got rid of her"—I said "Yes, and will soon get rid of you"—I could not swear that Lewis was the woman, it was so momentary—nothing more passed, but she ran away—I felt for my purse, and found it gone—I ran after her—Clough ran out into the middle of the road and laid hold of my right arm—someone halloaed out and a policeman came running towards me—he told me to run after Clough instead of the woman—I gave chase to him and saw him caught—I did not notice Cooper there—I noticed a second man running, but I had hot seen him before—my purse was in the left trowsers pocket—there was a half-sovereign in it, and twelve or thirteen shillings—I had</p>

               <p>seen it safe when I was on the bridge—I took a half-crown out of my pocket to pay a cabman, and I felt it then—I was perfectly sober—the purse has not been found.</p>

The policeman told me to run after the man—I said before the Magistrate "I pulled myself away from him, and ran after the woman"—the policeman was a little further on; when I got up to him I said I had lost my purse—he said "Follow me," and I let the woman go, and rushed after the two men with him—I had been out with some friends—I had been into one public-house and had two glasses of stout—that was all I had all the evening—I had not been with my friends the whole evening—I felt my purse when I was on the bridge—Clough did not say anything when he caught hold of me—it was a dark night—there were some lamps, but I can't say how far off—I was accosted by a woman before Lewis came up—I did not have any conversation with that woman—Clough did not hold me more than a second or two—I had some loose money in the same pocket with my purse.</p>

My coat was covered with mud when I got to the station, and something was said about my having been on the ground—I did not tell one of the police-sergeants I had lost a sovereign—I said I had lost a pound; a half-sovereign and some silver—when the woman was brought to me in the station-house, she said "You don't say I am the woman that robbed you?"—I said I thought the woman was a little taller, but it was so momentary I could not be sure.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 91). I was in the Lower Marsh about 2.30, the other side of Westminster Bridge—I saw the prosecutor and Lewis there—I knew her before—all at once I saw her run down York Street—the prosecutor made a start to catch her—Clough ran across the road, and took hold of him—I started to go across the road, when Cooper sung out to Clough "Come on, it is time to go"—he was on the opposite side—Clough then let go of the prosecutor, and they both ran up the Lower Marsh, and into the Westminster Road—I ran to the prosecutor, and asked what was the matter—he said he had been robbed by a female—I pursued Clough and Cooper for about 100 yards—they saw another constable in front, and commenced walking—I took them, and said I should charge them with being concerned in robbing a man of his money in the Lower Marsh—they said they had not been there at all—I saw the woman in custody afterwards—I can swear she is the woman—I have seen the men on three or four occasions—I only lost sight of them as they turned into the Westminster Road, for about a quarter or half a minute—I am certain Cooper is the man that spoke—I swear to them both.</p>

I was about fifty yards off when I saw Clough holding the prosecutor; it was a dark night, but the lamps were alight—there was a lamp close to them—Clough had hold of him by the shoulder—I could not say how long he held him—I had not seen Clough about there that night previously—I did not see the prosecutor accosted by any other woman but Lewis—they were only together a short time, just time to exchange a few words.</p>
