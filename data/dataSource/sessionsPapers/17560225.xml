               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Blake. I live at the corner of Duke's-court, Drury-lane; he came backwards and forwards to visit her some times, two or three times a day for near two months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come first?</p>
               <p>Blake. To the best of my knowledge he came first in September last; he behaved himself always very sober and civil.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he in?</p>
               <p>Blake. I can't say he was in any business. He asked me if I could give him cash for a note; (I believe that was in December) and produced one of 10 l. accordingly I gave him 10 l. upon it, after which I found it to be a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find that out?</p>
               <p>Blake. I had taken another note of him after that, which I had some reason to suspect being a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it accepted by?</p>

               <p>Q. Was she delivered of her goods?</p>
               <p>Johnson. She lay at Shadwell-dock when she was delivered of part, but there were above 40 puncheons of rum left on board when she went into the wet dock; and there was a chest of arms.</p>

               <p>Johnson. There were 4 muskets, one musketoon, and 5 pistols missing.</p>

Then I ordered him to meet me on the Wednesday after at Blackwall, which he did; then captain Johnson and I went on board; when we got upon deck we could not get the compainon open, there stood Login on board, I ask'd him what he did there? he said he was the king's officer, and said he would open it, which he did; we went down into the steerage, there was an empty cask stood on the arm chest, I bid him take it off, which he did; I opened the chest and bid captain Johnson take the arms out, which he did; there were 8 muskets, 1 pistol, 3 blunderbusses and eleven cutlasses.</p>
               <p>Q. What were missing?</p>
               <p>Campbell. There were wanting 4 muskets, one blunderbuss and 5 pistols, according to the inventory. I taxed Login with taking them, and ask'd what was become of them? presently Johnson came from out of the ship's hold; then I said to them, what a fine character have I got to lay before the commissioners of the excise of you for taking care of the ship; they said they knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any others left in care of the ship besides the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Campbell. No, there was no body else, the ship is laid up for a year; and on their desiring to be in the steerage, I gave them leave. Then we went to a publick-house in Poplar, and was told there were some arms there. The landlord told me Login had brought some arms there, and one McBean had carry'd them away; I think he said three musquets and some pistols. We took up McBean, he owned the same, and we found by his directions 2 musquets, 4 pistols, and a piece of canvas, and before the justice McBean confessed the stealing of rum. (Four musquets and five pistols produced in court.) I can't swear these are the same that were missing, they are such as I bought for the ship's use about six years ago; they were the property of me and the rest of the owners.</p>

            . On Friday the 9th of this instant February I received a letter from capt. Campbell, with another inclosed which he received from the master builder; he desired me to go to the ship to over-hawl the arms, to see what was missing. I went on the Tuesday morning and took capt. Johnson with me. We looked in the arm chest and found 8 musquets, 1 pistol, and 10 cutlasses. I went to the Jamaica coffee-house and told capt. Campbell what we found, he said then there were so many missing according to the inventory.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners challenged with taking what were missing?</p>
               <p>Sidney. They were, but they denied it, Then I found McBean in company with Johnson, he produced 4 pistols and some canvas; then he went with me before justice Berry and made his confession. I know nothing against the prisoners. I took charge of the ship at Shadwell-Dock, and carried her into the wet dock, at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When a ship is in dock is it not customary for other people to come on board her ?</p>
               <p>Sidney. They have no right to go under the deck, they pass and repass over her, as she lays by the side of others.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there none on board the ship while she was in the dock to take care of her?</p>
               <p>Sidney. About three days after she was in the dock I discharged a man by order of the owners; then there were none left but the prisoner, no body had any right but themselves to be there, and I had the keys of the hatches.</p>

             at Porlar with 2 mosquets and 4 pistols; I then look'd after Mr. Turnhill's house for two or three days, while he was ill; Login desired me to carry the arms to London for him to my uncle's house in Ratcliff-Highway, and to sell them for him, and told me I should have some of the money. I told him I would not do it upon any account.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250006"/>Q. Did he tell you where he had them?</p>
               <p>McBean. He did after he brought them, that he had them from on board the ship he was on; he came to me on the 8th of this instant, and asked me if I had a gimblet, and bid me come on board after him. I went; he took an old key out of his pocket, and unlock'd the padlock, and gave me a dark lanthorn and a candle, and bid me go into the hold along with him, and said he'd give me some rum, for it would never be missed; he took the gimblet and bored, and draw'd off some rum from a puncheon. Then he went to a locker on the side of the ship, and brought a piece of canvas and cut it in two pieces, and gave it to his wife, and she carry'd it to Poplar; and he gave me about 3 yards of it, which is this piece here in court; the bit he had was as big again as mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of rum did you take?</p>
               <p>McBean. He gave me four flasks, and kept seven to himself, the flasks held about a quart each.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Johnson had any rum?</p>
               <p>McBean. I know he had three gallons at a publick-house at Poplar, but how he came by it I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that?</p>
               <p>McBean. He told me he had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Johnson had any of the canvas?</p>
               <p>McBean. Login told me Johnson had some, but I did not see him take any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Johnson when you was on board?</p>
               <p>McBean. He was then at home.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>McBean. I live in Ratcliff-Highway, with my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>McBean. He is a grocer by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of no business whatever?</p>
               <p>McBean. No, nothing but of his business; I serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoners?</p>
               <p>McBean. I never saw them before the ship came into the dock at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had you been on board that ship?</p>
               <p>McBean. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you 20 times?</p>
               <p>McBean. I can't say, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Login before he brought you the musquets?</p>
               <p>McBean. Yes, I had two or three times; I had spoke to him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>McBean, At a publick-house at Blackwall. When I went on board, Johnson and he were on board together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you carry a bunch of keys on board?</p>
               <p>McBean. I had keys in my pocket; but they belong'd to my uncle, they did not know that I had them about me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it he brought you the musquets?</p>
               <p>McBean. I can't say, but it was before he gave me the rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know he was stealing the rum then?</p>
               <p>McBean. I did know it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that qualm of conscience to go off?</p>
               <p>McBean. He told me it would never he missed?</p>
               <p>Q. How came this affair to come out, was not you apprehended with some things upon you?</p>
               <p>McBean. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never hinted on shore to them, that, as the militia was raising in London, you wish'd you had a gun for your uncle's service ?</p>
               <p>McBean. No, my uncle had a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Login tell you what he wanted a gimblet for?</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body in the publick house at the time he brought the guns in?</p>
               <p>McBean. He brought them in backwards in the evening, there might be some people in the foreroom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they were his own, or that he had stole them?</p>
               <p>McBean. He told me they were his own.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times might you have been in this wet dock before you saw Login?</p>

             in Poplar; The two prisoners have both brought rum to my house; there was more rum in my house, but who brought it in I know not; there were also 4 pistols and some muskets. I know not who brought them, but the last evidence carried them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners use your house?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. They did; I once put McBean in my house while I went to London, and what was transacted in my absence I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the rum measur'd?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I did not; I have seen two flasks in the prisoners pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay them for the rum?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I paid them 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you pay it?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I paid it to McBean, it was he that let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. No, I never did, I have seen them bring rum to my house and put it down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did McBean deal in rum?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. They came all three together, and I made some of the rum into punch and they drank it; McBean measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much per gallon did you give him for it?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I did not make a bargain; McBean told me it would be of service to me; I am but a new publican.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might the flasks hold?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I believe each held a gill over a quart; they told me I should pay after the rate of 8 s. per Gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. This was three weeks ago, I believe; they always behaved well when they came to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what quantity they brought?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not an allowance on board a ship for a Customhouse officer?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I can't tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Johnson's defence.</p>
               <p>I brought rum to that man's house at different times, it was what I saved out of my allowance, and did not belong to the ship.</p>
               <p>Login's defence.</p>
               <p>This man, McBean, being a duffer, he used to go on board these ships; he is always lurking about that place.</p>
               <p>Q. to Capt. Campbell. Is there any particular allowance to the Custom-house officers for rum?</p>
               <p>Campbell. There is none at all, without we please to give it them.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Carter. When I heard the prisoner was taken up, I went to see what was the matter. On the 24th of January I ask'd him what he had done with the silver buckles he had taken out of the coachman's room; he told me he had pawn'd them for six shillings; I ask'd him what he had done with the box and other things? He said the hone was at a barber's opposite the Black Horse in Aldersgate-Street; he shew'd me one of the shirts on his back, and own'd the taking of the stockings. He said the box was at the Black Horse, and he had given two shirts out to be mended; he own'd he took three stocks, but would not tell what he had done with them; neither would he own the stock buckle. He told me that he opened the door with the pitch-fork.</p>

I laid hold of her hand, and the apron and things dropped from under her arm; a man struck me, and said she should not go with me, but a gentleman said she should go; then the man went away and left us.

I went and got a warrant, and pursued the prisoners; this was the same evening; I found them at Mr. Butler's, the King's Arms, in Horton-Street (I was informed they used that house) this was near about eight o'clock. I told them they were the men I wanted, for they had been in my shop, and I had lost a bundle of handkerchiefs, and that they must be the men that had taken them. I went to take the warrant out of my pocket, but found I had lost it. I desired them to stay there, and I staid along with them.

               <p>Mason. I was not gone long; I left no body in charge of them.</p>

               <p>Isabella Mason. I am wife to the last witness. On the 28th of January I was standing in my shop, folding up some cloth; the prisoners came into my shop, pretending to buy cloth for a shirt; they ask'd to see a piece, there was some laying on the counter; they said that was too good, and desired me to lift up my hand and reach down another piece; I told them I thought it strange they should come to my shop, when they had been there about a week before and could not agree. Then one of them went to the end of the counter, where the handkerchiefs were standing; I saw them move, and they were gone; there were 3 dozen of them; the prisoners bought nothing of me.</p>

            . As I was coming down Vere-Street, Clare-Market, on the 28th of January, between the hours of five and six, I met Mr. Mason's maid, who told me her master had been robbed of a bundle of handkerchiefs. I ran and overtook Sharp in Sheer-Lane. I tap'd him upon the shoulder (not thinking he was guilty of the thing, for I knew him.) I told him Mr. Mason had been robbed, and ask'd if he saw two men run; he said he was sorry for it, and that no body ran that way, only he and his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250014"/> partner had been running. I then went back to Mrs. Mason, and told her I had been of a fool's errand. Then she described the men to me, before I told her whom I met; so I and Mr. Mason went again after them, but could not find them. We went to the Advertising house, where he lost his warrant. We came back to the market, and on inquiry heard that they used Mr. Butler's, at the King's-Arms, where we found them.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it after you first went out after them, that you found them at Butler's?</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners endeavour to conceal themselves?</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched?</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. No, they were not.</p>

            . I lodge in Mr. Mason's house. I saw Sharp come into the shop, but did not see him take any thing away. Mrs. Mason called me down stairs, and said she had been rob'd; and I went and told her husband; I can say no further.</p>
               <p>Sharp's defence. I was at Mr. Butler's all that afternoon till three quarters after five, when Sharrat and a young woman came to Butler's to me. I went with the young woman to the Horseshoe in Fleet-street, and from thence into Sheer-lane, where we bid one another good night. I turn'd about and said to Sharrat, I must go to St. Dunstan's church for my coat, which is at the taylor's. We ran about half way down Sheer-lane, when Tomlinson overtook me. He asked me if I saw two men run. I said, nobody but I and my friend before. I called him, and asked if he saw any body run; he said, he saw nobody. Then Tomlinson said Mason's shop had been rob'd, wishing us a good night, and we then went to St. Dunstan's church, I took the coat, and paid for it. After that, I went to Butler's again, and when I had been there about half an hour, the men came in, and the prosecutrix said we were the men who had rob'd her shop: I was not at the shop.</p>
               <p>Sharrat's defence. I had been at work-all that day till five o'clock in the evening, at one Mr. Grace's, in Brook's market; at that time I went to Clare-market, and met the young woman Sharp has mentioned, who said she was looking for Sharp. I went with her to the King's-Arms, where Sharp was, and called him out, and we went to the Horseshoe, and from thence for his coat; we ran half way down Sheer-lane, when Tomlinson overtook us, and ask'd if we saw two men running. Sharp said, none but he and I. Then we went for the coat, and came back to the King's-Arms. I was not in the shop, nor don't know where it is.</p>
               <p>Q. to I. Mason. Did you see Sharrat in your shop the day you lost the things ?</p>
               <p>I. Mason. They were both in the shop that day, I assure your lordship.</p>

I had put a guinea and 3 shillings in my coat pocket, and in the morning I missed all but one shilling. I challenged her with it, and she denied it. I saw the door was lock'd, and she came down in her shift, let me out at a back door, and I found my way home.</p>

               <p>Winter. I saw her at the Royal-Oak, near Newmarket-Street, Wapping, just by Edward-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Midleton's house?</p>

               <p>Winter. It is. The prisoner at the bar brought the child in, and call'd for a pint of beer, and then drank to me; I thought she had been some lady's servant in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the child before?</p>
               <p>Winter. I had seen the child before many times, but did not know who were its parents. The prisoner went out with the child, and I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there?</p>

               <p>S. Markby. She had a pair of gold beads, and a cypher locket set in silver; and a pair of gold wires in her ears. Between twelve and one came a gentlewoman and ask'd me if I had lost one of my children. I said I have sent one of an errand.

I then sent for my husband, he is a waterman, and then went to see if I could meet with my child; but while I was gone she was brought home by the beadle of Whitechapel. She was much frighted, and said a woman had carry'd her to an alehouse in Stepney, and gave her a bun, and then took her ear-rings and necklace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take up the prisoner?</p>
               <p>S. Markby. I went to Mr. Harding's, at Stepney, the house where the child said she had been, and described the woman, as the child had done to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250018"/> then the maid said she knew her, and gave me intelligence of her; so I took her up.</p>

               <p>A. Vesper. This was about eleven o'clock. Then she said, come, now we'll go and have a pint of ale; then she had a pint of two-penny; after which she went out at our gate, that goes towards the church-yard.</p>

               <p>S. Craggs. I found the prisoner at the bar, and she own'd she had the cloak, but had pawn'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find her?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. In Norton-Falgate, where she lived. I went there by five o'clock in the morning and found her mother; I then ask'd for the prisoner, but she told me her daughter was not at home. I look'd about and saw her lying on the floor, and by the description my child had given me, there lay her hat and cloaths by her. I said young woman get up, and let me have the cloak you took from my child such a day, or I'll charge an officer with you. She got up, and told me my child gave it her, and she had pawn'd it. Her mother said, Madam, if you will not make a disturbance, you shall have the cloak. I insisted the prisoner should go with me to the pawnbroker's. She went with me to a pawnbroker in Bell-Yard, Whitechapel. She there told the pawnbroker's wife she brought it herself on Saturday morning, the cloak was produced there, and this is it ( holding one in her hand.)</p>

             came to my house and said he came from Hampstead, and ask'd if this was Mr. Barnardiston's; I said it was; he said I have got your boy and your money, with a horse and saddle for you. There was an apothecary with him. They brought me twenty-eight guineas and a moidore. The apothecary said he was coming by when the boy was taken, and being willing to save my cash, he came; but he is not here now, as I did not think there would be any occasion for him. We took the prisoner to justice Welch, and he committed him.</p>

            . I live at Hampstead. Last Monday was sev'n-night in the evening, the boy at the bar came to my house, and asked for a lodging; he lay there; the next morning he went away, and returned again about one o'clock with a little grey mare, and a bridle but no saddle; he said it was his master's mare, that he had sent him out for an airing for an hour or two, and had order'd him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250019"/> buy a saddle; which gave me a suspicion things were not right. I sent for a saddler in Hampstead, who brought a saddle, which the boy bought and paid for. I told the saddler afterwards, I did not think the boy was honest. He said he had cross questioned him, and thought there was nothing amiss. I told him, he says his master lives in Chancery-lane, I'll take my horse and ride thither; so we both set out together, that is, the boy and I. When we were come out of Hampstead, he (having the best horse) rode off; but there being a great many people on the road, they stop'd him, and he fell from his horse. There was a gentleman comeing by with a child in his hand, to whom I told my suspicion. We searched the boy, and I counted as I thought 27 guineas and a moidore (which I took from the boy) into the gentleman's hand, but when I came to tell it afterwards, there were 28 guineas and a moidore. The gentleman and I brought him to his master's house. We talk'd to him as we went along, but he would own nothing till he got to his master's, and there he confessed he had taken it out of his master's till.</p>

I went to my wife, who was ill in bed, and asked her for the key, but she refused it me. I then went down stairs, and said to my servant, I wonder'd her mistress refused me the key, desiring her to go up and tell her, that unless she would let me have the key I should break the door open. Presently after she return'd with the key, with this message to me, that my wife desired I would master up all my patience I could, for I should find it exercised. I asked her why, and she told me, when I went into the room I should soon see the plate was taken away. I sent the maid back again, to demand the key of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250020"/> the glass-case, that I might open it, and see whether the plate was gone. She came down with it, I went and open'd it, and found the plate was taken away, a large quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a silversmith?</p>
               <p>Cobb. No, I am a <rs id="t17560225-29-viclabel165" type="occupation">surgeon</rs>

               <p>Q What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cobb. He was my <rs id="t17560225-29-deflabel166" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

               <p>Q. Had he been absent about your business that time ?</p>
               <p>Cobb. No, but he absented himself very often from my business. He knock'd at the door, and my servant open'd it. He had fight of me, which caused him to retreat a little, saying he would return again. I stept to the door, and bid him come in. He did so, and went to go up stairs to bed. I went into my wife's chamber, to prepare something for her. He was coming down again. I told him he could not lie in the chamber he used to lie in, because I must lie there myself, and said I had something further to say to him, asking him what he had done with my tankard and plate. He said he would restore the tankard to me again, but the rest he had not, believing his mistress had pawn'd it. I desired him to go down with me to his mistress's chamber, and speak before her, which he did. I then charged him with having the money the plate was pawn'd for, and he did not deny it, but said he was to sell some houses at Bromley in Kent, and then he would redeem all the plate, and restore it to me. I told him I could not rely upon his promise, and asked him what security I should have in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he of age?</p>
               <p>Cobb. He is 23 years of age. Accordingly he gave me a note for 63 guineas. I then desired him to take care to do as he had said, and all might be well. He said he would. I ask'd him who was to dispose of these houses. He said one Mr. Langford, under the piazza's in Covent-Garden, and that there was to be a week's notice in the Advertiser, and were to be put up at Bromley; but this I found to be all a fiction. He continued with me till the Tuesday following, being Jan. 20. I call'd upon the pawnbroker where my wife said the plate was, and saw some of it. I return'd, and had occasion to go into the yard; when the prisoner took the opportunity to go off again. Then I went up into my wife's chamber, and told her I had seen the plate at the pawnbroker's, but there wa s not all, and ask'd her where the rest was; she said she believed Natt. had taken away the tankard. I asked her where were the castors; she said she believed he had taken them without her knowledge, if they were not there. I heard no more of the prisoner till the 4th of February, when I had an order from justice Fielding to come to him. I went there, and there was the prisoner taken up on suspicion of robing on the highway, at Turnham-Green, with a brace of pistols upon him; the prisoner then acknowledged he had the tankard and castors, and pawn'd them with one Mr. Fryer, in Wych-Street; upon which the justice sent for him. He came, and brought the tankard and castors; and he and I were bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the note for 63 guineas include the tankard and castors?</p>
               <p>Cobb. No, my Lord. I knew nothing of the castors when I took the note; neither do I remember that the value of the tankard was included in the note; there was plate to the amount of fourscore pounds missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents of the note ?</p>
               <p>Cobb. It was a promissory note to pay me 63 guineas, for value received, in so many days.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he acknowledge he had taken the tankard and castors?</p>
               <p>Cobb. He said it was by my wife's consent he took the tankard, the castors he did not mention.</p>

               <p>Q. HOW came the sum to be fixed at 63 guineas?</p>
               <p>Cobb. Because I did not apprehend all the plate to be gone. He told me he would give me a note for a hundred pounds if I pleas'd, but I fix'd it under the value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that he had received any particular sum?</p>
               <p>Cobb. The sum was not particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the sum of 63 guineas to be pretty near equivalent to your loss in plate?</p>
               <p>Cobb. No, my lord, I lost a great deal more; I would not touch the life of the delinquent, but he has wrong'd me in the tenderest point I can mention.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he paid the note since?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you found out where the rest of the plate is?</p>

            . I live in Wych street, am a pawnbroker. (He produced a tankard and three castors, all silver.) On Wednesday the 30th of December last, the prisoners brought these three castors to pawn, I lent him two guineas and a half upon them; on Thursday the 8th of January he brought the tankard, upon which I lent him 7 guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Fryer. I have known him 3 years, he has brought plate before, and a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know he was an apprentice?</p>
               <p>Fryer. No, I did not: He appeared as a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where he lived?</p>
               <p>Fryer. No, I did not; I know his father kept the Crown, at Seven-oaks in Kent; I believe he has brought a watch forty times to me, and taken it out again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cobb. Look at the tankard and castors, do you know them?</p>
               <p>Cobb. It is marked with my name, it is my property; the castors are mark'd the same, they are mine also.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fryer. In whose name did the prisoner pawn them?</p>
               <p>Fryer. In his own name.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Where is the rest of the plate pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Cobb. They are pawned in Wheeler-street; there was a gold laced hat, my property, pawn'd in the prisoner's name, but that is not here. I have lost above 500 l. by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>As the prosecutor's wife had the keeping the key of the room where the plate used to be, the prisoner could not take it without her privity or consent.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. On the 22d of January the prisoner came to live with me; and on the 23d she rob'd me of the things mention'd.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was she that took them?</p>
               <p>E. Emmerton. When she was there, they all were there; but when she was gone, they were gone. I had the cloak in my hand about a quarter of an Hour before she went away. I saw her go out, but did not suspect her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she go out about?</p>
               <p>E. Emmerton. She went out to sell some sprats; but did not return till my husband brought her. As my husband was going out to get some people to be witness to what she said, then she said she would not speak before any body, and snap'd her fingers at him, and said if she was to go out of the nation, she would go with the cloak about her shoulders. I ask'd her where she had pawn'd the other things? she said in Bishopsgate-street; I ask'd her where? she said she supposed I would charge a constable with her; and so she would not let me know where they were pawn'd. She gave me my apron, and said it is your apron, take it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you lend me the apron to go out with, as mine was very dirty?</p>
               <p>E. Emmerton. Upon my oath she never ask'd me to lend it her; if she had ask'd me, I should have lent it her, either that or the cloak; but I did not lend her any of the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at Billinsgate; they came to me, and ask'd me if I would come and live with them for a bit of victuals and drink; or whether they should let me have a little money to go to work with; he let me have a little money; then I bought some sprats, and went out with them, but did not come home that night; he came to me and swore that I had rob'd him of those things. I put the apron round my shoulders to keep the rain off; he said if you have not taken the things, you shall come and live with me again. When he was going along he put his hand to my throat and beat me sadly, and after he had hauled me about, he carried me before the justice.</p>

The prisoner used to lay out of nights; I used to talk to him for it, and ask'd him where he got money to support himself in such practices; he told me he did not need much money, for he kept gentlemen company, and they treated him. I twice found my indico chest staple drawn out; I put it in again, thinking it might be shook out, and clinch'd it on the inside. Some time after that I found it out again, and I put it in again. On Saturday was fortnight he had hired a horse to go down into the country; he went out of town; and while he was gone I searched my warehouse, to see if I could find any thing; in searching about, I found an old waistcoat of the prisoner's; in the pocket were a couple of keys. I tried my indico and soap chests, and they sitted and opened them both. Then I put them into his pocket again; he did not come home till the next morning. Then I sent for a constable, and charged him with the prisoner; then the prisoner said what do you charge him with me for? I told him, because I believed him to be a thief. I ordered him to go backwards into my warehouse, and demanded him to open a cupboard that he had made himself there. He tried, but being in a flutter, could not open it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250025"/> then I order'd it to be broke open; whence he took out the thread and indico mentioned in the indictment himself. I ask'd him how he came by that indico, he said he had it not from the chest, but he took it out of the indico bowl, which I grind it in, after I have done with it; but that was impossible, for had he took it out of the bowl after I had ground it, it would have been like slaked time; but this is hard, and the same as is in the chest. I took him before the justice; and in going along he confessed he had stole twenty pounds weight of thread, and sold it for five shillings; and three pounds of thread, which he had sold for three shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner an estate left him?</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jenkins. The prisoner came into our shop on the 14th of this instant, under pretence of wanting business. I told him my master was gone to dinner, and if he would call again in about two hours time, he might talk to him. I went up stairs. The prisoner went out, and came back again, and wrote directions to know where to come. Then I went up to dinner. Then he came back again and told the errand boy he wanted to speak with me; as the boy was coming to me, he ran out, and the boy after him; the boy soon return'd, and said the prisoner had struck him. I ran out, and in Warwick-Lane stop'd the prisoner with the goods under his arm. I challenged them; then he said if these are your goods, take them; which I did (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

The prisoner came into my house on the 20th of January, about six in the evening; I was asleep; but happening to awake, I ask'd her what she wanted. She said nothing at all; then I said you are soon served and went to dose again. She open'd a door and took a pewter dish off the sink, and went out; the girl stop'd her and call'd out master, master. I jump'd up, and ran out; she was got out of the house and the girl kept fast hold of her. I ran and took the dish from under the prisoner's left-arm. She said it was the first time she had been guilty of such a fact.</p>

On the 18th of Jan. as I was going through Aldgate about 6 o'clock at night, I had my hand in my pocket, and my handkerchief in my hand; I had occasion to blow my nose, I took my handkerchief out, and crossing the way by the corner of <placeName id="t17560225-37-crimeloc211">the Minories</placeName>

I felt in my pocket and missed it, and said I had lost my handkerchief; we were in a publick house then; there came in a gentleman who heard what I said, and said, where did you lose it? I said betwixt here and Aldgate; said he, I just came by there, our neighbours can hardly stir out of an evening without having their pockets picked; there are four of them stand at the end of the school at Houndsditch. I borrowed a great coat to disguise me, and I and my friend went out to see if we could take them. I went first, I saw a Dutchman in liquor and a woman following him; the two prisoners Condict and Shodd followed the man and woman close, when I came through the gate I lost them in a moment, I saw them shoot through and cross over the way, and were standing under the gate where the horses and coaches go, then I went back and saw a coach coming through the gate, after which I saw 4 of the boys; then my friend and I went and took the 3 prisoners at the bar under the school, where I saw them at first; I took 7 handkerchiefs from Boot, and while my friend was gone for a constable, I search'd the other two, they stood shuffling together, I took hold of one and pull'd him from the other, I saw a parcel of handkerchiefs lying on the ground under them; I said, bring a bag, here is a bag full more; we took them up, there were 5 of them and one glove (this was in the watch house) when the constable came to strip them out drop'd the other glove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your own handkerchief ?</p>
               <p>Eeles, No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What did they say for themselves ?</p>
               <p>Eeles. Boot called the other whom we did not take Bogey, and said Bogey had bought them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it taken from?</p>
               <p>Duthie. It was hanging on the door of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell coats?</p>
               <p>Duthie. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it immediately?</p>
               <p>Duthie. No, I did not; this was on the Saturday, I did not miss it till the Sunday morning; I enquired among the pawnbrokers on the Wednesday following, and at a new pawnbroker's in Russel-court I found it; they told me they had taken it in on the Saturday night on which I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the pawnbroker's name?</p>
               <p>Duthie. His name is Rotchford, ( produced in court ) this is a coat I made for my own wear, the pawnbroker told me the prisoner pawned it. I went in search of him and found him in the street, I had a warrant and so I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Duthie. This was on the Friday after I had lost my coat; I took him to justice Fielding who committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the justice?</p>
               <p>Duthie. Before the justice he said he bought the coat, but I forgot the person's name he said he bought it of.</p>

             a pawnbroker (he takes the coat in his hand) the prisoner at the bar brought this coat to me on Friday night the 14th of November, and said he was just come out of a fit of illness, he had bought it to keep himself warm and he wanted some money on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>He is mistaken, it was on Saturday night that I pawned it, and that Saturday night I had two shirts a making in Drury-lane, I went to give my seamstress a pot of beer, there came in two men and called for a pint of beer, one of them had the coat on his arm, they whispered together, then one said to the other, you bought it dear enough, I wish you may make your money of it again. I asked them what they would have for the coat, they said 20 s. I said I could not spare so much money; if you'll sell it I'll give you 16 s. for it; he let me have it for that, then they came to the box where I was drinking. I had not so much money about me, so I laid down 8 s. and my two new shirts, and left the woman that made them with them till I went and pawned it to get the rest of the money, which I did, and returned and paid the other 8 s.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Jackson. The prisoner lives in Drury lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business ?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. He is a carpenter by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. I work very hard for my bread at washing and with my needle; I was present when the prisoner bought the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. To the best of my knowledge it was in the middle of November. I had made two new shirts for him, and he came to my lodging and asked me to drink a pint of beer, when two men came in who buy old cloaths, as I took it they came to have a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What publick house was it?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. It was the Elephant and Castle, one said to the other he had bought a bargain since they parted; the other looked at the bargain, the prisoner asked the man that bought it whether he was for selling it or no?</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the coat?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. It was a light colour'd coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a coat?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. A horseman's coat, a big coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain as to the colour?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. It was a light drab I know, the man answered the prisoner and said he bought it to sell; he asked him what he would have for it? he said he would have 20 s. the prisoner would give no such money, he tried the coat on, he proposed to give 16 s. for it, they agreed for that, then the prisoner laid down 8 s. having no more, and said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250029"/> the old-cloaths-man he would leave me and the two shirts I had made him whilst he went and pawned the coat for the money; he went out and left me there, he came in again in 5 minutes and paid him the other 8 s. and they drank two tankards of beer and parted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what day this was ?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. I am not exact to the day of the month, it was about the middle of November, on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the coat again was you to see it?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. It was a light drab, indeed it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this coat. It was held up and was a very dark colour.</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. I can't swear it was that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call this a light drab?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. (She hesitated some time,) at last said I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when it was bought besides you?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wakefield. Do you set down the day of the month when you take in things to pawn?</p>
               <p>Wakefield. Yes, we do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in your book before you came out ?</p>
               <p>Wakefield. I did; and it was Friday the 14th that I took that coat in.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it?</p>
               <p>Wakefield. I believe it might be 10 at night, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Jackson. What time of the night was it this bargain was made ?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. It was after candle light, the hour I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you tell whether it was an hour, more or less, after?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. It might be 2 or 3 hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he gone to pawn it ?</p>
               <p>E. Jackson. He was back again in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wakefield. Where does your master live?</p>
               <p>Wakefield. He lives at the corner of Russel-court.</p>

            . I am a soldier, I remember I was drinking a pint of beer at the Elephant and Castle in Drury-lane there were two old-cloaths men came in with some old-cloaths, one said to the other I have bought a bargain since I saw you; the other said what is it; he said, it is this coat upon my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this, is this it? (it is held up )</p>
               <p>Kelsey. I never had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by at the time ?</p>
               <p>Kelsey. There was a woman along with them, but whether this is the woman, I know not. They whisper'd to one another: said the other, you have bought it dear enough. The prisoner said, will you sell that coat, my friend? Said he, I bought it to sell. Said he, what do you ask for it? He said 20 s. The prisoner said, I am like a quaker, I'll give you not more nor less than 16 s. Then with a great deal of words, one said, let him have it. He paid down 8 s. and said, I have got two new shirts; I'll leave you them 'till I go and pawn it, and bring you the money. They sat down in the box; and I staid some time, and saw the prisoner come in, and pay the other 8 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you subpaena'd ?</p>
               <p>Kelsey. I was subpaena'd last Saturday.</p>

               <p>Q. Does he live there?</p>
               <p>Young. He is coming there to live. The family is not yet come in; some of them are.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they come?</p>
               <p>Young. I cannot give any account when they did come in. I was at work there on the 17th of Jan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lie in the house ?</p>
               <p>Young. I cannot say whether they lay in the house, they were backwards and forwards most days: that is, Mr. Bridges and his lady, and several of the servants. On Saturday night, the 17th of January, we lost the tools. My chest was broke open; and I missed 4 saws, 15 pair of hollows and rounds; some chissels, a hammer, and a setting-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. From what place were they taken ?</p>
               <p>Young. From Mr. Bridges's dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last ?</p>
               <p>Young. About 4 o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Young. He was there; we kept a sharp eye upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a workman there ?</p>
               <p>Young. No, he was not. I never saw him before that day in my life, as I know of. They came and told me on Sunday morning I was rob'd. I went up and found my chest broke open, and all my tools taken away; more than mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in?</p>
               <p>Young. I found a pane of glass or two broke the butler's pantry, underneath the hall; to the sash of the hall window was opened by that means.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they come into the dining-room ?</p>
               <p>Young. There was no lock to the dining-room door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the outer door fastened ?</p>
               <p>Young. That was fastened by a padlock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Young. He was secur'd, and in the Round-house; and two bags of tools taken upon him. He was taken before the justice, and there he told me he got in at the hall window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the house was intirely fast, when you left it.</p>
               <p>Young. I can say the hall window was safe, and the sash fastened down; but the shutters were not shut: and there were iron rails before the house, and the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see your tools again?</p>
               <p>Young. I saw them again in the Round-house; and we have brought some of them here. ( he produced two saws.)</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property are these?</p>
               <p>Young. One is mine, the other

            . I lost 6 saws, 16 pair of moulding planes called O G's, 6 chissels and some gouges, from out of my chest; which was lock'd up over night, in the back drawing-room above stairs, in this house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last ?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. I saw them there about half an hour after 6 o'clock, when I left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house well secur'd over night?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. It was well secur'd as any house can be; all the doors were fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window fast?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. It was, and all the windows were; and when we went away, we went out at the front door, and lock'd that. I was in bed on the Sunday morning, when one of the men came and told me, that my chest was broke open, and all my tools gone. The prisoner was in the Round house at that time. I went there and found all my tools in a bag. One of these saws, here produc'd, is one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250031"/> of the 6 that was taken away of mine; here are 3 O G's, and a quarter round that were found also with the prisoner; which are part of the tools I left in my chest over night. ( producing them ) My chest lid was broke in pieces, and laid quite open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any part of the house broke open?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. I did. He confessed before the justice he got down the area window, and came out at the hall window; and that he had a partner along with him. That he got over the iron bars that belong to the palisades; that he broke a square of glass in the area window, and went in through that square in the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there room enough for him to go in?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. It was a very large square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he got in?</p>
               <p>Heyworth. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you take him?</p>
               <p>Laming. I saw him coming out at the hall window of Esquire Bridges, between ten and eleven o'clock; he had two bags of tools on his shoulders when I laid hold on him. We had a battle in the dirt for about a quarter of an hour, before any body came to my assistance; at last came two of my master's men; then we took him to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he got from the house when you took him?</p>
               <p>Laming. He had not got ten yards from the window. I had got him to the Round house, I went and fetch'd the bags; we had left them where we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Laming. I work for the same master as the carpenters do. I am watchman to the timber-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these tools; are these part of what the prisoner had got upon him?</p>
               <p>Laming. They are, except the saws. The prisoner own'd he had carry'd two bags full off, while I was at the pay table, and had pawn'd them (amongst which were the saws.) When I laid hold on his shoulder, I said what have you got here? he said I have got my tools. I said, I do not think there are any tools of your's there.</p>

               <p>I did not break open the house. I only went in at the hall window.</p>

            , they asked me to give them some beer. We went to the Red-Lion in Shoe-lane, where we had 3 or 4 pints of egg hot.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call egg hot ?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. It is gin, ale and eggs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. Till about 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I was a little in liquor when I went in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from thence?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. After that we went to Cheapside; there they call'd a coach; we got in it, and they order'd the coachman to drive to the Magpye, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink there?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. We did. We had three pots of porter there; and staid I believe about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go when you left that place?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. They order'd the coachman to go to the Brown-Bear, in East-Smithfield. There we had some pork steaks and beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you fuddled by this time?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. No, but I was a little merry. Then the other two prisoners join'd us company; from thence we all five agreed to go to the Red-Lion, in Bishopsgate-street. After we came there, we had some beer; and after that some mull'd wine; and staid drinking till about twelve at night. Then they began to make a quarreling in the house. The woman of the house then said get you out all together; I don't like you; you shall not lie here; get about your business. Then they all four got into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250032"/> coach; and I said to the coachman, I'll give you a shilling to carry them home, or where they have a mind to go; and I said I'd stay there and lay by myself all night. Then they said, come, my dear, or some such words, come into the coach with us. So by their persuasions I did get into the coach. I had my watch in my pocket then.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had it?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I took particular notice, and put the string within side my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you pretty much fuddled by this time ?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. No, I was not; I was pretty middling. I had not been in the coach above five minutes, when my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it go?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I did not miss it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to miss it?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. The coachman said he would have his money before-hand; and came down from off the box to me for 2 s. This was after I had been in the coach about five minutes. I went to put my hand to my pocket, and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he going to drive to?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I don't know that; God knows. I missed my watch. I said I am rob'd, I am rob'd; the watchman came immediately up, and we carried them to the watch-house, and from thence we went all five to the compter; the next morning we went to Guildhall before Mr. alderman Cockayne, who committed them all to Newgate, and bound me over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch again ?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the women search'd?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them sat nearest you in the coach?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I can't tell, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you tell which sat nearest to you?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. They were all four together.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must sit next to one of them.</p>
               <p>Parnhill. My Lord, I got in the middle of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which took the watch?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. It was gone amongst them.</p>
               <p>Skelton. You have known me fourteen years. You know when you came out of the Red-Lion, you insisted upon getting into the coach, but the coachman would not let you, and then you went to fighting.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I am an ironmonger and chapman.</p>
               <p>Skelton. That is, he cries about the street to buy old iron and lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know all the four prisoners?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I do, I know them by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known them ?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. God bless you, I don't know how long I have known them. I have seen them go up and down the streets to buy old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in their company before ?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I have with two of them, drinking sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with any of them before?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. No. What do you mean by acquainted? I don't understand that. I have been drinking with them.</p>
               <p>Q. With how many have you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. With the little one and the great one.</p>
               <p>Court. Name their names?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. That is, Skelton and Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might you have drank with them?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. I can't say, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the One-Tun, in Field-Lane?</p>
               <p>Parnhill. Yes.</p>

            . I had just been home with my coach; and calling at the Red-Lion in Bishopsgate-Street, saw this man, and the four women at the bar, at the Red-Lion door. I believe they had a bottle of mull'd whis; and staid there the value of an hour. The prosecutor changed a guinea to pay for it; he took his watch out at the same time he took the guinea out, to see what a clock it was. He gave the coachman a shilling for bringing them there. Three of these women agreed to lie by themselves in one bed; and to the least of the women, which is Skelton, he gave a shilling to lie with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this Red-Lion?</p>
               <p>Yates. It is an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they let such people lay together there?</p>
               <p>Yates. I can't say, but there may be such people lie there. After this they began to make words, and the gentlewoman said neither of them should lie there, and turn'd them out. Then the man gave the coachman a shilling to drive the women home somewhere. The coachman said he'd have 2 s. The man went to get into the coach; the coachman said he should pay first; he said he would not pay first, and pull'd off his hat and wig to fight. I knowing the coachman, said to him, don't hit him, for he is fuddled; so he did not. Then he put on his hat and wig again. Then the women call'd him to come into the coach, and said come my dear, and call'd him by his name. One of them said to him, have you got your watch and your handkerchief? I said to the watchman, let us see whether the man has got his watch, or not; he came with his light, and I saw the prosecutor pull his watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch?</p>
               <p>Yates. I did, and saw him pull out his silk handkerchief from his right-hand pocket; after they had much intreated him, he got into the coach; but he had not been in the coach above four minutes, before the coachman would have his money; he went to put his hand in his pocket, and could not find his watch; he said it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch afterwards ?</p>

               <p>Yates. No, I never saw it after this. I can't tell who had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prosecutor very much fuddled ?</p>
               <p>Yates. The man was not in a drunken condition, but he was a little in liquor.</p>

            . I am a watchman at the end of Widegate-Alley. I heard a great noise at half an hour after 12 o'clock. I went to the Red Lion door, and there were the prisoners and prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor's watch?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it when you saw it?</p>
               <p>Freeman. At almost one o'clock, it was just before he got into the coach. The four women were in the coach, and said to the man, my dear, have you got your silk handkerchief? He put his hand in his coat-pocket and pull'd it out, so likewise he did his watch, and put it into his sobb, and turn'd the ribband withinside his breeches, and stept into the coach; and he had not been there five minutes before he came out, and said he had been rob'd, and gave me charge of the four prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch after that ?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No, I never saw it since/.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the women search'd?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No, one of them offer'd to be search'd, but the others said, nobody should search them.</p>

            . On the 30th of January, towards the evening, betwixt dark and light, there came two women into my house (<placeName id="t17560225-41-crimeloc233">the Rose and Crown, Aldgate-High-Street</placeName>

They drank it, and call'd for another; in the mean time the prisoner and another man were drinking a pint of beer opposite them, in another box: by and bye the prisoner and the other man separated, the other man went into another company, and the prisoner introduced himself into the womens company, and began to drink with them out of the silver mug. My wife was out, and I was pretty busy; one of the women took it up on her finger and brought it to me at the bar, after they had done; and said, take care of your silver mug, and here is your money for your two pints of hot, and paid me. I took the mug and set it down in the bar; then the two women were going out, and wished me a good night; the prisoner started up and said, ladies, or gentlewomen, I have drank some of your hot, I'll be my pint. Then they staid, and I made another pint in the same mug; I brought it to him myself; the two women drank 'till it was almost half out, they wish'd him and me a good night, and went away, and left him at the table with the mug before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body at that table, besides the prisoner, when they went out?</p>
               <p>Terry. No, he was all alone. In about a quarter of an hour after, he call'd me, and paid me for that pint. I was walking up and down, out of one room into another about my business, he call'd me and said, he should be oblig'd to me if I would make it hot again, for it was quite cold. I order'd my servant to warm it, and after that I saw the mug before him upon the table; by and bye I missed the prisoner, but did not think of the mug, he having paid for the liquor before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you missed the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Terry. It was about 8 o'clock, and about 9 my wife came home, and ask'd my servant where the plate was? He look'd about and said, all the tankards were right. My wife said, where are the mugs ? He look'd about, and said there was one missing; then he look'd diligently about, but could not find it; then I recollected that the mug the prisoner had drank out of, had not been seen from the time he had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the mug any mark upon it?</p>
               <p>Terry. It had two ships engraved upon it. I have two others engraved after the same manner; in the morning I acquainted the silver-smith whom I bought it of that I had lost it, and by enquiring about I found out where the prisoner at the bar lived. I went and told him I wanted that silver mug that he made a little free with last night; said he, I know nothing of the matter; I said I had never seen it from a little after the maid warmed the liquor in it; then he desired me to walk up stairs into his own room. I did, there he denied it again, and his wife and he talked together in their own language; then he said to me what is the reason you did not suspect such a one that they call My Lord? I said I believed him, to as big a thief as you; then he said to his wife go and tell My Lord, I am charged with stealing the silver mug, and said if he has got it he'll send it. I wanted her to let another person go with her, but she went alone, and came back again and said he was not at home; then I said to the prisoner you must come along with me, and took him home to my house and charged a constable with him, he seemed to be very much affrighted, there were several people in my house who told him he had better impeach; he began to be very uneasy, and said, Mr. Terry, I'll take care and send for your mug. When the constable was going by his order, he wanted to go with him, so he, his wife, the constable and I went to a house, there was nobody at home; I said I would not be trifled with, and brought him back to my house a second time; then he sent a man for the mug, who returned and brought it, and put it down on the side of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him give that man orders to go for it?</p>
               <p>Terry. I did; I heard him bid the man go to a person for the mug.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person?</p>
               <p>Terry. I don't know who that person is, I asked him if that was the person? he said, what is that to you if you have the mug again? we took him before Mr. alderman Cockayne.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself there ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250035"/>Terry. His defence he made there was this; I own I had the mug to drink out of, and I was drunk and sleepy and laid my head down to sleep, and My Lord came and took it away. The alderman said, if you was drunk and asleep, how do you know who took it away?</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean by My Lord?</p>
               <p>Terry. The man that was drinking with him in my house that evening, he joined with other company that were drinking of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they join company after that, that night.</p>
               <p>Terry. No, I never saw them speak to each other after they separated from each other.</p>

               <p>Q. After the two women were gone, had there no men been in that room besides the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Terry. Yes there had.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Terry. I believe seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any there after the prisoner went away?</p>

               <p>Terry. I have two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room the prisoner was in next the street, or backwards?</p>

            . I am constable, Mr. Terry came to my house and told me he had got a man at his house that had stole a silver mug, and he desired I'd go to his house? I did, there was the prisoner at the bar, and Mr. Terry gave me charge of him. I ordered him to go into a box and sat down by him, and asked him if he had any body to send for, or had any thing to say for himself? then he said if I would let him go home to his wife he could tell me something about the mug. I said, if you can do that, you may send for your wife, and she can bring it. Then he proposed, if I would indulge him so far as to go with him, and take two or three more with me, he would carry me to his wife, and produce the mug. I thought it would be for the benefit of Mr. Terry, if I ventured to go with him, therefore told him what the prisoner had said to me, and that if he thought proper I would take two or three men with me, and go to his house. He thought it best so to do, so I went. When we came to his house, his wife was not at home. He said he knew where to find her. We went to another place and found her, where they talk'd together in their own language.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she alone?</p>
               <p>Turney. There were a man and several women with her in the room. At last I said, I do not understand your talk, but, good woman, I am come for a silver mug that your husband has brought you, and desire you will deliver it to me. She said she knew nothing of it. Then the man that was there told me, that if I would leave one of the men there, they would bring the mug to the prosecutor's house in a quarter of an hour. So Mr. Terry and I took the prisoner to his house, and they soon brought the mug thither after us.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say about bringing the mug?</p>
               <p>Turney. I don't know what he said, but it was agreed amongst them all. It was the other Jew man that said he would answer to bring me the mug, if I would go back again with the prisoner. They had been talking in their own language, but what I did not understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner talk to the other Jew man in a language you did not understand?</p>
               <p>Turney. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after the other man said he would see it forth coming?</p>
               <p>Turney. It was before that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you got to Mr. Terry's was the mug brought?</p>
               <p>Turney. It was brought in about a quarter of an hour, or not so much ( the mug produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at this mug; do you know it ?</p>

            . I know Mr. Terry, the prosecutor. The father of the prisoner came to me and told me I should inquire into this thing, because I used Mr. Terry's house. Three of us went there, and called for a pint of hot.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. About 15 or 16 days ago. We called the prosecutor up to us, and asked him if he could swear this young man had stoln his pint mug. He said no. Then we said, Can you swear he brought it back? He said no.</p>
               <p>Court. He says the same now.</p>
               <p>Myer Abrahams. I was with the other witnesses, to hear what the prosecutor should say. He said, I can't swear this man took it, nor who brought it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I have known him from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I do not hear a bad one of him.</p>

               <p>Rosey Solomon. I have known the prisoner about eight years. I used to trust him with money and goods, and he never wrong'd me of a farthing. If he should be clear'd, I shall trust him again on Monday.</p>

I bid him to tell her, if she would sell it, to bring it to me, and I would buy it of her. This I did in order to detect her, thinking she had stoln it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mozene. This was on the 14th instant; he brought her, and I went with her to an alehouse to see it. She deliver'd it to me. I said she had stoln it, and deliver'd her to the officer of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by it?</p>
               <p>Mozene. She said she found it in Bow church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you shewn it to any body else, does any body claim it?</p>

            . I know the prisoner to be a common street-walker. Last Sunday night I met her as I was upon my duty, being a watchman. She said she wanted a piece of candle, shew'd me a watch, and said she would sell it. I went and told the warder, who bid me go to her, and tell her he would buy it; his intent being to stop it, in order to restore it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250037"/> to the right owner. I went, and she brought it. I asked her how she came by it. She said, Gentlemen, I hope you will excuse me, she - for it, and served him right too.</p>
               <p>Mr. Basden. I am constable, and was charged with this woman on the 18th instant, about a quarter after eleven at night. She had got a watch, I asked her how she came by it, and she said she found it in Bow-church-yard; it was deliver'd to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it going when you received it?</p>
               <p>Basden. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any bruises or dirt upon it?</p>
               <p>Basden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an evening was it, was it clean or dirty?</p>
               <p>Basden. I know it was a dirty evening. I took her before Mr. Alderman Hankey the next day, who order'd her back again to the compter, and directed me to advertise the watch in the Publick Advertiser, which I did three times. Last Saturday a person came and challenged it. I told him Mr. Alderman Hankey had it, in order to find out the right owner, and on Monday I went to the alderman along with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Basden. He is not here; he is gone abroad as far as I understand.</p>

The prisoner at the bar and three or four more women met with me, and haul'd me into a passage. They took a handkerchief from my neck, and three golden guineas and eight shillings from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take any thing from you?</p>
               <p>West. She took my handkerchief from my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they haul you?</p>
               <p>West. They took me by the arms; one took hold of my right arm, and the other of my left, and so hauled me into the alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Which pocket was your money in?</p>
               <p>West. It was in my left coat pocket, in a paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when they took hold of you?</p>
               <p>West. I was coming up Chick-Lane; and they took hold on me, and invited me into that place, and threatened what they would do to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How invited you?</p>
               <p>West. They took hold of me; one of one arm, and the other by the other, and ask'd me to go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Invited you in, where?</p>
               <p>West. I was ask'd to go up the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ask'd to go into a house?</p>
               <p>West. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go willingly with them?</p>
               <p>West. I went along with them as they pull'd me along, according to their directions,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with a free good-will.</p>
               <p>West. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not try to get away from them?</p>
               <p>West. I have not the proper use of my arms as another man has. I tried to get away from them as well as I could; but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out?</p>
               <p>West. I was afraid to call out.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>West. Because I was got into such an ugly place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going?</p>
               <p>West. Home, from Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>West. I live in Bridgwater-Gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>West. This was the 15th of January, about eight at night; and as soon as I was in this bye place, they began to rifle me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take your handkerchief by force?</p>
               <p>West. It was loosely tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use any threatening words to you?</p>
               <p>West. I can't say there were any great railmenting, only d - ning and swearing to one another, but not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they demand any money of you?</p>
               <p>West. They did not ask for any money; but they took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money in your pocket at the time?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Had you not drank that evening?</p>
               <p>West. I can't say I had drank nothing. I had drank part of a pint or two of beer, with a person that belong'd to the same regiment that I did, that is in the college.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know you was rob'd at the time you lost your money?</p>
               <p>West. After losing my handkerchief from my neck, I put my hand into my pocket, and found my money was gone; but I did not care to cry out in that narrow place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in that place with them?</p>
               <p>West. I believe I might be there with them about half an hour, from first to last. I can't limitate the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing all that time?</p>
               <p>West. Pulling and hauling. I can't give an account, I was so frustrated.</p>

She said, to pawn this handkerchief, and lay it in my own name, because I should fetch it again; so I went and pawn'd it for her.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Cotton. I am an <rs id="t17560225-44-viclabel251" type="occupation">attorney</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17560225-44-victim421 t17560225-44-viclabel251"/>. There is a back-door out of an entry belonging to my office, which goes into an alley, call'd Queen's-head-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is that paved yard?</p>
               <p>Cotton. It is about as wide as the breadth of this court. To the office window in that alley are double shutters, inside and out; there are also inside and outside shutters to the parlour window, that is the back parlour belonging to my house, that looks into the yard. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, the 3d and 4th of this instant, and between 2 and 3 in the morning, my wife awak'd me, and told me she heard some uncommon noise. A lady being sick at the next door, I imagined it was somebody up with her; presently I heard it, and upon sitting up in my bed, I heard somebody walk below stairs, but still thought it was in the next house. I got up, and went out of my chamber into the next, which was the back room that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250039"/> looks out into my yard; my wife also went with me. I threw up the sash to look into my neighbour's yard, upon which a man jump'd out of my window into the yard; I rather say I heard than saw him, it was so dark. I heard him run across my yard into the clerks office, and at the same time I heard another person in the office very plain; I call'd out watch, but was not heard by any body. Some time after the watchman came his rounds, and I call'd him, and went down stairs. The first thing that I observed was, the back parlour door was open, and the watchman and I went in there; the sash was quite up that looks into the pav'd yard, and the outside and inside shutters cut; the outside shutter had a pannel cut out about the middle, and the inside shutter had a pannel cut out at bottom; the reason of which appear'd to be, that the bolt on the outside was in the middle, and the inside one fastened at the bottom. I have two beaufets in the two parlours, in which the plate was when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these parlours situated?</p>
               <p>Cotton. One looks out into Red-Lion-Street, and the other backwards into my pav'd yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person get out of one parlour into the other?</p>
               <p>Cotton. They might, the sash door between them was not lock'd. I found the beaufets stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Cotton. I lost a silver coffee-pot, a pair of silver candlesticks, a silver pint mug, two half pint silver mugs, a large silver salver, two small ones, a silver milk-pot, a silver handle knife and fork gilt, a shagreen case, seven tea-spoons, one table spoon, tongs and strainer, a tea-chest with three tin canisters in it, two silver saltcellers, two salt shovels, one silver pepper-box and one punch-ladle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these taken out of the beaufets ?</p>
               <p>Cotton. They were; then we went a-cross the yard into the clerks office, for the door that came out of that entry into the pav'd yard was not fastened that night, and we seldom do fasten it; I found in the office one of the windows broke open in the same manner the other shutters were; the outside shutter of the window that looks into Queen's-head-alley, had a small piece cut off, in order to reach the bolt; the inside shutter had a pannel cut through, so as to put in a hand and lift up the bar; that sash I found wide open; I found the three desks of my clerks every one of them broke open and the papers tumbled about, but could not find any thing was taken away. I went from thence into the house and into my own study, which is even with the parlour, where I have a row of presses for papers with drawers under them; the first of these presses and that alone, I found broke open, and likewise a drawer under a table upon which I write, but the others were not touch'd; in these two drawers I sometimes had kept money, and the prisoner Robert had been an errand-boy to me about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he go away?</p>
               <p>Cotton. I think it was in October last that he went away; I knew he had seen me take money out of that first drawer, and I don't know that any person in the world, out of my own house, ever did; this with his being advertised for robbing another gentleman, occasioned me to take him up upon suspicion. One thing I ought to have mention'd before: In the morning when I came down, in my parlour window I found this knife, (producing a sort of a Dutch knife with the edge back'd into a saw. )</p>
               <p>Q. Which parlour window did you find it in?</p>

               <p>Cotton. THE window that the persons got in at out of the pav'd yard. It is a very remarkable knife with an inscription upon it, and the sheath was found by my servant, who will give the court an account of it when she is called. I took him up, and upon his being examined before justice Manwaring, the day before the fast, I thought proper to have him search'd, but nothing belonging to me was found; this knife was shewn him there, he denied he ever saw it in his life before: afterwards his mother was called in as a witness to prove where he was at the time the robbery was committed, and when this knife was produced to her, being ask'd if she knew that knife? she said immediately, that knife is my son's knife, I'll swear it (imagining, I believe, it had been taken out of his pocket with the other things of his that lay upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner Robert then ?</p>
               <p>Cotton. He was not then in the room; she had named two sons, but had not said which son owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the two prisoners brothers?</p>
               <p>Cotton. They are; she was asked which son owned the knife? and she said really I can't tell which son, for they both of them claim it, sometimes one says it is his, and sometimes the other says it his; for it was given or sold to them by an acquaintance of theirs, as they told her. After that

             the elder was called in to give an account where his brother was that night; he came as a witness for his brothers; the justice then shew'd him this knife, but he likewise denied having ever seen it in his life before. Upon that the justice called in his mother again, and bid him not speak a word till he had asked him a question; then the justice said, before his mother, do you know this knife ? he said no, I never saw it before. The mother said, why John you know it is your knife, but he still denied it. Upon this suspicion the justice sent both the prisoners to the watch-house than night; the next day, which was the fast day, after service was over in the evening, the justice had them before him again; the youngest was brought in first and was again shew'd this knife, and asked if he would own it? he said no, he never saw it till the night before. The justice said to him, why your mother owned it last night before many people to be your knife. Yes, said he, my mother was affrighted then, and did not know what she said; but if you'll please to call her in, she has got the knife in her pocket that she mistook for this knife; the justice said he would call her in by and by, and accordingly he sent him out and called the mother in; then he asked her again, and shewed her the knife, whether that was her son's knife? she then said no, it was not: the justice said, you said it was his knife many times over last night. I did so, said she, but I was affrighted; she produced another knife, and said this is the knife that I mistook for that last night. (Produced in court a sheath knife, but it had no resemblance to the other.) The justice took it of her, laid it down and sent her out, and sent for the prisoner Robert in, an d asked him whether he would own the knife or not? he said, no; I told you my mother had that knife she mistook for this in her pocket, if you please to call her in. The justice said, he would call her in presently; then he took up a knife and said, is it like this? he said no, then he took up the knife his mother produced and said, is it like this? he said no, that knife is not so long as the blade of this.</p>
               <p>After that some people were called in to his character, and some to prove him elsewhere at the time; but they varied in most of the facts, so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250042"/> that when they come to be called I beg they may be examined separately, for there were not two of them that said the same thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever met with your goods, or any of them again?</p>
               <p>Cotton. No, I have not, I advertised them, and got papers from goldsmiths hall distributed about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners own anything?</p>
               <p>Cotton. No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. from Robert. Was there not a mistake about the knife? the justice shewed me all those knives, I said none of them was like it; I said it was a little knife not like any of these; this knife he has here is not the knife shewn to me before the justice.</p>
               <p>Cotton. This is the very knife that was produced by the mother, which he denied to be his knife; I now recollect another thing; when she produced this knife, the justice said, but you said you wou'd swear to the sheath as well as the knife. She, upon the sheath being shewn her, said her son's knife had exactly such a sheath, and he always wore it with such a sheath; that it was of that colour and that kind; but Robert said, when he was asked about the sheath, that he did not wear his knife in a sheath, and mentioned his once falling down and cutting his thigh by reason it was without a sheath, and said he wore it in his breeches pocket. The fastening of my house was very particular, I know it could not be broke open in the manner it was (being broke on the outside and inside shutter exactly where the fastenings were) but by a person that had lived in my house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cotton, when we came down in the morning we found the house broke open, and when I went to bed the doors and windows were all fast, and the things all in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>J. Jobson. I did not go to bed till after master and mistress were in bed, and that was between 12 and 1 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In which room do you lie?</p>
               <p>J. Jobson. I lie up three pair of stairs forwards</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>J. Jobson. I was when Mrs. Wilson own'd the knife to be her son Robert's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him brought in?</p>
               <p>J. Jobson. I did; he denied it. When I was cleaning the stove in the back parlour, I found the sheath that belongs to that knife my master found.</p>
               <p>Street Arnot. I am clerk to Mr. Cotton, I heard the examination before the justice.</p>

               <p>Arnot. I know no more; I took the prisoner Robert, he seemed to be under a good deal of concern of mind.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him?</p>
               <p>Arnot. The Thursday after our house was broke open; when I met with him I asked him if he had heard master had been rob'd? he said no, and pretended a good deal of ignorance, but seemed very uneasy; we went to a public house and I call'd for a news paper and read it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. from Robert. Whether or not you did not tell me, Mr. Cotton saw three or four persons run cross the yard?</p>
               <p>Arnot. No, I did not; I told him Mr. Cotton saw one person run cross the yard.</p>

On the Sunday night the robbery was committed I went to Nortonfalgate, at seven at night; my husband was sick, so I left the key with the prisoner's mother; when I came home it wanted ten minutes of one o'clock, I knock'd at her door and her sister got up and let me in, I said, don't be angry, I'm sorry to give you this trouble.

            , on the 24th of last January, in Hillandon. I am a cooper, and had been carrying some work home, and coming back I met with the boy, playing with this ring upon his finger, he was turning it round; I ask'd him what he was going to do with that ring; he said he was going to sell it. I ask'd him what he would have for it; he said a penny, or any thing I would give him, and added, he had not had any victuals for two or three days past. I carried him to one Mr. Clark who deals in such things, whose wife said it was a gold ring; then I took the boy and the ring down to Uxbridge. He desired me not to carry him to the overseers, for fear they should lay hold on him. Then I took him to the Three Tuns, next door to my shop, where we found him in several stories; at first he said he had it of a lad in James's-Street; afterwards he said he had it of a lad at Ealing; at last he owned he took the ring out of the waggon: on Wednesday I advertised the ring, but heard no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he threatned?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. He was, the landlord of the inn talk'd to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with the prisoner Hodges.</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. The prisoner Edward Peass said, he sold one ring to the prisoner Hodges; Hodges said he had it as a pledge, and sent for his book, and said it was set down as such: Edward Peass said before the Justice, he did not think any thing of this, or he would not have been concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hodges say before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. The Justice asked him how he came by the ring; he said 
               <persName id="t17560225-45-person439">

             the father let him have it as a pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hodges mention the time when it was pledged?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. He did, but I don't remember the time particularly.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hodges come voluntarily before the justice, without a warrant?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250044"/>Cowdrey. He had no warrant as I know of; I did not ask him, or concern myself with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he freely come before the justice?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. He did, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned Hodges bringing the book, and that it was set down as a pledge; did you not?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. He said so, I did not look in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hodges come to clear himself, and he an evidence against any body that had stole the ring ?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. I suppose so.</p>

I brought it down in the morning, and wrapt it in my handkerchief; I had a sort of a lemon basket in the waggon; I put it into that basket with my handkerchief about it, and then tied the basket up, and tied it to the side of the waggon between two bundles of flax. I set out about three in the morning, and going along on this side Chevy-Chase, the strait road to Uxbridge, about 9 o'clock in the morning I met the boy,

            ; he desired me to let him ride in the waggon, for he had been five miles that morning, and was tired.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the prisoner come?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. He came out of a lane's end. He offered me a penny or a pot of beer when we came to Uxbridge. I took him in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the waggon at that time?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. There was nobody else there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these bundles of flax?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. About a yard off from the tail of the waggon. As I was going up Hillandon Common, he said I might have the pot of beer at a house there, and we had it; he said, do you pay for it, and I'll pay you at the Half-way House. Presently the boy came out of the waggon and walked forwards, and I lost sight of him; I called at the Half-way House, and asked if they had seen such a boy; they said no, and I never saw him since 'till now.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your packet?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. At one o'clock the next morning. I asked the maid to lend me a lanthorn and candle to put my boots in the waggon, and there I saw the box lay and no paper about it, at the tail of the waggon; another box had the string cut, and the lid half off and half on: we searched the box and found nothing in it; the handkerchief I wrapt it in was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was in the box?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of those rings here?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. I have not; nor ever saw the rings, nor know what was in the box. I brought the empty box and the paper home to my master, and he found out who they belonged to (the box produced by Mr. Russel ) this is the same box I found in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you went from Hillandon 'till you met with the boy, did nobody get into the waggon?</p>
               <p>Sharrad. Nobody at all. I got into Beconsfield about 5 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the waggon put?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250045"/>Sharrad. In the street under the sign-post, where it is usually put.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the waggon belong to?</p>

               <p>Mr. Manning. I am master of the Bull and Mouth Inn. After the boy was taken up, I went with Mr. Dupea and took a warrant from justice Blincoe. We asked the boy several questions, he said he found the rings; I went into a little room, and asked the boy whether he could give me an account where any part of the rings were; he said, as he was walking between Southwell and Hanwell, he met a waggon, and that the waggoner asked him to drive while he went into the waggon to sleep, he said he drove the waggon for two miles, and that there was in the waggon at that time one

             took this small box out of a box on the side of the waggon, that he thought it was a box of apothecary's stuff, and Harris put it in again; then he took it out and opened it, and told the waggoner there were eight rings in it, and that the waggoner made him reply and said, you dog I know that: then he said, the waggoner and he agreed to share them, that he had five and the waggoner three. I said, how came the waggoner to have but three and you five? He said, the waggoner put his hand in and pulled out a brass case, and in that was a silver tooth-picker, and that the waggoner had that. I asked him what he did with the five rings; he said he sold one to a baker, that was driving a cart between Acton and the George alehouse; another to a milk-woman between justice Fielding's country house and Acton; he said, one was stopt from him; and the other, says he, I gave to my father, and he has told me he sold it for half a crown. I found all the rings where the boy told me he sold them; one of the rings I saw was No. 7, another No. 4, he said one he sold for three-halfpence, one for a shilling and a pint of beer, and another for sixpence. I sent and took up the father, he denied it at first; but afterwards he said he sold it to a pawnbroker for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you his name?</p>
               <p>Manning. Yes, he did, he said his name was Hodges. When I sent to take him up, he said he had it as a pledge for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>Manning. I was. The justice asked the father whether he asked the son how he came by the ring, the father said he did not; then he asked the pawnbroker whether he asked the father how he came by it, he said he did not; said the justice, did you not see it advertised? he said he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first make enquiry after the rings?</p>
               <p>Manning. It was on the 11th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cowdrey. Did you know this boy before ?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. He was put out by the parish of Uxbridge apprentice in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how old the boy is ?</p>
               <p>Cowdrey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Manning. Do you know Hodges?</p>
               <p>Manning. I do. He sells plate, and old cloaths, and several things; he had a book, which he shewed to the justice.</p>
               <p>Council for Prisoner. Does he not take in pledges?</p>
               <p>Manning. It is wrote so over his door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten him, or promise him he should not suffer if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Manning. I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce his book?</p>
               <p>Manning. He did. It was set down as a pledge in his book, but quite a different date to what the man said who sold it.</p>

               <p>There was another boy in the waggon, that had a hand in it along with me.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the matter, but my son brought me a ring, and said he found it; I charged him strictly with it.</p>
               <p>Hodges's defence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought the ring to me, and pledged it for half a crown; afterwards he came again for more money, I said I never lent money a second time.

I was got just between the shoemaker's shop and the iron gate, when a man came up and laid hold of my breast. I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted my money; I told him I would not give him any; I put out my arm to lay hold of him, he step'd back and made two or three chops at me, but it being dark, I could not see what it was with; it went through the sleeves of my coat and waistcoat of the left arm and wounded my hand; (be shew'd the cuts in the coat, a little above the elbow) I held up my stick and defended myself, he ran away, I called, watch, watch, watch, stop thief; the first watchman came and said, he saw nobody pass along that way; the man was out of my fight in half a minute; there came another watchman, he went towards the rails, and close by the rails he saw a man lying upon his face; by that time there were three or four watchmen came; they took the man up and brought him to me, and asked me if that was the man that had attempted to rob me?

               <p>Kelley. My lord, I said to the constable, and also before the justice, I rather thought that was not the man; I think the man that assaulted me was of a larger size.</p>

            . I am a watchman: On that Monday morning, about a quarter before one o'clock, there was an outcry of stop thief, I stood with my staff in my hand at the middle box in Lincoln's-inn-fields by the wall, when the prosecutor came and said, have you got him? I said I had not, nor no man had passed by me. I heard a foot cross the coach way towards the rails, I went up to the rails, and about 5 yards from the place there lay the prisoner on his face upon the ground, almost over against my box.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the rails did he lie?</p>
               <p>Mannor. He lay close to the stonework on which the rails are fix'd, his nose was dirty and his hands spread out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were his cloaths clean?</p>
               <p>Mannor. His coat and waistcoat were quite clean. I called out, here lies a man; there were 5 men came to me; I took the prisoner up by the right arm, and said bollo, what do you do here? he seem'd to be a little in liquor; I searched him, there was nothing upon him but a razor without a case (it was shut) in the side pocket of his breeches, and a corkskrew.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood upon it?</p>
               <p>Mannor. Not any that I saw. After that I examined him; he said he came from the White-horse, but where he could not tell. We went up to the White-horse near Whetstone-park, he said that was not the house, but one Donnolly kept the house where he came from; then we carried him to the watch-house, that is all I know of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I sat about 40 or 45 yards from where the prosecutor was attacked; I heard him cry, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your box?</p>
               <p>Folk. It is against the dead wall; I saw a man run by me towards the highway.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you see him run?</p>
               <p>Folk. I might see him run about 10 yards, I pursued him side by side, till he went farther off towards the rails, then I went back to fetch my lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure you saw him running beyond the corner of the rails, so that he could not turn up towards the Duke of Newcastle's.</p>
               <p>Folk. I did; he could not turn up that way, being got too far down. I went again to the spot of ground, and there my partner cry'd out here he is; but I did not come to him till the prisoner was taken up. We searched him, and found a corkscrew in his breeches pocket, and this rasor in his side pocket in his breeches (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood on it?</p>
               <p>Folk. I can't say there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner fuddled?</p>
               <p>Folk. He appear'd stupified; he could not tell where he was. I believe he was no ways in liquor, only frighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I got leave of my master to go out about two o'clock, and went to drinking with an acquaintance. I went with him to lie at his lodgings, but they were all in bed; then I came back to go to lay with my brother, in Holbourn. I remember I fell once, and was taken up by the watchman; but did not know where I was; and when I awaked in the Round-house I could not tell where I was.</p>

            . I know all the prisoners very well; I have been acquainted with Berry, I believe eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Macdaniel ?</p>
               <p>Blee. About two years; and I have known the others a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at any meeting when there was a consultation about doing this fact?</p>
               <p>Blee. Yes, I was present at many meetings on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Court. Begin with the first.</p>
               <p>Blee. Berry said to me one morning the latter end of June, or the beginning of July was twelve-month: My Lord ( a nick name they gave me) money grows a little short, if you can't get two men, you must get one, to go upon the scamp. He sent me for Macdaniel, and he said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Blee. In Berry's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they mean by going on the scamp ?</p>
               <p>Blee. That is, to go upon the highway, to hang them for the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to that?</p>
               <p>Blee. I said I did not chuse to be concerned in this affair, because Kidden's  affair was so bad.* Macdaniel made answer and said, G - d d - n you, if you don't, it shall be the worse for you; the next day Berry sent me down to Macdaniel's house, and order'd me to come to the stable. I was afraid of Mr. Price, he having a warrant against me on Kidden's affair. They sent me then into the Spa fields, and came to me there. We went into the fields several days, to look out for a lad of two, but could light of none fit to do the job, as they call'd it.</p>

            , a porter, No. 129, in Mr. alderman Rawlinson's mayoralty; compare that with No. 30 in the same mayoralty; and 140 in Mr. alderman Winterbottom's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went there with you?</p>
               <p>Blee. Only Berry and Macdaniel. On the 15th of July, I remember it very well to be on a Monday, Berry sent me to Macdaniel's house to get him to come to him. Then he order'd me to go into the Spa fields, and sit upon a hill. I went, and believe I sat there two hours, to see for a man or two. Macdaniel came to me, and said Tom, there are Mr. Berry and Salmon the breeches-maker coming to Sir John Oldcastle's. I went down there along with him, to the farthest arbour on the left-hand, where sat Berry and Salmon; they bid me sit down, and drink some beer along with them. There we had some discourse about where the robbery should be committed; one said on this side New-Cross turnpike. Macdaniel said, d - n you, it had better be near Blackheath. Berry said that will be too far off; suppose it be near the four-mile stone (there the robbery was committed.)</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did they give that it should be done in that particular spot?</p>
               <p>Blee. For the reward given by the parish of Deptford; they did it for the reward, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all three agree to that ?</p>
               <p>Blee. They did; at that time Berry said we must have one for the fence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by the word fence ?</p>
               <p>Blee. That is, for a person to buy the goods after Salmon was rob'd of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they agree he should be the person to be rob'd?</p>
               <p>Blee. They all did agree to that, and that Eagan should be the fence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Salmon agree to be rob'd?</p>
               <p>Blee. He did. Then they talk'd about a handkerchief of Macdaniel's, for Salmon to be rob'd of. Macdaniel said it would do very well. Salmon said I have a better than that; I have one that is mark'd with four holes, a hole at each corner. This was to put the things into, that they could swear to; and he said he would make two pair of breeches, and mark them under the pocket with I S and a figure of 4, that he might swear to them again. Then they talk'd about having a halfpenny mark'd. Macdaniel said he had a pocket-piece ( that his wife bought for three-pence and a halfpenny worth of gin) which was agreed upon, and mark'd by Eagan afterwards, because they should swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with that pocket-piece ?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was to be given to Salmon the breeches-maker to be rob'd of. Then Macdaniel said he had got a tobacco-box, a very particular one (I believe I have fetched fifty halfpenny-worths of tobacco in it for him.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250049"/>Q. What was to be done with that tobacco-box?</p>
               <p>Blee. That was to be given to Salmon, that he might be rob'd of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else agreed upon there?</p>
               <p>Blee. There was a knife and fork, that he might be rob'd of also. This was all that pass'd at Sir John Oldcastle's. Then Berry told me to go about my business; and said he would let Eagan know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live then?</p>
               <p>Blee. I lay in Berry's hay-loft then; because my money was gone that I had on the affair of Kidden (who was hang'd wrongfully) he turn'd me out of his house into his hay-loft. The next morning Berry call'd me in, and said he had been at Eagan's, and he had agreed to be the sence. Then he bid me meet him at the Bell in Holbourn. I went there, and found them all four together, Macdaniel, Berry, Eagan, and Salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Blee. I believe it was about three or four days after he had told me Eagan would be the sence?</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the only meeting they were all four together at?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was. We agreed then to get two people to go upon the scamp, or highway; and if we could not get two, to get one. Berry said there would be twenty pounds a piece (he always paid the money.) Macdaniel never had any money but what his wife gave him at a shilling a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the business talk'd over there?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was, and that Salmon should be the person to be rob'd, and Eagan the fence; and that it should be committed between Newcross turnpike and the four-mile stone; because there was money given by the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this agreed upon by you all five?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pocket-piece mention'd?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was; and that it should be mark'd by Eagan with a tool (I saw that bought.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the man at the Bell's name?</p>
               <p>Blee. His name is Hunter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in pursuance of this consultation procure any body?</p>
               <p>Blee. I did.

            . I had orders from Berry to tell them I knew where to get a brave parcel of lullies, if they would go with me down to Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by lullies ?</p>
               <p>Blee. That is a word used for linen. I meant to steal some linen.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you told the prisoners you had met with these two young men?</p>
               <p>Blee. I can't justly tell the day of the month; but it was mention'd several times.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason was you to tell them of getting a parcel of lullies?</p>
               <p>Blee. I knew them to be lads of very bad life; but I mention'd it to get them to go along with me to commit this robbery on Salmon; they did not know any thing of that robbery being to be committed. I know, the first time I told Berry and Macdaniel I had got these two lads, was on a Monday; the next day was Tuesday the 23d, when the white regiment marched; they bid me go to the Artillery-Ground, and take the boys with me there; where Macdaniel and Berry saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all four see the boys?</p>
               <p>Blee. They did. Eagan went from Macdaniel's house to the Fleet-Market on purpose to see them, and he approved of them. When Berry and Macdaniel had seen them in the Artillery-Ground, I said to Berry, do you think they will do? He said yes, Newman and March were less than they. (See their trial in No. 496 and 497 in Mr. alderman Cockayne's mayoralty.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who were March and Newman?</p>
               <p>Blee. They were persons that they had hang'd. Macdaniel said I have done less than they over at Kingston.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by doing them over?</p>
               <p>Blee. He meant hanging them.</p>
               <p>Macdaniel. Now he knows he is telling a lye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all approve of the two boys?</p>
               <p>Blee. They did. Berry gave me money to treat the boys after they were approved of?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing?</p>
               <p>Blee. I think on the 29th of July I met Berry at the Plumb-tree alehouse: he gave me 2 s. 6 d. in silver, and a half-crown piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the others by at the time?</p>
               <p>Blee. There were Macdaniel and Salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you that money for?</p>
               <p>Blee. Berry said, d - n you, my lord, go and flash this to them, and tell them you got this last night by a brave parcel of lullies. I was to shew it all at once, and to tell them I was to go to the sence for more. I went with them to Little Britain, and gave them some bread and cheese. I then left them, and said I'd soon return. I went then to Berry, Macdaniel, and Salmon, who were all three together. I said you must meet me at such a place; Berry said where? I said at the Bell, in the Borough. Then I return'd to the boys, and took them round Tower-Hill, to delay the time, till Berry could get there. I went in at the Bell, and gave the boys a halfpenny worth of gin each;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250050"/> there sat Berry. As we were coming out of the door Kelly said G - d d n you, there is that old thief-catching son of a b - ch, your master. I said I don't belong to him now; let us go on. I then bought a breast of lamb for breakfast. Berry the Saturday before had given me 6 d. to go and pick a house out, where to bring them to after we had done the robbery, that they might be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it agreed that Eagan should be the fence at all the places where you talk'd of it?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was; and he had notice of it, and where to meet.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>

               <p>Blee. Because I met him in Hatton-Garden, and he told me of it; and gave me a halfpenny to buy me a dram at the White-Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house you had before pick'd out?</p>
               <p>Blee. We did, and drank pretty heartily; then we went into the fields, because it was too soon to do the job. Berry had ordered me to go to the sign of the Ship at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it any part of the agreement where Salmon should be?</p>
               <p>Blee. I was to meet Salmon at the sign of the Ship, he was to come in accidentlly; they all knew of it, and agreed upon it. When I and the boys went to the Ship, neither Berry nor Salmon were there; we drank part of a pint of beer, and then I said I had got a relation in the town that I must go and see. I went out and saw Berry, he call'd me, and he and I went to a publick house, I think it was the Duke William's Head; he gave me part of a pint of beer, and said, go over to the Ship, Salmon shall come to you presently. I went and said to Kelly and Ellis, we may as well go in; they were sitting at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was about the dusk of the evening, I can't justly say to the hour. After we had eat some bread and cheese, Salmon came in with a blue and white handkerchief and a bundle in it (I knew what was in it) he clap'd himself with his back against the dresser (I also then knew the tobacco-box was in his pocket, and the money in it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other company in the house?</p>
               <p>Blee. There were several other people there. Salmon called for a pint of beer, and talked as if he had been to Deptford Yard; (it had been before agreed upon, for him to say he had been there with some breeches) then he said he was going to London (he was to say so.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was you to take any notice of him?</p>
               <p>Blee. No, I was not. About 5 or 6 minutes after this, Berry came by and look'd in at the window, and nodded his head to me. I went out with a pretence to make water; he said, d - n you, when Salmon comes out do you follow him. I went in and asked what was to pay, and paid it, and gave the boys a quartern of gin; (Berry told me afterwards, he lay behind the four-milestone and saw Salmon rob'd.) We followed Salmon as Berry ordered me, and as Salmon was making water Kelly said, G - d d - n me, there is that old son of a bitch the old breeches maker; his son and I have been picking pockets together many a time, let's scamp the old son of a bitch. I walked up to him; he said here, take the handkerchief, and gave it me, and I gave it to Kelly, and Kelly gave it to Ellis; Salmon said, what I have is in my left-hand pocket, Kelly took it out, it was in a tobacco-box, and he took out a knife and fork also and put the tobacco-box in his pocket; then away we walked very coolly to the Turnpike, there were several people coming backwards and forwards; then we went to Kent-Street. Berry gave me sixpence before to pay for my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you knew that tobacco-box before?</p>
               <p>Blee. I have seen it I believe a thousand times; the unicorn has got never a horn upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Blee. I believe I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the pocket-piece?</p>
               <p>Blee. I believe I can; I have never seen them since I was here last.</p>
               <p>Q. To what place was you to come that night?</p>
               <p>Blee. I was to come to the Black Spread-Eagle, but we were to lie at a woman's house in the neighbourhood. They appointed me to come to the White Bear in the same street; I went there, and there sat Berry and Salmon; says

             - d d - n that son of a bitch Mack, he is not come yet, you must turn back again, and Eagan shall go along with you. I went, and Eagan followed me; I said, I must buy something for breakfast, so I went and bought a lamb's liver, and said to him, do you go on (he knew where to go as well as I could tell him.)</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business?</p>
               <p>Blee. He went on purpose to buy the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it agreed amongst you all that you should take the boys there?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was. I brought in the liver and began to cut it, and said to Kelly, may be that man will buy the breeches, for he deals at Rag-fair (but he is a cobler.) Then I said to him, my friend will you buy two pair of breeches? Eagan said, what do you ask for them? I said 6 s. said he I'll give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250051"/> you 5 s. said Kelly he shall have them; then said Egan, my wife has not been here and I have not got any more money. I said, will you stay and eat a bit with us? Then he said (as we had agreed before) landlord, let me have a half-penny worth of tobacco; and felt in his pocket, and said I have lost my box. I said to Kelly, let us sell him the box; no, said Kelly, I had rather ding it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by ding it?</p>
               <p>Blee. That is, fling it away. Then said Kelly I'll sell you a tobacco box, and shewed it to him; Eagan said what do you ask for it? Kelly said 6 d. said Egan, I'll give you a pot of twopenny; well said I, you shall have it. We then played at a game called the devil and taylors, and I went out under pretence to get shaved and left them at play, and went to the White Bear. Berry and Salmon were gone; then Eagan came and called me into the Elephant and Castle, and said where is your great coat? I said I left that in the house; he said Macdaniel is come, and bid me be quick and fetch it. I went and took my great coat, and said I'll go and get shaved, and away I went down from the Black Spread Eagle to the Elephant and Castle; there was Berry, who said, get away as fast as you can to the Bell in the Borough, but be sure you get shaved as you go along. Berry came in and said D - n you, the job is done Tom, now you'll get 20 l. by this. Then we went over London Bridge, and into Paul's Church yard; where I saw Mr. Rogers. Berry said go along, don't let us be seen together.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boys?</p>
               <p>Blee. They sent me out of the way, fearing they would squeak against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken?</p>
               <p>Blee. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them after this?</p>
               <p>Blee. I never saw them after 'till I saw them at Maidstone. I know the prisoners intended to hang them for the reward, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this tobacco-box. (It is put into his hand.)</p>
               <p>Blee. This is the same box that I fetched tobacco in for Macdaniel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this medal. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Blee. I believe this to be the same; this, Macdaniel's company-keeper bought at the Two Blue-Posts in Holbourn. After this, Berry lent me 1 s. 6 d. to go to Uxbridge fair, because I should not be taken: If I had been taken Salmon was to swear I was not the man, and that he never saw me in his life time (and I suppose he'll say now he never saw me.) When I came back from the fair, Berry told me there had been three or four men to look after me, I believe Mr. Cox was one, but Berry said d - n it Tom you need not be afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you apprehended ?</p>
               <p>Blee. I was, in Newgate-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you up?</p>
               <p>Blee. Mr. Cox and Mr. Warrin, of Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time of your discovering this affair?</p>
               <p>Blee. It was. They met me and ask'd me if my name was Blee; I said no, my name is Lee; said they, you are the man we want: I said don't make many words, when we get to a proper place we'll talk about it; and I told them it of my own good will.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you met Berry in the Borough when the boys were taken, 'till such time you were to go down to the assizes; how often had you been in company with Berry and Macdaniel.</p>
               <p>Blee. Several times; they told me I need not be afraid of any thing, for if I was taken Salmon would swear I was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this handkerchief. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Blee. This is the same handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Blee. These are the two pair of breeches that Salmon mark'd and took with him, on purpose to be robbed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this knife and fork. (They were clasp ones that book'd together in the hasts.)</p>
               <p>Blee. These are the same. The fork was dropped in the house where they were taken, and the drummer found it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. from Berry. He says he came to my house in June, to go into Cold-Bath-Fields; ask him whether he dared to come into the yard, when there had been two robberies committed in the yard; one by robbing two coaches of the brass, and another for running away with a man's money; and whether there was not a warrant against him.</p>
               <p>Blee. Here are several people can prove I was there then. There was a warrant against me, Berry's son, and himself; one Mr. Price had got it for stealing some bullions out of a coach, but then they had one to take me upon Kidden's affair, and Berry concealed me in his own house.</p>
               <p>Berry. He had robbed the Foundling-house, and there were three warrants against him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250052"/>Eagan. I know Berry was not at the taking of the prisoners in Kent-Street.</p>
               <p>Salmon. I never was in a house with Blee in my life, or ever drank with him; if any person can say I ever was in a house with him, or drank with him, I'll be hang'd up directly.</p>

            . I know all the prisoners. The robbery was committed on Salmon the 29th of July, 1754. Salmon, Eagan and Macdaniel came to Greenwich and enqured for a constable; they brought the two boys Ellis and Kelly; there were two pair of leather breeches mark'd I. S. and a figure of 4 under the right hand pocket. I was constable; they said Ellis and Kelly had robbed Salmon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they all agree in that story?</p>
               <p>Sergant. They did all agree in it, and the things were produced before justice Bell; the justice gave them into my hand, and desired I would seal them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced them before the justice?</p>
               <p>Sergant. One of the three did, but I can't say which.</p>
               <p>Q. What things were there?</p>
               <p>Sergant. There were two pair of breeches, a tobacco box, a clasp knife, but no fork (that was produced afterwards) and a piece of money as big as a shilling, and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this box. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Sergant. This is the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this piece of money.</p>
               <p>Sergant. This is the same piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the breeches.</p>
               <p>Sergant. They are the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this knife.</p>
               <p>Sergant. It is the same knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the handkerchief. (The handkerchief had four holes in it, two at each corner.) He looks at it.</p>
               <p>Sergant. This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the two boys?</p>
               <p>Sergant. They were committed, and I carried them to Maidstone jail. Upon the road going along they told me there was one concerned in the robbery with them named Blee. Mackdaniel told me, as I was but a young constable he should take the money for their conviction and he'd pay me my money. Berry said at the assizes, if Ellis and Kelly were not convicted, he must beg his way home, and if they were convicted, we should have a goose for supper that night. He had no business there as I know of, only he was afraid his partners would cheat him.</p>
               <p>There were several other witnesses ready in court to be called, but these having confirmed Blee in every thing, it was looked upon as needless to call any more.</p>
               <p>Berry's defence.</p>
               <p>This Blee never dared to come into my yard at any rate; had I been in Kent-street at the time the boys were there, why should we go so far back as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175602250054"/> to the Bell? what they have sworn against me is entirely false, as I hope to enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>Mackdaniel's defence.</p>
               <p>I have sent to the Bell at Holbourn to desire the man of the house to come, the people said they never saw us all three in their lives; I sent for all the servants to come into Newgate among the smuglers, they all declared they never saw any of us there in their lives. The maid at the Cherry-tree said, at the last trial, she never saw me there in her life. I happen'd to have the misfortune to bail a man for 200 l. who ran away to Dunkirk, they came and broke open my door, they fired, at me but missed me, one of them was so eager to get at me that he shot
