I live at No.39, and was going to get some necessaries for the children's supper; I was on the top step, I had not been there five minutes before Mr. Pearce, or Benton, or whatever his name is, came out of No. 38, with a loose coat upon his left arm, and he passed me, and went into the road, and took a pistol out, and fired at me immediately, I had not time to say, Lord have mercy on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No; I had no acquaintance with him, only with a girl of the town that he cohabited with, and his landlady was this girl's aunt; I never gave him an angry word.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of the shooting? - A. My scull was shattered to pieces; I was taken up for dead, and was taken to the hospital.</p>

            It was as he passed me; if I was never to draw another breath, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was there to enable you to see him? - A. There was a light in the passage, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>JAMES MASH sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing about this transaction? - A. Yes, I saw the whole of it; I was standing at my own door; I live at No.39, Eagle-street, the same door where the accident happened; I was within five yards, or five yards and a half of the woman, when she was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-1-person30">A. </persName>

               <p>Q. Did you see the man who fired? - A. Yes; it was a pistol fired by a man unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. He had on either a white or a light jacket, I am not sure, like a pastry-cook or baker; I was not more than three yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do after he had fired the pistol? - A. He walked for a little way as men generally do, and then ran.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that like the man? - A. No, no more than I am, nor yet a bit like the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you happen to know the time to be ten minutes after nine? - A. The watch did not set till nine o'clock; there are at least thirty watchmen to call over, and they do not call the roll over till nine, and the watch was then set.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men in the street? - A. No; no man standing near, nor woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the woman at the time? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-1-person31">A. </persName>
            Standing upon the step.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pistol which this man had? - A. He seemed to carry it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman wounded - did she fall down? - A. No, she stood equally the same, only she held her silence, before that, she was singing and swearing, and intoxicated, as she had been all day.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FELLOWS sworn. - I am a watchman in Eagle-street: On the 6th of October, I saw the woman about a quarter before nine, as I was going to the watch-house, at her own door; she was upon the top step but one of the cellar; she was very much intoxicated, and had a great mob of men, women, and children about her; she had a pint of beer three parts full, and I begged her to go into the cellar; she sells oysters, and garden stuff, and fruit; I have known the woman for some time about ten minutes after nine, or a quarter of an hour, I had lit my candle, and was going upon my beat; I was called, and saw the woman had been shot; between ten minutes and a quarter after nine, I helped her into a coach; it was the night before the general illumination; there were a great many guns and pistols firing about in all directions.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. Yes; then I went with her to Mrs. Brown's; we went up stairs, and I laid down upon the bed; she asked me for sixpence, which I gave her, and then I fell asleep; Mrs. Brown's son came up to me, waked me, and asked me, if I had lost any thing; I told him, I did not know; the first thing I felt for was my watch, and I missed it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to put your hand to the chain? - A. I commonly do when I lay down any where; when I missed it, I went down stairs, and the prisoner was there; Mrs. Brown said to her, I am sure you have got the property, she said, she had not it, and Mrs. Brown said she would have her searched; I sent for a brother tradesman of mine, and my wife happened to be there; she, came and I sent my wife for an officer, and while she was gone, the prisoner put her hand in her bosom, and said, here is your watch, take it; I said, no, it is too late, there is an officer sent for; she then put it upon the hob in the fire-place, and said, who can hurt me, if the property is not found upon me; a little while after, the officer came in and I gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you were sober enough to know that you had the chain of your watch in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>

               <persName id="t18020113-4-person78">A. </persName>
            None at all; the officer brought in the baize before any of them were served; I followed them out, and saw Wood and the sailor go into a public-house, the corner of Golden-lane; I saw them drinking together.</p>

            Look at that property? - A. It is mine; there is a mark upon it, No. 8; this was the outside piece; I had removed it from the door about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Caybill's defence. I know no more of the robbery than the child unborn.</p>

               <p>Cayhill called one witness who had known him eight or nine years, and gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Smart; Staple's-inn  is part in Middlesex, and part in London; this part, No. 8, has been always reputed to be in London: On Sunday evening the 27th of December, about a quarter before nine, I was going up into the chambers; I unlocked the door, and heard the chairs move, which led me to suspect there was somebody in the room; I called out, but no answer was made, and the chairs still continued to move; I immediately shut the door again, and went to the porter's-lodge for assistance; the porter and two or three others went with me; when we got to the staircase, we heard somebody on the staircase, and when they heard our voices, they went back again on the staircase; there are a number of closets which they searched a considerable time, and at last found the prisoner at the bar concealed in one of them, with a candle-box, and candles secreted under her clothes; the candles were in the candle-box; we took her into the chambers.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020113-5-person87">Q. </persName>
            Whose property were they? - A. Mr. Smart's; we searched her, pulled off her pockets, and found about seventy pawnbroker's tickets in them; we then went into the bed-room, and found the bed-room had been stripped; there were four blankers, a counterpane, and the sheets, gone; I then missed a great-coat and waistcoat of my own; the prisoner then said, she had removed the articles I missed, to her lodgings.</p>

            Did you threaten her? - A. No; she said, they were at her lodgings, in Portugal-street; we took her there, and she delivered me a counterpane, a set of fire-irons, and my great-coat and waistcoat; she hoped I would forgive her, the devil had been very busy with her that afternoon; but I made her no promise.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD sworn. - I am inspector of the watch and lamps of St. Andrew's, Holborn; about a quarter before ten, on Sunday the 27th of December, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I found her in the Lodge, at Staple's-inn; she said, as you have got your things again, I hope you will forgive me; Mr. Thomas desired I would go up stairs with him; I went up, and he shewed me the property.

               <p>Q. Had you employed the prisoners to remove these goods? - A. I had not; I opened the drawer, and missed the money; the upper part of the chest of drawers were divided into two drawers; I looked in the drawer that I left the notes in, and they were gone; the other drawer had been taken out; I observed a piece of paper in the place where the drawers had been taken from; I looked, and found that to be the three twenty-pound bank-notes; I immediately inquired who had been there, and, in consequence of information, I went in quest of the two men who had removed these drawers; I found the prisoner Merriman; Sapwell, the officer, was with me; I don't recollect the name of the street; we found him in the street, and his wife with him; we took him to a public-house on the other side of the street; Sapwell searched him; I observed the woman drop something, watch proved to be a small pocket-book; Sapwell opened the pocket-book, and found two two-pound notes; we inquired of the woman where she got them; she said, she got them by her own earnings; she said, she was a silk weaver, or winder; she had a red cloak with her tied in a handkerchief, which she said she had bought six years ago at Portsmouth, where she bought the cloak she was then wearing nine years ago; Sapwell interrogated her a good deal where she had bought this cloak, but we could not find where she had bought it; Merriman was in the room all the time, in the custody of another officer; I then went to look after Bessiker; we found him, but could not discover any mark of suspicion on him, and the next day he came forwards before the Lord-Mayor, and told the whole story, and the Lord-Mayor thought proper to commit him.</p>

               <p>Q. By whom were they removed? - A. By the two prisoners at the bar; they were porters.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, on the 16th of October, entrust him with any draft, for the purpose of being presented to your banker's, and for what amount? - A. I did, for 4261. I have the draft here, (produces it); that is the draft, it is upon Prescot's house for 4261.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any directions respecting the application of that money? - A. I desired him to receive it from the banker's, and make a payment upon 5000l. scrip consols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the draft to him yourself? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect him to return that day into your service? - A. He did return, and the following morning he was not at the accompting-house, but I had no suspicion, knowing he had had a bad cold; I thought he might be indisposed.</p>

               <p>Q. When you sent him first of all to pay this instalment, you put into his hand a receipt for former payments? - A. Yes, they are all on one sheet of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask, if these scrip receipts in the City of London are not marketable? - A. I do not know that that unfortunate young man could have converted them into money, but any person that was known certainly might have disposed of them with the utmost facility.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe nearly 400l. had been paid upon these receipts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been in your service a few months? - A. Yes, I had the highest opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. And his friends are most respectable? - A. They are.</p>

Combe and Bridgman wished to shew him lenity, if he would make all the restitution in his power, I would see what I could do for him; he then went and fetched the scrip.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him to the place from whence he fetched the scrip? - A. I did not; he went by himself, and brought the scrip to me at my house, in Rood-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing besides this scrip? - A. Not at that time; I continually repeated to him to disclose the property if he had any left, and on the Tuesday evening he produced me a 20l. Bank-note, a 1l. note, and a 7s. piece; he laid, that was all he had left.</p>
               <p>

            Look at that 20l. Bank-note, and tell me if that was the note you received from him? - A. I believe this to be the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The scrip receipts that he delivered up to you was a security for former payments? - A. Yes; that scrip was to the value of near 3000l. that had been paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurnty. Q. Which he returned to you, and you returned to Mr. Bridgman? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday the 26th of December, you met him at the Theatre? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it Mr. Bridgman met him at your house? - A. On the Monday following, which was the 28th.</p>

I told him I had good grounds for it, and knew more of the business than perhaps he thought of; but, to avoid the painful business of a search, if he had any thing, he had better deliver it up; he said, he had not any; upon which my partner said, you know you have; and he said, what; my partner immediately said, three pieces of wire, which was apparently next kin to electricity to him; I then sent for an officer, and took him down to my dwelling-house, as being a less public place; he went with me to the dwelling-house, and the officer came and searched him; but, finding nothing, he began to be a little insolent; but, upon further search, it was found under his shirt, under the waisthand of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purpose for which that silver was intended? - A. For strainers for funnels that he had to make, and that which was found upon him was the pieces that were too long, and which he had cut off the three pieces that will be produced, and the pieces found upon him will make up the exact deficiency.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you leave it to your men to help themselves to silver? - A. If the foreman is not in the way, or myself and partner, they frequently help themselves from the skillets.</p>

            Did you weigh this yourself? - A. No, nobody weighed them; but silver of the same breadth, the same lenght, and the same thickness, weighs that weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself run this out to know that it was exactly the same? - A. I have got the very piece of silver here from which it was cut off; three such strips would weigh exactly three ounces fifteen pennyweights; it is a flat piece of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it that you cut off exactly pieces of the same breadth? - A. It was the whole length of the silver, and we have the rings here that are turned up that he cut off that night; we take them, and divide them as we want them, and mark to that breadth along that silver, and it must come to that weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it measured in such a way that the strips must be of the same weight - how do you manage to cut them so exactly? - A. There is no difficulty in that; the silver, when it is produced, will shew how easy it is done.</p>

               <p>Q. How is it you ascertain that? - A. The silver is flatted to a gauge; we gauge the breadth and length.</p>

             sworn. - Last Saturday, between six and seven o'clock, I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw a butcher coming out of Mr. Eyresls shop, I believe the prisoner at the bar to be the same man, but I cannot be sure; I was standing opposite the door, upon the foot pavement, on the same side of the way, and about a minute after, a man came out, in a blue coat, with a roll of carpeting upon his shoulder; I don't know who that man was; before he had got five yards past the window, he let it fall, I suppose it was rather too heavy for him; then the person that I believe to be the prisoner, looked round and saw the carpet upon the ground, he had got about ten yards before the other man; he turned back, and lifted the carpet upon his shoulder, and told him to go along, and he went along with it, and Johnstone went along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he follow him or how? - A. He walked along-side of him; a gentleman desired me to knock at the door, and ask Mr. Eyre if they had lost any thing, which I did, and Mr. Eyre immediately went after them.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear to him, he was a man very much of his appearance, but he had not the coat on that he has now.</p>

I did; I missed the halfpence, but did not miss the waistcoat till after the officer had found it; I then looked at Mr. Turner's desk, and saw that open; I found the lock had been wrenched clear off; I missed a hydrometer from his desk; I did not examine it any further, but sent for Mr. Turner; it was about a week after, that I saw the waistcoat in possession of the officer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. A person stooping down in the necessary to buckle his shoe, might have seen this parcel? - A. No, they could not.</p>
               <p>Q. This privy is so situated, that Pritchard, or any body else going past, might have gone into it? - A. It is in a garden, any body might have gone in.</p>
               <p>JOHN KNOWLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you go with Griffiths to the prisoner's house? - A.

Yes, it was; I took him at the Fir-tree public-house, Church-lane, Whitechapel, upon another charge; I was with Griffiths when he found the waistcoat and other things, with the curtain twisted round them, so as to conceal them from sight; I afterwards found the picklock-keys under the seat of the privy; we took Pritchard on the Tuesday morning following, the 8th.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I suppose twenty years; I have known him from a boy, he lived in Ponderson's-place, Bethnal-green Road.</p>

            About three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner and myself went to Mr. Turner's gates, I opened the wicket gate with a latch thing, and went into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see that latch thing there? - A. Yes, this is it; then the prisoner unlocked the accompting-house door with this key; then we got a light by a bottle of phosphorus, which the prisoner had, then we broke open the desks with this (a screwdriver;) we took out of one desk this waistcoat, some paper, and some few halfpence; out of the other desk, we took six guineas in gold, some silver and some bad halfpence in a little bag; we took some halfpence tied up in paper off the desk; then we brought out a little box with something in it that brewers use, like a weather-glass.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Turner.) Q. What is the use of the hydrometer in your business? - A. To ascertain the gravity of the wort.</p>
               <p>Pritchard. We were about a quarter of an hour about it; the prisoner locked the door again, and we came out at the gate, the gate shuts of itself; then we went to Bow-fair-field, and the prisoner put on this waistcoat; we took the money to the prisoner's house, some we left there, and some I carried home; he left the waistcoat at his house, and then went home with me; it was then, I suppose, between four and five o'clock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Pritchard gave me this waistcoat to go to the Bank in, to get change for a note; I am as innocent as the child unborn; Pritchard has done this to clear himself and his son, and I will take care never to have any thing to do with such a man again; I don't know where the brewhouse is, as God is my Judge; he has brought up his own son in the same way; his son was detected in carrying false keys to him while he was in jail, to let him out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Parkes's, Broad-street, St. Giles's: On Monday morning I went there, and found them; the weight of them was one hundred two quarters and twenty-one pounds; I desired to see Mr. Parkes, and after a communication with him, I gave directions, in case any more were brought, to let me know: On the 31st of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sent for; I went and saw the two prisoners at Mr. Parkes's with 162 shoes, weighing one hundred three quarters and seven pounds; they were taken to Marlborough-street.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Parkes, ironmonger: On the 31st of December, the prisoners brought a parcel of horseshoes; they came together about seven o'clock in the evening; the shoes weighed one hundred three quarters and seven pounds; I know the vmen well from having been there on the 18th of the same month; I sent up to Messrs. Moorcrost and Field's, as I had been directed to do; they were asked where they brought the shoes from; they said, they brought them from Paddington, from one Morris; a little time after, Messrs. Moorcrost and Field came to the shop; they were to have thirty shillings a hundred for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Field. I know these shoes to be mine; they are marked with the letter M; the shoes are made by two different people, each has his own mark.</p>

            Have you never said that you believed this man's son was the person who had stole them, and these people the persons who disposed of them? - A. I may have said so, but not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he had the whole to do with the stealing of them? - A. That I know nothing about.</p>
               <p>Jones. I have no doubt of these shoes being Messrs. Moorcrost and Field's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You missed them from time to time, so that it must be some person who had the opportuinty of frequently taking them? - A. That night we found the yard-door open, and the shop-door open.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you win? - A. No; as soon as they put it down, I thought there was something wrong; I thought they were going to rob me, and I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130024"/>to my nephew, John, you have brought me here to be robbed.</p>

            Before all the company? - A. Yes; he said, no, uncle, I know the men very well, they will not rob you; Mr. Parker, the man at the bar, got the money in his hand, and I snatched it out of his hand by force, and, in getting it from him by force, I tore the thirty-pound note in three pieces; I had put into his hand a thirty-pound bank-note and two five-guinea country-bills; then that caused a disturbance in the house, and they were angry with me, and he said I had robbed my nephew, for he could have won the game if I had let him.</p>

            Was he to go halves with you? - A. There was nothing said about halves, and my nephew himself was angry with me; upon that we all went away from that house, and I thought of going home, and all the way I went, my nephew and these two men were chiding me that I had ruined him, by not letting him win the money; they said, they were my nephew's friends, and they would not let him be robbed; so in going home, some of the party proposed to get some more drink; then we went to a public-house in the Haymarket; they call it the tap at the Opera house; we went all straight away in the parlour.</p>

               <persName id="t18020113-24-person312">Q. </persName>
            What time of night was this? - A. I do not know, for I had been drinking punch with them, and had more liquor than I should have had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not you know what time it was - was it dark? - A. Yes; I dare say it was nine o'clock before we went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the tap? - A. The prisoner Lonsdale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. I do not know whether he was drunk or sober; I did not see any thing by him; when we went into the parlour, they called for some more punch, and some of them began to produce a pack of cards again; my nephew was as keen of playing as any of them, and he said only put it down, and we will soon have the money; and they proposed a wager again, and one of them said, oh, he is drunk, we will soon do him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-24-person313">A. </persName>
            One of the party that was playing.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought him drunk too, I suppose? - A. I thought he was in liquor; he appeared very much like a gentleman; they would not let him speak, and I thought they used him ill; and then I laid the same wager as I had done before; I laid forty pounds to twenty again; I was thinking I could get some money.</p>
               <p>

            And did you think that perfectly honest? - A. I cannot say; then my nephew laid twice over ten to one, that was threescore pounds, and I put it down for him; he said, he had got such a hand of cards; he had got all the trumps in his own hand; he had got seven trumps; he had only one trick to get; he had only one card left when the wager was laid, and that was a trump.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew all this, and saw it? - A. Yes; and one of the men wanted to look at the cards that had been played, and he played a trump; my nephew said, you are a rascal, I played that card, it was the seven of hearts; then the gentleman, that pretended to be drunk, snatched up the money, and ran away with it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Will you just tell the Gentlemen of the Jury how many jails you have been in? - A. I never was in any jail for any harm.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. I did not know any thing of him further than coming to my shop for cheese and butter: On Tuesday, the 6th of January, he called upon me, about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130025"/>o'clock at night, and asked me if I was busy; I told him I was; he said, he had betted a wager of a bowl of punch about a foot-race at York; and I told him I knew the man won his wager that he run for, but I could not tell what time it was to be done in; I told him I had an uncle from the country, if he would take him with me, I would go; we went first to the tap under the Opera, and there they said he was gone to the Talbot; then we went to the Talbot, and then a man came in with a note from the Robin-Hood, saying, that his bowl of punch would be forfeited, unless I came directly; I left my uncle, and went there; there was only one person in the back parlour, and he asked me what I knew about the wager, and I told him; he said, he was satisfied that he had lost, and called for a bowl of punch; I had a glass of punch, and a man came in, and said, Mr. Bolderon, how do you do? I was astonished at his knowing me, and he asked me to have some brandy and water; he said, he should like to smoke a pipe with me, and persuaded me to fetch my uncle; Parker went with me, and my uncle came; after we had sat down some time, a pack of cards was produced, and my uncle was asked to play; he said, he never did; we played for a bowl of liquor; I had a capital good hand, and they proposed to bet wagers as far as forty pounds; my uncle put down a thirty-pound note and two five-guinea notes; Parker took them up; and then my uncle, dreading something, said, John, you have brought me here to be robbed; I said, G - d bless you, no, we are all countrymen together; then there was a proposal to go to the tap under the Opera.</p>

            Only since May; we went to the tap, and then the cards were introduced again, and we stopped to play; hearts were trumps, and I had the ace, king, queen, knave, nine, seven, and six, of hearts, Parker was my partner; the other two were Furby and Harrison; Harrison was the man who was represented as the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. He was drunk, was not he? - A. He pretended to be drunk; when I looked at my cards, I said to my uncle, I am sure I can get the odd trick; I trumped one of their cards with the seven; then Furby said, let me look at your cards that you have played, and he did look at them, and stole the seven from my cards; after a little while, he played my trump seven, and then I perceived he had stole it; then the gentleman swore he had won, and snatched up the money; my uncle had betted thirty pounds, and put down five five-guinea notes and four guineas in gold; Mr. Harrison put down his pocket-book and his gold watch against it; it was all put into the hands of a man of the name of Solliker, and as soon as there was a row about it, he snatched the money from Solliker, and ran out; my uncle ran out immediately, but he was gone.</p>

When I recovered myself, I followed, crying out stop thief, to Rosemary-lane, and to Salt-petre-bank, but was afraid to go any further, being a stranger. I have not the least doubt that Brewer was one, and that Doyle took my watch. I was perfectly sober, if I had not been so I could not have acted as I did. I have never had the things again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Was your comvanion drunk? - A. Yes; I had been drinking with him in a public-house about two minutes before, we had sixpennyworth of rum and water; I had been drinking some beer in a private house, but I drank no more than I thought would do me good, I cannot tell how much; I did not drink three quarts, nor two, but cannot tell how much; I only drank sufficient to quench my thirst, I was not drunk; there might be seven or eight pots among four or five in company.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw either of the men before? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, was it not? - A. It was starlight enough for me to distinguish their faces; and there was a light from the public-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who took your watch was in sailor's clothes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common dress in that part of the town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did the first scussle last? - A. Not two minutes; and the second not a minute. I have no doubt they are the persons with whom I had the two scussles.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is Leman-street lighted with lamps? - A. It was at the bottom, in the very darkest part; there was one lamp belonging to the sugar-house that gave a bad light; I trusted to the star-light, and the light of the public-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell: I had information, and went to Salt-petre-bank, and on the Tuesday evening I apprehended Brewer in St. Catherine's-lane, I knew him well before; Doyle was in company with another man, I had an information against him at that time; I found on Brewer a black crape round his hat, he said, he was in mourning for his mother; and upon Doyle I found two keys, one he said belonged to his house, and the other to a lodging in St. Catherine's-lane.</p>
               <p>Brewer's defence. I had been two days locked up before they took the crape from my hat; and the prosecutor at first said he did not know either of the men, and took a man with a green coat on, because he said he did not know either of our faces.</p>
               <p>Doyle's defence. A man, named Farmer, asked me if I wanted a constant birth, I said I did, and he took me to Shadwell office; I staid at the White Lion while he spoke to the clerk, as he told me; he came to me, and said he had got me the birth; we had some beer, and in about five minutes the officers came in; they called Brewer by name, he got up, and they hand-cussed him; they said, young man we want you, but did not know my name; Cook said they wanted nothing with me, and I staid there till near ten o'clock; I met Brown, and said, what did you want with me; he said, nothing of no great consequence, but I want you now, and he took me; I have people to prove where I was at the same time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know him before that time? - A. I cannot say I did, ever to be in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - A. An unfortunate woman; St. Catherine's is about half a mile from Leman-street; Doyle has lived along with me three months; I did not attend at the Justices; I told he officers he was with me all day, to the best of my knowledge, but cannot be positive; I don't know how he has got his living; he went to the water-side umping, and sometimes to biscuit-baking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he came from? - A. I heard people talk; he told me he came from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other day you can tell me, when he was with you all day? - A.

             sworn. - I am streetkeeper and constable: On the 2d of January, coming along, I saw the prisoner run across Thames-street, from Dice-Quay to St. Dunstan's-hill, with a cask upon his back; I pursued him till he got into Tower-street, where I stopped him, and he threw the calk off his back. I secured him, and he said he was employed by a man to carry it; the cask was staved by throwing it down; then the carman came and claimed it. (The cask produced, and identified.)</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Flack, at Ware: The mare lost was in his straw-yard, she was lost on the 10th of December; I saw her there with others between six and seven o'clock, I fastened the gate with a chain and nail; I went to the yard between four and five o'clock the next morning, and did not see the mare, the gate was shut, but fastened in a different manner; indeed it was only shut to. Four horses were gone as well as the mare, which I have seen since; she was found in Smithfield; I had her in my care but three or four days, and took no particular notice of her, but I think it was the same mare; she was a grey mare, and there was no other in my master's yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. On the 10th there was a grey mare, and four others, in the strawyard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. You fastened the gate, and the next morning the chain and nail was unlassened, and five horses had strayed away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had strayed away, did you ever find any of them? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they found? - A. Yes; four were found the next morning, in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw a grey cart mare? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said that you could not take upon yourself to swear it was the same mare that was in Mr. Flack's straw-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. My Friend has talked about straying - I take it for granted a horse could not unchain the gate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Four horses, and the grey mare, strayed out of the yard, as my Friend calls it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the grey mare found her way to Smithfield to be sold? - A. Yes; I hear so.</p>

I am sure it was my master's mare; Chester lived at Ware, but has followed no business lately.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. When you came to Smithfield, you saw a grey mare belonging to Mr. Humphreys? - A. Yes.</p>

He tied the grey mare up to the rail, and said he would return; then that man came and asked me who was the owner, and I told him a man had left the price with me; the constable took me to Giltspur-street Compter, and I wished to wait till the man came back, because, as I said, I was not the real owner, though I had the price of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk in Messrs. Lesevre's house, and produce the draft for twenty-two pounds, which was presented for payment on the 4th of December, before I went into the office at nine o'clock, but I don't know by whom; the person appeared to be in haste; I told him the clock had not struck nine; when it did, I paid him in a twenty-pound note, No. 6062, dated 6th June, 1801, and two pounds in cash; about half past ten, a person came and informed us of the robbery; I immediately went to the Bank to stop the note, and in about an hour a person fetched me to the Bank, where I saw the prisoner and the note I had paid him for the draft; we questioned him, and he said he had received it from a person in the street, whom he was to meet at the top of Cornhill; we took him there, and not meeting him, he said he was to meet him at the Red-Lion, in Whitechapel-road; we got an officer, and went to the Red-Lion, where we staid five or ten minutes, but did not see the other man; we then took him to the Whitechapel office, where he was searched, but nothing found on him, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you ever seen the man since who applied for the payment of that check? - A. Not that I know of.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; he and I went to Hudson and Gordon's brewhouse on the 3d of December, about twelve o'clock at night, and staid about there till one; when we unlocked the wicket door with this key, which we took with us; then we went to the accompting-house door, which we unlocked also; we got a light from a bottle of phosphorus, with a match, and looked about us; this key opened the iron cupboard, from which we took a quantity of bank-notes, and several other papers; then we broke open the desks with this thing, (a large screw-driver,) and took out some bad money and a one-pound bank-note; there was a bad dollar, bad shillings, and bad six-pences; and a quantity of halfpence; we took out of a drawer some shares of tickets, and a quantity of notes; also two checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one? (Shewing a check.) - A. Yes, it is; I took this, and the twenty-five, the twenty, the fifteen, the five, and a great quantity of one and two pound notes; this is the fifteen pound note which I gave to my wife; I live at No. 8, King-street, Mile-End New-Town; I do not know the other notes; when we had taken them out of the iron safe, we slammed the door, locked the accompting-house door, and came through the wicket into the street; we then went to Bow-fair Field, where we left the thing like a weather-glass, which we brought out of the accompting-house, and went and committed another robbery. I had the fifteen pound note, and some of the ones, and the check; and Warren had the twenty pound note, and some of the ones; after that, we went to Warren's house first, and then he went to mine, where we parted the things, as well as we could, in the morning, and then he went home; this check I told him I could get money for, and the other too; he fet off to Bow to inquire about the robbery, and if any body was coming after us, and was to meet me; I went to the end of Gracechurch-street, where I met a man, and asked him if he knew where that check was payable, he said he did; I did not know, but I asked him to go for it, and I waited at the door; it was a few minutes before nine, and he stopped some time; I went in and asked for change for a five pound note, they said I had come too soon, and the man said he was waiting for his money; I went out, and in a few minutes he came out, and gave me a twenty pound note, and the rest in money; this is the gentleman who said it was too soon,(Mr. Churchyard); I gave the man two shillings, and he left me. I then met Warren, who said, there was a great disturbance at Bow about the robbery; I gave him the twenty pound note I received for the check, and we then went to my house, this was about ten o'clock, he said he would go and get small notes for it; I told him he had better not, but he said he would go to the Bank of England, and he went away, and I never saw him again till I saw him at Whitechapel Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Nobody else accompanied you but the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept the check, and employed a man to take it to the banking-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is just as true as that you don't know the man at all? - A. He was a staranger to me; when I went into the banking-house, he said he was waiting for the money, not for his money.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you stole it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130040"/>Q. May I ask, is your own son in London at present? - A. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not the officers been looking for him? - A. I don't know, I heard they have been at his house; I have been a prisoner myself ever since I resigned myself up on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not your son the person who went to the banker's? - A. No; my son is about my size, or a little taller, with hair rather lighter than mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were a witness here before? - A. About twelve months, on the trial of one Woolridge, about Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. As a voluntary witness, to save your own life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn evidence against any other man for forging Bank notes at any time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been tried here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or any where else? - A. Yes, at Stafford.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Neville.) Q. Look at the fifteen pound note, and the twenty pound note; do you know them? - A. They correspond with the numbers in my book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I submit, that this being a place at some distance from the dwellings of the two partners, and not communicating with either, it is impossible to call it their dwelling, because, though there might be a pretence for saying it was the dwelling of the two if they live together, yet, in as much as they live in two separate houses, it is impossible that it can be considered as the dwelling of both; it must be shewn; taking it that they both lived in one dwelling, that it would then constitute a felony; I know it has been considered that our houses might be taken as dwellings, but there is a case where an out-house, separated only eight yards from the principal dwelling, was not considered as a house in which a burglary could be committed; that case is in Ist Hawkins, 219; here the evidence stated, is, that the brewery is upwards of one hundred yards from the dwellings which the partners occupy, which is a much greater distance than that stated in that case; the proof is, that they occupy two several houses, and the out-house is charged as being a part of the joint occupation of both; I therefore contend the indictment cannot be sustained, but it is not proved to be the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not stated to be a part of the dwelling, but is charged to be a burglary on the ground of it being an out-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord, it is also stated to be out of the parish of St. Mary-lc-Bow.</p>
               <p>Court. I am not aware of any thing to induce me to say that an out-house is a place in which a burglary cannot be committed; the case which you cite, was a case in which it could not be connected with the dwelling-house; in this case, though it has not been distinctly proved to be a part of the partners' dwelling, yet it is a part of their premises; if you mean to say there was a distinction between the accompting-house and the other part, the answer is, it is connected with the place where the man slept, by a continuation of building. However, if upon further consideration you think there is any thing to be made of it hereafter, the prisoner shall have the advantage of it.</p>
               <p>JAMES BILLINGS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the premises of Messrs. Hudson and Gordon, and if so, describe them? - A. I begin with the accompting-house that was broke open next the street, from which we go to the marsh run on the stage, next it a store-house, and a passage from one accompting-house to the other, all under one continued roof; there is a ready communication without any interruption whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the robbery: Pritchard came on Friday morning to my house with a bundle, containing a red waistcoat, and writing paper, my wife said the waistcoat was too big for me; he said it could be altered, and then he sent for some gin, and took me to his house; he said his son was waiting at the new pump by the Bank; I went with him, and we met his son, who took the check to the banker's? he bought a fowl, and told me to take it to his house, and says he, you shall have a bit of fowl, and a drop of wine after dinner; then he asked me if I would go and get change for a twenty pound note; I said, yes, and went and asked for it; they told me the note was stopped, and asked me who I had it of; I said a man, who was to give me something for my trouble. He wanted to bring me in about two months ago, as he has now, when he gave me a Norwich bank-note, and I went to the White-horse in Fetter-lane for change; they told me it was stole a twelvemonth before; I might have been stopped there as well as for this; Combes knows Pritchard put the things in the privy himself. I have been a man that have always got my living by the sweat of my brow, and he never did in his life.</p>

            There are a great many clerks in the house who have access to this safe? - A. Yes; the doors of the safe are open, but the drawers are locked; two drawers hold the cash collected, and the other holds common papers, and different things; they have each of them a different lock, so that one key will not open two; I had one key in my possession the whole time this bag was in the drawer; I had been there several times before I missed it; there were two or three other bags in the drawer; the notes were tied up in a little sample bag, I did not miss it, because there were other bags, and this was a very small bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody could have access to this drawer but yourself? - A. No; but it has been found open once or twice, nothing was missed before then; it was entirely forgetfulness of me to leave it open; I am sure I locked it when I put the bag in.</p>

             sworn. - I was collecting clerk to Messrs. Hanbury, and know the prisoner; his province was to post the cellar-books: On the 26th of December last, I was in the box which is appropriated for the use of the clerks to make up their cash, in order to carry to the banker's, and the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I could oblige him with change for a ten-pound Bank-note; I asked him if he chose small notes, or gold; he said, gold, which I gave him; I asked him if he had marked the note; he asked me what I meant; I said, there were a great many forged notes about, and I always wrote on the notes the person's name I took them of; he said, it was almost impossible he should remember who he took it of, because, perhaps, he had had it in his possession six or seven months, but if he wrote his own name on it, he supposed it would do; I said, yes, but I should write his name also upon the face of the note, as I always did; he took up the red-ink pen, and wrote his name on the back; I did not know how he wrote his name, but I looked at the manner in which he had spelt it, and wrote it myself on the face of the note, with the date of the month; he thanked me for the gold, and walked away; I put the note into a bundle of notes without taking any account of it, which led to a disagreeable mistake, for I found myself ten pounds out of pocket; that delayed me an hour or more from going to the banker's, but when I found it out, I carried it to Taylor's and Co. No. 60, Lombard-street; I had mentioned this circumstance to Mr. Evelyn, who asked me about it, and of whom I had taken it, which introduced the enquiry after the note; I paid it into Taylor's the same day I received it of the prisoner, about two hours after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was a fact well known, that a number of notes had been lost in June last? - A. Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have been an easy thing for this young man to have got change for the Bank-note any where else? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know what you meant by marking the note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You explained, by saying you meant marking the name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you, he did not think it possible for him to do that, because, perhaps, he might have had it for six or seven months? - A. Yes, I think that was his expression.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mean to fix it precisely, whether five, six, or seven months? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, if he put his name, he supposed it would do? - A. Yes, and I said it would; upon which, he wrote it at full length; he never attempted to decline or conceal it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had that ever been in your custody before? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The bags are sometimes thrown across the yard from one to another - are they not? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Your accompting-house is frequented by all the draymen and publicans that come to settle accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where things are carelessly kept, numbers of people have opportunities of taking advantage of it? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>

             sworn. - I apprehended the prisoner when he was at the accompting-house; I and Ray took him to his lodgings, but the door was locked, as his wife was out; I told him we must search the place; upon which he broke open the door himself; there was nothing found but a twenty-pound note, two ten-pound notes, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130046"/>receipt for some stock; he gave every assistance; and while I was looking about, by some mistake the receipt had got into a book, but he shewed it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have stated the fact to my Counsel; every body in the accompting-house knows that I received money from my brother in the West-Indies about that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Holden.) Q. Do you know that fact? - A. very well know it; he received a bill of lading of some coffee, which he put into my hands, and a bill of exchange for fifty pounds, which I received for him, so that he might well be in possession of that sum; it was sent to him about twelve months ago, and he might receive the proceeds about five or six months ago.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to change a piece of linen, and asked her to let me look at a piece of calico, she did, I paid for it, and came out of the shop; she called me back, and sent for an officer, saying, I had taken it, but it lay on the counter when I went in.</p>

             sworn. - I am a City constable, and went with Mr. Holdsworth to No. 5, Grub-street: Smith called out, and Buckingham came down; he was taken, and I found a small key on him, that had been filed for opening drawers, and a common pocket knife; he wanted to know what he was taken for. Mr. Holdsworth and I then went up one pair of stairs, at No. 5, I got a light, and found the keys as is already stated; in the back room I found this stock, (produces it); there was no centre-bit.</p>

            Are you the son of Robert Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind and speak the truth - do you know the prisoner Buckingham? - A. Yes; I lived with his father, about two years ago, who was a fishmonger in Fore-street; I know one Belcher, but never saw him but once: the last day of December, Buckingham, Belcher, and I, went towards Covent-Garden; and had a pot of beer, about three o'clock; Buckingham-said he knew of a good place, but for want of a centre-bit they could not get in; Belcher said, let us go and see if we can't rob it; going along we saw a lamp-lighter's ladder, and he persuaded us to take that; Buckingham said we could get one nearer than that, in Aldersgate-street; we then agreed to go to the Old Hand-in-Hand Fire-office, but first we took a ladder from Aldersgate-street; Buckingham said I looked more like a lamplighter than he, and I took it; we walked about till it was dark, we went to Buckingham's room, No. 5, Grub-street, up one pair of stairs, he brought down a sack, those keys, and a chisel, and between five and six o'clock we went to Angel-court; then Belcher got a pipe of tobacco, a farthingsworth of matches, and a halfpenny candle, the ladder was put against the wall, and Buckingham told me to go up and stick a knife in the putty; I said I could not; he said, then break the window; I said I could not without making a noise; he said, if any body comes he would stick his knife in them; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130050"/>I broke the top window over the door; I was to put my hand over, shore the thing round, and hoist up the sash, but I could not open it; I then broke the bottom window, got in, and went down stairs and let them in; Buckingham put a match into the pipe and lit the candle, and we all went up stairs to the first-floor; Belcher put a pair of pistols in his pocket, and we all filled the sack full of things; Belcher and me held the sack open while Bucking ham put them in, bed-furniture, and table-cloths; three counterpanes were tied up in my apron, and not put into the sack; Buckingham wanted Belcher to pull off his smock-frock to make a sack of it, but he would not; Belcher went down first with the sack, I was to wait and see that nobody was coming after him, Buckingham came back to me, and then Belcher ran away with the things; Buckingham and I took the three counterpanes to a man of the name of Blake, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street, he keeps a private-house; Blake took us up three pair of stairs, to an empty room, first he told me to wait down stairs, but I said I would not, and I went up with them; Buckingham asked three pounds for them, Blake said he would give eight shillings a piece, and that three times eight was twenty-eight; he meant twenty-four, but he gave Buckingham a one pound note, a seven-shilling-piece, and a shiling; I had the seven-shilling-piece and the shilling; we then went to an Alamode beef-shop, and I changed the seven shilling-piece; I said I was afraid to go home, as I had left my place,and he said he would take me to a house in Chick-lane, where we went and slept two or three nights; the house is kept by one Smith; next day we went to an ironnonger's in Redcross-street,and bought a stock and centre-bit, which I paid for, I gave two shilling, and had sixpence in change, Buckingham took them to his lodgings in Grub-street; going down Snow-hill, on Friday fortnight, we went into a gingerbread-baker shop, and bought a plumb-cake, I gave the one pound note, and the young woman went for chage; Buckingham gave me the twenty shilling note to take care of, because his pocket was not good; I staid with him till the money was all gone, then he told me I had better go home till he could get more tools to work with; I told one Jago, the next day after the robbry, what I ahd done, but my father spoke to me about it first; I went to Buckingham several times, to ask him what I had better do; he told me not to say any thing about it, for they could not hurt us, as it was only a warehouse,and not a dwelling-house, at most they could only trasport us for it; I told my father five days after I had told Jago, and he took me to Mr. Holdsworth, who took me to Buckingham's, in Grub-street, the same night; I called him down by the nick-name of Kebble, and he came dwon, and was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you know that he had been a sailor twenty or thirty years, and had been fractured in the skull, and in consequence of that was out of his mind at times? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you he had got the wrong bundle? - A. Yes; but hesitated sometime; there was nothing taken out of it; he said, it was a mere mistake.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What time did you send him out? - A. About a quarter past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to send a man perfectly out of his senses for your things? - A. I did not wish to let the people of the house know I pledged things, and he seemed collected that day; he returned about two o'clock, or after; I think the bundle was at Sowerby's, and the ear-rings at Windsor's; I took the bundle in a passion from him, and threw it on the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wilkins). Q. Was this lady present? - A. The prisoner and she lives together; he called her his wife, and she called him her husband; I am sure the bundle was taken from behind a curtain.</p>

I said, to town; my great coat was buttoned; they instantly tore it open, and searched for my watch, which I had left at home; I said, my friends, I have nothing for you only a few six-pences; don't use me ill; I thought it was very hard to be used in that manner; they said, it was bl-y hard for them to be without money; the sailor instantly put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, where there was about eighteen pennyworth of halfpence, which they took out, with a knife, a cork-screw, and a tobacco-stopper; he then put his hand to search for my breeches pocket, and the prisoner held me; I had nothing in that pocket; there were four shillings, and there might be a dozen six-pences, which he took out, and run off directly; when the prisoner loosed me, he gave me a shove round, and he run off; on turning round, I saw the heads of two gentlemen; I halloaed to them, and begged their assistance, for I had been robbed; we pursued them about one hundred yards, and took the prisoner; the other run away; they had no arms.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW MACKENZIE sworn. - On Thursday last, the 14th of January, I was in company with Mr. Greenly, going home, and it being so clear a night, we agreed to go across the fields; when we got about one hundred yards of the pitching-block, I saw a man, who called, I am robbed, give your assistance; we agreed to pursue the men who were running; and, after running a few yards, took the prisoner; he made no resistance, or was he out of my sight.</p>
               <p> - WYATT sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, but only found an old pocketbook, a knife, and tobacco-box,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along the footpath, and heard two men running; I stood up, and a man passed me; I saw two more coming up, and, thinking it might be a quarrel, I turned out of the road; upon which they came and took hold of me; I was not going to run away, I had done nothing; there is my discharge from the army in that pocket-book, in consequence of being wounded three times.</p>

             sworn - I am one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street; going along on the 1st of January, my partner and I heard the cry of watch, watch; we went down Crown-street, and saw a woman standing at the door; she said, she was sure there was some person in that empty-house, for she heard them cough; I told her nor to be alarmed; Perry and I knocked at the door, and the prisoner finding he could not escape, opened the door, and let us in; we secured him; he had a black apron on that had a deal of mortar or whitewash on it; while I hand-cussed him, he said to me, you'll observe that basket does not belong to me; I did not ask you, said I; there was a bunch of matches, a wax taper, a pipe of tobacco, a piece of green baize, a brass lock and five iron ones, and a piece of lead. (The property produced, and identified by Williams.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you heard the woman cry watch, did you not hear the cry of fire? - A No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Crown-street, and there was a woman alarming the neighbourhood with a cry of fire in the empty house; I put my hand to the door and found it open; a man immediately rushed by me, and shut the door; I was in the dark, the house was then surrounded, and I let them in; I never saw the basket before.</p>

            : On the 30th of November, a little after eight in the evening, there was a noise in the window, as if the glass was breaking; I went out, but the window was not broke; there were three people round it, and the window not being broke, I did not suspect them; a short time after, the same noise was repeated again; I went out again, as before, and there were the same three persons at the window, but there was no window broke; when I went out, they went away different ways; about a quarter of an hour after, the same noise was repeated again; I went out again the third time, and saw the same three standing round the window; they went off in different directions, as before; I went to the window, but still did not perceive it broke; my master then gave me a small bill, and told me to go and pay it, about four doors lower down; upon coming back again, I saw the same three standing round the window, and heard the glass crack; they perceived me, and went away; I went up to the glass, and saw there was a piece of glass gone out of the corner; I then told my master the window was broke, and if he liked, I could take one out of the three; he told me by all means to take them, if I could; I directly followed them, they were all going up Holborn-hill together; Brown was a little before the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these were the same three that you had seen at the window? -

            Brown I am sure of; I saw all their faces at the window, and, when I followed them up the hill, I saw the face of Brown only; I am sure they were all of them the same people; I then took Brown, and brought him into the shop, the other two walked off together; I then went for a constable, but could not find one; and, in coming back, I saw two men in conversation, and I suspected they were the other two men; they were standing on the opposite side of the way, looking at our shop; I stepped close up behind them, and the one who made his escape, said, I am glad he did not take me; they did not see me at that time; Johnson immediately repeated, so am I; for, when he came out the third time, I had my knife in the window; I then stepped in between them, and took hold of one with each hand; the one, who made his escape, kept several times saying, it is not me; I asked him what it was that he had done; he still repoased, that it was not him; Johnson, in the mean time, jumped up, and stuck a knife in here, (pointing to his head;) as soon as he had done that, he got my hand up to his mouth, and began biting; I having hold of the other as well as him, could not defend myself but by drawing my hand out of his mouth, which I did three times, and the fourth time he got hold of my finger; I then found that my finger was so fast in his teeth, that I could not draw it out, and I was obliged to let the other one go; I then got my finger out of his mouth, and took him over to the shop; the knife was so stuck into the bone, that I could not get it out; I tried twice, but could not get it out; Mr. Bainbridge got it out for me.</p>

(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty it was not the same he first gave you? -

            Certainly I could see that the moment it was laid down; I took it in my hand, and told him I should keep that half-guinea and secure him; I desired my wife to send my servant out to get assistance; another man had come into the shop just at the time that I had given the prisoner the good half-guinea back, and asked for a quartern of soap; I went to cut it, and he desired me to serve the other gentleman first, meaning the prisoner; I told him I could serve him in a minute; I cut him a quartern of soap, and took his money; they were both in the shop at the time the prisoner offered the bad half-guinea; I went round the counter to lay hold of the prisoner, and they both went out of the shop; I followed them into the street, and took the prisoner by the collar with my left-hand, and called for assistance; it was some time before any body made their appearance; a third person came up in the street, of the name of Fowles, who was discharged, and the man that was in the shop called me all the thieves and bad expressions he could use; Fowles doubled his fist at me, and threatened me; the man that had the soap, brandished-a-stick over me, and as soon as they saw some neighbours coming to my assistance, they made a grand pull, and got him away from me; the prisoner ran up West Harding-street; I went after him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken; he ran nearly as far as Fetter-lane; Mr. March was upon the spot, and I delivered-him to him.</p>
