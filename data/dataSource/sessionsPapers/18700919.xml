I am an umbrella manufacturer, of Monkwell Street, City, in partnership with Mr. Earl—prior to July, 1869, I knew the pri<lb/>soner, not intimately, I had business and money transactions with him; if he brought a Manchester cheque, I have given him my cheque in exchange, nothing beyond that—a day or two previous to 10th July, 1869, he came to me, and said he had got a quantity of goods in pawn at Messrs. Harris &amp; Sweeting's, about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, that he owed them 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he wanted to redeem them, and had not the means, and would I let him have the money to redeem them, as he had sold a portion of them to Messrs. Ward &amp; Sturt, of Wood Street, enough to pay me the money back, which he would do in three days—I refused, for several days, to let him have it; he came repeatedly about it, and pressed me very hard to lend him the money; he said he did not know what he should do if I did not, that he was ruined if he did not get them out—I ultimately consented to go and pay the money</p>

               <p>myself to redeem them, which I did; I went with him, and paid the cheque—I went twice; the first time Mr. Harris or Mr. Sweeting were not in—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque I gave, it is for 262<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for expenses—at first I was to hold the goods as security—afterwards he said they had better not go to my place, as he had got to my place, as he had got to re-box them before they went to Messrs. Sturt—Harris &amp; Sweeting gave me a receipt for the money—the defendant handed me a list of the goods, but he had it back again to see that they were correct; I have never seen it since—he did not give me any memorandum, or any security for the advance—I did not have a halfpenny as discount—after two or three days I called at the defendant's premises—I don't think I saw him the first time, I called again and saw him—he said he had not sent the goods in yet, he had not got the boxes—I took his word—I saw him repeatedly afterwards; he kept on making excuses; at last he said he had sent the money to his father, that he had received from Ward &amp; Sturt—I said he ought to have known better, he ought to have paid me—he made no reply to that—he said he was going down to Manchester, he had got some money there, and he would bring me the money up—I met him with his father, in Falcon Square, three or four weeks after the money ought to have been paid, and the father thanked me very much for my kindness to him, and told me I should not lose a penny, if it was the lost stick he had to sell he would pay me—I called afterwards at the defendant's premises from time to time—sometimes I saw him, sometimes I saw his clerk—I asked him every time for my money—I did not get it—on one occasion he said he was going to Man<lb/>chester, to sell his stock there, which he did—he did not give me the money out of that—he was taken and put into Whitecross Street, with the money in his pocket, directly he came from Manchester—about Sep-tember or October I heard of his having executed a bill of sale to his father, and went to Messrs. Weeks, my solicitors—a letter or two was subsequently received from the prisoner's father, in consequence of which I waited some time longer—the letters were before I heard of the bill of sale—on 22nd September I went to the premises in Castle Street, and found the whole of the stock had been removed—I made inquiries, and traced the goods to Messrs. Honey &amp; Hum<lb/>phrey, accountants, in King Street—I went there with my solicitor, and ascertained that the goods were to be sold on the following Saturday, by tender—I subsequently saw the prisoner's father, with my solicitor—I did not see a bill of sale of these goods—there was a bill of sale shown at his father's house when I saw his father—that was on the furniture—I never saw the bill of sale—I gave my solicitor instructions to take proceedings against the prisoner in bankruptcy, when we found he had filed his own petition—I was appointed assignee in the bankruptcy—there were no assets—I received nothing—I have never received a shilling of my advance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mineral water manufacturer, Norfolk House, Globe Road, Mile End—I have been in the habit of supplying Mr. Perrett at the London Bridge Refreshment Rooms, and the Broad Street Refreshment Rooms, with mineral waters—Westley senior has been in my service some time—his son was also a paid servant of mine—the boy Humphries was not in my service—he was paid by the Westleys—Gabriel was in my service—</p>

               <p>he was employed to deliver express orders—the Westleys had commission as well as a salary—Gabriel had no commission at all—the Westleys have been six or seven years in my service, and Gabriel four to five—Gabriel had a book supplied to him for the delivery of mineral waters—there was a par<lb/>ticular book for Mr. Perrett supplied to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Gabriel used to drive a one horse van and the Westleys a pair horse van—my brother, who was the manager, would superintend the loading of Gabriel's van—he would take an account of the goods put in the van—on the 20th August, 23rd August, and 2nd September, Gabriel took out goods to deliver to Mr. Perrett—he had no goods to deliver to any other place—when he goes out in the morning the counterfoil which is left in the book is unsigned—the other part is left with the customer as an invoice—I find some of the counterfoils in this book signed by Denham, who was Mr. Perrett's cellarman at London Bridge Station, and Trodd, who was the cellarman at Broad Street Station—the book is brought back after the delivery with the counterfoil signed—I don't know Denham's writing—Gabriel had no right to transfer any portion of the mineral waters on either of those days to the Westleys' van.</p>

I am the brother of the last witness, and am manager of the business—on 20th August I superintended the loading of the one horse van which Gabriel drove—he took out fifty dozen—he brought the delivery book with the signature of Denham for fifty dozen delivered to Mr. Perrett—on 23rd August he took out fifty dozen to Perrett's, and brought back the book signed by Denham—on 2nd September fifty-six dozen was taken out—he did not come back with the book that day; he was taken into custody before he returned—he had no goods on either of those days to deliver to anyone but Mr. Perrett—there was no other book in his pos<lb/>session but Mr. Perrett's—he would not take goods out without bringing back a receipt—there are entries of goods delivered to two other persons, with those exceptions it is Mr. Perrett's book only—Mr. Perrett is one of our largest customers, we have no customers named White or Harris.</p>

I keep the refreshment rooms at the London Bridge Station and at the Broad Street Station—Denham has been in my service, at London Bridge, twelve or thirteen years—he received all goods, and had entire charge of the cellars—it was his duty to receive the goods, see if they were correct, and sign for them—I have dealt for some time with Mr. Edmonds, both at Broad Street and London Bridge—George Trodd was the</p>

               <p>person in charge at Broad Street—Denham went there occasionally to put him right—in consequence of deficiencies within the last twelve months, I have discharged several servants, principally barmaids—I was aware of the deficiency, but I could not trace it until I received information from the police—I gave Denham into custody on 2nd September, about three weeks after I had received information—the signatures on the counterfoils of 20th August, 23rd August, and 2nd September are in Denham's writing, and also the figures on the counterfoils—on 23rd August there is forty-four dozen and fix dozen seltzer; that is in Denham's writing—the figures on 2nd September are also in his writing—Denham had the sole control of the cellar, and no one else.</p>

On Saturday, 20th August, about 8 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner Gabriel driving a horse and van—I followed him to London Bridge—about 10.30 I saw him coming back over London Bridge, with his van—he went into Moorgate Street, where he met the two Westley's and Humphries—he stopped his van, got off, and spoke to them—they were waiting with a two-horse van at the Swan's Nest, a public-house in Moorgate Street—Gabriel spoke to the elder Westley—he then drove into Fore Street, and then to Cripplegate Buildings—at that time the Westleys and Humphries were with the other van in London Wall—I saw Gabriel take from underneath some sacks in his van two boxes containing four dozen each—he took them to the Westley's van, and the elder Westley received them—they then drove away in different directions—the younger Westley stood at the corner of Philip Lane, five or six yards off—I should think he could see what happened—after the boxes had been put in the van the younger Westley got up, and drove away with the other—on 23rd August I again followed Gabriel—I saw him meet the Westley's at the same place, after he had been to London Bridge—he took a box con<lb/>taining four dozen from his own van to the Westley's van—he had stopped in Cripplegate Buildings, and the others in London Wall—the younger Westley stood by, and saw the first box removed, and he spoke to Gabriel—I then saw a second box, carried by Humphries, which Gabriel gave to him, from the one-horse van, and he took it over to the two-horse van, and</p>

               <p>gave it to the elder Westley—I then saw Gabriel count out three dozen, and put them in a basket, and carry it to the two-horse van, and give it to Westley—the younger Westley was then in a public-house—after the con<lb/>versation with Gabriel he left, and went into a public-house; he came out of the public-house, got up in the van, and drove it away in one direction, and Gabriel went in another direction—on 2nd September I was in com<lb/>pany with Lawley—I saw Gabriel deliver goods at London Bridge on that day, at Mr. Perrett's stores, in Joiner Street, Tooley Street—before he went there I saw him deliver two dozen at a coffee-shop in Duke Street, Tooley Street, to a Mr. White—he then went to Mr. Perrett's, where he delivered four dozen of lemonade, in two boxes—I then saw Gabriel go through Snow Fields, Union Street, and through all the back streets, to Southwark Bridge, where he met the two-horse van and the Westleys and Humphries—they went to Upper Thames Street, where they had a conversation for four or six minutes, and then the younger Westley drove to Southwark Bridge again—Gabriel followed behind with his van—they stopped in Sumner Street, Southwark, and young Westley left the ran and stood about twenty yards off—I saw Gabriel and the elder Westley pass four boxes containing lemonade and soda from the one-horse van to the two-horse van—Gabriel also put two dozen of soda water in a basket, and put them in the two-horse van—the younger Westley could see what was being done—when he saw the first box come from Gabriel's van he started away and stopped about twenty yards off—I went up to him where he was standing—I told him I was a police officer, and I should take him for being concerned in receiving a quantity of lemonade and seltzer water from Gabriel—he said "I have had nothing to do with this transaction, and I have told them both of it many a time"—I then went up to where Lawley had stopped the two-horse van—I told the prisoners I should take them down to the station, and we did so on the van—on the way to the station young Westley said to his father "I have told you not to do this, and it is through you I have got into trouble"—about 2 o'clock the same afternoon I went with Lawley to Mr. Perrett's, where I saw Denham—I had seen him before open the door to Gabriel at the stores—I saw him when Gabriel delivered the four dozen lemonade—I told him we were police officers, and asked him what he received in Joiner Street on that day from Gabriel—he said "I don't know him by that name; I know <hi rend="italic">Tom.</hi> I received a gross of lemonade"—I said "How did you receive it?"—he said "In three boxes of four dozen each"—I said "Did you receive any seltzer water?"—he said "Yes, two dozen"—I said "Did you count them?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I have only seen you receive from Gabriel four dozen of lemonade, and no seltzer water, and I have been watching you all the time"—he made no reply—something then passed with Mr. Perrett, and he was given into custody.</p>

I am at present in Holloway Prison—I have been con<lb/>victed of offences similar to this—I know Banks and Chapman—I was pre<lb/>sent when Chapman was arrested in Stamford Street—I saw him taken by the Sheriff's officer to Horsemonger Lane—Banks and Lawrence were there with me—Lawrence was the attorney—he was also convicted with me—we went down together to Horsemonger Lane—I have seen Chapman before that in Whitecross Street after a previous arrest—I was there some time with him—this is a consent by Chapman to a judgment at my suit—this John Harris on it is not my writing—I don't know whose writing it is—I never saw it before to my knowledge—it is witnessed by Henry Banks, but it does not look like his writing—I think the signature is his, but the other part is not in his writing—Chapman never owed me any money, and I never lent him any—I don't think I lent him money at any time—I was not present when the consent was given—I never saw it until the other day at the Police Court—at the time Chapman was arrested I was not aware that it was at my suit—this deposition, made after the arrest, and immedi<lb/>ately before the adjudication is filled up in Banks' handwriting—it is chiefly printed, but it is filled up by Banks—it is Chapman's deposition, sworn before the Registrar in Horsemonger Lane Gaol, after the arrest and before the adjudication—it is dated the 22nd December—the signature, "John Harris," to that is my writing, but the rest is filled up by Banks—the resi<lb/>dence</p>

               <p>of the executing creditor, "Ball's Pond Road," and the amount, "25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," are in Banks' writing—there is a question, "In what Court?"and the answer, "In the Major's Court, London," is in Banks' writing—"John Harris, Ball's Pond Road," is the first creditor in the three days' statement—that is in Banks' handwriting—the affidavit verifying that is in my writ<lb/>ing, all but the signature—the first name on the ten days' statement is "John Harris, Ball's Pond Road, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., money lent in 1869"—that is my filling up—the whole of the page is in my writing—the general affidavit of the 26th May, verifying the proceedings, is filled up in Banks' writing.</p>

Q.</hi> You knew Chapman in Whitecross Street some times before these proceedings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose twelve months before—Banks and myself had some proceedings taken against us at the last Sessions—I believe that Banks is considered skilful in getting persons through the Court—some hundreds of persons had availed themselves of his services in going through the Court—he usually receives from 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing so—I was em-ployed by him as servant, and did what I was directed to—no one but Chapman was ever prosecuted that we took through the Court—these forms that were used were kept in the office—they are common with solicitors—we kept a large quantity of them in the office—I was Banks' clerk at the time of the arrest, and at the time of these proceedings—I did not make any arrangement with Chapman that he was to be outside the office on per<lb/>pose to be arrested—I don't think Herrick was the person who arrested him—I think it was one of his men—Banks and Lawrence were present at the time—I don't remember whether Chapman objected to be locked up—I did not instruct any boy to go and point out Chapman as the person to be arrested, to the officer—I don't know that any boy was sent, and I don't re<lb/>member a boy being there—with the exception of myself, John Harris for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there are only three other creditors, "Holmes, the ironmonger, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mr. Guyatt, the Secretary of the Alum and Ammonia Company, 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Coleman Street, and am Secretary to the Alum and Ammonia Company—Chapman was formerly in the employ of the Company, as manager of the works—I know his handwriting very well—the signature, "James Chapman," to the consent to judgment, is in his writing—the petition of bankruptcy also bears his signature, also the deposition, the three days' statement, and the affidavit verifying it—the affidavit to the ten days' statement is also signed by Chapman—he was first of all arrested</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe those works at Bow had been carried on for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for several years—it was carried on for some time under private hands, and was converted into a public company—Chapman was a plumber by trade—he was the plumber at the works, prior to being appointed manager—he was manager about three years, up to 1868—about that time he made some statement with reference to me and the accounts, and I brought an action against him for slander—prior to that I had requested him to resign his office of manager, the directors being dissatisfied with him—I asked him to resign, telling him at the same time that he would be dismissed if he did not—he was offered a sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to resign—he was not asked to resign because the works did not pay—he declined to resign—he was receiving 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year at that time, and, latterly, a bonus of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every six months—he did not produce from the raw material sup-plied to him what he ought to have done, and the directors were dissatisfied—he knew nothing about the accounts—he said nothing about them not being properly kept until after his dismissal, and he then made a statement that I had falsified the accounts, and I brought an action against him, and recovered 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages and 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coats—that was the foundation of the debt of 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that money has not been paid, or any part of it—I took four bills from him for this debt—they were accepted by Mr. Wood—I am not aware that Mr. Wood was sued—Chapman was discharged on 26th May, from bankruptcy, and I applied to the Court of Bankruptcy for leave to prosecute him—they gave me leave to do as I liked—the debt has not been paid, not a penny.</p>

I have been a sailor since 1824—I was engaged by the prisoner to act as master of his vessel—I have confessed myself guilty of having destroyed this ship, and I wish I had done it long since—Gillies first made the suggestion to me when the ship was about half loaded in Liverpool—he asked me if I would do something for him—I asked him what he meant, and he partly told me—I said that I did not under<lb/>stand such work—when I asked what he meant, he said he had had the vessel a length of time, and she was doing nothing, if I could do something for him he would make me a present—I said that I did not understand his presents—that was all that passed then—he came to me again next day, and asked me if I would do something for him, and do away with the vessel—I said I could not think of doing such a thing—he asked me why—I said I should lose my certificate and my character, and he swore his Maker that he would haul the vessel up and get her round in Dublin—I asked him if he would pay me off; he said he would not—nothing more passed on that day—he told me he would make me a present amounting to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more if I would do for her—after being at anchor he told me I might do a good turn for him—I asked him to buy a few small tools for me, for there were none in the vessel—a large screw auger, an American one, was hanging up—I asked the price of it—he said "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "It is too much," and I went away—he called me back, and said that we should have it for a half-Crown—he asked me if I had any money in my pocket—I said "Yes" and I paid for the auger, fetched it on board, and left it in his stores, and I gave way to take 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a present—he bored a hole with the auger and put a plug in the hole, and I meddled with the plug, and could not get it in again.</p>

This document is in my writing—it is dated 17th June, 1869—on that day I received 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Peane, which I was told came from Mrs. Hughes—I forget how I received it, or whether I re<lb/>ceded it from the defendant, or his wife—when I said I received it from Pearse, I meant through him—I kept that money—I put my signature to the document the day I received the money—I think I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the defendant just prior to his bankruptcy in Lewes—I was not attorney for the plaintiff, I believe Mr. Harrison was—I gave an undertaking to appear and consent to the judgment the day the writ was issued, and the result was the defendant was only in prison a few hours; when the Insol<lb/>vent Court was in existence, in 1861, that was an every day occurrence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an inventory of goods, at 59, Lancaster Road, Netting Hill, the property of Thomas Pearse, a bankrupt—that was the house he used to occupy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you acting as the solicitor for the assignees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; under the bankruptcy at Lewes—it was by my advice that he went down to Lewes, and sought the protection of the Lewes Bankruptcy Court, as being more expeditious and less cost—Mrs. Hughes is a debtor of the defendant's to a large amount—this inventory was to be given over to Mrs. Hughes for the money she had advanced, but it was found not to be a good assignment, and the assignees in the London Bankruptcy took pensions, so that neither Mrs. Hughes nor the defendant got any of that furniture at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Robert William Ediss, an architect and surveyor—he is the sub-lessor of the property at Twickenham, of which Captain Haggard is the freeholder—certain sums of money were advanced by Captain Haggard to Pearse from time to time—on 16th April, 1869, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced, and also a cheque for 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same day—they were cheques payable to Wheeler, and are endorsed by Wheeler—they were advanced to Wheeler for Pearse—on the 8th May there was a further sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the back of that cheque is endorsed by Pearse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at Heath Road, Twickenham, and am agent to Mr. Swanston, the ground landlord of the Twickenham estate—in April, 1869, I went and saw the houses, the leases of which have been proved—the leases are not granted until the houses are roofed—Mr. Swanston was ill in bed at that time with rheumatic fever, and I attended to the business of granting the leases, on 30th April, to Warlow, 14, Chepstow Terrace, built by Peane, on 1st May, 15, 16, and 17, Chepstow Terrace, to Sexton, also built by Pearse, and on 6th May,' 9 and 10, Am<lb/>yand Park Road, to Mr. Levi—on the 3rd of May I paid Pearse a cheque for 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a clerk to Messrs. Blagg &amp; Edwards, solicitors, for two or three years—a little before the 16th July I saw some<lb/>thing which I communicated to Inspector Russell—I got tickets from Jordan—they are all initialed with my initials on the back—Jordan was a ticket clipper at the Fenohurch Street Station of the Great Eastern Rail-way Company—Bodger relieved him—when I got the ticket from Jordan it was in the condition it now is—(<hi rend="italic">ticket produced</hi>)—he gave it me by the booking-office, down stairs—he was on duty there, clipping—I came to know Jordan through Parsonage, who told me he could show me how to travel for nothing—that was some days before I got the ticket from Jordan—he introduced me to Jordan in a public-house opposite the station—I then told Mr. Russell what I had seen—the date on the ticket is 16th July, No. 9015, third<lb/>class, half return—I met Mr. Russell by appointment, and he and I initialed the ticket—on 18th July I had a meeting with Parsonage at Fenchurch Street—Bodger was there, in uniform, at the clipping place, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw something take place between Parsonage and Bodger—Bodger gave Parsonage tickets, and Parsonage gave me one—it was a third<lb/>class single ticket to Black<lb/>wall, No. 7092 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I always handed these tickets to Mr. Russell after I initialed them—Parsonage and I travelled together to Blackwall—at the time these tickets were given by Bodger to Parsonage and handed to me, they were clipped—I did not go all the way to Blackwall, I alighted at Shadwell or Stepney—Parsonage went on to where he lived—on 27th July I went to the Blackwall booking<lb/>office, in Fenchurch Street—I received this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say from whom—it is No. 5278, half-return from Fenchurch Street to West India Docks, third-class—I went either to Shadwell or Stepney—on 28th July I received this ticket from one of the prisoners (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not initialed—I did not use it, I travelled with a legitimate ticket—J. T. Avery went by the name of "Little Joe"—I remember on oth August going to Foster's public-house with J. T. Avery—I received these two tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from "Little Joe," one at the public-house and one elsewhere—No. 8029 is a third<lb/>class half return from Black-wall to West India Docks, August 5th—one or two days previous to this I saw Jordan, when I was going out, and he said "I shall not be here to-morrow, I will make it all right with Joe"—the other number is 5611, third<lb/>class, to Poplar, 5th August—Jordan introduced me to Joe—we went and had a glass together—Jordan said "Call in the afternoon, the tickets will be all right"—I called, and they were there for me—Avery told me to come in the office when I liked—he was a booking<lb/>clerk at Fenchurch Street—I</p>

               <p>think I saw Jordan and Avery on a Saturday, between 9 and 10 o'clock—A very said something about going to Gravesend, and would give me a couple of tickets if I came on Monday—I asked him for one on the Saturday morning, and he said "They are not up yet"—he said they would be up shortly—A very soon after that gave me one ticket, and Jordan gave me one—the one from Jordan was No. 604, first-class half return, Shad well, and the one from A very No. 3413, third-class to Black wall—I am not sure if they were clipped when given to me—I went on with a legitimate ticket—on 9th August I went to the Fenchurch Street Station—I saw J. T. A very—I got two tickets from him, third-class half returns, Nos. 1473 and 1541, to Blackwall—they were both clipped when I received them—I saw him give two tickets to two girls on this date—they passed through the window at the booking<lb/>office; but paid nothing—I believe they were clipped tickets—I cannot positively say—on 10th August I saw A very give a man a ticket whom I had seen on the line repeatedly—he did not pay for the ticket—on 12th August A very gave me two half tickets, second-class returns from Fenchurch Street to Blackwall, Nos. 9316 and 9317—on 13th August I took a man named Carter with me, and I found A very and Jordan at the side of the booking-office, in Fenchurch Street—A very said "How are you, old fellow; are you going down the-line to-day?"—I said "Yes, this is a friend of mine"—he said "Is it all right?"—I said "Yes"—he said "The proof of the pudding's in the eating"—after that J. T. Avery gave me two tickets—he gave me four on the 13th—the first ticket I got from Jordan on the 13th was put by him under the lining on the top of the stool, which is just inside the door where he nips the tickets—he said "There it is, under the stool"—I then went into the booking-office, and Avery gave me one; he pulled several out of his pocket, and gave me a first-class—all the tickets he pulled out of his pockets were nipped tickets, and different colours, and for different stations—the two tickets given to me by Avery and Jordan were for the East and West India Docks, Nos. 9152 and 9153, first-class, 13th August—I put them in my pocket, and travelled with legitimate tickets—I went again, later in the day, to the booking-office—Carter was with me—I saw J. T. Avery, who gave me two more tickets, first-class returns to West India Docks, 9159 and 9164—I did not go down with the train, and gave the tickets to Mr. Russell—I saw Avery again, later in the day; he gave me a ticket to Limehouse—I never paid anything for these tickets—they were all clipped when I received them—on 21st July I saw Parsonage at the Fenchurch Street Station—I made these notes in my pocket-book when I went home—I also saw him on 22nd July—on the 21st he got two tickets; on the 23rd he got three tickets—Parsonage got the tickets by the side of the booking-office—on the 23rd Parsonage got three tickets from Jordan, one was for me, and one for a person named Knight, whom Parsonage had introduced to me, and one for himself—I lighted at Shadwell, and let thein go on—they were followed—on the 30th I received some tickets from Jordan—two nipped ones—one is produced—one was given up in mistake—Jordan was on duty as usual—I have re-peatedly seen Jordan take tickets out of his pocket—on 2nd August I received two tickets from Jordan, first<lb/>class, Fenchurch Street to Blackwall, 6329—on 2nd August I received two tickets from Jordan, one nipped and the other not, Nos. 9389 and 9390, second, half returns, Fenchurch Street to West India Docks—on 4th August I went with Jordan to a public-house, and he gave me two halves of tickets, 2415 and 2454, first, half returns, to</p>

               <p>Blackwall; and later on the 4th, he gave me a third half return, Line, house, 2932—I knew Parsonage first of all, some months since; he is a cigar merchant, and is in the Customs—he lived at Stepney—he said he had paid seven threepenny fares in fifteen years, that he had travelled the line, and had used the line four and five times a day, he used, at night, to bring up spirits by it—I think it was 18th July when I first received any tickets from Parsonage—in that month of July I was on the platform at Stepney, and a ticket collector named Rutterford said to Parsonage "Look out, there's a b—detective on the platform"—on the same day, when Parsonage got to Fenchurch Street, he said to a ticket collector named Treadgold "Come down, old fellow, and have a glass of ale"—we all three went together, and while in the public-house Parsonage said to Treadgold "Look out, old fellow, there is a detective after us; you had better warn the people; it has already been done at Stepney," and Treadgold's reply was "Don't trouble, all the b—'s on earth can't catch us"—on that morning Parsonage did not take a ticket at Stepney—I have never seen Parsonage take a ticket, though I have travelled with him several times, nor go near the ticket clippers to have his ticket clipped—Jordan and Bodger were on duty at the Fenchurch Street Station on one occasion, and a man named Hollingshead was there—I saw him take out a lot of tickets from his pockets, and give away one or two—I never saw Parsonage go by the Tilbury line—I have seen Edward Avery repeatedly in the booking-office—when Parsonage introduced me to Bodger, he said I was a friend of his, it was all right—I have seen Bodger put his hands into his pockets and pull out tickets, on several occasions—I have seen J. T. Avery pull out hundreds at a time, and sort them out—I have seen Bodger hand tickets to Parsonage—I received this first-class ticket from Jordan on 10th August, No. 7061, first, single to Blackwall—that was given to me at Fenchurch Street, just at the nipping place.</p>

Avery was—we had a conversation, and afterwards Melhuish, Jordan, Avery, and myself, went to Foster's public-house—I paid for something for them to drink—I heard Melhuish say to Avery "We shall be going up and down two or three times"—he said "All right, old boy, as often as you like"—we went back to the booking-office—we were at the door—I saw Melhuish speak to Jordan—Jordan said "Look in the stool"—I had previously seen Jordan sitting on the stool—I saw Melhuish put his hand in the top of the stool and take out a half return first<lb/>class ticket, which ticket I afterwards initialed, and gave to Russell—No. 9159—Avery was inside the office when Jordan did this—after we got this from the stool we went into the booking-office, and Jordan remained outside—Melhuish spoke to Avery; what I did not' hear—I saw Avery put his hand into his right-hand waistcoat pocket, I did not see what he pulled out, as Melhuish was between myself and Avery—we came out and went up stairs towards the platform—we passed Jordan, and he did not look at our tickets—he said "All right"—when we got to the train Melhuish showed me the other ticket and this one, No. 9164—there were four on that day—this one I received from Avery, which Melhuish gave me—I gave them all up to Russell—I went through to Shad well and back—I again went to the booking-office when I got back to Fenchurch Street—Avery was there, and he and Jordan, Melhuish, and myself, went over to the public-house to have some more drink at my expense—I heard Mel<lb/>huish say to Jordan we should want to go to Gravesend on the Monday—Jordan said he would see what he could do for us—we went back to the booking-office; the door was a little open—we went in—Avery said twice to Melhuish "Keep dark, keep dark"—I saw Avery take four halves of first-class tickets from his right-hand waistcoat pocket—we left then—we again passed Jordan, and he asked for no tickets—the numbers of these two tickets are 9152 and 9154—they were all clipped when we received them—we made use of other tickets which I bought in the morning—on 27th July I was at Stepney Station, at 9.50 up train—I saw Parsonage going through the door in the yard—he then returned to a man named Daniels, who was on duty as a ticket collector—I saw them speaking together—I saw Daniels take a number of tickets from his right-hand trowsers pocket, twenty or more, and give one of them to Parsonage—it was a third-class ticket, from the size of it—he did not take a ticket at the booking-office—he went up the steps, and passed a man named George Rutterford, and went on by the 9.55 train to Fenchurch Street—I went by the same train</p>

This, Sir, in as near as I can tell, and I am positive, on the whole, I have underrated it," signed by Davies—Melhuish gave me that receipt—I was certainly under the impression that the money I gave to Melhuish, and for which that is the receipt, had been paid to Davies—I am under that impression—I have not heard Davies swear that he has not been paid—on 15th July I directed Melhuish to pay it—I might say this as a rule, Melhuish had money in hand of mine—I don't say that Melhuish gave me this receipt ou the 15th, it might be some days afterwards—I have no doubt whatever that Davies was employed in my office, I saw him myself two or three times—lie must have been employed by Melhuish, he was not employed by me—he was</p>

We have been married many jean, but are without family, and have determined upon bringing a little one up as our own. My constant care shall be for the child, and every<lb/>thing which will be for the child's comfort shall be strictly studied. Should you think more of this, and will write saying where and when I can see you and how I shall know you, we shall feel obliged.

Willis, the same as the previous one—in consequence of that I went to the Brixton Railway Station, and saw the prisoner, Waters come by a train from the City—I had in my hand the letter I had" received that morning—I must have been in error when I said I tore it up on my way to the station—I tore it up after I met the prisoner—I addressed her as Mrs. Willis (I had previously spoken to the ticket collector)—she replied "Mr. Cowen"—we then sat down, and she said "I have had the letter," and I then told her the circumstances about my daughter, I told her that my daughter had been outraged, that she had left me early in the year on a visit, at sixteen years of age, that the child was not yet born, but that it would be in about a fortnight, and she was then at Mrs. Castle's, waiting to be confined—I said, "I mention these circum<lb/>stances so that you may not adopt an illegitimate child without knowing it"—she replied, "That will make no difference with me"—she then told we that her husband was a representative of a shipbuilding firm, that they</p>

               <p>had been married thirteen years, and were without family, and were extremely anxious to adopt a child as their own—she still refused to give me her address, but said she would do so after a short time—she said she should not like the child to be taken from them after they had learnt to love it, or words to that extract—she said that the name she hood signed in her letter was not her name, but the would also give me that when she gave me her address—I said as doom as the child was born I would communicate with her, at the same post-office in Camberwell—I gave her my name and address—she laughed, and said "How funny, I live within a stone's throw of you, and I can almost see your house from my windows"—we then separated at the station—my daughter was confined on the Saturday week following, the 14th May, of a male child, and on the Sunday or Monday I wrote by post to the name and address given in the advertisement announcing it (<hi rend="italic">The letter was called for bed not produced</hi>) it was merely to inform her of the birth of the child, and request<lb/>ing her to call at my residence—she did call on the Tuesday, the 7th, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I told her of the birth of the child—she asked when she could have it—I replied "When will it be convenient for you to take it?"—she said "To night," and an appointment was made for 9.30 that evening, at the Walworth Station, to receive the child—that same night I went to Mrs. Castle's, 164, Camberwell Road, with my land-lady, Mrs. Guerra, who brought out the baby, and I went with her in a cub to the Walworth Road Station—Waters had not arrived—we waited there forty minutes, she then came—she looked at the baby and admired it—she said it was a beautiful child, and she wrapped it up in a large shawl and took it away—she promised to call on me in two or three days—it was about 10.15 when she took charge of the baby—I believe there never was born a more healthy child, so I was told; I don't know, myself, I did not look at it—Waters did not give me any address at that time, she was to call on me—she did call two or three days afterwards—it was on the Tuesday she took the child, and she called I think on the Friday following; I saw her and asked how the child was—she said she was delighted with it, it was a beautiful baby, and that her husband was equally fond of it, "In fact," she said, "it is all a boy"—I then asked when she would bring it, when I could see it she said she was busy making nice clothes for it, naming certain articles, I forget what they were, a hood, a pelisse, and something—I said "Allow me to make it a present of those"—she said "No, I don't require it, I have bought the materials, and I am having them made up"—I then took two sovereigns from my purse and put them on the table before her—she pushed them back to me, and refused to take them, saying "I know you have taken at a great expense, and I won't take it"—she got up to go away and I forced the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon her, and as she left the room she returned with the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in her hand, offering it back to me—I refused it, and told her to spend it on the child, and when she brought me the child I would give her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—she then left, and took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with her—during the whole of the interview she was speaking in praise of the child—as she was going away she said "I pass nearly every day, and I suppose if I call with it you won't turn me away"—I said I should be glad to see her, and it, at any time she called—she did not call again I neither saw or heard of her afterwards—up to that time I did not know where she lived—on the Thursday in the following week, the 26th, toe officer Keef called upon mo—I told him the facts, and in consequence of</p>

               <p>has been very ill, suffering from diarrhoea;" she said that she had had a doctor attending it, and she had also spoken, the day before, for a wet-nurse for the child—I did not take much notice how the child was clothed at that time, I only noticed its appearance generally, it was so dreadfully emaci<lb/>ated and deplorable—I then 'went away, and returned to the house later in the day with some things for the child—on that occasion I went down to the lower room of the house, what they call a breakfast parlour, below the level of the earth; the front kitchen—the room I had been in before was the parlour—in that lower room I saw four or five infants—I think there were three on a couch, and two on chairs, on a bed made up for them—I saw four other children out in the back yard—they were older, I should say from two to three years old; one was four years old—they were merely running about, playing—I asked Waters, who went down with me, what on earth she could want with taking Miss Cowen's child, already having such a number there—she said that the others were children that were paid for weekly, and they were taken away from her after some time; but she wished Miss Cowen's child to be brought up entirely as her own—I knew, at that time, that the child had been removed from the house in the morning—she said she had done everything that was possible in her power for the child—this was about 4 o'clock in the day—I remained there about ten minutes—I saw a child in Ellis's arms; she said it was her own baby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you give a description of Miss Cowen's child when you saw it just before it was taken away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had scarcely a bit of flesh on its bones, and the only thing I should have known it by was the hair; it was not crying or making any noise, not any of them, that I heard; it appeared to be dying almost; it could not make any noise, it was much too weak, I think, to make the slightest sound; it was scarcely human, it looked more like a monkey than a child—when it was born it was a very fine fat baby, and when I saw it there it was a shadow, not a bit of flesh on its bones—it would be much lighter in weight.</p>

               <p>together; the other two laid on their backs, with their mouth open, at the lower end of the sofa—they were all together, only the three were more towards the head of the sofa, and the others lower down; all five lay in the same direction—they were all quiet, and all appeared to be asleep from some cause—they all had some clothing on, infant's clothes, and very dirty indeed, saturated with wet, and smelt very offensively—I did not see any ap<lb/>pearance of food about—two of the infants appeared to me to be dying, the two that were lying on their backs; they were in an emaciated condition—I did nothing towards awaking them at that time—I said "To whom do these children belong?"—Waters said she did not know who the parents were—I said "Are these some more by adoption?"—she said "Yes"—I then said, in the presence of Ellis, "Have you any more?"—she said "Yet, a few; there are some older ones in the yard"—I went into the back yard, and there found five more; they appeared in better condition, one boy was a very fine child—I said to Waters "These children look better, how do you account for that?"—she said "We have so much a week with these"—I then left the house, and fetched Dr. Puckle, the medical officer of the parish—I returned to the house in about two hours with Dr. Puckle, and Mr. Cowen—I believe we were again let in by Ellis, but I am not positive—little Cowen was brought into the room; it was not in the same condition in which I had seen it before; it was cleaned up, I mean it had got clean clothes on—I did not observe any difference in any part of its person—I noticed the child's head particularly, for I have children of my own, and it did not appear to me that its head had ever been washed—the child was very dirty, particularly about the head; it had a good crop of hair, but it looked like a shrivelled up monkey—it was in the same state as before, it did not appear more lively—Mr. Cowen said "Mrs. Willis, you have been murdering this child, "and he shed tears when he saw it—Waters said that the had not; the child had been ill, and she had had Dr. Harris to attend to it; and also that she was going to put it out to wet-nurse that day—I then went down stairs; I found the five infants still there—they had all got nice' clean clothes on then, and were laid in rows on the sofa, and feed-ing-bottles by their sides, and teats in their mouths—I believe three were on the sofa, and two in a little crib by the side of the sofa—they did not appear to be in any different state, except the clothes—they were all in this quiet state, apparently asleep; I mean they appeared to be all void of any feeling, in a state of torpor, unconscious, in a state of stupor—I did not see that they were using the bottles; they contained food—I observed this bottle (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) on the table, with the cork out and lying by it—this was in the kitchen where the infants were—I smelt it and thought it was laudanum—Dr. Puckle also smelt it; he marked the bottle and gave it to me, and it has been preserved—Dr. Puckle said the only way that might save Miss Cowen's child's life was by putting it out to wet-nurse, so that it could have its natural food—Waters said she was going to put it out to wet-nurse that day, and had sent for Mrs. Rowland—Mrs. Rowland was ultimately sent for again, and came, and Cowen's child was delivered over to her—one of the other five infants was the prisoner Ellis's, and that was in the same state as the others; she said it was her child—it was me of the five that laid on the sofa; it was quiet and asleep the same as the rest—Ellis took possession of it, and the other four remained there till Monday; I then came with the divisional surgeon, and had them removed to Lambeth Workhouse—asked Waters if she could tell me who the children belonged to—she said she</p>

               <p>could not, she did not know who the fathers or mothers were—I asked her if any of the children had got any names—she said "No"—I said "How long have you been in this business?"—she said "About four years"—I said "How many have you had in that time?"—she said "About forty"—Ellis said "Oh, more than forty"—Waters said "Oh no, say forty"—I asked whether she could tell me what had become of any of the other children—she said some had been sent away, and some took home—she did not tell me where any of them were at that time—I felt it to be my duty to consult my superior officers as to what course I was to pursue; and having done so, I returned to the house on Monday, in company with Tyers, 195, Dr. Pope, and Captain Baynes—the door was opened to us by Waters—I said to her "Mrs. Waters, I shall take you into custody for not providing proper food and nourishment for the illegitimate male child of Janet Tassie Cowen, whereby his life was endangered"—she said "Very well"—she also said that the children had been attended by the doctor, and repeated that they had plenty of milk, which her milk bills would show—at that time Ellis came up stairs—I told her that I should also take her into custody for being con<lb/>cerned with her sister in having four infants in their possession and not providing proper food and nourishment for the same, whereby their lives were endangered—at the station, after the charge was read over to the prisoners, Waters said "Believe me, what my sister has done has been entirely under my direction; I am the sinner, and I must suffer"—they were searched by a female, who handed me seventy-nine pawnbrokers' dupli<lb/>cates and a marriage certificate, a purse containing 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and another purse, found on Ellis, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent the whole of the ten chil<lb/>dren to the Police Court, and nine of them were taken to Lambeth Work-house, Ellis's child remained with her—as the children had no names, they were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9—after the prisoners were taken into custody I searched their house, and found there seventeen pawn<lb/>tickets, a receipt, and a medical certificate of attendance on 'Waters' husband—I took possession of a quantity of children's clothing and a milk bill, which I produce—I traced two persons who supplied milk to the house—I saw little Cowen constantly afterwards until 24th June, when he died; I saw it about three hours before it died—I saw the other nine children frequently at the workhouse—I did not get the articles out of pledge that the seventy-nine duplicates refer to; I have seen them in pledge, and there are some here—I produce a list of the articles found in the house, and the things are in Court—(<hi rend="italic">The lift consisted of a large quantity of articles of children's clothing</hi>)—They were all dirty—I saw the whole of the articles to which the seventy-nine duplicates related—a great number related to furniture—the best part of the articles are here—I have a list of such as relate to babies' clothing, extending from about January last year to May this year; they amount to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produce a detailed list of them; they were pledged with a variety of pawnbrokers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth—Brixton is within that district—on Saturday, 11th June, I was called upon by Sergeant Relf—in consequence of what he said I went to 4, Frederick Terrace, shortly after 11 o'clock—I went down stain to the front room, and there found the two prisoners, and five babies, besides one which was Ellis's—they were all together in the front kitchen—Ellis had hers in her arms, the others were lying in a row, three on the sofa and two in a cot adjoining, or in chairs made up as a cot—one of the five was pointed out to me as Miss Cowen's child—Waters took it out of the cot and brought it to me—I examined it minutely, sufficiently to form an opinion—I examined its lower parts; I took the clothes partly off—it had on the ordinary clothes of a baby of that age, a night-dress—they were quite clean—the body of the child was very much emaciated, extremely wasted, the besides almost coming through the skin—it was a miserably wasted child, no flesh hardly on the bones, the bones almost protruding through the skin, and it had that aged appearance in the face which made it difficult to form an opinion of its age; but I took it to be a month old, and I was informed that was its age—it was not a small child with regard to the size of its bones, I should say it had been a fine child, but at the time I saw it, it was no miserably wasted, that it was nothing but skin and bone—it was in a thoroughly insensible state; the eyes were closed, the limbs hung down, and it appeared in a very profound stupor—I raised the eyelids, and found the pupils very much contracted, not in a natural state—I should say that in ordinary sleep the pupils would be somewhat contracted, but they were con<lb/>tracted more than ordinary, very much contracted—I endeavoured to rouse the child, and used considerable endeavour for that proceed it would not at all rouse with a slight endeavour—I should think it was untter my obser<lb/>vation on that occasion quite twenty minutes—I succeeded slightly in arousing it, just to show it was not in a natural sleep—neither diarrhoea or thrush would account for the state it was in—my opinion is that the child was in a state of narcotism, arising from the administration of some narcotic poison—laudanum would be the very thing that I should suppose had been administered, from the appearance of the child—it would be a very improper thing to administer to a child—supposing it to have been affected by thrush or diarrhoea, laudanum, to produce insensibility, would be a very improper remedy—it would be difficult to say what amount had been ad<lb/>ministered, some would be under its influence with a smaller dose than others—I asked Waters about the child having been ill—she said it had suffered from diarrhaea and from thrush—I saw that it had suffered from thrush, but the thrush was somewhat improving—I asked what food she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190116"/>
               <p>had given it, and what medicine; she said she had given it no other medi<lb/>cine than what Dr. Harris had ordered; that he had been attending the child, he had seen it previously, and she expected him that day—I asked her if she had given it any sleeping medicine, or any soothing syrup—she said she had not, she said she had given it corn<lb/>flour, arrowroot, and plenty of milk, as her bills would prove—from the state of the child, I formed an opinion that it had been either improperly fed, or that it had been fed on such food as had not nourished it—I noticed the other children slightly—I noticed one other child; it seemed very ill—they were all very quiet, I did not examine them tho<lb/>roughly—they were all quite quiet, and it afterwards struck me as being a very remarkable thing that they should be so very quiet for such a length of time—I was in the room I should say nearly half an hour, so as to know that there was no cry all the time, nor any motion of the children—Cowen's child was given to Mrs. Rowland to take charge of—I ascertained that she was a healthy woman, and capable of nursing the child—I thought her a very suitable person, her baby being only seven weeks old—she had suffi<lb/>cient milk for her own baby as well as this one—at the request of Mr. Cowen I attended the child while it was with Mrs. Rowland—I saw it daily—it rallied for a time, it improved for some days, then there was a return of the diarrhoea, but not very excessively, and the child went off again and did not rally; the day before its death it became in an insensible state, with convulsions—it died on 24th June—in my opinion it died of a combined cause, atrophy, or extreme wasting, with exhaustion and congestion of the brain—my judgment has been formed upon a general view of this case, and the cases of the other children—there is no doubt that many children brought up by hand will die of atrophy; still, my judgment would also be formed from what I saw in this case alone, seeing that the child was narcotised at the time I saw it—in my judgment death arose from want of suitable food sufficiently early, and also from the improper administration of a narcotic—many children die that are brought up by hand; I mean a disproportionate number to those that are suckled—I am unable to form a decided opinion as to the proportion—there is no doubt that with great care a larger proportion would be saved—where a number of children are brought up by hand together, the chances of living would be less—I saw very little of the other children who subse<lb/>quently died; but I heard of their state from the medical men who attended them, and I also saw them several times—they wore under the care of Dr. Bullen, and Dr. Pope also saw them on several occasions, and from what they told me, and from what I saw of them myself, I have formed an opinion of the cause of their respective deaths—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence, at it would open an inquiry into the antecedent circumstances attending the con-dition of each of the children, and would not assist the Jury in arriving at the cause of the death of the child in question.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the evidence was admissible, if the same mode of treat-ment was pursued towards all the children, then the effect of that treatment upon the others became important, in relation to the cause of the death in question</hi>)—My opinion is that there was congestion of the brain in the other four children—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and the con<lb/>gestion of the brain formed a very important part of the cause of death of those four infants—I had noticed the condition of those children whilst living, and they all appeared to have been more or less subjected to the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190117"/>
               <p>influence as the infant that was entirely under my charge from the time of its removal, the kind of stupid condition, which led me to believe that narcotic had probably been also administered to them, as I was certain had been in this case—I attribute the cause of their death to a want of suitable food, and probably also to the administration of narcotics—when I went into the front kitchen, with Sergeant Relf, I noticed on the table a small phial, lying with the cork beside it—this is it—I marked it—it contained a few drops of a fluid, which I was of opinion was laudanum—I subsequently examined it more thoroughly, and I am certain it was laudanum—I think it is tincture of opium, which is laudanum—there were only about three drops in the bottle—I don't think it was in a diluted state—I think it was as it would be sold as laudanum—after smelling the bottle, and handing it to Relf to smell also, I again asked Waters if she was quite sure she had not given the child anything to make it sleep—she said she had not—cleanliness is very im<lb/>portant with a child, whether brought up by hand, or in the ordinary way—this child was not kept well clean, under the arms and behind the ears, and generally it had not been well washed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say "not well washed;"I suppose then we may conclude that it had been washed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt it had been washed to some extent; but not habitually well washed—I have no doubt it had been washed at some time; but not as frequently as it ought to have been—a child suffering from diarrhoea would require it more frequently than others—a child taken from its mother three days after its birth, and exposed to the night air, would be liable to catch cold—a good deal would depend upon the kind of evening, and partly on the constitution of the child—a strong child would probably be less liable to take cold than a weakly one—the circumstances of the mother during the period of gestation may in some cases have an influence upon the constitution of the ohild; but this appeared to be a remarkably fine and healthy ohild; I believe it has some influence mentally upon the child; I mean on the nervous system—that might be the case without its exhibiting external signs of it—in the case of an illegitimate child, the mother, endeavouring to conceal the matter, and being under alarm and apprehension, might act upon the child she was bearing—I had no means of discovering whether this child had been so affected or not; it might have been, without my being able to discover ft—in the bringing up of a child by hand it might make a slight difference if it was affected in that way—the bringing up children by hand is attended with very considerable difficulty and danger in all cases; there is a greater risk of the child not living—in all cases it is attended with some risk—I have had a great experience, medically, as regards children who are brought up by hand—it is not a fact that the majority of them die—I cannot give you the per<lb/>centage—milk and water and sugar would agree, at first, with many children, and disagree afterwards—if the digestive functions became deranged, then the milk Would very likely not agree with it—if the milk was the cause of the derangement, I think it would appear within three days—cow's, milk agrees with most children, with sugar and water—a little sugar is added, because infants will not take cow's milk—it is not sweetened, as a rule—there is more saccharine matter in the human milk, and there<lb/>fore sugar is added to approximate the cow's milk to it, which would probably make it more likely to agree with the child—I don't think it would have taken the milk without sugar; but if the sugar was discontinued after two or three days, I don't think it would make that difference that it would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190118"/>
               <p>disagree with the child—I don't think it would have any injurious effect upon the digestion—if I found an alteration in the food, upon which the child did not do well, I should be disposed to attribute it to the change of food—anything that deranges the digestive organs of a child of that age would be likely to produce diarrhoea, and derange the whole system—thrush may arise from that cause; but it will also frequently arise in infants with<lb/>out any apparent cause—soothing medicines are not usually given to children suffering from diarrhoea, they are given to keep them quiet—I believe it is not an unfrequent thing for those who have charge of them to give them Godfrey's cordial, or syrup of poppies (it goes by different namet), and laudanum sometimes, I suppose—I should never give it to a young infant, I can't say what others would do—a small amount of laudanum might have a tendency to stop diarrhoea; but I think that would be very much counterbalanced by the injury it would do to the digestive functions—a small amount of laudanum might be given by some medical men, for diarrhoea; but not to produce narcotism, or insensibility, or what I witnessed in this infant—if nurses give anything of the kind, they probably do it to keep the children quiet—if given in excess, for the purpose of stopping diarrhoea, it would produce stupor—at the time I saw this child it was Mid to be suffering from diarrhoea; but when it was removed there was not much diarrhoea, at first, when I attended it; very slight, indeed—I think it is probable it had been suffering from diarrhoea—if it had, it had been checked—there was less at the time I took charge of it—I can't say posi<lb/>tively that it had suffered from it, or that it had not, I only took the statement that I received—I could not speak with certainty, from my own observation—laudanum forms a principal ingredient in the soothing medi-cines I have named—syrup of poppies is not laudanum; but the active principle is very much the same, it is a narcotic—it is more often than not made up artificially with opium—poppy and opium are different things—you can extract an opiate from poppy—the syrup extracted from poppies is very like laudanum—it is sometimes given by nurses in excess—I am of opinion that there was nothing in this bottle besides laudanum or tincture of opium, which is almost the same thing—either, diluted, would be a very improper thing as a narcotic, and under any circumstances, it would be a very improper thing to give to a child—it would never be proper for a nurse to give Godfrey's cordial or laudanum to a child, not if it was diluted, or to give any soothing syrup—it would be most improper in all cases, unless a medical man had ordered it—I consider that a nurse never should give laudanum to any child of her own accord—I did not know Dr. Harris; I never spoke to him till yesterday—diarrhoea will of itself produce ema-ciation, more or less, according to the length of time it exists, and according to its severity—if an opiate had been improperly adininia-tered for the purpose of checking the diarrhoea, and had checked it, the counter effect would be a still greater derangement of the digestive system—the direct effect of an opiate is to render the liver torpid; that would, in a child of this age, still further increase the emaciation—if an opiate had been administered to check the diarrhosa, I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> not be surprised to find a child in a state of emaciation—I had never seen Mrs. Rowland before that day, to my knowledge; I considered her a healthy woman; I depended upon what she told me, and also from an examination of the state of the breast as regarded the state of her milk, and also from examining her infant, which was a very healthy one—I cannot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190119"/>
               <p>recollect her age—I think she said she had four children—if a woman has plenty of milk and her health is good, I think she might fairly suckle two children; a good deal would depend upon the nourishment given to her; she would require a greater supply, and she had it—the child improved the first two or three days while with her, it improved when it had the change of food; I account for its not continuing to improve, from the state it was in at the time I <hi rend="italic">first</hi> saw it—the diarrhoea returned, but very slightly; it had a little astringent medicine for that, only on one day—catechu, with a small quantity of ammonia; no opium—that was administered, I think, about a week before its death; it checked the diarrhoea—a very small quantity was given; there were several doses at intervals; Mrs. Rowland told me they were given at the proper times—they did not appear to have any other effect than to stop the diarrhoea—one of the injurious effects of opiates improperly administered would be congestion of the brain—laudanum is never applied externally to infants in diarrhoea, to my knowledge; I have never ordered such a thing—I should think a flannel with brandy on it and a few drops of laudanum, bound round the bowels was improper, but it was not on the bowels of the child—I could not undertake to say it was not at any time; I think if it had been it would have been improper; it could do no good—if the laudanum was applied in a concentrated state to the surface, a certain amount might probably be absorbed, which might produce some stupor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and practice as a surgeon and general practitioner at 2, Northamp<lb/>ton Terrace, Denmark Hill, about three quarters of a mile from where the prisoners lived—I know both the prisoners—I first saw them on 9th Hay of the present year; I knew Waters by the name of Mrs. Lackburn—I was sent for to the house on 7th May; I went on the 9th; it was to see a child about two and a half years old—at the same time I saw another child, about a year and a half old, and an infant a few weeks or a month old, which was Mrs. Ellia's; it was a small child—I was not called on to attend the child a year and a half old, I merely saw it there; the one two and a half years old was the one I was called in to attend—on 1st June I was out, and when I arrived home I found I had been again sent for—I got there about 10 o'clock at night—I saw Ellis she said they</p>

               <p>had a child suffering from diarrhoea and flickness, which her Bister had brought up the previous evening from Bristol; she said it was about three weeks old—I was then shown a child about that age; Ellis had it in her arms in the front kitchen when I went in—a friend of mine called with me—there were some children in the room at the same time; two young infants, on the sofa—this was in a room below the ground, on the basement—I don't think I saw Waters that night—I did not take much notice of the two children, they appeared to be asleep—I have no means of knowing whether the child I law at that time was Cowen's child, only from what the prisoners have told me—it was a male child, and it appeared to be about three weeks old, and I have heard since from one or other that it was Cowen's child; it was not very lively—I heard that it had diarrhea and sickness, and I prescribed for it a preparation of mercury; the black oxide of mercury, triturated, in the form of a powder, to be dissolved—I took it out of my pocket, and mixed it with water, in the house—I did not administer it—it is not a soporific—it was intended to stop the diarrhoea—this was all on the same day, 1st June—I left directions if the child was not better that I was to be sent for the next morning—I ordered it to have milk and water, with sugar of milk dissolved in it—I was not sent for the next day—I went again on 3rd June, to see another child, my first patient—I don't think I saw this child on that occasion; I was told it was better—I did not make inquiry about the two children I had seen on the sofa, on 1st June—Ellis told me, without inquiry, that they had been left with them for a day or two, until a home could be found for them in the country—I know nothing of the number of children that were in the house—I can't say positively that I saw Cowen's child after the 1st of June—I new prescribed opiates for it, or for any other children there—I should not like to swear that I never saw it again, but I feel sure in my own mind that I did not; I am sure I never saw it professionally—I was not there at all on 10th June; I was there on the 8th, and saw Mrs. Ellia's child—I did not see Cowen's child on 10th, and prescribe for it—I was not expected to call and see it on the 11th—I saw Ellis's child on the 8th; it had diarrhoa—I directed beef tea to be given to Cowen's child—I think that was on my second visit, without seeing it.</p>

Q.</hi> On 1st June, I understand you to say, you did see Cowen's child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was apparently suffering from diarrhoea; I was told that it was—children brought up by hand are very subject to diarrhoea—it was not more prevalent among children at that time than at any other—the medicine I have named was the only medicine I ordered—I prescribed again, the second time, without seeing it, not the same medicine; I think I altered it then, and prescribed <hi rend="italic">podophyllum,</hi> a new American medicine—I think it is in the pharmacopoeia—that was on my second visit, on 3rd June; it was in the form of a tincture; it is called vegetable mercury by some persons—we don't use it as an astringent, we use it more to act on the liver—it is not calculated in any way to produce torpor, or even sleep—I am a homoeopath—<hi rend="italic">podophyllum</hi> has been in use as a medicine for several years—it is recognized in our branch of the profession; I can't say that it is universally—I mixed so many drops in water for a tea-spoonful to be given at a dose, so many times a day—I can't tell how long the child took it—I gave about enough to last three or four days—I think I was told afterwards that the child was better—I will not swear positively that I did not see the child after the 1st—I don't remember that anything was</p>

               <p>said about thrush; I did not treat it for thrush especially—I ordered sugar of milk; that is not a medicine, it is an article of food sold at the chemists' with printed directions for its use—the effect of it is to make the cow's milk I nearer approach to the mother's milk; I ordered it for that purpose—I thought it very likely that the cow's milk was disagreeing with the child; it will disagree with a good many children, even when diluted—if I heard that a child had had cow's milk, with merely the addition of water, and that it was suffering from diarrhoea, in the absence of any other cause, I should attribute it to the milk—that would be a sufficient cause in many cases—I really did think at the time that the cow's milk was disagreeing with the child—that was my reason for ordering sugar of milk—there are, no doubt, some points of difference in the milk of different cows; the milk of one cow to-day and another to-morrow, might disagree with a child—when I saw the child on the 1st it was in a moderate condition as to clean<lb/>liness; I did not strip it—it seemed tolerably clean—I don't think she complained of its food disagreeing with it; she told me of sickness and durrhcea—I don't know what sort of sickness—I daresay I asked her at the time, but I do not remember now—I don't remember that she said its food disagreed with it, and that it was wasting away; she did not say much about that, because I understood she had only had it the previous night—she did not say she had had it three weeks; she said it was three weeks old—I called on the 8th—I don't remember that I made any inquiries then about the child; it was for Ellis's child then—I ordered sugar of milk for that—I did not inquire about the child I had ordered it for before; I sup<lb/>posed it was well then, I had not heard any more about it—I don't know of my own experience that soothing syrups, are often given by women and surces improperly to children—I don't remember saying before the Magis<lb/>trate that I thought I had not seen the child more than twice—I don't think I did, but I can't swear it; it is possible I may have seen it twice—I went a second time for the purpose of attending another child—I am quite certain I did not twice see Cohen's child professionally—it was Mrs. Ellis I saw when she showed me Cohen's child—I did not see Waters that night—I have seen her, but I can't say on which day—they professed anxiety about the state of its health—diarrheoa is a common complaint with children brought up by hand.</p>

               <p>examination—in my opinion, the cause of death was severe congestion of the brain, and emaciation—I considered the peculiar congeition of the brain to be due to the administration of a narcotic, and the emaciation to a want of proper and sufficient food—on Monday morning, 13th June, I went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and went down into the front room on the basement, a little before 9 o'clock; they called it a front parlour; it was below the surface of the earth—I think one of the prisoners was there, but I can't recollect, exactly, who was in the room—I found one infant there; it was asleep—I examined it, and found its bowels were out of order—it was in a dirty state, in a bed made up on a chair—one of the prisoners took the child in her lap for me to examine it—I found the motion of the child in a very unhealthy state—I roused it, and it cried weakly—I should think it might have been about three months old—I then went up stairs to a bedroom at the top of the house, and saw four babise in bed—two of them were in a very dirty state, in a small cradle, placed together, asleep—I did not rouse them—I did not examine them; I just lifted a part of the clothes, and found it in a very dirty state, and left it alone—it was quite wet; everything belonging to the cradle was wet and saturated—the children looked very thin, and were soundly asleep—I examined them again, casually, at the Police Court, the same day—I noticed one of the children very torpid indeed—its mouth was parched, and partially open; the lips were separated—I told the Magistrate I be-lieved the child was then under the influence of a narcotic—that was my opinion—I did not observe that the others were so torpid as that—they were afterwards taken to the workhouse—when I saw them at the prisoner's house, they had ordinary feeding-bottles beside them, with tubes reaching to the mouth—I am speaking of the four—I did not especially examine the contents of the bottles at that time; I looked at it, and pronounced it to be a mixture of corn flour and water—I examined them more particularly at my own surgery, afterwards; not the same day, I should think a week afterwards—I noticed that some of them were sour when they were lying by the side of the children; one particularly I smelt, and it was sour—I unfastened the stopper at the time and smelt it—I did not see anything against the kind of food that was in the bottle if it was sweet, it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do occasionally to give a little corn flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and medical officer of the Lambeth Workhouse—on the afternoon of 13th June, nine children were brought there—I was there at the time—three of them were from two to three years old, as near as we could guess; the others we con<lb/>jectured to be from three weeks to eighteen months old, or it might be rather more—having no names for them they were numbered from 1 to 9—Nos 1, 2, and 3 were subsequently claimed and removed—they were the elder tnes—they appeared to be in very fair health; I did not discover that there was anything specially the matter with them—Nos. 4 and 5 were the next eldest, the younger about eighteen months and the other rather older—a claim has been made to one of them, but they are still under my care—they are very much better—they were not in good health when admitted, far from it, but they have recovered surprisingly, and I think are now out of danger—as to Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9, the youngest was about three weeks old, and the eldest about three months; they have all died—the first that died was No. 8, a female infant, she died on 23rd June; No. 6, a male infant, died on 26th June; No. 9, a female infant, on 5th July; and No. 7, a female infant, on 11th July—No. 8 we judged to be from three to fire weeks old at the time of admission, on 13th June; it was in a state of great emaciation, and very puny—there were marks of recent thrush about the buttocks, and thush was also present in the mouth and throat; it was in a condition of torpor, inanimate—when I saw it, it had been washed by the nurse—there was a peculiar glazed look about the eyes in the whole four, but in this child especially; the pupil not answering very well to light—the great emaciation was ostensibly attributable to want of sufficient and proper nourishment; and the torpid inanimate condition I believe arose from its being under the influence of some soporific drug—the children were exclusively under my care from the time of their admission to the time of their death—I saw them daily, and several times a day—the first child for the first two or three days appeared to get better under the stimulus of plentiful food; subsequently it rapidly succumbed—the symptoms were occasional sickness, and almost continuous diarrhoea,</p>

               <p>which I was unable to arrest—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion, on 24th June, the day after the death of the child—it was about 22 in. in length; the body and limbs were much emaciated, but there were no marks of violence—there was still the appearance of recent thrush about the bottom part of the person—on opening the head, there was found great congestion of the whole brain structure, both externally and internally the membranes also showed the signs of infor<lb/>mation; the dura-mater was glued to the skull in some portions, so that it could not be separated, which is an unusual occurrence—those appearances confirmed the view I originally took of the cause of the symptoms—the child weighed nearly 5 lbs.; it was weighed shortly after admission, and again at death; there was not very much difference—the ordinary weight of such a child would be about 12 lbs.—No. 6 was from three to four months old—when admitted it was in a very puny and emaciated condition; the weight takes almost immediately after admission was 6 lbs. 15 ozs.—a child of that age should not have weighed much less than 20 lbs; its length was about 26 in.; it was also suffering from thrush in the same way as the other—the nervous condition was torpid, the eyes having the glazed appear<lb/>ance before described, and there was very little animation about it—it took its sustenance greedily at first, but subsequently the same change took place as in the other; it failed—the alimentary canal was continually disturbed, sickness, and curded slimy dejections—I was present at the post-master examination of that child—I attribute its condition to the same cause as that of No. 8, want of proper and sufficient food, and also a congested state of the brain—No. 9, a female infant, was not so emaciated as the preceding two; its condition, as regards the nervous system, was more lively, and the pupils were not contracted when I observed them—I supposed that child to be from four to five months old—it was emaciated, but, compared with the others, it did not strike the observer so forcibly—the weight of this child, as of all, was not more than that of a new-born child it was about 10 or 11 lbs.—it was weighed soon after admission, not on the day—it had a great deal of diarrhoea; that existed on its admission, and continued <hi rend="italic">with</hi> slight intermission, conjoined with occasional vomiting, up to its death—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of that child; there was con-gestion of the brain, and also effusion in the ventricles of about an ounce of fluid—I ascribe the death of that child to the congested and inflamed state of the brain, associated with emaciation and diarrhoea—I ascribe the emaciation to want of sufficient nourishment previous to admission into the work-house—from the appearances noticed in this child I could not speak pon<lb/>tively as to the brain having been congested at the time of admission—No. 7 was supposed to be about from three to four months old—I am not certain of the weight of that child at the time of admission; the weight taken at death was 41/2 lbs., but that would hardly indicate what it was on admission, it was so very emaciated—it appeared very ill upon admission, and was suffering from profuse diarrhoea, which was visible upon examina-tion—this child had thrush worse than any of the others, it was quite raw with it, in a fearful condition—they all had slight signs of stupor, with glazed eyes and inanimate condition, but this and the preceding one were not so much so as the two first that I have mentioned—I always connect the occurrence of thrush with the existence of an improper or insufficient dietary; I never knew thrush to arise from any other cause, either through the mother, when at the breast, or when brought up by hand—there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187009190125"/>
               <p>also a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in this case; the brain was in a much better addition than the others—the cause of death in this case was supposed and believed to be from mesenteric disease, which we found after death—there was an enlargement of the alimentary canal, and induration of the glands—that might be the direct result of insufficient food and nourishment nothing is more common than the result of mesenteric disease, from neglect or insufficient food—none of the children, as far as I could judge, would weigh the proper weight of a new-born infant—from the state in which they were when they came in, I should say they must have been poorly for at least ten days or a fortnight, if not more—they were undoubtedly so poorly that they would urgently require medical attention and care—from the position I hold I have had large experience in the treatment of infants taken from their mothers and brought up by hand—I think the baris of all proper food for infants must be milk, either pure or diluted, according to the age—some farinaceous substance should be added as it grows older—I think a quart of diluted milk per day and night would be suficient for a young infant; half pure milk and half water; that would be sufficient up to perhaps six weeks, after that a larger quantity would be Necessary—I think a pint of new milk, diluted to a quart, would be suffi<lb/>cent for a very young infant, every twenty-four hours, with some form of sugar admixed, and I do not object to a little arrowroet.</p>

               <p>breast it is common—when the attempt to bring up a child by hand fails, thrush, diarrhoea, and consequent emaciation is the result, and frequent con<lb/>vulsions, and affections of the nervous system—as to one of the children, No. 9, I did not observe congestion of the brain at the time of admission, yet there was considerable congestion at death—possibly it might have been produced while it was in the workhouse—congestion of the brain, I am bound to state, is a very common occurrence with children, and it may re-sult even from advanced thrush, and from prolonged diarrahcea; it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> occur entirely unconnected with the use of any narcotic—I do not think the congestion I found in the others might have been the result of thrush and adiarrhoea—in two of the cases there was a result from inflammation, an adherence of the membranes, that must have taken some considerable time; and in the youngest, the first admitted, there was not time for that result to have taken place, at least in my opinion—there was not an unusual num<lb/>ber of children dying in the workhouse about this time—I daresay then may have been six or eight deaths in the course of May, June, and July, in addition to those I have named; possibly you are alluding to some esta<lb/>blishment connected with the workhouse, but upon that I cannot speak of my own knowledge—children were sent out from the workhouse, and, for aught I know, they are so still—I believe, with the consent of their mothers, a certain number are removed from the breast to some' establish<lb/>ment at Pimlico, conducted by Miss Broughton—I called the attention of the Board to having heard of an unusual mortality there—I did not know it of my own knowledge—I believe some of the guardians went and inquired into it—I do not know the result.</p>

               <p>Friday night before they were taken—that child was taken to the work-house, and died in the workhouse—that came on the Friday, and she was taken the following Monday—it had its food on the Saturday—Mrs. Waters brought that child about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Mrs. Waters seemed to be fond of children; four of them used to sleep with her—I have seen her carrying them about sometimes, not very often, and washing them—she washed them all every morning, except Miss Cowen's child, and that she said was too ill to be washed—she seemed fonder of that child than the others—I have seen her nurse it—I told her on one occasion that it looked ill—it was very ill one day, and she sent for the doctor, at Denmark Hill; it was Dr. Harris—he came in the evening, and the child was shown to him—I was in the other room, taking care of the children, when he came, and Mrs. Ellis took the child in to show him—she was in the room with him about ten minutes—he brought it some medicine; it was like water—the medicine was given to the child every morning by Mrs. Waters, a teaspoon<lb/>full of the mixture, by itself—there was no other medicine given—she used to send for some brandy sometimes—I used to see her mil up a little drop for the children, about a teaspoonful in a wine-glass of water—she used to give that to the children, with a spoon—she said the child was ill; that was Cowen's child—she used to give the medicine to the child in the morn<lb/>ing and in the night, twice a day, for about a week—the child did not seem to get any better; nothing seemed to do it good—she used to mix up a little isinglass with some sugar, sometimes, and give it to it—I used to mix the corn flour, and put it in the bottle—some hot water was put to the milk, to warm it, and some sugar—I used to give it to the children myself—Mrs. Waters might give it to Cowen's child sometimes—she would have the child on her knee, and it used to be lying on the sofa—the bottles were laid on the sofa, by the side of the children; and when they wanted it I used to put the teats in their mouths—Mrs. Waters said the lime water was put in the milk to keep sickness away from the children—Mrs. Ellis did not seem to approve of it—the children were dressed before they were taken away—they had as good clothes as she had to put on them—they used to have flannel on, and a nightgown and a shawl—I mean the four children that were taken away at night—they used to be wrapped in a shawl, and sometimes one of them would have a cape—they were com<lb/>fortably wrapped up—when they were brought down in the morning they were laid in the front kitchen, on the sofa, and they were taken into the back kitchen and washed, and carried up again at night—I earned them up sometimes, and sometimes Mrs. Waters, and put them to bed—the children that could eat bread food were fed three or four times a day—that was the elder children—the babies were fed once or twice a day, and then they used to have their bottles—they used to have corn flour very thick, and fed with a spoon—I have seen Mrs. Waters give Cowen's child corn flour with a spoon—Cowen's child got very ill after a day or two, and did not seem to improve—the medicine the doctor gave it did not seem to do it any good—it had a little cough—I used to go over to the baker's for sponge cakes—some<lb/>times I got a penny sponge cake for one of the children, and sometimes I used to go for <hi rend="italic">sally lunn</hi> cakes—I used to pay a penny for that, and some<lb/>times 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not do that every day, very often—I used to sop it, and give it to two or three of the infants, who used to eat sop, some of them that died in the workhouse—I used to give sop to them—the child that came on the Friday night had milk and corn flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Rye Lane, Peckham, and am a member of the Royal College of Physicians, of London—I professionally attended Mrs. Waters from 22nd September, 1868, to the beginning of this year—I left off attending her about a year ago, and have never seen her since—I have been called in to see infants that were ill, when she lived in the Bournemouth Road, and have prescribed for them—I never saw any<lb/>thing in her conduct but uniform kindness and motherly solicitude—opiates should never be ordered for children—of course, they are sometimes ordered; but under very peculiar circumstances—infants, are so wonderfully sus<lb/>ceptible to the effects of opium, it kills them like a shot, almost—there is a mixture called paregoric elixir that is sometimes given, a soothing syrup, that contains a small proportion of laudanum, two grains or a grain in an ounce, or something of that sort—that is given frequently; but very wrongly—I do not hold with giving children any opiates—women will do so upon their own responsibility; but medical men do not—paregoric elixir is prescribed for some children for cough, and, as a soothing medicine; if given in excess, it would produce narcotize, stupor—if children, suffering from an overdose of an opiate, rally for two or three days, I should de<lb/>cidedly think they had got over the stupefying effects of it; reason and experience teaches that—I have not heard the medical evidence in this case—if the stupefying effect of laudanum passes away quickly, the patient invariably recovers—lime water, properly made, is used to check the acidity of the milk—I have heard the evidence about the lime water; it was im<lb/>properly made—it would not have been improper to put a dessert spoonful of it in the milk, if it had been correctly made—this was too roughly made—there would be nothing positively injurious in it—it would have the effect of neutralising the acidity of the milk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the London Fire Brigade—on 5th August I was called by the police from my station in Shepherd's Lane, Brixton, at 10.25—I went with an engine to 2, Mitford Place, Vassal Road, and on arriving there I found smoke coming from the house, which was in charge of a constable—I went into the front kitchen in the basement, and found a sofa partly consumed—the bottom of it, and part of the back, was consumed—standing behind that was part of a French bedstead, which was also partly consumed; the paint on a door was scorched, and the gas pipe across the ceiling was melted—in the back kitchen I found a clothes-horse scorched, and a table close to it, and the ashes of something which had been bunt, were partly on the table and partly on the horse—in the front parlour the window curtains were burnt, and the shutters scorched—one fire could not have burnt those three different rooms—a chimney ornament, and a window curtain in the back parlour were also burnt, and the carpet was turned up against the fender—one fire could not have ignited the other—I inquired for Miss Gent, and was told she was next door—I went there, and saw her—I asked her if she could account for the fires in different places—she said no, she saw a blue light, and heard a report—I asked her if she was insured—she said "Yes, in the West of England Fire Office, for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that she held the house on a lease—she was very excited—this was about twenty minutes after I went there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shadwell, and am a builder—on 22nd August I was at the Canterbury Arms, and had some gin there—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner there—my watch was safe, and my purse, with some cheques in it, which were drawn to order, and some sovereigns and silver—my watch was fastened with a cross-bar to my button-hole; it was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it cost nearly 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not consider I was drunk; I had had some drink—I do not recollect that the landlord refused me any more—I do not remember what time I left—I recollect nothing afterwards—I do not recollect walking home to the prisoner's house, and I do not believe I did—I have a sort of half-recollection, a sense of being on a bed without power to help myself—I felt somebody feeling over me without my having power to resist it, a perfect consciousness of mind but no power of body—when I was conscious I found myself walking in the street—I spoke to the first man I met, and informed him of my loss, which I had then discovered—I gave information, and my wife went for Mr. Garty, the doctor—I had vomited at that time, and part of the vomit was preserved—I was wearing the same shirt when I saw Mr. Garty as I were the previous night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Agar Terrace, Brixton—on 23rd August, at 8 o'clock in the morning, I was called to the prosecutor's bedroom, and found him lying on his back in a very exhausted state—his feet and hands were cold, he was almost pulseless, and the pupils of his eyes were firmly contracted—on inquiry I found that he had had stertorous breathing during the night—I asked for the vomit, but it had been thrown away—when I took his hand out of bed to feel his pulse I smelt chloroform—I felt his shirt, put it up to my nose, and found chloroform on both sleeves—my judgment is that he had been drugged first with morphia, and after, to destroy sensibility entirely, had chloroform given to him—a small room like a public-house, with the fumes of tobacco or gas in it, would cause morphia to take effect upon him very shortly, as such things deteriorate the Atmosphere—morphia would increase the amount of vomit—the utensil did not smell of alcohol, such as gin or brandy; I should have detected it by the smell if it had been thrown up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Morphia will increase bile, or I suppose beer would not be a good thing for a bilious person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would increase it—drunken men vomit a good deal, and if there is bile it would be apt to come up with the beer—I ascertained that he had vomited a good deal—that would decrease his pulse—when a man has been very tipsy over night, you do not expect to find his pulse strong in the morning—I did not examine the room, but am certain he had no bottle of chloroform there—the only trace of it I detected was the smell of his shirt—chloroform is highly volatile, but I detected it in the folds of the shirt.</p>

On 25th August, I met the prisoner, and told him I was going to take him for stealing a watch and chain, on the Monday night previous—at the time he was at the station the police had received no information of the robbery—I traced the watch by the maker's name, and the number—he said he was in the Canterbury Arms, and a gentleman came in and had some gin, and paid for a pot of beer, and he had some of it, and when he came outside the gentleman was drunk, and wanted to go home—he said I asked him to come home with me, which he did, and when he got into my room he fell on the bed, between my wife and daughter—there was a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and the light was put out—I got a light again, and it was put out again; and when I got a light again I saw the gentleman exposing himself—he said he was very sorry, he had got no money, and he gave me his watch, and said I could make 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—I asked him if he knew the gentleman—he said no, he never saw him before, and knew nothing of him—he said "He left my house, and went away, and I never saw anything more of him."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he say "He had got no money, he was very sorry for what he had done, and gave me his watch and chain to go and pledge?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think those were the words—I do not think anything was said about the gentleman coming in the morning to bring the money, but I think I understood him that he expected the gentleman in the morning—I examined the prisoner's house—there are two or three little cottages all on one floor—there is only one small room, and as soon as you enter from the street you come into it—the prisoner lives in one room, that is all he has—he and his wife and daughter sleep in that room—the daughter's age is seventeen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "When he came into the Canterbury Arms he was the worse for liquor. He called for wine; he was not served. Does not that show he was drunk? I had a drop, and he had the same. He would have me go home with him. I said, 'No;' but he took hold of my arm, and would stick to me. I said, I have no bed for you, but you can come home and sit in the chair.' When I went in I went to the mantelpiece and got a light. He saw the bed and took a view, and dashed the candlestick out of my hand, and got into my bed. My wife and daughter jumped out in a fright. He lays hold of my wife by the middle of the back, and got her up against the bedstead. I said,' My good fellow, what do you mean? I thought you were a different sort of a man.' He said, 'I am very sorry for what I have done; I have got about me; here is my watch; take it to the pawn; you will get 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I am very sorry.' I said, 'You had best go away, and take your</p>

               <p>watch with you.' He said,' No, I won't take the watch with me.' I said, Well, I'll keep the watch till 12 o'clock to-morrow for you; and if you don't come then I will go to the pawn with it.' I followed him out with his hat. He was in such a hurry to go out, I believe nature overpowered him. I think he was too fond of the ladies. He pat on his hat, and walked away as well as I could. He had too much wine in him. If I had meant anything wrong, I should not have gone to the pawn with it, nor to the station afterwards."</p>

I am not single—I have been living with the prisoner formerly, and left off living with him eighteen months ago—I began to live with George Meyer five or six months ago—I do not know where the prisoner lived at this time; but recently he lived in Kent Street, which is about three minutes' walk from Violet Place, where I lived with George Meyer—during those five or six months I have washed a shirt for the prisoner occasionally—he gave them to me to do, and threatened me if I did not—during the four or five months I have lived with Meyer the prisoner has spoken to me when he met me, and said "Do you intend to live with me any more?—I have said "No, I do not; anything I can do for you I will; but I do not intend to live with you any more as a wife, for I was so ill-treated, that I will not"—he said that if I did not he would do something to me" and likewise your man, too"—ou Saturday, 27th August, I was coming along Kent Street, and the prisoner came up to me, and struck me two blows on the head, saying that he wanted the duplicate of his shirt; but I had not got one of any shirt of his—he knocked me down; but I regained my feet, and went home, and George Meyer, the deceased, said "Emma, you are excited"—I made a com<lb/>munication to him, and between 9 and 10 o'clock that evening the prisoner came and knocked at the door—I threw the window up, and saw him outside the door—Meyer ran down stairs, in his trowsers and shirt, without his boots—he returned in a few minutes and said "Emma, give me my boots"—I said "No, George, I shall not," and I threw them under the bed; but he got them, and took his waistcoat off the bed, putting it on as he went down—I tried to stop him, and got before the door; but he threw me—presently, somebody said to me "Mrs. Meyer, your husband is fighting;" and when I got to my room Meyer was holding his bowels in and said "Emma, my dear, I am stabbed"—I laid</p>

Emma Jones, the woman I am living with, ran up to me; she seemed to have had a blow in the face. The landlady called out, 'Mr. Meyer, you're wanted.' I then went down to the front door. I saw the prisoner there; he said 'I want the ticket of a shirt.' I said she had not got one, I said 'If you don't go away, I'll give you a ticket.' He said 'Will you?' I said 'Yes, I will.' I ran up, and put my waistcoat on. I came down again. I gave him a <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> on the side of the head. I said 'Now go, or I'll lock you up.' Immediately I said that, he put his hand into the breast pocket of his coat. He then carne close up to me, and gave me a plunge in the stomach. I felt that I was stabbed, and my entrails were coming out. He made no motion of opening a knife beforehand; it all happened in a minute. I put my hand to the wound. I walked 100 yards or so, to look for a policeman. I then went up, and laid down. I did not see what became of the prisoner. Some constables came, and took me to the station on a stretcher. Some people stood by, but nobody was near me but the prisoner. I have lived with Emma Jones about six months. The prisoner has quarrelled with me about it. I have heard him twice say he'd have his revenge.—George Meyer.")</p>
