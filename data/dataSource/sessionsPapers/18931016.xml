                  </hi>. I am a financial broker, of 85, Coleman Street—on 15th July the defendant called on me—he was a stranger—he pro-duced a card of Mr. Mortimer, my tailor—at the same time he produced this cheque on the Birkbeck Bank for £300, drawn by C.

I am a commission agent, of Leytonstone—I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Bazaar</hi> newspaper an eighteen-carat gold watch for sale for 40s., and a chain for 29s.—on June 4th I received this letter: "20, Saxony Road, Liverpool. Mr. Garman is open to buy the lady's watch and chain, or will send post-dated cheque on approval; the N.W, Bank, Liverpool, are Mr. Garman's bankers"—I wrote back asking for a post-dated order, and got this letter with a printed heading: "Dear Sir,—I have sent you a post-dated cheque; you can either send the articles or return the cheque; I want them for a present to-morrow"—I paid the cheque into my bank on July 5th, and it was returned marked, "Refer to drawer"—I immediately wrote for the money, but got no answer—this is the watch and chain.</p>

On August 25th, I arrested the prisoner on another charge—he gave his address, 19, Wilson Street, Gray's Inn Road—I searched there and found fourteen pawn tickets, and these two among them, and the letter of June 26th, written by one of the witnesses; also a letter addressed, "My dear wife," and signed, "T. T. R. Garman," in which is this passage: "I received two pianos from Guernsey which the police sent back. I returned from Walton this day week, and there is nothing left but to raise some money. I have a banking account again. I will send you a gold watch in a few days for which I have sent a cheque, and you must try to realise the worth and buy yourself and the children some clothes"—I showed him that letter on September 9th, and he said, "I wrote that letter to my wife"—it appears to be in the same writing as the other documents put in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that a friend owed him some money which he promised to pay into the bank for him, and that he hoped to provide for the cheques when they arrived at maturity.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 11, Bell Yard—I was admitted in 1870—I first became acquainted with the prisoner about September, 1890, when she came to my office with reference to the admin-istration action of Goodwin <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hooper and Large, then pending—the prisoner was a defendant in that action, which had reference to the admin-istration of her first husband Goodwin's estate—ah order was made on February 27th, 1891, committing her to Holloway for contempt in having broken into 1, Walpole Road, Croydon, a house in the hands of the receiver, Mr. Henderson—on 18th March, 1891, the prisoner surrendered at Holloway Prison—on her instructions I made several motions to the Court for her release—they were refused, because she had not purged her contempt—I saw her and her brother with reference to her purging her contempt and being released—I received this letter of 28th March from her from Holloway. (<hi rend="italic">This asked him to bring a Commissioner next week in order that she might swear an affidavit that she had no books or papers belonging to the testator, and to request Mr. Meikell to send her</hi> £5 <hi rend="italic">at once; and after referring to oilier matters, it stated that she enclosed a clique which fie</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Day</hi>) <hi rend="italic">was to give Meikell, who was to pay to the Receiver</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">before Faster was ever, on Tuesday, if possible</hi>)—that letter enclosed this cheque for £400, signed Sappho and Co., the name under which the prisoner was trading. (<hi rend="italic">This cheque was payable to, and endorsed P. Henderson</hi>)—at the Police-court the prisoner admitted that that was her cheque—it is in her writing, which I know—I also received from her this letter of 30th March from Holloway Prison—the 29th was Easter Sunday, and I was away for a holiday at the time. (<hi rend="italic">The letter of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th asked for the</hi> £5 <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Meikell to be forwarded at once, and inquired whether the</hi> £400 <hi rend="italic">cheque for Mr. Henderson had been received, as if not it was to be stopped at the bank</hi>)—in reply I wrote these two letters of 31st March. (<hi rend="italic">Acknow-ledging the receipt of the two letters and the cheque from the prisoner</hi>)—I handed the £400 cheque to the prisoner's brother, Mr. Meikell, and he was to find the other £100, and give me the £500 to pay into Court—that arrangement was made between me and Meikell in consequence of the instructions I received from the prisoner in her letter of 28th March—I did not go with Meikell to the Receiver; I left the £400 cheque with him, and he was to see me the following day and bring me £500—a few days afterwards I paid in Meikell's cheque for £500; this is the receipt from the Bank of England, dated 10th April—at the time that money was paid into Court there was Hooper's judgment against her in the Chancery proceedings—Mrs. Hooper was the landlady of 2, Northwick Terrace, Maida Vale—her action was for rent due from the prisoner as administratrix. (<hi rend="italic">An office copy of the judgment was put in, showing verdict for plaintiff for</hi> £43 5s., <hi rend="italic">costs</hi> £135 13s. 10d., <hi rend="italic">which had been taxed and allowed</hi>)—I also produce the chief clerk's certificate showing that she owed as administratrix debts amounting to £707 10s. 1d.—in addition she had incurred other debts in respect of costs in the</p>

               <p>Chancery proceedings, which she was liable to pay; they amounted to some hundreds—after the £500 was paid into Court an order for her release was made on 16th April, 1891—in support of the application she swore an affidavit, of which this is an office copy, dated 6th April, (<hi rend="italic">In this affidavit the prisoner swore that she had paid into Court</hi> £500, <hi rend="italic">and was prepared to pay into Court such sums as were necessary to discharge the, claims of the plaintiff and taxed costs, and the costs of the committal order; that she had delivered over into the hands of the Receiver the title deeds of 1, Walpode Road, and Westbury, Beaver Hill, Southampton, and she apologised for her unintentional contempt of Court</hi>)—after her release she discharged me as her solicitor—I sued her on my bill of costs—she defended the action, and set up a counter claim—I got judgment against her for £130 and costs in February, 1892—she alleged that I had been guilty of fraud and negligence as her solicitor—the issue was tried by a jury in the High Court, and decided in my favour—to enforce the judgment, I got this order, directing that certain deeds of her Southampton property should be delivered over to the Sheriff of Southampton—I could not get payment; there was nothing to levy on—the Sheriff of Southampton held an inqui-sition under the writ of elegit, and after the inquisition had been held the deeds were handed to me on 28th March, 1893—I obtained an order from Mr. Justice Chitty for the sale of the Southampton property—in order to give effect to the order after it was granted, I had to make frequent attendance at the Chief Clerk's Chambers, and frequently met Mrs. Large there; she appeared and opposed the order—pending those proceedings she called at my office and abused me, and threatened to break my windows and my head if I did not give up the deeds to her—I took out a summons, which was heard at the Mansion House on 26th May, to have her bound over to keep the peace, and she was bound over in £50 for six months—about two or a quarter-past two on 24th May, while that sum-mons was pending, she came to my office with a policeman, and gave me into custody for stealing the deeds and the cheque for £400—she told the policeman I had stolen them—I was taken in custody, with the policeman, the prisoner, and another woman, in a cab to John Street, Paddington, Police-station—I was charged before the inspector with stealing the deeds and the cheque—he would not take the charge—then we walked to St. Mary's, Paddington Green; the police sergeant insisted on my going with him—the prisoner asked him to take me to another Police-station, and he complied with her desire—at the second Police-station the inspector took the charge against me of obtaining the £400 cheque—I applied to be released on bail; the inspector refused, and I passed the rest of the day and the whole of the night in the Police-station—I told him that another inspector a few yards off had refused to take the charge, and yet he refused bail—next morning I was brought before Mr. Hannay, the Magistrate at Marylebone; there were three hearings—Mr. Hannay let me out on bail at the first—on 8th June the charge was dismissed—I saw the prisoner sworn, and heard her give evidence at the Marylebone Police-court—she said I had obtained the £400 from her by fraud; that there was nothing owing by her to any-body at the time; that I had stolen the deeds from her; and that the money she sent was not the money paid into Court—her attention was called to the letter of 28th March, and the other letters—she said it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189310160023"/>
               <p>not the same money that was paid into Court, and that the £400 was no portion of the £500—she said I had conspired with several others to defraud her, and that Mr. Henderson's name on the cheque had been forged—I had not made any false representations to her, nor had I been guilty of any fraud in obtaining the cheque from her, nor had I used any threats towards her to induce her to give me the cheque—on the "day after the charge was dismissed against me the prisoner came again with a con<lb/>stable to my office, and gave me in charge for stealing the deeds—I had, only been charged before Mr. Hannay with stealing the £400—I was I marched through the streets to Bow Street by a policeman in uniform on 9th June—I told the constable that I had been discharged the day before—he did not take any notice of what I said—at Bow Street the prisoner I charged me with stealing the deeds—I sent for my solicitor, who made an explanation, and the inspector refused to take the charge, and I was released.</p>

Blair and Girling, in Court in March; it may have been on the 17th—I never told Meikell that if he did not hand up the deeds you would be detained as a Chancery prisoner for all your life—I never threatened you—I did with the cheque what you told me to do in the letter—the money never went to Mr. Henderson, I believe, because it went into Court—I should say at that time a great deal more than £400 was owing by you to Hooper for the costs for the judgment—the judgment was only against you as executrix—Meikell gave me a cheque for £500—I don't know where the £100 came from, but the £400 came from the cheque you had signed "Sappho and Co."—Meikell' went with me to pay it into Court—I wrote to Mr. Freake Palmer, on your brother's instructions, telling him not to act as your solicitor, because I was acting for you—your brother told me to write and tell him to do nothing for you,' as I was still acting for you—you never instructed me to write to him—I heard Mr. Henderson swear at the Police-court that he never authorised the endorsement to the cheque, and also that he would have had his commission out of it—he did not say that he had been robbed out of his commission—I have seen a copy of Goodwin's will—it was said the estate was insolvent—you instructed me to write on 12th March, 1891, to Mr. Batchelor, telling him not to allow Mr. William Large, your husband, to have the furniture that he had illegally entered 1, Walpole Road and taken—you represented he had been and taken some of your furniture—on 28th May, 1892, the Sheriff seized some things of yours, under my order for my bill of costs, which you would not pay—I levied no execution on you in March, 1891—I did not refuse to allow you the use of a nightdress when you came out of Holloway—I did not turn your old mother out—you came out of Holloway on 16th April, 1891—there were divorce proceedings against your husband—Mr. Justice Chitty made a receiving order against Goodwin's estate, but I know nothing about it, as I was not acting for you at the time.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On 8th June, 1892, she issued a writ against me and against Messrs.

Blair and Girling, and other persons, claiming delivery of jewellery, title deeds relating to this property, and £400 received from her and retained by me; that is the same £400—there was no statement of claim or anything else in that action—the order for committal to Holloway recites that, in addition to the prisoner, her mother, Mrs. Meikell, was also committed to prison for contempt for helping the prisoner to commit this breaking into the house—to save the old lady these deeds were handed over by the prisoner on 17th March in Court, and on account of that, and the mother's age, the judge dissolved the order against her—the £500 was the amount agreed on between me and the solicitors on the other side as being a proper amount to be paid into Court—the deed of gift had nothing to do with that £500—it turned out that Goodwin's estate was more than solvent, enough to pay all the debts and leave a large balance.</p>

                  </hi>, the younger. I am a son of William Alexander Charles Adams—my mother was the deceased Emily Maria Adams—I remember the 4th August, 1891, the day on which my mother was killed—some months before that I remember seeing my mother out in the street—it was at night, after the houses were shut; that was twelve o'clock—it was in a turning out of the Commercial Road—she and the prisoner were together; I saw them—they did not see me at first; they must have seen me coming down the street, and when they saw me they went across the road arm-in-arm together—they walked along, turning off Commercial Road under the new arch—I followed behind; I ran to catch up with them; they got together in a court, and I said to them, "Sup-posing father was coming along, what would he say?"—I rushed at Lewis and hit him on the chin—mother said to me, "Go home"—I went home, and was sitting on the doorstep when she came along—she said, "Go upstairs'—Lewis was not with her then—I did not sleep at home that night; I slept at No. 1, Batson Street; our house was No. 10—I went home next morning—I cannot tell the day of the week it was—I had seen the prisoner one Saturday before this in our house sitting down-stairs; mother was there at that time—father was not at home, and he was not at home at the time I saw the prisoner and mother in the street—I did not know where he was till afterwards—I never saw the prisoner and mother together afterwards.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness, and live with him at 10, Batson Street—in the beginning of 1891 the deceased was living with us—her husband was not living with her; he had been there, but he went away—I knew the prisoner by coming once to our place, that was all—on Monday, 3rd August, 1891, Bank holiday, he came to the house in the afternoon—he did not ask for anybody—Mrs. Adams was upstairs at the time—the prisoner stayed in our company till the evening, and we all went to the Pavilion Theatre together, and afterwards he walked part of the way back with us—when he parted he seemed on perfectly good terms with us all—next morning, Tuesday, 4th August, Mrs. Adams went out about half-past nine or a quarter to ten—I thought she was going for some soap and soda; it was washing-day at our house—some little time afterwards, as she was so long gone, I wont out to see for her, and I went to the Railway Tavern in Three Colt Street—I went into the private bar, and saw her standing at the private bar with her arms resting on the slab—I said to her, "Come along, Emily, the washing is to be done to-day, remember"—she said, "Go along, I won't be many minutes"—the prisoner was in the bar with her—he offered me something to drink, and I took it out of his hand—I was not in the bar many minutes—I did not see the prisoner alter his position at all while I was there; they were both standing up, not near each other—they were a distance apart while I was talking to Mrs. Adams, and my back was towards him—after waiting there about five minutes I went home—shortly after-wards a boy came and made a communication to me, and I went back to the tavern, but there was such a crowd I could not get in, and afterwards went to the hospital and there saw Mrs. Adams; she was then dead.</p>

I manage the Railway Tavern, Three Colt Street, Limehouse, for my father—in August, 1891, I knew the prisoner for about six months I also knew Mrs. Adams and her husband for six or seven years, as occasionally coming to the house; not very often, only as customers—I remember the prisoner coming to the house on the morning of 4th August, about ten minutes to ten—he came into the side bin in Three Colt Street, the private bar, which is entered by a swing door—there was no one else in the bar when he came in, and there was only myself behind the bar—there were no other customers in the house, only those two and me—my wife had before served him—at ten minutes to ten he called for a glass of mild and bitter; I served him—he stood near the partition which is between the public bar and the counter—he had not been there many minutes before the deceased came in, and he asked her to have a drink—she said she would have a glass of ginger wine, and she was served with it—she was standing in front of the bar—they then adjourned to the back of the bar—I did not hear any conversation after they left the counter—I left the bar to do my work—they were standing in a corner of the bar, towards the door, at a place where the shutters are placed—when I served them with the drink they stood by the counter—I went to clean my pewter, and I heard the door go slam, which I imagined to be one of the swing doors—I jumped up and looked round the corner of the partition, and saw the woman standing here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the model</hi>), and putting her hands to her breast, saying, "I am stabbed"—I immediately raised the flap of the counter and went to the front, and as I rushed out the man fell across me, and the woman fell—I called out to my wife—when I got through the flap this man stopped my progress, and I saw a man pass at that moment, side-faced—the prisoner fell across me on to the floor—I held the woman up, and called to my wife, "Gus, Gus!" which is my wife's name—it was at that moment that I saw a man passing, side-faced—I saw him through the window of the folding-door, the one to the left—that window was partly embossed; it is plate glass, partly plain; you can see through it; you can discern a person, not distinctly, passing the door—the words "Railway Tavern" are on the part that's embossed—you can see through the plain part of the glass persons passing, but not properly—at the time I saw the man passing the left-hand side of the window by the door, he was passing by the doorstep, by the window of the door—he was in the street, on the pavement, towards the Commercial Road, towards the church, on the left-hand side—he went by quickly; I could not tell if he was walking—he went by the door, and went to the coffee-shop next door—I thought I recognised the man; I thought it was Adams, but I was not sure—after he had disappeared I opened the door, and my wife came and took the deceased in her arms—I opened the door at the moment and saw a crowd of persons; I sent one man for a doctor and one for a constable—I did not give my attention to the prisoner; I had quite enough to do to look after the bar, there were such a lot of people—I could not say whether the prisoner was conscious or unconscious, or whether he spoke—some men came over who were standing near the rail-way arch—when the doctor and police came the woman and the prisoner were put into separate cabs and taken to the hospital.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of 44, Three Colt Street, Limehouse—on 4th August, about a quarter-past ten, I was called to the Railway Tavern, and there found the deceased and the prisoner in the private bar—I attended to the woman first—she was on the ground, her head being supported by Mrs. Truett; she was alive, but quite unable to speak—she was suffering from a wound in the chest, and there were blood stains on the clothing in the neighbourhood of the wound—I ordered her immediate removal to the hospital—I then gave immediate attention to the prisoner; he was sitting on the floor supported by the witness Conlan—his eyes were closed—I did not speak to him; I tried his pulse; it was beating quickly but feebly—I ordered brandy and water; it was brought to him—he was able to swallow that—I believe he was unconscious—I examined his wound; it was a clean incised wound—there was not much loss of blood—in the case of the woman there was great loss of blood—I could not form a good opinion at the time as to whether the prisoner's wound was serious or not.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "17, Cambridge Ward, 4th July, 1891. John Lewis, 186, Oxford Street, Stepney. About 10.30 this morning I was with Mrs. Adams in Mr. Truett's beer-house. I had half a pint of ale; Mrs. Adams had a glass of wine. She was standing towards the door, I walked to the counter to get a light, and I felt myself stabbed in the left breast; the man was in front of me. I knew him about Christmas last as the husband of the deceased. I had a quarrel with him just after last Christmas; we had a short fight. After I was stabbed, and falling, Mrs. Adams called out, 'Oh, I am stabbed!' Mr. Adams then hurried out of the house. Mr. Truett then came into the same compartment, and sent for a doctor and the police. I am living with Mrs. Willis. He had a black, broad felt hat, and a sandy moustache. I was in the house last night about three p.m. Clark asked me me to have a cup of tea; I had it in the back room downstairs. After we had tea, Mr. and Mrs. Clark, the deceased, and myself all went out and spent the evening at the Pavilion. I left them at the George, Commercial Road, at 1.30 p.m. I arranged to meet her at Truett's this morning. She told me her husband had got a revolver to shoot me. I have seen Adams twice since Christmas; the first time was when the fight took place. I saw him the following day, and had a drink with him; also in Church Road, but I did not speak to him")—the inquest was opened on 6th August—I produced the knife there; I think it was given me by Crouch; it was shut; I opened it—I noticed a stain on the blade—I gave the knife to Dr. Galloway, the house surgeon at the hospital, to examine it—the second day of the inquest was on the 12th of August—I was present when the prisoner gave evidence on that occasion, and when the Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against William Alexander Adams—the prisoner stayed on to the end of the inquiry; he was an inmate of the hospital—he was present when the Jury returned their verdict—on 16th August I was at the Limehouse Station when the prisoner was charged with the willful murder of Emily Maria Adams on 4th August, 1891, at Three Colt Street—he said, "Just so"—I placed him in the dock—he said, "Am I taken</p>

I have known the deceased twelve months. Her husband came out of prison three days before last Christmas. I saw him when he came home. Just after Christmas I was with the deceased outside of Truett's beer-house in Three Colt Street. Mr. Adams came up to us and wanted to know how it was I was with his wife. I told him I had treated her to a glass of ale. Then he ran away, and came back behind me and threw me and blacked my eyes. Then he ran to his home. That was the first time I had seen him. I did not know who he was. I knew deceased was a married woman. Three weeks after that I saw him again. I was just outside Truett's, and he asked me to go into the Five Bells, in Three Colt Street, and treated me to a glass of ale, and gave me his hand. I did not see him again until June, when I saw him in Church Row, Limehouse; but he was at one end of the street and I at the other: we did not speak. I never saw him again until Tuesday, the 4th August. On Monday evening, 3rd August, I went to the theatre with the deceased and Mr. and Mrs. Clark. I arranged to meet deceased at Truett's on Tuesday morning, but no time was mentioned. I went to Truett's that morning a little after nine a.m., and waited for the deceased. She came in at 9.30 a.m., and I treated her to a glass of wine. Deceased told me on Monday that she had net seen her husband for three or four weeks, and that she was going to write to</p>

               <p>the Past Office at Cardiff to find out where he was, as she had received a hitter from Bristol four weeks back to say that he would be home at eleven p.m. the next Saturday night, and he did not arrive; and he told her to write to the General Post Office at Cardiff, and she had not done so, but was going to do so. Deceased did not mention anything about her hus<lb/>and on Tuesday morning. She did not say that she had seen him or that she had not seen him. Deceased had been in Truett's a good half-hour, and we were standing near one another close to the street door. I had arranged to meet her at night, and I was about to leave. I walked from the door to the bar to get a light, and left deceased standing at the door. I had got a light at the bar and turned round to go out, when I saw deceased's husband come towards me, and he leapt at me with a knife in his right hand. I stepped back to try and escape it, but he stabbed me in the left side of my breast, just above the heart. He did not speak, did not see or hear him come into the bar. I am a little deaf. He threw the knife down on the bar floor towards my legs, and ran out of the door. I did not see him again. Just as I was stabbed I noticed the deceased in the corner near the door, falling. The deceased called out, am stabbed. 'She did not say who stabbed her. Then Mr. and Mrs. Truett came into the bar, and I lost consciousness. I don't remember anything afterwards until I found myself in the London Hospital. While deceased was in the bar with me, and before we were injured, Mrs. Clark just looked in and said she had two shillings for deceased; she did not stay, but told the deceased to come and do the washing. There were also two persons who came into the bar. They came in together. They were perfect strangers to me. They were a man and a woman. They did not stay many minutes. I had not noticed anyone looking in at the bar door window. I should not know the knife again. I only saw the blade, which was a large one. I am sure it was Adams who stabbed me. but I did not see him stab the deceased. On a Saturday night four weeks before this deceased was expecting her husband home. Deceased came out at nine p.m. to meet me against the Town Hall, Limehouse. We went in a tram to a large tea place just past the George, Commercial Road, and she bought some tea. I did not pay for it. We walked back. On the way back, before reaching Stepney Railway Station, deceased's son met us. She thought her son had not noticed her with me, and she ran across the road to avoid him, and told me to follow her. I did so and the boy came across to us. He was going to hit me, but she stopped him. It was then 10.15 p.m. He said he would knock my head off. He said he would tell his father. With that the deceased sent her son home, and she followed after him, and I went home. The next day deceased told me that her son had run out of the house and had not been home all night, and she was about the streets all night looking after him. That is the only time I saw the son. He is fifteen years of age, I think. Mr. and Mrs. Clark did not know that I was meeting the deceased so frequently. Deceased and I were in the private bar at Truett's when we were stabbed. I have not had a knife of any description for months. I had no knife about me when I was stabbed.—(Signed) J. A. <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS."</hi>

I done it, and tried to do myself as well. I fell on the floor. I was very fond of the woman, and am very sorry. Some weeks before it happened her husband saw me with her; he said, 'What is the meaning of this?' With that he went to strike her. I stood between them, so that he should not strike her. When he saw me do that he ran up the street, saying, 'All right, we'll see. 'I remained with her. When he came back he took me by the belt from behind, and threw me down.

On the evening of June 18th I was with another detective in Kingsland Road, and saw Whelan—I told him I should take him on a warrant for assaulting and robbing a man in Dalston, with two others—he said, "All right, governor, I will come with you; I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, where he was placed with the other two prisoners and six other men, and Bartlett identified him—when he was charged he said, "I never saw the man before"—about seven p.m. I saw Morgan in Kingsland Road, and told him I should take him for being concerned with two others in assaulting and robbing a man in Dalston Lane—when he was charged at the station he said, "I did not assault anyone."</p>

I am the Divisional Police Surgeon—I saw Bartlett on this night—he was suffering from a severe contused wound of his left elbow and a severe wound on the left side of his chest—he was not able to move his arm—I thought there was serious injury, and sent him to the hospital—the injury was consistent with a fall with con<lb/>siderable violence—the skin was abraised for about an inch, and the parts were all swollen up owing to the bruising, and there was a deep blue rich colour—the wound on the chest was severe, but not so severe as that on the arm—this was three hours after the occurrence.</p>

I am a clerk in the confidential enquiry branch of the General Post Office—in consequence of a complaint I saw the prisoner at the chief office—he was going out on the 7.30 delivery, and at my request Mr. Elliott examined his letters, and found six letters not in his delivery—I then said, "On September 23rd you presented at the shop of Mr. Barnes, the grocer, this cheque"—he said, "I know Mr. Barnes, but I did not present the cheque"—I said, "Mr. Barnes says you came and said, "My wife will be having a cheque; will you cash it for me?" and you afterwards came and presented the cheque and had the money"—he said, "The last cheque I had was on Saturday; I cashed that at Mr. Barnes'"—I told him the cheque was posted at Marlborough—he said, "I know nothing about it, and told Mr. Barnes to send the lady to me if she came to the shop"—that was on the night of 9th October—I gave him in custody—I have got the envelope.</p>

I am going to charge you with stealing a horse from Stanmore, last Friday night"—he said, "All right, I will go quietly with you"—I took him to the station—I then went to Cassidy's lodgings in Clerkenwell Lane—I found Cassidy in bed—I told him the charge, he said "All right"—he got up and dressed—I said, "I may as well tell you your <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> is in custody"—he said, "I did not know I had got any <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—I sent him to the station—the next afternoon they were charged at Edgware—when the charge was read over Plummer said, "I don't know it"—I understood him to mean he did not know where the place was from which the gelding was stolen—Cassidy said nothing—on Cassidy I found three combs, two of which are used for trimming horses, and a pair of trimming scissors—on Wednesday, Rawlingson was charged, and he said, "I admit fetching the horse away, but I deny being concerned."</p>

On the 3rd October I arrested Rawlingson at Palmerston Road, Kilburn—he said, "I have been expecting you"—when the charge was read he made no remark—I found on him this written statement, which was read at the Police-court: "On Saturday evening Cassidy came to me about five p.m., and asked me to go to the Upper Welsh Harp to fetch a horse for him, as he was not in a fit state. He went into the Crown Public-house bar, got a piece of paper, and wrote a note, and gave it to me to give to the ostler, and told me to bring the horse to Mr. Hawkins, which I did, Cassidy meeting me there on my arrival with the horse, telling me to put him into a stall and tie him up. I did so. I thought Hawkins had bought the horse, and asked Cassidy to fetch it home. I had not the least idea that anything was wrong, or I would not have gone, or had anything to do with the matter. On Monday morning I was told by a gentleman that Cassidy was locked up, and then my suspicions were roused that I was led into</p>

On October 3rd, about one p.m., I was in Dorset Street, Spitalfields, and saw four men against a dead wall—three were close to the wall, and the prisoner had hold of the middle man by the neck with his left hand, holding him by his throat tight against the wall; he seemed to be choking—I got about five yards closer, when the prisoner drew him from the wall with his left hand and struck him with his right, and sent him into the middle of the street, and ran away, and I saw Barnett catch him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was arrested thirty or thirty-five yards from where the robbery took place—I was within eighteen or nineteen yards when it was done—the prisoner was facing the prosecutor, but his side face was towards me—that is all I have to go by.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at 37, Bowcarn Street,. Hackney—on Friday, 8th September, about half-past four, I was in the Cattle Market, Islington—Sawyer called me, and said., "Excuse me, will you tell me where the auction rooms to sell horses are?"—I was explaining as near as I could, when Wilson came up and said to Sawyer, "Will you take the £24 I offered for the horse?"—Sawyer said he would not have anything to do with him or his money; his (Wilson's) man had insulted him—Wilson called me on one side and asked me, "Will you buy the horse of your friend?"—I said, "He is no friend of mind, no more than youare"—he said, "If you will buy the horse I will give you £2 for your trouble," or "commission"—I said, "I do not want anything to do with it," and then he said he was buying for the London General Omnibus Company—he said the horse was a good horse, sound and perfect, and was worth £35 to the company—I went back with Wilson to Sawyer, and tried to persuade him to sell the horse to Wilson, as I had no money—Sawyer said he would not have anything to do with him or his money on the second occasion—I said the only way I could buy it was by cheque—Sawyer agreed to take the cheque, and we went to the Lamb Public-house, at the corner of the market—I wrote a cheque for £24—a man whom Sawyer described as his brother-in-law followed us to the Lamb, and objected to the cheque—he, Wilson and some of their friends followed us to the Lamb—the brother-in-law persuaded Sawyer not to take the cheque as he had got into trouble before with one—Wilson heard what was said, and offered me the money again to pay; he began to count gold and notes into my hand, to see if Sawyer would take it that way, because he would not take the cheque—he had only got a few pounds into my hands, when Sawyer said, "I have told you I shan't have your money"—Wilson said, "Have you any money with you, so that you can pay a deposit, to make the rest secure?"—I said, "I have £2"—I gave that to Sawyer, and he tore up the receipt for £24 and made out this one: "Sold to Mr. Pearce, a black mare for the sum of £24. Paid on account, £2, leaving £22 to be paid before delivery"—I wrote a second cheque for £22—Sawyer asked me if I could go into the market and get it changed—I went into the market to see if I could get the cheque changed—a friend of the prisoners' went with me—the bank was closed, and I had to get the money from one or two tradesmen in Hackney—I returned to the market with the money alout ten minutes to six—I paid the money to Sawyer—before paying it I said to Wilson, "Do you mean to have the horse? If not, I am not going on with it"—he said, "Yes," and smacked my hand on the deal—Sawyer delivered me the horse—I looked round then for Wilson, and I could not see him; he was gone—a number of the prisoners' friends began hitting the horse with whips, and running it up to make it roar, and it lid roar after it had been running a little—some of the friends offered me 30s. and 35s. for the horse for knacker's price—ultimately I sold the horse to a greengrocer or dealer for £3, half or three-quarters of an hour after<lb/>wards—I gave information to the police on the following Wednesday and</p>

               <p>took a warrant out, after taking Mr. Rickett's advice—on the 15th, the following Friday, I pointed out Wilson to an officer; he was with Sawyer's brother-in-law and a man who had held the horse—I am quite certain Wilson is the man who was with Sawyer; I was never more certain in my life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WARBURTON</hi>. I went to the market to buy a bit for my pony—the description I gave of Wilson was medium height, closely shaven, and wearing an ulster coat—I made a mistake in his height—he had a moustache, but when I called him clean shaven I was speaking of the side of his face; I did not mean that he had no hair on his face—as near as I can say it was between a quarter-past to half-past four I first saw Wilson—I don't remember saying before the Magistrate that it was between four and 4.15—Wilson was wearing an ulster when we were doing the deal—I know that Riley was taken to identify Wilson, and failed to do so; I was outside at the time—another man, Buston, also failed, and was called by the prisoners as a witness—those two men turned out to be friends of the prisoners—Riley was there when he saw me take the money over, and he saw Wilson agree—I saw Riley again on Saturday, the 16th, in Wells Street, close to my yard, with two men, who came down to <hi rend="italic">square</hi> the <hi rend="italic">job</hi> for the prisoner Wilson—one of the men with him was Griffiths, and the other, Griffiths told me, was Wilson's cousin—as the result of my conversation with them I communicated with Mr. Ricketts, and after that Riley and Buston went to see if they could identify Wilson, and they could not identify him—Riley was called at the Police-court as a witness for the prisoners—Buston was there on the 8th, when I paid the money—I saw him in Wells Street on the Saturday after the prisoners were apprehended, and asked him if he would be a witness; he gave the address, 4, Margaret Street, Wells Street—on Sunday, the 17th, I was going there with a detective, when I met one of his friends, and then I went to Grandstow Avenue, Mare Street, about five minutes' walk from Margaret Street, where I saw Buston—he was afterwards called by Wilson for the defence—I might have had a glass of beer before going to the market; I was perfectly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SANDS</hi>. I am not a judge of horses—I had never bought a horse before; I had. bought a pony—I was talking to Sawyer for about five minutes before the other man came up—I did not care about the value of the horse; I left that to Wilson—Sawyer went away when I had paid him—he heard everything that was said—I had no stable for the horse, and did not want it—so many of Wilson's friends were running it up and down and lathering me that I did not know what to do with it—I have seen Wilson with those men—there were a number of people about—none of them were my friends—I saw three or four of them out of the eight or nine speaking to Sawyer while we were in the Court—one of the men hustling the horse was a friend of Sawyer's, because he came and offered the money afterwards; he was Sawyer's brother-in-law—I sold the horse half-an-hour after buying it—I said before the Magistrate that there were eight or nine friends of the prisoners' hustling the horse about—Riley gave me £3 for the horse—I did not see him speaking to Sawyer—I have seen him in Wilson's company, not in Sawyer's.</p>

About six p.m. on 15th September the prosecutor pointed out Wilson to me in the Metropolitan Cattle Market—I told him I had a warrant for his arrest for fraud, and should take him into custody—I took him to the station, and read the warrant to him; it charged him with conspiring with another man, on 8th Septem<lb/>ber, and defrauding Pearce of £24—he made no answer—I found on him a, £5 Bank of England note, £20 10s. in gold, 7s. 6d. in silver, and 7d. in bronze—he said he was a home dealer, and had got no home—on 2nd October, about two p.m., I went with Pearce to Croydon Pair, and there he pointed out to me Sawyer—I. told him I held a warrant for his arrest for conspiring with Wilson and defrauding Pearce of £24—he made no answer then—on the way to the Croydon Station he said, "I admit selling this mare to him" (pointing to the prosecutor), "but I know nothing about a case of fraud"—I found this pocket-book on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon of police, and live in Gascoign Road, South Hackney—on 16th September, about a quarter to twelve, I was called to Wick Road—I saw the deceased lying on the floor, in the back room, in the basement; he was drunk, and was suffering from a severe contusion on the left side of the forehead—there were two lacerated wounds, one very severe, and his face was covered with mud and blood, and the wound itself was all muddy—I do not think either of the injuries was caused by a blow from a fist—I think both were caused by a fall in the roadway—on 25th September I saw him again; he was then suffering from tetanus, a consequence of the injuries; he was delirious.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. On 19th September I was called to attend the deceased—I found him in bed at 25, Wick Road, with his head bandaged—I removed the bandage, and found a large contused wound on the left side of the forehead, and two lacerated wounds over it—a large quantity of matter was coming from the wounds—he also had a good deal of bruising about the left side of the neck and shoulder—I think the wound on the head was caused by a fall in the road—he died on the 28th from traumatic erysipelas, arising from the wounds.</p>

I am an ice-cream vendor, of 13, Eyre Court, Holborn—on Wednesday, September 27th, I was one of a wedding party—I met the prisoner, who asked for some sweets, and eventually said, "Let us go to the bride"—we went to Donato Falcho's house at Eyre Street Hill, where the marriage was solemnised, and I asked for two glasses to drink, one for me and one for the prisoner—after he had drunk, the prisoner threw the glass on the ground—the bridegroom turned him out—I went out about two minutes after him—he had waited for me below—he asked if I had to pay for the broken glass—I told him the bridegroom did not wish to be paid for it—he began to be cross with me, took out a razor from his pocket, and began to stab me all over—before doing so he said, "I want to kill you"—he struck me seven, eight, or nine times, I could not say how often, twice on the face, once on the shoulder, once under the right arm, once on the neck—then Manchini came and took me to the hospital.</p>

I am master of Edmonton Union—the prisoner and prosecutor have been inmates of the workhouse the greater part of their lives—about 1.30 on 3rd September I received information, and went to the water-tower; and in the room underneath I saw blood stains on the door and floor, and this table-knife stained with blood on some pots on the floor—I went to the infirmary, where I saw Tharby, who was suffering from a number of small cuts on his throat and a deep wound on the right of his neck; he was also badly cut on his hand, and had cuts on his buttocks—from what he said to me, I went back to the tower, and found a sixpence, stained with blood, lying on the floor—Tharby is of weak intellect.</p>

I lived with my brothers and sister and father at Nichol Street till towards the end of August—they did not have enough to eat day by day from the time my mother died—I am in the mantle-making line—my father gave my sister about 3d. for their maintenance—I remember my father going to the races in August; he had about a sovereign in the morning, and in the evening about £2 odd, and on Tuesday and Wednesday he went to the races—I cannot say how much he had on the Tuesday—he gave my sister 3d. or 4d. each morning—he asked me to go to the races, but I had no money to pay for it—my father was going to pay, but my sister asked him for food for the children; he said he could not give it to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You very seldom gave her 4d.—you did not pay 3s. 6d. or 4s. a week for bread only; there were other things—four loaves were sent for on Saturdays, but. only two on other days—I never saw two besides; sometimes there was none at all on Saturday till we got some in the afternoon—you did not since June have tea made, and put into a jar, before you went to bed, and leave it in the bedroom for them—I always went out without my breakfast—I paid you 11s. on Friday night from my wages because I was going for a week's holiday—you did not give me 32s. 6d. to pay the landlord for three weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I never saw four loaves of bread, because I was not at home—the children did not have enough to eat; they cried for food, and the older ones used to take it from the younger ones—I never saw any milk—there was plenty of soap—I used to earn 9s., and gave my father half, but I got no breakfast; only two slices of bread and butter—my father went to Kempton races that week, but I did not go—he went by rail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I came home from work at 8.30 or nine p.m., and left at nine a.m.—what happened in the day I do not know—I am quit certain the two youngest, the twins, never had any milk since June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Nicholls—we are tenants of the prisoner, and occupy two rooms—he occupied the two parlours and the kitchen with his children—we have been there seven months; we went there a fortnight after his wife died—I saw the children every day—they were not clean; they were full of vermin, including the two younger ones——their bedroom was very dirty and they had no bedclothes, but the prisoner's lied and bedroom were kept very clean—the little girl who was left in charge of the children did her best—I saw soap there, but they never had enough—I have seen the twins have some milk; I spoke to the father about it, and he said it was all <hi rend="italic">rot</hi>—I have fed the children; they</p>

               <p>appeared to want it; they used to put their hands out and take it—Mrs. Marsh used to give them food—I paid the insurance once—I have seen the prisoner the worse for drink—one of the twins was very ill three weeks before August Bank Holiday—the illness would be obvious to the lather—the parish doctor was sent for, after which I think the prisoner sent for a pennyworth of milk one day, and I made some custard—the father did not purchase any milk, but I gave then milk every morning out of my own money—the prisoner said he wished the twins were dead—he did not spend 3s. or 4s. a week at the chandler's shop, his biggest score was 2s. 11d., and there was coal and wood in that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 2s. 11d. included coal—the coal in summer was because the girl had to wash for eight of them, nine with the father, and then she took Barber's washing—Mrs. Walter, the chandler's wife, showed me the book—on the Saturday as I went there on Wednesday, the children were crying for milk, and the father would not let them have it, and I took them down some milk—I never saw tea made and put in a basin at night; they never had tea, only what I gave them in the morning; I never saw them with a bottle or any milk—I owed you a fortnight's rent, because my husband has bean away three months, and you were the cause of his going away—you did not give me the fortnight's rent.</p>

I am a widow—I rent a room of the prisoner at 27, Nicholson Street, Hoxton, at two shillings a week I have been there three months—I have seen the prisoner's children; they had not enough to eat—I could not afford to give them much—they had vermin on their heads, and I saw sores on Walters head—I remember one of the twins being ill—he had milk once—the father bought a can of milk—I thought the child was going to die—I did not see that he was treated in a different way by his father—the prisoner's room was comfortable, and he had a nice bed; but there was only one small bed for the six children, and it was filthily dirty, and the loom was dirty too—the children fell away after the mother's death—when I found them they appeared hungry; they caught hold of the bacon; anybody could see that they wanted food—I have seen the. prisoner the worse for drink—I have heard the neighbours tell him that the baby wanted milk; he said it was <hi rend="italic">rot</hi>, he could not get it—I have heard him say twice that he wished the children were dead or in their coffins, as they were worth more dead than alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Hake Street, Bloomsbury—on September 7th I went to 7, Nichol Street, and saw the prisoner in the front room, ground floor, which he occupied—there were no children there, hut I saw them in the other room: Sidney, Arthur, Walter, and the three youngest; they were dreadfully dirty, and vermin were running about their heads and faces—I asked him if they had any milk; he said they never had any—the children's room was dreadfully dirty; they laid on a dirty mattress and sacking, which were alive likewise—the children were ravenous, but they seemed too weak to ask for food, but I gave them some—I asked the prisoner if he objected to see the doctor; he said, "No."—the children were weighed; Arthur weighed 111/2 and Sidney 101/2 pounds—when I first went into the room the twins nearly fell out of bed trying to get out for the food—I went again</p>

               <p>the next afternoon, and saw Albert, Joseph, and William; they were very dirty and very hungry—their room was cleaner than on the previous day, but there were no bedclothes—the prisoner's room was quite clean—I went again on the 9th, and saw the four elder children; there was a flight improvement in the back room—I saw no food; the relieving officer sent for some, and it disappeared in a single day—I went again on the Tuesday; there was not a morsel of food in the house, and the prisoner seemed to be recovering from drink—he said he had earned about 30s. a week, but he had had no work for a fortnight—Albert said, in his father's presence, that he was very hungry, he did not have enough to eat, and that his father went out at seven a.m., and did not return till eight or nine, and generally the worse for drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went on Thursday I found you there, but I do not know that you went out, and borrowed a shilling to get them something to eat—I only sent for one pint of milk, and that was on Thursday—I gave them food on the 7th, 8th, and 9th—I was there on the Sunday—no friend ever came with me—my head officer came with me one day—the children's bed was dreadfully dirty; there was fresh filth on it, and no blankets or sheets—I saw your sister-in-law there on Friday evening—I saw two clean sheets on your bed at eleven p.m., but not on the children's bed—you bought them some bread on Thursday, and on Friday it was all gone—on the Saturday they had no food at all, and I thought it necessary to get food and meat immediately for them.</p>

I live at 91, New North Road—on September 7th I went with the last witness to the prisoner's house about 3.30, and saw the two rooms—I agree with him as to the dirt—the two older children were in a dreadful state of emaciation, and vermin were running through their hair, which was coming off—the twins were emaciated from want of food, not from disease—they were weighed; Arthur weighed 101/2 lbs., and Sydney 111/2 lbs.; the normal weight would be 24 lbs.—I ordered them to be removed—children of that age should have milk as the basis of their food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at the North London Police-court—on September 6th Annie Pennycuik applied to Mr. Bros for a bastardy summons against Mr. Stevens—it was granted, returnable on September 20th—on that day Mr. Bros was the sitting magistrate—the case was adjourned till the 27th, when Mr. Bros made an order on Stevens to pay 3s. 6d. per week till the child was fourteen—no appeal was lodged against that—Stevens gave evidence denying the paternity—I took notes of the evidence in this book; they were not read over nor signed—the first witness called was the complainant, Mrs. Pennycuik, and then she called the prisoner to corroborate her—she was sworn, and I took down in writing the material parts of her evidence—the complainant was then called back and cross-examined, and after that Stevens was called for the defence—the prisoner and Pennycuik were the only witnesses for the prosecution; the magistrate held that the fact of Stevens and Pennycuik having lived together in the house was sufficient corroboration of Pennycuik's evidence with the fact stated by the prisoner that Stevens invited Pennycuik to make any complaint she had before the prisoner—after Stevens had given evidence the prisoner was re-called and said, "I saw the complainant on 2nd May at our gate with a child in her arms. She asked me if the defendant was in and I said no"—the magistrate cautioned her and pointed out that the child had been born in the workhouse and the date of its birth could be easily proved, and asked her whether she was sure of it—she said, "I spoke to the defendant" (that would be Stevens) "at once, and he looked at the almanac and marked it"—she said that to fix the date—she was asked if she repeated the statement, and she said, "I repeat that I saw the complainant and the child on 2nd May"—the case was adjourned for seven days till 27th September, and when it was called on the solicitor for the defence said that Mrs. Johnson wanted to make a statement, that she had found that she had made a mistake and wished to correct it—she went into the witness box; she was not sworn—she said she was very sorry; she found she had made a mistake in the woman—the magistrate pointed out that she said Mrs. Pennycuik actually spoke to her on 2nd May—she did not reply to that—an almanac was not produced then, but this one was at the perjury proceedings—the magistrate made the order against Stevens on 27th September—under his instructions I wrote a letter to the Solicitor to the Treasury, and subsequently a summons was granted against the prisoner for perjury at our Court—that was heard before Mr. Lane, and the prisoner was committed for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I reside and carry on a boarding-house at 60, Guildford Street, Russell Square—in July, 1892, the prisoner came to board there, I having arranged with her that she should pay four guineas a week for herself, her nurse and her child—she remained till about 21st October, 1892—during that period I had paid various sums for her for parcels from tradesmen, and I had received money on account from her—on 21st October, after crediting her with everything I had received, she was in debt to me for £69 10s. 3d.—she had told me she received a cheque monthly, but that her husband would pay anything extra, when he came—she did not tell me the amount of her income—on 21st October, she proposed to leave me to go to Bournemouth—I asked my son to tell her I wanted some security if she left—she left in my possession these articles, reputed to be jewellery' in this plush box, which was put in a black wooden box, and handed over to us to take care of while she was away—in the black wooden box were a lot of little trinkets—I handed it to my son—she left on the Saturday, and on the following Monday morning my maid called my attention to her luggage; in consequence of which I made a communication to my son about a jeweller—the prisoner called on the 29th for her letters, and I said, "Mrs. Taylor, do you know the jewels you have left with me are false ones?"—she said, "No, but the only reason I can give is that my husband said, when</p>

               <p>I was leaving America, 'You had better not travel with such large jewels,' and he must have changed them.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that they were received as security for the debt of</hi> £69)—at the interview, when she said that her husband must have changed the jewels, she made no suggestion that I or my son had tampered with them—I had not had the jewels altered or tampered with in any way. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he should not suggest that the witness had tampered with them in any way</hi>)—I instructed my solicitor to bring an action to recover the £69 10s. 3d., in consequence of a letter I received—I attended the trial of the action and gave evidence—the prisoner was in Court—I was cross-examined as to the substitution of the jewels—the action resulted in a verdict for me on the claim, and for me on the counter-claim, with the exception of one farthing damages for breaking open the box—immediately after the verdict I instructed my solicitor to apply for a summons for perjury against the prisoner—the warrant was not executed till 10th or 11th September—my judgment has proved fruitless; I got nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner, during the time she was with me, gave me three drafts on Brown, Shipley and Co., the American bankers; £50 18s. on 12th August, £49 14s. 11d. on 9th September, and £50 18s. on 13th October—she said she could not pay anything through the bank, and asked me to cash the drafts for her—I did so; they were duly honoured—I received that money—so far as I could judge she was entitled to an allowance of about £50 a month—when she was going to Bourne-mouth I asked for her address there, and she said she was not certain what part of Bournemouth she was going to, but it was to her husband's brother—she gave no name—my son is acquainted with Mr. Barnett; I suppose he is an expert in diamonds; he is a pawnbroker—several times before 21st October the prisoner hail left her brooch and earrings with me to take care of for her, and she asked for them each day she wanted to wear them—I had had the opportunity of examining two of these three articles for two months—she used to have them two or three times in the week to wear at the theatre, and brought them back to me next morning—six days after I found the diamonds were false the prisoner called—I asked whether she had gone to Bournemouth, and she said, "Yes, I have just come up from there"—I had then had the three articles in my possession for a week—I asked her did she know the articles of jewellery she had left with me were false; she said, "Well, the only thing is, when I was leaving America my husband said, You had better not travel with such large jewels; I will give you smaller ones.'

               <p>received them from my mother, and handed them to Mr. Lewis, our solicitor, eventually—I drew up this receipt—on 24th October, after a conversation with my mother, I took these jewels to an expert, Mr. Barnett, a pawnbroker, who examined them—a few days afterwards the prisoner called, and I told her the things she left in our possession had been examined and were false—she said she did not know they were; her husband must have changed them before she came to England; that she had much larger jewels when over there I and she said her husband had said that travelling with those she was apt to lose them, and so she supposed he had changed them—she did not suggest that I or my mother had changed them—I was present in Court at the trial of Neck <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Taylor—I heard my mother cross-examined—I was also present at an interview at Mr. Lewis's office between her and her solicitor and the expert and myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the prisoner the jewellery was worthless; she seemed surprised—she said before she came to England her husband had her large jewels and must have changed them for these, and that if she had known they were false she would never have worn them—when' she got to America she would prosecute her husband, as it was a criminal offence in America for a husband to take jewellery from a wife.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Barnett, a pawnbroker and jeweller, of 316, High Holborn—I have had some years' experience in valuing jewels; the stones in these three articles are paste—the setting of the ring is poor, known as 9 carat, and it is not likely that a valuable diamond of this size was ever in this setting—the setting of the earrings is metal, and was never made for real diamonds—I should say they were made in America—the setting of the ring is very high to take a deep stone, which shows it was made to take a paste and not a real stone—imitation stones are cut high to give an artificial brilliancy.</p>

Cannot I move my things from one house to another without you stopping me?"—I said "No," his answers did not satisfy me, he must come to the station—he at first refused—I blew my whistle and called assistance and took him to the station, where he was detained till inquiries were made—at the station I found on him this underclothing and linen—he threw it on the floor saying, "There they are"—he was detained—when I stopped the prisoner the man with the bicycle ran away, shouting out, "Put his light out; don't go with him"—I went to where the bicycle was, and found there a pair of lady's kid gloves and other articles.</p>

I live at 225, Neville Road, Upton Park, and am a house decorator—on 22nd July Hobbs came and said he had a friend who wanted to rent the stables, and make a sort of warehouse or stores of them—I let them to Hobbs on a weekly tenancy of 4s. a week—I afterwards saw on those premises some boxes; I could not say what they contained—I met Hobbs there on one occasion—I got no rent till this morning, when an order came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Southwold Grove Road, Leytonstone—I was in Kendell's employ at his Harrow Green Road shop for seven or eight months—at the beginning of June he told me in effect that he was in difficulties—about the 5th July I took stock at that shop; Wilkinson was there—we were engaged all night—we brought out the stock roughly at about £600—I first heard of Hobbs in connection with Kendell's difficulties at the latter part of July, after the stock-taking—I did not know Hobbs; Kendell mentioned his name—I was laid up at the time, and about 8th or 10th July Kendell came to my house and said Hobbs had heard he was in difficulties, and he had been through the Bankruptcy Court and had made a good thing of it, and if he liked, be would carry him through with a friend of his who had helped him, and he (Kendell) would make a good thing out of it—before I was laid up I packed three japanned travelling trunks with articles from the stock, and while I was laid up they were taken away—at the end of July I packed up, in soda casks, boxes and travelling trunks, ironmongery, painters' brushes, enamelled ware, and things of that kind—Kendell said he had a stable, which I afterwards found was at Forest Gate—I afterwards saw some of the boxes in a stable in Stacey Road; that was when a cask was being taken there—on 31st July I saw Hobbs at the shop—Kendell discharged me on 29th July; he said Hobbs had advised him to discharge me and Wilkinson, who was Kendell's assistant at his other shop—on 24th August I went into Kendell's shop at Harrow Green to see Wilkinson, and I saw Hobbs and Wilkinson—Hobbs wanted some fourpenny brushes—I said to him, "You have a box of them at your place"—I had put some into the japanned trunks—Hobbs did not answer for a moment, and then he said, "I have turned the boxes out but there are none there. If I knew that you knew as much as you do you should have been in the <hi rend="italic">swim</hi> with us"—it is no use denying that I knew that what was being done was not quite right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew from the beginning of June that Kendell was attempting to do what was simply a swindle with regard to his creditors—I remained in his employ, and did what he told me—he said at stock-taking that he was going to move some of the stuff away from his creditors—I will pledge myself that I did not. know this before stock-taking on 5th July—he only said he should move some goods after stock-taking—he had three shops; a china and glass shop and oil and colour shop in the Portway Road, and an oil and colour shop at Harrow Green—I looked after the Harrow shop, and Kendell and Wilkinson looked after the Portway Road shops, which were distinct—on one occasion, I cannot say whether before or after stock-taking, he told me he meant to strip the Portway Road shop so as to keep the stock from his creditors—I said in the information I swore on 5th September, 1893, "Four or five months ago he (Kendell) told me he was in difficulties, and meant to reduce his stock at the Harrow Green shop, and strip the Portway shop so as to keep the stock from the creditors"—he did say that—I was not to get anything out of it—he promised me a horse and van at one time, when he sent round for me in September, I believe—till then he promised me nothing if I helped him to do it—it was a week or</p>

               <p>fortnight before he filed his petition he promised me the horse and van; it was after I left his service—he sent Wilkinson round and asked me what I meant, and I said I meant to make a clean breast of it, which I had done; I did not tell him I had done so—I went round and saw Kendell, and he asked me to hold my tongue, and promised me the horse and van—beyond that he promised me nothing—he said something about, when it was all over, he would share the proceeds; something to that effect; I took no heed of what he said—I went on doing as I was bid—we were not to share the proceeds; he only said I was to have some share of it—Kendell told both me and Wilkinson at the time we were taking stock on 5th July that he wanted to know what the stock was worth, and that he meant to reduce it—Kendell told me that Hobbs' friend was a party named Foote, or Scott—I did not know anything about him, and had seen him on one occasion—I was afterwards told he was a solicitor's clerk—I packed up the three trunks before I was laid up, and when I came back they were gone—I was taken ill almost immediately after stock-taking; three or four days after, not more—more or three trunks were sent from the Portway shop to my house when I was in bed—those were not the ones I packed—I packed three japanned travelling trunks, and they had disappeared when I went back to business, and I don't know where they went to—they did not go to my house—I knew what the trunks sent to my house were, and, when I got well, I went to Kendell and said I would not have them there, and they were moved the same day—I did not know they were coming to my house—I was laid up for five or six days—the trunks were brought on the Wednesday, and fetched away on the Thursday or Friday—the conversation between Hobbs, Wilkinson, and me might have been a few days or a week after I was discharged—I have never said before that Hobbs told me he had turned the boxes out; I think I said at the Police-court that he said he had looked—I went with Kendell to look at a pony—he handed me a paper containing something which he said was £5—we went to Manor Park, and the man was out, and we went into a public-house, and Kendell said, "You had better hand it back," and it was given over—I said at the Police-court, "I told Kendell I should round—on him. He then gave me £5 wrapped up in paper. This was after I had made a statement. I handed the money back to Kendell in a public-house outside the station in Manor Park"—I made a statement of what he had done to a traveller, and to the soap people—he gave me the £5 in paper between six and seven p.m.; I went to look at the pony, and was to bid a price for it—he gave me the £5 to buy the pony—I could not say if he gave it to me because I told him I was going to round on him; he promised me a horse and van on one occasion—I said I did not want the horse and cart, I wanted the money.</p>

                  </hi> to this indictment—I have been about five years in business—I first saw Hobbs when he was sold up under his bankruptcy—early in July I was in difficulties through my shops not paying—Hobbs called at my Leytonstone shop to sell me something between 1st and 6th July—it was before stock-taking—I told him about my affairs, as regards my two shops in the Portway Road not paying, and I did not know how to meet my creditors—he suggested that I should go through the Bankruptcy Court; that he had done so and he could aid me—I said I thought of calling a private meeting of creditors, and he advised me not to do so, because, he said, "They will be down on you all at a time; directly they know the state of your affairs they would be continually worrying you"—from that time he came frequently to my place; he was there at one time nearly all the week from day to day and at different times in the day—he was no connection of mine—he never told me what he was doing this for—he told me to wait until I was sued before filing my petition—he had goods from my shop from time to time—he did not pay for them—I spoke to him more than once about calling a private meeting of my creditors; he said, "Don't be a fool; listen to me," something to that effect—I first took steps with regard to moving my property on 6th July, the day after the Royal Wedding, in consequence of what Hobbs said—he advised me to remove goods so that when I went through the Court my assets should not come out quite so large—Hobbs took premises at 225, Neville Road, to store goods in from my shop, and I sent there the goods which were afterwards found and given up—I took a stable in Stacey Road, to which goods were removed—Wilkinson and Sweeting both knew I had taken it; Hobbs did not know—Hobbs gave me the key of the Neville Road place after he had taken it—when Sweeting packed the three japanned boxes I was not at the Harrow Green shop, and Wilkinson moved them to Sweeting's house—Sweeting said he had hurt himself lifting the trunks upstairs, and I should have to move them from his place, and so Wilkinson fetched them away, and then I and Hobbs took them to Hobbs's house—Mr. Marsh was to</p>

               <p>do the legal part of filing my petition—I have never seen him—Hobbs introduced me to Foot, and said he was Marsh's clerk; that was in the Spotted Dog—I think I saw Foot two or three times at my place with Hobbs—I have not seen him here—Hobbs prepared my statement of affairs at his house; he arrived at the figure of £295 for my assets—I knew nothing about bankruptcies under. £300; it was my first experience—at the time he was preparing the statement of affairs the boxes were at his house—Foot was there on two occasions—I told my wife about this matter at the end of August, before I went away to a friend's for a day or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a statement in writing to my solicitor at Holloway—these matters were then fresh in my mind—I have never said before to-day that I saw Hobbs and had this conversation with him prior to the stock-taking—it became plain to me in June that I should not be able to meet my liabilities, and then I had a conversation with Sweeting about it, and he mentioned the Bankruptcy Court—he was the first to mention it—he did not volunteer to help me through the Court, only to do what I wanted him to do—Sweeting made the first suggestion to me of moving goods away before I had any conversation with Hobbs about it—Sweeting was the instigator of the whole thing, not Hobbs—Sweeting then helped me to pack goods away till the time he left—I had not started, with Sweeting, packing goods away before the conversation with Hobbs—I took no notice of what Sweeting said; I did not promise to give him money for doing it in June—Foote did not at the time of the public-house meeting suggest that I should remove goods; he did afterwards indirectly, and I understood what he meant—I only kept a rough day-book of cash takings, and a book in which I put down the amount of the invoices as they came in, and one or two in which I put down goods paid for in a day or two—the goods Hobbs had of me were simply small items for household use, not goods of any value—he was assisting at that time in preparing my statement of affairs—I was present when he took stock by himself, after goods had been removed, and a week or so before the petition was filed—he knew the value if the things very well, he was in the same business—I have five children—my children went away after the affair with the trunks for a holiday—I was not giving up my house—I don't remember telling Hobbs that my children were going away; I might have said a good many things to him.</p>

               <p>she was 32 years of age—we had been married about twelve years, and have had six children—the last child was born on the day of her death; that was her sixth confinement—on 24th of July, about twelve or one in the night, she was taken in labour—I called in Mrs. Russell, a friend of ours—I had known the prisoner as a midwife; I had spoken to her some few weeks before; it might be five or six weeks or more—I made arrangements with her to attend my wife when she was wanted—she said 8s. 6d. was her price—in the early morning of 24th July I went for the prisoner, and brought her back, and she attended my wife, with Mrs. Russell, until the child was born, which was at twenty minutes to one in the afternoon—I had to go away at half-past one—my wife was suffering in the ordinary way at that time, I should say—the prisoner appeared to be perfectly sober then—I got home again about ten minutes past three—I met Mrs. Russell in Windsor Street; she spoke to me, and I went home—I found my wife lying across the bed, dead—the prisoner was in the room—all she said to me was, "It was a bad job"—I was, of course very grieved and upset, and I did not pay any particular attention to the prisoner; I did not notice her—when I left, at a quarter to one, I believe there was some spirits in the room; there was a full bottle in the morning—I am not quite sure whether any was taken out or not—it was an ordinary sized bottle—I left it to my wife to make all the necessary provisions for her confinement; I had to attend to my work—I gave her 13s. that day—I don't say that there was any meat in the house; there was sugar, and butter and tea—it would not be true to say there was no food—my wife had had a certain amount of trouble and difficulty in her first confinement, and it was necessary that instruments should be used on that occasion—she had no trouble in the four subsequent confinements—on the last occasion before this, the fifth confinement, a midwife attended her, also on the third and fourth; that midwife was not the prisoner—she had not attended her before this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard of her some few weeks before, as a midwife who had attended a large number of confinements successfully—she came very early in the morning—I was present when the child was born——when I returned and found that my wife was dead, a Mrs. Allen was in the room—the prisoner was standing by the side of the bed—she said it was a bad job; I don't recollect her saying anything, else—I did not see her walk out of the room; I was too much upset to notice anything—I am not aware how soon she went out—I saw nothing to show that she was drunk—I was not aware how much gin was in the bottle—I heard my wife ask her if she would have some gin, not that she herself might have some—if I said so before the Magistrate it must be a mistake; she did not want any—she had taken gin in her other confinements—I did not see the prisoner take any—the child is still living—I don't know if she suffered from flooding in her previous confinements—I have to be away at my work, and could not be at home much—I don't know that Mrs. Russell had any gin—I never saw her have any—my wife wanted some beer—if I said before the Magistrate that she craved for beer, it would be quite correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Russell, of Godmore Lane, Chertsey—on 24th July I was called to the Elliotts' house—I had known Mrs. Elliott before—I got there about three in the morning; she was then in labour—I stayed with her till about twenty minutes to four—I saw the prisoner there—she was quite sober when she arrived—the labour continued till about half-past twelve in the day—the prisoner arrived about twenty minutes to four in the morning, and the two of us remained till the child was born about half-past twelve in the day—it was not a very difficult labour—when I first went into the room I saw a bottle of gin on the drawers; it was full—just before the child was born the prisoner had some of it, about half a tumblerful; she gave some to Mrs. Elliott, about half a tumblerful; she put some water with it—in the morning, a little after six, the husband brought in some beer; the prisoner had some of it, and Mrs. Elliott—I believe it was all drank soon after—later on there was some more drank by Mrs. Elliott and the prisoner—at the time the child was born, about 12.25, the prisoner was quite sober—after the child was born Mrs. Elliott became very light—headed; she fell off the bed on to the floor—that was nearly two o'clock; the prisoner was there then—I made an effort to help Mrs. Elliott back to the bed; I asked the prisoner to help me put her back again, and she could not do it, because she was so drunk—she took some gin and water after the child was born, and before Mrs. Elliott's fall, about half a quartern—I did not see her take any more—that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the child was born—Mrs. Elliott was very lightheaded at that time—I could see that the prisoner was drunk, because she could not move herself to help me; she was sitting down—she did not make any effort to come and help me; she could not move at all—I sent Mrs. Elliott's little girl for Mrs. Snelling, who came, and the two of us helped Mrs. Elliott on to the bed—directly after the child was born the prisoner pulled Mrs. Elliott about dreadfully, when she was light—headed; she was not light—headed before—there was a little bleeding at the time the child was born, not much—the prisoner pulled her about with her hand between her legs with the whole of her hand several times, not her arm, and she brought the after-birth away in pieces—she was doing that for about five minutes—she put the pieces into the chamber—she did it gently, not very roughly—there was dreadful bleeding; that began directly after the child was born, and continued about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I can't tell exactly—it went on till she fell off the bed—she was exhausted—Mrs. Knelling told me to go for Dr. Daniels, and I went, leaving her and the prisoner in the room—Dr. Daniels did not come at first—I went back to Mrs. Elliott; the prisoner was still there and Mrs. Snelling also—I did not notice Mrs. Elliott's condition at that time; I hardly stayed a minute—I went and fetched Mrs. Allen, and she went for Dr. Daniels—I did not go bad; to the room; I went to find Mr. Elliott—Mrs. Elliott was then very ill indeed—I did not go back to the room till after she was dead—the bottle of gin was then nearly empty—the prisoner was there when I went back—she was very drunk—when the bleeding began she did nothing for it—there was a great quantity; it came through the mattress and palliasse on to the floor—Mrs. Elliott was a very thin woman—while</p>

               <p>the bleeding was going on I sent the little girl for some brandy—the prisoner suggested it and gave it to her—I only saw the prisoner drink anything on two occasions—about two o'clock I went downstairs to make some tea; that was about ten minutes before Mrs. Elliott fell off the bed—the prisoner was all right then, when I left the room—when I came back I could see she was drunk—I saw that some of the gin was gone in my absence.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Rowton House, Bond Street, Vauxhall—on 2nd October, about 12. 20 midnight, I was just going up to bed when I saw flames coming out of cubicle No. 323—the rooms are in cubicles, with a bed in each, and a separate door—there is a corridor, with doors opening into each room—255 was the prisoner's cubicle; mine was 357, next to the prisoner's; I had to pass his to get to mine—323 was to the right, opposite the prisoner's—on seeing the flames coming out of 323,1 instantly rushed down and pushed open the door of 325, and saw about half an inch of paper flaring up, right in the centre of the bed—I rushed to the top of the landing and gave the alarm of "Fire!" watching the door at the same time—I waited till Pearson, one of the staff, came up—he went into the room, and the prisoner came out behind him, with some things all flaring up—when Pearson rushed into 323 the prisoner was inside, standing looking at the Are—I am sure he had not entered the room after I saw the fire and before Pearson went in; he must have been in there behind the door—I did not hear him say anything.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am porter at Rowton House—the prisoner had been lodging there about three months; I don't know whether he always had the same cubicle—on 2nd October, between twelve and one, I heard the alarm of fire from upstairs—I ran up as fast as I could, and I saw Clark between the door of 323 and the landing—I said, "Where is it?"—he said, "There"—I ran into 323 and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the bed nearest the partition, and the bed was all on fire; the sheets were blazing, and the other things were smouldering—I pulled him on one side, roiled up the clothes, got outside on the landing, and put them out—I called up Hyatt, the manager, and the prisoner was afterwards given into custody—he had gone up to bed about ten minute before this took place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a gas jet in the corridor nearly opposite 325—that would throw a certain amount of light into the prisoner's cubicle—I have known lodgers strike matches in their cubicles; there is a rule against it—from Saturday to Monday we usually have a rougher class of lodgers—I have been there ever since the house was opened—I believe there have been five fires there—the first was on 19th September, on the same landing as this; the second was on 20th September, not on the same landing; the third was on 28th September, on the floor above this; the fourth was this one, and the last was on 5th October, on the same floor—the prisoner was given into custody immediately after the fire—the prisoner had taken off one coat when I went in—there was one chair in the room.</p>

Gibbons, the post mistress—at the time I issued them there was no other writing on them; they were issued in blank, to be filled up with the name of the payee—the prisoner, George Robert Edwards, was present at the time—he was a postman employed there—he was very near to Mrs. Skinner—it is a small room—he was waiting for the letter-bag, which he would take to Sutton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Ralph, of 52, Livingstone Road, Clapham Junction—in June last, I went to 1, Park Villas, Merton Road, Wandsworth—before I went there I had some printed paper given me—I could not read it—I was only able to see with one eye, the right, but not properly and clearly; I could not see to read—I could distinguish objects at a little distance—with the left eye I could only see light from dark—I went to that address for the purpose of being treated for my eyes—I went about 15th June, with my sister-in-law—I saw Heere Shah and Shahah Bedean—they were both in the room when I went in—I sat down in a chair, and Heere Shah looked at my eyes with his naked eye—he then rubbed some stuff on a slate, and put it in both my eyes; he did it with what I should compare to half a knitting-needle—they said nothing as to why they put the stuff there or what was the matter with my eyes, not till the third time—that was all that took place that day—I went home; I went again later in the day, about two o'clock, and saw the same two, and the same thing was done; some stuff was put in my eyes—I can't say whether they both put it in at that time, they were both there—I went three days, twice a day—on the third day Heere Shah examined my eyes with a hand-glass; he told me he could cure me in a short time—up to that time I paid a guinea a day and 10s. a week—I was not charged anything for the first and second days' visits—after the examination with the hand-glass Heere Shah cut each temple, and put some stuff in my eyes—it hurt me very much; my eyes smarted—I did not pay anything for the operation; I only paid 10s. a week; I paid the guinea on the third day; I paid that to Heere Shah—I continued to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189310160121"/>
               <p>go week by week, twice a day; he put some stuff in the eyes every time I went—on those occasions I saw Heere Shah and Shahah Bedean, always the same two—I went again on the 5th July and saw the same two—on that day an operation was performed; I did not know that I was going to have an operation on that day—I sat down in the chair; my husband was there—I could not say which one it was that operated; it was one of the two; they were both round me, Heere Shah and Shahah Bedean—they placed one or two hooks in my right eye; before that they put something in my eye and put some wet wadding on it, which was dabbed on my eye—after doing that I was left for a few minutes; then they put the hooks into my eye—that did not cause me pain; I had no pain at that time—they took a skin off; I was not able to see it afterwards—my husband saw it, I did not; they did not show it to me; they showed it round the room—after the operation they put some black stuff round my eye and put some wadding upon it; it was some paint, I should think, and a bandage was put over it—no direction was given me as to how long I was to keep the bandage on—I then left with my husband—after the operation Heere Shah said he wanted a testimonial—he spoke in English—my husband hesitated about it, I could not tell what he said—a testimonial was given on that day—I was not in the room at the time—I went again the next day—nothing was done then to the eye that had been operated upon—some stuff was put in the left eye—I paid constant visits up to the 14th of August; on that day I went again with my husband to the fame address—I then saw Heere Shah, Shahah Bedean and Khair Deen and another Indian; that was not the one I saw at Richmond; I have not seen or heard of him since—I saw Shahah Bedean in the morning, he was alone—he said I was to come in the afternoon, and then I saw the four—I sat down in a chair, and Heere Shah applied some wet wadding to my left eye, and he pinched a little round lump underneath my upper eyelid; he did it with his finger—they got round me, and cut my eyelid and took something out—Shahah Bedean did that, while the others stood round—I did not see what he did it with, I had my eyes shut—I could not tell what it was that he took out—they then put some wadding on and bandaged it up—I had a lot of pain from that operation—no money was paid for that operation—by that date, the 14th August, the bandage had been taken off my right eye, and I had a shade over it instead—after the second operation I stayed away and went to a convalescent home—I did not go to them again for about a month—I was not sent to the home through them, but through my friends; I was only suffering from weakness—after that I went for two weeks to Verandah House, Richmond—I there saw Heere Shah first alone—I went to say that I would not go on with his treatment; my husband was ill and laid up at the time and out of work—I had no more money—Heere Shah saw my husband that day; he was with me—he asked me when I could come under his treatment—he examined me with a glass, and said God had given me bad sight, and he would give me good sight—he said he would take me for five shillings a week; that was after I had said I had no more money—I only went there twice, I think, in October—I asked him if there were any more operations—he said, "No"—during those two weeks Mr. Khair Deen cut my right temple; I could not say with what; it was some instrument—Heere Shah was present—after my temple was cut a blister was put on; it caused me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189310160122"/>
               <p>very great pain—I paid five shillings to Heere Shah; I mostly paid him—altogether I paid £5 11s.—I don't remember having paid any to Khair Deen—I do not remember any testimonial being given after 5th July—I am now very nearly sightless with my right eye; that has got much worse—I did not notice any change in the left eye after the operation on the right; it is getting worse now every day—that commenced soon after the operation last September—it began to trouble me while I was at the convalescent home; it had not troubled me before—after the operation it bcaused me pain—since the operation my sight has altered for the worse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JERVIS</hi>. I can see a little to-day out of my left eye—when I went to the Indians I had something the matter with both eyes; my left eye was the worst, but my eyes varied—I sometimes saw better with my left, sometimes with my right, when I went there—now my eyes do not vary at all except that they get worse; the left is the better eye—I see you through that—I complain that I am not better—my eyes were worse at the convalescent home—I had to come home—that home had nothing to do with the prisoners—I got worse there—I was not treated for my eyes at the home—I would have undergone the operation suggested by the prisoners in October, but that my husband was short of money because he had been ill and out of work—after the operation of July 5th I went on August 14th to have another performed—I don't remember my husband writing a testimonial on August 14th; I will not swear he did not—I cannot see well enough to identify his writing—after the operation on 5th July I did think I was gaining sight daily until I had the other operation—I did not think my eyes were going back again as they did after the last operation—between 5th July and 14th August I thought I was gaining sight—I believe the second operation, on 14th August, was quicker than the first—something was taken out of my eyelid—I don't think it was a tumour—I did not derive any benefit from that—I had a lot of pain—all that was done after I came back from the convalescent home was that my temple was cut—I can see now with the left eye; it is gradually going—I could not see so well with the left eye before going to the prisoners; my eyes varied so—I don't remember the testimonial which my husband gave being read over to me—I said before the Magistrate that the first time the testimonial was read to me it was one of the printed bills—I cannot say that he never signed a second one—I gave a testimonial on 5th July after the operation, and when my eyes were bandaged, because Heere Shah guaranteed my eyes would not come bad any more, and he talked my husband into giving it—I was there, but not in the same room in which the testimonial was written out—I cannot remember what was said—I don't remember a second testimonial being signed by my husband—I could see the men who operated; I could see better before the operation than after—I received no money for giving the testimonial, nor did I receive any remission of my payments—I paid 10s. on the Thursday after the second operation, I think—my husband was not out of work then—I made a complaint when someone came to see me from three to five weeks ago, and I told him what had happened—it was no good complaining before, because they had gone from Richmond.</p>

The first stated that a successful operation had been performed on the right eye by Kream Bocesh, the Indian, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, and that in a short time tits left eye would be operated on, and that the public should know tits result.

               <p>her sight—on 5th July I and my sister went with her to 1, Park Villas, Merton Road, Wandsworth—I had not been there before with her—she gave me the address; I had not seen a printed paper before going—I Maw the landlady, Heere Shah, and Shahah Bedean—there were other Indians' there, but I do not recognise them—my wife was placed in a chair and Heere Shah took a powder from a bottle, placed it in a glass of water, put a bit of wadding in the glass and placed it on the eye—the wadding was removed after a few minutes, and then Heere Shah and Shahah Bedean each took a hook—the surface of the skin of the eye seemed to me, when the wadding was taken off, to be puckered and drawn over the sight, so that they could get hold of it with the hooks—Shahah Bedean put one hook in the skin in the outer corner of the eye, so that he could shift it as Heere Shah cut it with the scissors; the other hook was held by Heere Shah in his left hand, and that was put in another part of the eye, in some skin it might have been, while with the scissors in his right hand, Heere Shah clipped the skin—it was an ordinary pair of scissors—the skin he clipped was right over the sight of the eye, over the pupil; it seemed to be taken right off all over the eye—I saw the piece of skin cut off; it was the size of a threepenny piece when it was held up—Heere Shah it was, to the best of my belief, who held it up to the light on the hook—there were several patients in the room all sitting round; some had the stuff in their eyes which was put in before operating, and there were people who came with the patients to look after them—they could have seen the operation if they had looked, but they did not all witness it. I cannot tell what was done with the piece of akin—after it was taken off I saw it—after the skin was taken off from my wife's eye the eye was bandaged up, and I went and sat down, and Heere Shah came to me and asked me for a testimonial—I declined to give him one—I did not say I would not, but I declined at the time—I asked him it the eye would get better—he said, "The eye is good; no more bad; new sight," so I then consented to give him one, and I and the landlady, Mrs. Becker, and Heere Shah went into the next room, and made out this testimonial between us; I refer to the one on white paper as being correct—I think Mrs. Becker actually wrote it—this produced is it or like it—it was drawn up on the 5th of July—I could not tell when I first saw it in print—on the 7th August I went again with my wife to the same place—to the best of my recollection I then saw Shahah Bedean—I don't think any other Indians were there—as soon as we got in he said, "No operation to-day, <hi rend="italic">nicker</hi> Sunday," meaning next Sunday—I went again on the 14th August; my brother and sister went with my wife in the morning; I did not; I went in the afternoon—I then saw Heere Shah, Shahah Bedean, and another Indian whom I do not recognise—they went through the same process with my wife, with the powder, water, and wadding, and put it on the eye; Heere Shah did that—I did not notice the surface of the eye after that—Shahah Bedean covered the eye up; he forced the back of the eye as forward as he could, and then with a small penknife, or a knife, lanced the eyelid right through, and he forced something out; it seemed to me like a small bunch of lights, about the size of a filbert—it bled very much—after Shahah Bedean cut it away with the scissors he passed it to another Indian, who is not here, and he took it away; he would not show it to us—Heere</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired gasfitter, of Richmond—in 1889 and 1890 I suffered from my eyes, but I could see to go to the hospital by myself—I was an in-patient at the Ophthalmic Hospital, Charing Cross, three weeks, and about a year and seven months an out-patient, under the care of Mr. McNamara, the oculist there—I ceased to attend the hospital late in 1890 or the beginning of 1891—no operation was performed on me, but during the three weeks I was there I used to have injections under the skin of my left arm, and I used to have medicine to take—nothing was put into my eyes—after I left the hospital my sight got gradually worse—Dr. McNamara said the blood left the vessels at the back of the eye, and I should go totally blind; he could do no more for me—he said it was optic atrophy, and that opinion was verified, for in the beginning of 1892 I totally lost my sight, and by the middle of 1892 I could not distinguish light from darkness—in the same summer Mr. Reed, of Barnes, handed me a paper—I got my wife to read it to me—there were several testimonials on it—after that I determined to consult Mr. Karim Bakhsh at Park Villas, Wandsworth—my wife went with me, and I also went with Mr. Reed and his wife—on 8th July Karim Bakhsh examined my eyes, and put some stuff into them—he said I was to come three days a week—I went twice on "the 9th, and stopped till two o'clock, and went again at ten; it was on Sunday afternoon after dinner—he said it was free of charge for three days, and he would then tell me if he could cure me—on the third day he lanced and scratched the skin of both my temples, and put something in—I cannot say whether it was cut—he put blisters on—he told me he could cure me, and said would I have it done—I said if he could cure me I would go on with it—I understood all he said—he said I had beautiful eyes and he could give me good sight, and his fee would be a guinea the first time and 10s. a week afterwards—I told him I had been to the hospital, and was turned out incurable, and was totally blind—I went on the fourth day, Monday morning, and took the guinea, because my wife had not got it with her on the third day—he said I was suffering from a disease in my head, and it came down gradually to the back of my eyes, and when he could clear that away he would soon give me sight—that was after the guinea was paid—I went on</p>

               <p>castor sugar he had to take for a few weeks, and then he had to take the powder with sugar and butter—they put the cone ground down into the eyes the day I paid the money—we went to them two or three times the first week and then once a week, and I had the medicine once a week—some times at Richmond the children took him—when we went they would put the stuff in—all the three I have spoken of put in the stuff at different times—the money we paid was reduced from 10s. to 7s., and afterwards to 6s. a week—after the Indians went to Richmond, my little boy went with my husband once, and when he came back he said something to me, and I went with my husband to see what they meant—I saw Heere Shah who said that he would operate on his eyes, and when he had done one he would see, and he would operate on the other, and give me medicine free of charge—he wanted two guineas for the operation—at that time 6s. a week was being paid—on 29th December I was present when the first, operation took place—other people were in the room, including Miss Parsons and her father, and they witnessed the operation—Heere Shah and Khair Deen were present—I saw Heere Shah put two hooks into my husband's left eye, and pull the skin over the whole of the eye up together, and slip it with the scissors—a piece of very thin skin was clipped off about the size of a threepenny piece, I should think, if it were stretched out; it bled, and when I saw the blood I turned and looked round—my husband did not complain at the time; he did afterwards—they got a piece of wadding or wool and wiped the blood up, and then bound the eye up with a silk handkerchief, which I took with me—I paid £2 on that day; a receipt was not given for the money—I asked about a receipt, and he said his tongue was a receipt—I had a paper given me before the day of the operation to tell me how much it would be—my husband was told to come back in a fortnight—the eye was kept bandaged up for a fortnight—at the end of the fortnight I went back with him, and I continued to go down to April this year to Verandah House; I then saw in the paper that the Indiana, had gone—as far as I have been able to judge, the eye has not been any better—since the operation he has complained; it has been very painful at times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a railway pointsman, and live at 71, Faroe Road, Hammersmith—I have a daughter named Evelyn, twenty-four years of age—for some time she has been suffering in her sight; she has only one eye; she has a glass eye—I remember going to the Ophthalmic Hospital in Marylebone Road-about three years ago; her eye was taken out there, the left eye—the sight of the right eye is very bad; she can just see with it, a mere shade like—in June last year, about the 24th, I went with her to 50, Grove Road, Hammersmith—I saw Kream Bocesh and three or four other Indians, not either of these—I asked Kream Bocesh whether he could cure her eye—he had her three days to try the sight—he said she had got good sight, and he could cure her; she had got a disease, but she had good sight at the back—he opened her eye, and put some stuff in it, like ointment or paste—he examined the eye with a round glass, a magnifying glass—he put the stuff in with what looked like a kind of bodkin—I asked him what his fee would be—he said a guinea the first time and 7s. 6d. a week afterwards—that was for twice a day—no other sum Was mentioned—I took my daughter there twice a day for the attendance for nineteen weeks—I did not always take her myself; sometimes I went with her—a good many used to take her—I paid the money several times.; to Kream Bocesh at first, and to Heere Shah and Khair Deen—I do not I recognise Shahah Bedean—when I used to take my; daughter, Kream. Bocesh used to treat her in the same way; he put the stuff in her eye—all the three used to attend her; sometimes one, sometimes the other—I had not learnt the nature of the disease from which she was suffering—I remember going to Verandah House, Richmond, on December 29th, 1892, with my daughter—Heere Shah and Khair Deen were present—she was</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at 71, Faroe Road—I have only one eye; the other, the left, was removed about five years ago, at the hospital in Marylebone Road, where I was a patient—I was suffering from <hi rend="italic">caratilis</hi> in both eyes—when the left eye was removed I could just see a little with the right, light from darkness—it was still the same when I went to the Indians; no change for the better or worse—I continued to attend at the hospital after the removal of the left eye, for some months, perhaps a year—I was not told not to come again; I left of my own accord—I did not get any better—in June last year I went to Grove Road, Hammersmith, and was treated there by an Indian named Kream Bocesh, I understood; I was told so afterwards; I heard his voice—I don't remember if I afterwards heard his voice at the Police-court, Rich-mond</p>

               <p>—some stuff was put in my eye; it smarted very much—I continued to go there about three months, twice a day—I recognised other Indians there; I don't know their names—I heard their voices afterwards, at the Grove—on 29th December I went to Verandah House, Richmond, and an operation was performed there—it caused me intense pain; I nearly fainted—I was stupefied—after the operationmy eye was bound up—I went again about ten days or a fortnight afterwards; the eye was then unbandaged, and something was put into the eye—since the operation the eight of my right eye has become worse—after being under them three months I could tell colours slightly, if the colours were very bright; that was before the operation—I took pills—after about four months the operation was performed—since that I have only been able just to see light from darkness, about the same as I could when I went to them—I have not had any operation on my right eye at Marylebone Hospital since the one five years ago—I had two operations there on the right eye before the left was removed—that would be about eight years ago—after that operation the sight of the right eye was about the same—they called it hereditary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, of 3, Bignat's Cottages, Twickenham—I have a child named William, who was four years old on September 6th; he has been blind since a fortnight after his birth—when he was six or seven months old he was an out-patient at the Ophthalmic Hospital, under the care of the surgeon in charge—there was no change at all after he ceased to attend—in the summer of 1892, in consequence of seeing some testimonials, I went to Wandsworth and took the boy with me—I saw Here Shah and Shahah Bedean, who both examined the boy with a magnifying glass, a circular glass with a handle to it, and put a little paste in his eyes, by putting a little water into a plate and then rubbing a cone, something like a coffee-nut, which they put on the end of a short needle and put it into both the lad's eyes—Heere Shah said I was to take him twice more, and he would see if he could cure him—nothing was said about charge the first three days—I did not take him the second time, my wife took him—the paste seemed to put him in great pain; he screamed dreadfully—I went once or twice after that, but I cannot say the dates, and the same treatment was done—on 2nd January, when we got into the room where the operation was</p>

I live at 43, Biscay Road, Hammer<lb/>smith—before July of last year I suffered in my right eye—I could only see a little light—in July I went with my brother to Hammersmith—I had been treated at a hospital—I was not told what was the matter with it—I was told nothing could be done—at a hospital at Bristol it was operated upon—I went to the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital, at Moorfields, eight years ago, and was told they could not do anything for me, but would see whether I got better as I grew older—I was an in-patient at a Bristol hospital three years ago—since the Indians had gone I was under Mr. Lawford, at Moorfields—I went to 59, The Grove, Hammersmith, on 20th July, to Kream Bocesh—after being treated for some months I went to Heere Shah on 20th November, 1892—he told me he could give me beautiful sight in my left eye—he did not say anything about my right eye, but he put stuff in it—I was treated till 2nd January, when my left eye was operated on—some wadding was put on it after being dipped in liquid; then the upper eyelid was cut from the outside and made to bleed by Heere Shah—then some stuff was put on, and the eye bandaged up for a week—when I got to Verandah House they put lint on, and I was asked to wait while they operated on the little boy Turner, and then I was told to go out because the operation so unnerved Heere Shah, and to come back at two—my left eye has been no better since the operation, but I have suffered great pain, as inflammation set in—at times I get pains in it; it feels as if the eye is coming out—I do not remember feeling those pains before the operation—my left temple was lanced in July by the other Indians—Mr. Lawford told me disease was causing me blind<lb/>ness.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Manor Road, Brixton—about the last week in September, 1892, I consulted the prisoners with regard to my eyes—I saw Shahah Bedean first—I saw the testimonials—three of the prisoners attended me at different times, all but Kream Bocesh—I had dimness, but my right eye was the worse—Shahah Bedean said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189310160137"/>
               <p>he would see me to-morrow and tell me if he could cure me; if he could not he would not take any money—then he said he would cure me, and the fee would be 12s. 6d.—he looked at my eye with a little round magnifying glass—then he said, "I can cure you, you have beautiful sight," and he cut my temple on each side—besides his fee of 12s. 6d. I was to pay him 7s. 6d. a week, to which I agreed—I last saw him on the Thursday before Christmas Day, which was on the Sunday—I paid alto<lb/>gether between £5 and £6—Khair Deen cut my temples again, and put paste in them twice a day, every time I went, with a little bit of copper wire—I was given pills and snuff to take—the right eye got better, but something went wrong with the left, which had not been so bad, and I tried to make them understand not to put anything in it—the right is still better, but the left seems to have something in it—it is uncomfort<lb/>able—it was only dimness before—they said I had a disease in my head—my left eye hurt me very much, not the right so much—they said they would work the disease through my eyes, and I should not be troubled any more, as the disease was the cause of the dimness; but it has not done so—the right eye is clearer—through the aid of glasses I can see much better; I have got proper glasses since I left them—after I left the Indians, on 5th January, 1893, consulted Dr. Archer in the Gray's Inn Road, at the Ophthalmic Hospital—my sight was tested—I had glasses, for outdoors, as well as indoor glasses—the defendants should have ordered me glasses—in a testimonial I gave them they say. I was totally blind; that is false, (<hi rend="italic">Testimonial produced</hi>)—I can read this: "I think it is only right to tell you how pleased I am with your skilful treatment of my eyes"—those are words I don't think I put in—"which for some time past have been failing, until at last I was quite blind"—that is quite wrong—"Fortunately three months ago your name had been introduced to me, and I can truly say you have, without operation, been successful in the treatment of my eyes; I can now see as well as ever, and the method is quite painless. I am thankful I was put under your treatment, although at first I was doubtful of success. My age is sixty-nine"—I am seventy now—I gave them the testimonial because they worried me—Shahah Bedean pressed me to give it the second day he saw me, and kept on till I gave it him three weeks after I had been to them, but not all those words—my nephew wrote the testimonial, and sent it on, but I knew when I saw it I was not blind—I could read it, but I did not stop to do so before I handed it in; I trusted to my nephew to do everything that was right by me—I handed it to Shahah Bedean, who went away, and did not attend me any more, but left it to Heere Shah—that was the last I saw of it until I saw it in print the next week in a Richmond local paper—I did not trouble to alter it; perhaps I should have done; everyone who knew me said how wrong it was to put it so—I went on attending because I thought they would cure me; then I got out of patience, and left them—they said if I stayed away I should go blind—they frightened me to go—then they sent me a letter on 1st or 2nd January—I burnt it, but I remember every word—I do not know whose writing it was—I had worn glasses since I was forty years of age.</p>

Valpy, Chaplin, and Peckham's, 19, Lincoln's Inn Fields—his name is Bockett, the same as mine—he is a lawyer's clerk—very likely I told the prisoner's landlady they were doing me good when she used to let me in, and they were at first—I may have said so on more than one occasion—two or three days after I left I found my sight going bad—my right eye got better, but my left eye got worse, and there was an uncom<lb/>fortable feeling; sometimes it was better, sometimes worse—the words that I had been quite blind are the only words I can be sure were not in the testimonial.</p>

I am a widow, living at 2, Spring Cottages, Richmond—I knew Verandah House, where the prisoners were—I went there about the middle of March last—I suffered from my eyes—I could see a little—someone told me there was a clever gentleman who had come from India who would be sure to give me sight—I could see the figure of any<lb/>one, but not distinctly—I saw Khair Deen—I said, "I understand you give sight"—he said, "Yes, I will give you your sight"—he put a glass in front of my eyes, then he cut my temple, and scratched with something like a quill pen—it bled—then he put on a blister—then he mixed some yellow stuff on marble with something like a bodkin or needle, and put some in my eyes, which gave me great pain—I have it now—I have had nothing like it before—then he asked me for ten shillings—I had not got it—I told him I would endeavour to get it—he asked me what time—I said by two o'clock—I tried to get it from the minister or the visiting lady, but could not, and I did not come back again—I went home—I next received a letter from him a short time after—then I went again, and he put stuff in my eye and made it smart, and got water and a handkerchief and took it out again—I told him my sons would help me to pay if he would give me my eyesight, and he told me again he would give me my sight—he said God had given me bad sight; he would give me good sight—then he shut me in and locked the door—he said, "Give me ten shillings; you no go," and he made me sit down, and would not let me go—I went to open the door; it was locked, and he made me feel ill—he made me sit on the sofa—I begged him to let me go, and walked up and down the room frantic—he said, "Give me ten shillings; you no go; sit you down"—but C could not sit down—the landlady came, after I had stamped on the floor and tried to get out of the window—he opened the door, and she said, "If you will let her go she will endeavour to get your money"—he said, "What time?"—she said, "Two o'clock"—I went home and wrote letters to ladies for</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons—I practise at 55, Green Street, Park Lane, and am surgeon to the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital, and lecturer on ophthalmic surgery there—I have given special study to diseases of the eye, and have had considerable practice in dealing with those diseases—I saw the witness James Russell at the Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital in April this year—I examined his eyes—he was suffering from atrophy of the optic nerves of both eyes—he was practically blind—it was quite impossible that the disease could be cured; the only possible hope was that it might be arrested from absolute blindness—I have not heard described the so-called operation on Russell; I heard of some hooks being inserted. (<hi rend="italic">The evidence of the treatment was read to the Witness</hi>)—that treatment could not be of the slightest use—the optic nerve is of considerable size, as large as a pencil—it proceeds from the posterior part of the eye to the brain, and forms a communication between the nerve and the brain; images formed by the eye are not communicated to the patient unless through the optic nerve—such an operation could have no beneficial effect upon the optic nerve; it could have no beneficial effect what<lb/>ever—little Willie Turner was brought to the hospital on or about 10th April, 1890—I examined his eyes—he was suffering from destruction of the cornea in each eye, due to a previous attack of inflammation; it was a purulent inflammation from some sort of contagion; some matter must have got into the eye—he was then only seven months old—both the cornea were sloughing at the time I saw him; the sight must have been extremely bad—of course, in such a child, it was extremely difficult to test the sight; but the cornea, instead of being clear, was opaque, making it impossible to have little, if any sight—he was treated in the hospital under my advice and wire—he had some ointment given him, in the hope that some portion of the edges of the cornea, which had escaped, might recover its transparency; that was the whole of the treat<lb/>ment that was thought necessary, to be effective—it was necessary to watch the case, because the eyes might become painful and troublesome, And it might become necessary to remove one of the eyes, and there might be complications resulting from that—he was an out-patient—I cannot recollect how many times he came; it was some few times—he did not get any better—I thought it was a very bad case, that there was no prospect of his getting any useful sight, and I told the parents so—the operation described by the parents as performed by the Indians could have no good</p>

               <p>effect whatever—such an operation could have no beneficial effect upon the eyes—the only means that could be devised would be cutting out a small piece of the cornea and placing in a transparent piece of cornea, and that has never been successful—the treatment I used was according to the English treatment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JERVIS</hi>. I was not aware that there is a different style practised in India—the practice of surgery varies in different countries, therefore there must be alterations of treatment—there are many methods of operating in cataract which vary slightly, but all based on the same principles—I only know of the surgery carried on by qualified practitioners in different countries—I have no knowledge of unqualified persons having as much skill—I cannot say when I last saw Russell; I saw him in April, 1893, and at other times—there Vas no distinct, evidence of any operation being performed by the prisoners—I cannot say that it looked as though it had been hooked about—he was then suffering from atrophy of the optic nerve, and he was quite blind in consequence of it—in some cases we hope the progress of absolute blindness may be arrested—no local treatment can be of any good; no local treatment can roach the optic nerve—there was atrophy of the retina—no local treatment can touch that; it is absolute destruction—one might see a case where fibres have escaped destruction, and we could hope that those fibres might continue to carry on a certain amount of action—Russell had no other disease of the eye when I saw him—I would not be quite sure that I had not seen him. before April; I have seen him a good many times—I do not think he told me anything about the treatment he had at the hands of the Indians, I noticed no indications of any—I am not familiar with the drugs that the medicine men use in India—I am aware that there are other Pharmacopoeias—I saw little Turner when he was seven months old—I could not say how long he was under my care peration at any time—I do not think he would ever grow out of it; there was actual loss of tissue, actual destruction that could not be replaced—the margin of one of the cornea was not quite destroyed; one hoped that there might be a small part of the cornea remain transparent, then possibly an operation might remove part of the pupil, by cutting out a part of the eye and making a false pupil; that was the only hope; he was not suffering only from that; there were other complications.</p>

I say if after some time I had found a portion of the cornea transparent, I might have performed an operation so as to create a false pupil, and so transmit impressions to the retina, and so through the optic nerve to the brain—that operation would have to be performed at the edge of the cornea opposite the most transparent portion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital. I have made the eye a special subject of study—I believe on 10th April last I saw the little boy Turner at the hospital—at that time the right eye was totally blind, and the left eye very nearly so—the anterior part of the right eye was bulged forward considerably—the front of the eye in both cases was opaque, both cornaœ, the right more so than the left—it was the result of ophthalmia of the newly born, <hi rend="italic">unatorum</hi>—it is a disease which usually appears about three days after birth—it is purulent in character, having been the result of contagion—I have heard the description of the operation on the boy on 2nd January by Heere Shah—I say it was useless, improper, and cruel; it could have done no good as the child then was, and under no circumstances; it would most likely produce evil results—I understand that the operation was done with a dirty knife, after having been attempted to be sharpened in the spittle of one of the prisoners—such an instrument would be very likely to convey septic contagion, leading to septic inflammation, and, practically, there would be no end to it, most serious results—the operator having been smoking at the time, I should say would probably rather add to the danger—I think a dirty pipe would most likely contain septic germs.</p>

I should say it was not an operation which, under any circumstances I can conceive, would be performed by a man of capable skill—I should decidedly say he could not be competent to diagnose with skill the diseases of the human eye, and could not be possessed of knowledge and skill as an ophthalmic surgeon—such an operation could be of no use in Turner's case; no operation could possibly cure the right eye.</p>

When I saw the boy on 10th April the eye was perfectly quiet; it showed signs of past inflammation; there was a small superficial scar across the front of the right cornea—I saw no evil results from the use of the dirty penknife—the only operation, I thought, would be to remove the diseased part, the whole of the right eye, practically—that would not be in the hope of benefiting the left eye, but to relieve the internal pressure; the eye continues to bulge, which often leads to a very nasty condition—it would only be with that view; not with any view to cure—it might not have been bulged more before the Indians cut off a portion, it would be more likely to bulge—the boy could barely shut his lid over it—I think the removal of a portion would tend</p>

               <p>to cause more bulging and more inflammation—when I saw it in April it was barely inflamed, the smallest chronic inflammation—I know the usual medicines in use throughout the civilised world—I have not seen any of the cones, I have heard of them—they have not been shown to me for the purpose of testing them—I would not undertake to analyze drugs; that is a special branch of the profession—I saw some of their forceps and hooks—I have said that some of them might be used.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALL</hi>. There was what I took to be a very small scar across the front of the cornea in Turner's case; that might be from a slight wound—I cannot say exactly what was removed—there was the presence of a very slight scar, showing that a portion had been removed—the wound had healed, cicatrised—if a piece of the conjunctiva had been taken off the front of the cornea, it might be clear, but not in the case of an inflamed eye like Turner's—when I saw the boy's eye at the Police-court, Richmond, it was in a state of very low chronic inflammation—the cornea is, as Mr. Critchett has termed it, "the window of the eye" in front of the pupil, the iris.</p>

The conjunctiva is a sort of protecting coat of the eye; it runs superficially underneath the lid of the eyeball itself, becoming very thin over the front of the cornea, and it is the secreting membrane of the lubricating material, and the cause of tears; it secrets a fluid—its functions are protective and lubricative apart from that it does not assist the organ of vision.</p>

I am a member as well as a F.R.C.S. of England, and Fellow of Edinburgh, and Senior Ophthalmic Surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—I practice at 21, Harley Street—I have made the eyes a special subject of study, and for many years have had an extensive practice connected with the treatment of them—a large portion of the evidence in this case at Richmond has been read over to me, and I am familiar with the statements made by the different witnesses in the case there, and here; my actual knowledge is derived from what took place at the Police-court at Richmond. (<hi rend="italic">It was admitted by Counsel that the evidence at Richmond was substantially the same as that given here.</hi>)—my attention has been called to the case of Sarah Ralph—she is suffering from <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi> or disease of the <hi rend="italic">iris</hi> of the eye, the colouring portion of the eye which forms the pupil—I speak of both eyes—the effect is not equal in both; it is a good deal worse in the right eye—I examined her about five weeks ago, about the middle of September—at that time her condition, in my opinion, was not curable as to either eye; that disease must have existed for some years—oh 5th July, 1892, I know that a so-called operation was said to have been performed on her right eye; the nature of that operation has been described to-day in my hearing ns a hooking up and snipping off a portion of the conjunctiva—such an operation could have no good effect on the disease of <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi>—I consider the operation was so absolutely and entirely improper that I have to guard myself against any use of any exaggerating statement in regard to it; it was one from which evil results might have followed in this way, that it was quite pos<lb/>sible</p>

               <p>that an adhesion might have formed between the eyelid and the surface of the eye—I agree with Dr. Dodd that it was useless, improper, and cruel—as to the second operation on the same woman, on the 14th August last year, under no circumstances could that have been beneficial—of course there is a possibility (I don't say in this case, because I don't think it existed) of some tumour beneath the lid which would need removal, and in that case there would have been swelling and pain to indicate it—if there had been a tumour the operation might have been justifiable, simply for the removal of the tumour, but not in this case—I found nothing to warrant the existence of a tumour in the left eye—from the description given of what was forced out of the eye, in my opinion it was either a mass of fat from the cellular tissue, for the cut was merely superficial, and the woman was very thin, or the cut might have gone sufficiently deep to remove a portion of the lachrymal gland, which is the tear reservoir—the cellular tissue is the membrane in which the fat would be contained—I say that neither operation could have been of the slightest possible benefit—to diagnose the disease of iritis, a hand glass if used either with an oblique sun light or candle light would be useful; I should prefer to say artificial light, instead of candle-light, obliquely to convey the rays of light—in the early stage the thermoscope would be useful—that has been in general use among ophthalmic surgeons during the last twenty years—until about forty years ago there was no means of diagnosing deep-seated disease of the eye—the conjunctiva is transparent; if a piece of it is snipped off, it would wrinkle and become much less transparent; under the conjunctiva exists another tissue called the sub-conjunctiva tissue, that is far less transparent—the conjunctiva of a diseased eye might be more opaque, and probably would be if the eye had a disease which affected the conjunctiva; I mean in the case of the child who had the disease of the eye—if the eye had such a disease it would Income thicker and less transparent—the effect of the entire removal of the lachrymal gland would be to diminish the flow of tears, and the removal of a portion would have the same effect, that is the sealing of the gland—it would, not tend to diminish the sight, but if it induced dryness of the eyes that would cause absolute disease; <hi rend="italic">vera thalma</hi>, a dry eye—I examined James Russell on the same day as I examined his wife—he was suffering from atrophy of both eyes—I have heard of the operation of December 29th, similar to the first operation; that was absolutely impossible to have any beneficial effect on the atrophy of the optic nerve, and it would deprive the man of a portion of his eye—the optic nerve is at the back of the eye, and cannot be communicated with or affected by any operation in front of the ball of the eye—Russell was suffering from pure atropy of the optic nerve and nothing else—a hand glass would be entirely useless to diagnose such a disease as atrophy of the optic nerve; the proper instrument would be the ophthalmoscope—I have one in my pocket. (<hi rend="italic">Producing it</hi>)—it consists of a perforated mirror, and the operator can see in; in all cases of difficulty a surgeon would use it—prior to about forty years ago you could hardly obtain information except after death—these patients must have been treated by conjecture—this was very deep seated—in the case of <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi> a mirror would be useful to assist the surgeon—the pupil of the eye is an absolute aperture formed in the eye, and we are able to send light through it; the iris consists of two</p>

That is what I say, in combination with the fall—even supposing all that, had been told to the Indians, they would not have been able to discover the atrophy of the optic nerve without the use of the ophthalmoscope—I remember the operation as described—it is quite possible that by September this year the outward skin could so completely have grown afresh that there would be no scar from the cut—that would apply to it if the conjunctiva and sub-conjunctiva had been cut away, if only a small portion of each had been removed—a man working in the gasworks in a great heat, and going out into the sunshine, would tend to congestion of the cerebral parts; and we must remember also that he was very fatigued, and instead of sleeping after his work, he went for a walk—I examined Evelyn Parsons the same day at Richmond—she was suffering from disease of the cornea and iris of the right eye; the left had been removed—the operation performed on her on 9th September was similar to those previously dealt with, and could not, in my opinion, having regard to her disease, have been beneficial in any sense—it was harmful in that it removed a portion of her eye which, in my opinion, it was quite unnecessary to remove, and therefore deprived her of something which was her lawful possession—it did away with the connection of the eyelid to the eye—I think it is unjustifiable to deprive a person of any portion of the human frame without due reason—it is quite possible that such a proceeding might have led to adhesion between the inner surface of the eyelid and the outer surface of the eye.</p>

               <p>—it would depend on the nature of a cataract whether an ophthalmoscope would be necessary—there are infinite varieties of cataracts; some could be detected with the eye, some with a magnifying glass, and some would require an ophthalmiscope—Gillingham's cataract would be discoverable to the eye of anyone without anything—if the optic nerve and the retina are complete there is always the power of perceiving shadows, and that is the only power—the incision of the left upper eyelid with a penknife would be absolutely useless as a curative or remediary treatment for either of the diseases I have described—it would be useless for a remedy and useless for a deep-seated old inflammation—it is an operation which would cause considerable pain, and would do nothing except to cause a little blood to escape, a cruel method of taking blood—the cutting of the temples with a view to subsequent blistering is both useless and cruel, and would have no effect except giving pain—in cutting the eyelid, if the instrument passed very deeply, certain filaments of nerves might have been wounded which would have produced a sensation as' if the eye was coming out subsequently—the sensations which a patient feels are so various and multiple that suggestions would have to be very wide, and possibly rather indefinite as to any other cause for the change she speaks of—assuming that she describes correctly what she has felt since the operation, it is possible that if a change had taken place in the tension of the globe that would have some influence—when I saw Mary Ann Bockett, I found traces of commencing cataract, slightly, in both eyes; they consisted of a few strise round the outside of the eyes, but they did not affect the centre of her vision—in the right eye, I found traces of old trouble in the coroid; it had commenced by inflammation; when I saw it all the inflammation had long since died away—the trouble had been of an inflammatory kind—when supplied with suitable glasses the sight of the right eye came within about 30 deg. of the normal standard; with suitable glasses the sight of the left eye came up to the normal standard, such as is taken for Army and Navy candidates, the standard of youthful sight—the operation performed on her of cutting the temples and subsequent blistering could have no beneficial effect on the cataract in either eye—if at that time the coroid trouble was still active, blistering might have been of some slight service for the right eye, but I should strongly deprecate the incisions in the temple, and especially at the seat of the blistering—it would be impossible for any person skilled or unskilled to diagnose the inflammatory condition without an ophthalmoscope; it was in the deepest recesses of the eye, in the very centre, at the back—my opinion was when I examined her that the coroid trouble had probably existed for two or three years at least, probably longer—I should not like to give a definite opinion as to whether it was present in March this year; it was not present when I examined the eye—Mary Perry was suffering in her left eye from iritis, and opacity both of the lens and its capsule; the pupil was adherent to the anterior surface of the lens—she could just tell the difference between light and darkness, but could not localise the flame of a candle when I held it in different positions before her—the right eye has normal vision; of course, as a woman of 56 years she needs glasses for reading—in my opinion the cutting of the temple in her case was quite useless—the commencing cataract in Mrs. Beckett's case could have been seen undoubtedly by a skilled eye with the use of</p>

               <p>the ophthalmoscope, not without it—it is possible it might have been seen without it had atrophine, or something to enormously dilate the pupil of the eye, been used; if so enormously dilated, it is possible that two or three of these little striæ might have been seen—it would not only be necessary to use atrophine, but to put a light down, so that the light was sent through it—it was difficult for me to see it, even with the ophthalmoscope—the only remedy Mrs. Bockett needed, in my opinion, was suitable glasses—Mary Perry's left eye, in my opinion, was absolutely beyond all remedy—she needed glasses for the right eye for reading, and that was all that could be done for her—her left eye was too soft, showing that serious degeneration had taken place in the eye—I cannot say whether glasses were known to the Eastern races before Europeans entered their country, but they have known of them since Europeans settled there—they have been taken over by English and French settlers, I should think—it requires considerable skill to work out the kind of glasses a person needs, or they may do more harm than good—the best opticians supply glasses on the prescription of a scientific man—I examined Henry Allison—he is suffering from glaucoma in the right eye; the first part of the name means blue or green, and was applied to the disease because the waters of the eye became extremely dull and muddy, and looked like the water of a stagnant pool; the eye, instead of being elastic to the touch, is as hard as this piece of wood, and all sight has left it—in its early stages acute glaucoma is curable—Allison has lost all sight—given that his eye was otherwise healthy in October, 1892, all he could have had was the perception of shadows from the cataract he had—the whole structure of the eye is affected by glaucoma in its later stages, and that is the present condition of his eye—that condition has existed for some months, not more; the disease has reduced the eye into its present condition since October, 1892—I believe that when he consulted the Indians in 1892 he was suffering from cataract in that eye, and that the procedure that was followed was the depression of the cataract into the lower portion of the eye by pushing the cataract forcibly downwards with a needle, so that, instead of lying vertically, it laid obliquely in the lower part of the eye—I can now see the cataract down there, and, with certain movements, it bobs up and down; the edges of the lens are clearly discernible—the lens could not have got where I saw it without a very severe blow—I should expect a man sightless up to the performance of such an operation to immediately afterwards be able to see more clearly, as the pushing down of the cataract would in a moment free the pupil of the eye, and whereas before nothing but bare rays of light could pass through the cataract when it was pushed down or extracted, light would pass through the pupil on to the retina, and then the man, although he saw very confusedly, would be able to count fingers—that operation is known as couching—it was because the old sightless condition of the eye often returned that the operation was discontinued; it frequently produced traumatic glaucoma—couching is an old and disused operation; it was disused because it was found that traumatic glaucoma so frequently supervened—I think it supervened in Allison's case; had the glaucoma existed before the operation in any degree, the man would not have been able to count the fingers immediately after the depression of the lens—it</p>

               <p>is in the natural condition of things that the eye should have been very painful as soon as the glaucoma supervened; the pain of glaucoma is as intense as any that is suffered—I should say that couching had been practically abandoned for fifty years; there have been instances since—the operation appears in books as a relic of the past, or rather as a thing to warn people against—it was not a common operation fifty years ago; the operation of extraction had been discovered long before that—assuming glaucoma to exist in the right eye it might have a sympathetic effect on the left eye in the sense of causing pain—a continued pain in the right eye might produce such continual depression As to render the second eye more subject to glaucoma; that is a point a little more in dispute; personally I do not think that glaucoma causes directly sympathetic inflammation in the other eye, certainly not destruc<lb/>tive glaucoma—it might certainly have the effect of causing pain in the other eye—if Allison continues to suffer pain there will be no resource but to remove the right sightless eye—the testimonial given by Allison would give a correct description of what was done, only it ought not to have been done—the ordinary mode of removing cataract is to make an incision through the cornea, or window of the eye, and pass through a very narrow and extremely sharp knife, and with great care cut up in the wide arc of a circle; some surgeons remove a portion of the iris, but all release the capsule by making a gentle pressure on the skin of the eye; the cataract is resting on what is almost a fluid and the cataract is coaxed to bring its edge opposite the incision and then it gradually glides out, leaving the pupil clear and transparent—if the wound in the cornea heals, as in a large proportion of cases it does, then the patient can see perfectly well by placing the lens in front of the eye in the shape of a rather large pair of spectacles—we succeed in that operation in more than 90 per cent of our cases—if it had been performed on Allison, the odds would have been 90 per cent, in his favour of being successfully treated—if nothing had been done to him, and he had remained with the cataract in his right eye to-day, I should say he would not have had glaucoma; but, of course, this is not the only thing that produces glaucoma—cataracts sometimes pro<lb/>gress with great rapidity, and sometimes remain stationary for years—in this case the cataract was complete, and it could have remained, and the operation could have been performed ten years afterwards—I should always strongly urge a person who possessed normal sight of one eye not to have an operation for cataract performed on the other—I should give an old man like Allison glasses; a young man would not need them; they would not help an eye with cataract—that is the generally recognised treatment of the large marjority of my profession, I should say—I think that snuff of ordinary quality or character would not only have no remedial effect on any of these diseases, but in some cases it would probably have a very damaging effect; if anyone was suffering from congested blood vessels in the retina at the back of the eye, the sneezing that might be induced would lead to possible rupture of some of those vessels; in fact, some cases have occurred in my own prac<lb/>tice where the sight has been damaged by it—I mean any snuff that would produce a more or less violent sneezing, including powdered tobacco—zinc oxide is contained in the ordinary zinc ointment of the Pharma<lb/>copoeia—when I have applied any of that ointment to my hands, and</p>

               <p>some of it has got into my eye, it has caused smarting; but it does not do any permanent damage, nor do I believe it would—I cannot suggest any effect it would have beyond smarting; it is a mild astringent, and an astringent of which, with reference to eye troubles, I have had no personal experience—I cannot assume it to be effective in any of these grave cases—the only solitary case in which I can conceive it would be usefully em<lb/>ployed would be one of prurulent ophthalmia in an active condition, as all astringents are good for that—at the time I saw the little boy the pruru<lb/>lent ophthalmia was not in an active condition; it had been in an inactive condition for upwards of three years, I believe—I should think the result of introducing into the eye a paste with zinc oxide as one of its principal ingredients, twice a day for nineteen weeks, would be extremely irritating, and that it would have no other effect—it would lie irritating in a more or less degree, as it was used for a longer or shorter time—with reference to this extract from <hi rend="italic">La Petite Marseilles</hi> of November 29th, about the in<lb/>cision made in each temple, I say that is absolutely outside my large experience; and, as to the latter part of the extract, I say that the Indians seem in that case to have followed the same proceeding as in Allison's case: depressed the lens, with the result that the man was for a time able to see with comparative clearness—glaucoma follows that operation in a very large number of cases, and another disadvantage is that the cataract, although depressed, may come up again; there are cases where a sudden jump has brought the cataract up, and the patient in a moment is as blind as before—medical congresses are held attended by qualified surgeons from India; there is one in England at the present time—Indians and English foregather from time to time in order to see what progress has been made in the science we follow—a man who left the hospitals twenty years ago would probably not know much about ophthalmic surgery—it is only in recent years that surgeons have learnt it at the hospitals—the conjunctiva might have been drawn up with these hooks, or with many other things—they are steel—they are not such books as we use—I should not use them—I use a fine pair of forceps—I find here two pairs of forceps, one of extremely common make, and the other finer; I should see no objection to use the finer ones, the others are extremely clumsy, and in my opinion would be quite useless, and ought not to be put near an eye—I find several probes, one of them might be used in skilled hands for dilating the tear duct; these others are, in my opinion, worse than useless, because they are very large, and not graduated, and the introduction of them would be attended with very great harm; the first one is graduated—there is a three-sided needle of rather curious make, and of a reddish colour, which might be from rust, or a medicine; I know no proper use for it, but possibly it might be used for pushing a cataract down—these are two lancets, one undoubtedly of Oriental make and shape; the other might be used for vaccination or opening a vein, if it were clean and sharp; they happen to be blunt, rusty, and dirty—I saw them at the Police-court early in September; they were in the same con<lb/>dition then, and in that condition are quite unfit for use in or upon the eye—these are two hand magnifying glasses; the sole use of those would be to magnify any object on the outer surface of the eye, and detect whether any foreign body were there or not; or, used obliquely, to transmit rays of light a little more deeply into the eye, but not to the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JERVIS</hi>. I have never been called as an expert witness with the intention of contradicting the evidence of other gentle<lb/>men of my profession—I have given evidence which has been in some degree dissented from by other qualified practitioners—my evidence to<lb/>day is my opinion, except where I have spoken to questions of undoubted fact—it is a fact that Allison has glaucoma, not an opinion—I believe that I am one of many vice-presidents of the London and County Medical Protection Society, but I only know that on hearsay—I never attended a meeting of the society, and know nothing about it—I am not influenced in the smallest degree by the fact of being so connected with the society in giving my evidence to-day—I am not one of the persons who put the prosecution in motion; I did not know of it till two days before I was called to Richmond—I don't think I signed the articles of association or anything—I don't know what this snuff is, whether it is tobacco or not; it is only a fine, and, I should think, rather an irritant powder—my only objection to snuff is that it may produce a violent sneeze—it is not usual in some diseases of the eye or brain to take powder through the nose—I have known snuff, or some powder, prescribed for a very violent cold, and hay-fever sometimes—the sole possible use of zinc oxide is that it is a mild astringent, and it is used in the form of an ointment to put on a sore place—if a person suffered from eczema, which extended to the eye<lb/>lids, zinc ointment would be a proper thing to apply—as far as the zinc oxide is concerned, I would not say that it was altogether necessarily an. improper substance to put into the eye in the form of a paste; I have not heard of the other ingredients—inflammation of the eye might be relieved by letting blood from the temples, but that might be done in a far less cruel manner, and more successfully—under no circumstances do I think the scarification of the skin is justifiable, because you can obtain your end by other means—bleeding by leeches might relieve the inflammation—I should employ leeches—you would get a certain amount of blood by cutting the temples, but much less, and the prisoners used it in conjunction with blistering—in a country like India, where leeches might be difficult to obtain, getting blood by lancet would do instead, I think—in former years bleeding was used for almost everything—as a rule a vein was opened in the arm—I saw the patients at Richmond, but I have not seen them as a professional man till I was called into this case—the little boy had a scar on his eye; not an absolute scar, it was a little thing—I saw the same thing in the man Russell—six months would be quite enough for obliterating nearly all traces of so dreadful an operation if there were not adhesions—in Mrs. Ralph's case the lachrymal gland could be taken away through the eyelids, and no trace of it remain</p>

               <p>to-day—of course, if a tumour was removed, there might be no trace of it, but it might be only fat and cellular tissue—I was told that a mass the size of a filbert was removed, and I have given two or three things which it might have been—the ophthalmoscope is known in India and to the natives—ten or twelve years ago the majority of ordinary practitioners would have no knowledge of the ophthalmoscope—Hawkins had cataract in his right eye; they had done nothing to the left, but if they had had proper knowledge that could have been brought up to the proper standard—their treatment may have been that pursued by surgeons forty years ago—the lens might get up again to its old place, and a second operation could be performed to repress it—in the majority of cases <hi rend="italic">traumatic glaucoma</hi> intervenes—I say that in these eight cases these men have made mistakes, have been wrong—in cataract cases, ten per cent, of the cases fail—we have not the same statistics in other operations, but even in cataract cases you must not take it that 10 in 100 fail, we sometimes have succeeded in 97 or 98—there is a form of cataract known as diabetic cataract, and an ophthalmic surgeon would not allow his patient to go through it because the odds are as much against it as in favour—the strides in ophthalmic science have been very great in the last thirty years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALL</hi>. I use forceps to take hold of the con<lb/>junctiva but not to raise it—I should not attempt to remove any film or growth on the conjunctiva by medicine; if there was a growth I should remove it, but you used the word film which I object to—by a growth I mean there may be a little tumour—that growth might not spread over the whole eye—there is one disease of the eye named <hi rend="italic">pannus</hi>, blood vessels spreading over the cornea, that is the only growth I know apart from tumour—<hi rend="italic">pterygium</hi> is a tumour of the conjunctiva and that might spread unless arrested towards the pupil—it stops here. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to the diagram</hi>)—it is the outer covering of the eye, so that you have two mucous surfaces together—<hi rend="italic">pannus</hi> is not under the conjunctiva, it runs from the conjunc<lb/>tiva over the cornea—there is also something called a diptheritic mem<lb/>brane—it usually appears on the conjunctiva under the upper lid, but it often comes on the other as well—it might appear without diptheria in association with blood poisoning—films of the kind I have mentioned may occur in addition to other diseases, and the removal or diminution of them would be a proper object of ophthalmic surgery—the removal of a diptheritic patch would be more noticeable five or six months afterwards than if you took out a piece of healthy conjunctiva—I think you would trace the removal of <hi rend="italic">pterygium</hi> for six months and <hi rend="italic">pannus</hi> much longer—Mrs. Ralph's disease was <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi>—pure <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi> would not cause any film over the eye, but I wish to distinguish between that and a growth over the cornea—<hi rend="italic">pannus</hi> is over the surface of the eye, and if it were associated with any other disease there might be a film in the substance of the cornea—if patches had been removed from the conjunctiva very little would appear after six months—Miss Parsons suffered from old cornea <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi>, probably with deeper trouble at the back as well—the answer I gave on Mrs. Ralph would apply to any living individual—without the ophthalmoscope power of observation would depend upon a person's sight—anyone accustomed to the use of the magnifying glass would be able to detect a slight speck—Dr. Mackenzie, of Glasgow, is a man of great ex<lb/>perience,</p>

               <p>and by accumulating his knowledge of a large branch of cases, he has come to recognise certain conditions which enable him to arrive at an approximate opinion—I single out Dr. Mackenzie, of Glasgow, as one man whose very great experience enabled him, taking a large class of similar cases, to arrive at an approximate diagnosis of atrophy of the optic nerve, before the introduction of the ophthalmoscope—he did it without examining the eye at all; he had no means of examining it—he would not use a magnifying glass, you cannot use that for examining the deeper parts of the eye—it seems to me it must have been a species of individual instinct with him, aided, of course, by large and wide powers of observation—he had very acute sight, but the most acute sight in the world is no use for examining the deep-seated structures of the eye—by his large experience he arrived at an approximate conclusion; he was feeling his way to the truth—leeching is still practised in a modified degree—blistering is still practised in cases of inflammation—if deep-seated inflammation were in an active condition at the time blistering was the right treatment—it would confirm my opinion that blistering did good, if she was sure her sight had improved afterwards—I do not think a blister would rise so well over an excoriated surface; my objection to the cutting or scratching of the temples is that it would cause pain, without doing any commensurate good—lancing is an old-fashioned form of bleeding—under some circumstances it would be possible by the aid of medicine to bring the eye of a person who could only distinguish light from darkness to be able to distinguish colours; it would depend on the nature of the disease—I said at the Police-court, "It is not improbable that unskilled oculists could have produced that beneficial change," but I qualified it at the time; I think I said it was quite possible that her eye had improved while she was under their treatment, but I did not think it was their treatment which had produced the improvement; I think that is on the depositions—I will not be so ungenerous as to say that it was impossible for her to improve under their treatment—if an improvement of that kind took place, it might be due to suitable medical treatment, and to the blister—if the entire lachrymal gland had been removed in Mrs. Ralph's case, it would have been about the size of a filbert—there would have been very few tears to that eye if the entire gland had been removed,. I have never suggested that the entire gland was removed—if half the gland had been removed, I do not think there would have been severe irritation caused by the lack of tears; I think the eye can get on very nearly as well with half its gland as with the whole—the function of tears is not only to cry, but to lubricate the eye with its secretion; and the want of that, by removing all the gland, means very serious irritation—if part were removed, the rest would have more work—I only once removed a lachrymal gland, and that was in a case of lupus, at the request of a physician who practised skin diseases, in order to arrest the ceaseless, flow of tears over the sore spot—it is an operation very seldom practiced—a tumour of the size of a small nut might grow at the back of the eye in the orbit; we have tumours there—the further back it was placed, the less outward show there would be—I doubt whether it would be possible for a tumour to be there without being very noticeable, because it usually</p>

               <p>spreads in each direction—it would not be justifiable to remove any tumour unless its presence were so appreciable to sight and touch that there was no doubt about its existence—I do not think it could be appre<lb/>ciable to touch without being seen; it might be appreciable to touch and not very visible, but, if it were appreciable to touch, it would be visible to a certain extent—I prefer the term ophthalmic surgeon as applied to my<lb/>self I gave the opinion that anyone might call himself an oculist; I had no right to do so, but I believed I was right, having regard to the anomalous state of the English law at present—anyone has not the right to call himself an ophthalmic surgeon—as a matter of personal opinion I do not think a general practitioner, who is not an ophthalmic surgeon, should operate upon the eye except in cases of extreme emergency—I do not find him generally very ready to do so, even in country districts—I have a large experience of country towns; there is hardly a town of any size in England that does not possess an ophthalmic surgeon of special experience—I have known cases of wrong diagnosis among ophthalmic surgeons, cases that have subsequently come to me—I mean cases of patients said by medical men to be suffering from one disease of the eye, when I came to the conclusion they were suffering from another—I don't remember any case where an operation had been performed by a general practitioner before the patient came to me—I have known of cases where an operation has been performed by some not very experienced ophthalmic surgeon, which in my judgment was not the best operation to have selected—during the last few years our operations have been performed under the influence of cocaine, a local anæsthetic that deprives the eye of sensation for a time—that is used among local ophthalmic surgeons; it has been universally practised during the last seven years; prior to that chloro<lb/>form was used in the majority of cases, not in some of the least painful operations—if an anæsthetic was not used ophthalmic operations would be painful—in cases of heart disease and so on you cannot use chloroform, but a case that could not take chloroform could probably take ether; we rarely meet with a case that cannot take an anæsthetic—there must be suffering; the eye is almost, if not quite, the most sensitive portion of the human frame.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It therefore requires greater delicacy in dealing with it—I heard Mrs. Ralph say she suffered no pain from the first operation; I formed the conclusion that probably the piece of wadding, she said was placed on the eye, contained cocaine—I noticed the other patients described the operations as painful, from which I concluded that cocaine was not employed in those cases—tumour of a cancerous nature would be painful; a large number of tumours are painful, especially those that haunt the orbit; they are usually malignant, what we call sarcoma,—I emphatically disbelieve Mrs. Ralph had a tumour, and I have given my reason why I think her eye was subsequently painful—in the ordinary history of tumour I should not expect the pain to commence and continue after the removal of the tumour—I did not find in any of the persons examined any indication of <hi rend="italic">pannus, pterygium</hi>, or diptheretic membrane—indications of the operations on the conjunctiva in Turner's and Russell's cases are dimly discernible, but I can see them—in none of the cases I have examined do I see the slightest indication that there was a growth</p>

I live at 5, Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square—I have given very considerable study to the eye and to its treatment—I am ophthalmic surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, and to Moorfields Ophthalmic Hospital—Sarah Ralph attended with tolerable regularity, about once a month, perhaps, at St. Thomas's as an out<lb/>patient, from October, 1889, to November, 1890—she was suffering from chronic iritis in both eyes, which was, as I thought, probably complicated by a disease of the deeper part of the eye—it had been in existence about two years, I thought—I think when she left off attending her eyes were about in the same state; it was an unfavourable case; she was prac<lb/>tically no better; no measurable progress was made—she was not dis<lb/>charged, but she did not continue to come—I have heard of the operations performed on her on 5th July and 14th August, 1892—I should say that each operation was absolutely useless, and therefore quite unjustifiable—I have not seen her since—I heard Mr. Critchett's evidence, and in general terms I quite agree to what he has said in regard to all these cases.</p>

I am assistant surgeon to the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, at Moorfields, and at St. Thomas's—I have made the structure and diseases of the eye a special study—I saw Eliza Gillingham about the end of August this year, and examined her eyes—she was suffering from a form of cataract and deep disease of the eye, situated in the cornea and retina; the technical term for it is corodo retinitis—in my opinion it was of long standing—I heard what the Indians did to her described at the Police-court, and she described it to me herself; that the left upper eyelid was cut open, and blood made to flow—I should say that operation was improper and useless, and could by no means be expected to do any good to the disease from which she was suffering—I can see no reason for its performance—I advised her at the end of August to have no further treatment, as I did not think it would be of avail—I have heard Mr. Critchett's evidence, and I entirely agree with the diagnosis he made of Gillingham's case.</p>

I trade as Stoneman and Co., printers, of 138, High Street, Wandsworth—the prisoners have each been to my pre<lb/>mises as customers, and under their directions I printed something under 100,000 of these handbills in assorted colours—Heere Shah always gave the orders, because he can speak English—I understood him perfectly—the first order was in June, 1892, for 50,000—after I had set up the type I sent it down, and the tall one came with his brother and made some suggestions, or found some fault—two or three months afterwards a second order was given for 50,000—this (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit J.</hi>) is a copy—it is one of the altered ones to the diff<lb/>erent address—I find on the back of it "4,000 for Aldershot, 30,000 for Forest Hill, 3,000 for Wandsworth, 30,000 for Kilburn"—I believe that is the landlady's writing—there is a note at the bottom, "The copy is all right; of course, Mr. Karim Bahksh does not want the same heading as Aldershot, as that is only once a week attendance"—it says that Bahksh can be consulted every Wednesday between two and four—I executed the order in that way—K is not in the same writing; it is not a handbill, only a piece of paper, "Verandah House, The Green, Richmond,—Sir,—Please to print 15,000 of this address"—I executed that, and they were distri<lb/>buted in the streets by men in Indian costume as fast as I could get them done; they came and took them by handfulls, and gave them to everyone they met.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a Fellow of the Chemical Society, and practise at 11, Archway Road, High gate—I produced the "Medical Register" for 1893 yesterday—in September I received two cones from the Magistrates of Richmond—they had been produced in the proceedings—I examined them microscopically—they were brown, and had the lichenous appearance of bark; the other side is smooth—I tested them merely for organic matter, for vegetable alkali, and the results were similar to what are obtained from ipecacuana, but there are several other vegetable alkaloids which produce the same effect—since my examination I have made a further test for mineral matters, and found that the cones contain a consider<lb/>able amount of zinc oxide, but no other mineral substance—I</p>

               <p>made a paste from some of this substance and put it into my own eyes; it had no effect on the pupil, either dilating or contracting, but it slightly irritated it, making it bloodshot for an hour or two, and slightly painful; it then all passed away—I received some pills from Mr. Wood's clerk, and examined them microscopically and otherwise; they were a sugary con<lb/>fection, containing the rind of oranges or lemons, and some fruit, like prunes in colour—there were no alkaline or mineral substances in them—I took one, and it did not affect my eyes at all, or any portion of my body—I also received this snuff (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the solicitor's clerk, and found it was powdered tobacco; it had a slight scent—I tested it for minerals and for organic alkaloids, and found none other than the active principle of nicotine—I took some of it; it caused me to sneeze several times, but it had no effect on my eyes—I did not go on taking it for several weeks—in my opinion, the snuff could produce no effect on a person suffering from optic disease—these pills would have absolutely no effect on Mr. Russell's eyes, or on his general bodily health; they are slightly aromatic, and might have some effect in removing flatulency.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JERVIS</hi>. The cones were given to me at the very last part of the case, and I gave my evidence when I had not had time to make anything but a very short examination; I have corrected it—it was not necessary to give them to the Public Analyst, and you objected on the ground of expense—they were ordered to be put in a sealed box, which is still in Sergeant Hawkins' possession—I am one of the two secretaries of the London and County Medical Protection Society, and the prosecuting solicitor is my brother—our society prosecuted two or three of the Indians who lived two or three miles from me, under the Medical Act, for calling themselves "Doctor"; not these men, but three of the same troop—there were three hearings before Mr. Cooke at Marlborough Street Police-court—it was offered that if we would withdraw from the prosecution, they would drop the title of "Doctor" on their handbills and otherwise; but we would not accept it, because I had personally warned them—we never applied for costs—the Magistrate said they were in igno<lb/>rance of the law of the land; I must explain that it has to be wilfully done—I said as to the cones that I could not find any active vegetable principle but that of ipecacuanha; you drew that out at Richmond—I have had much experience in analysis—I am a general practitioner—I took a long course in analysis at college, and took the medal—I have pursued it since—I was not asked before the Magistrate to analyse the pills—I obtained some of the pills before that from a young lady who had to do with blind people, but had not analysed them when I was before the Magistrate; I have done so since—it does not look like zinc oxide, it is mixed with some vegetable matter, I cannot say what—there are drugs which nobody in the world could detect, but we can detect the active principle—I will not swear there is <hi rend="italic">imitine</hi> in this, but it gives a similar reaction—that is the active principle of ipecacuanha—when I put it into my eye it did not contract the pupil, but the conjunctiva was slightly reddened—irritation would come from any<lb/>thing,</p>

               <p>even the dust in the street—I cannot be positive what fruit was in the pills; it was not a very useful substance, or I should have detected something; there should be something in it with some appreciable effect—by testing one pill I could find all the important ingredients it con<lb/>tained—doctors sometimes put in some other substance to make the paste, they never use anything without an object—I am going to ask the Jury to believe that that snuff is pure tobacco—this brown mixture (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is totally different, it is not tobacco—I will swear I am not mistaken about the composition of the other, I am sure it is snuff—I have received a training in ophthalmic surgery, but do not practise it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rushton, Northamptonshire, and am a coal merchant—when about four years of age I had an attack of brain fever, after which my sight became bad, short-sighted—in the following spring a person took me to Sir Salbzberg Wells, an eminent ophthalmic surgeon; I was then nearly live—I have very little memory of it; I cannot remember what took place, or what I was suffering from—I know my mother tried to get glasses for me, but failed; no glasses would do me any good—two years afterwards, when I was about seven, I went to Mr. Walton Jones—I do not remember what took place at that inter-view—I subsequently consulted him at his surgery in London; I don't know the address—I should say that was five or six years afterwards, when I was about twelve or thirteen; I am now thirty-three—he examined my eyes thoroughly; he said there was no change—about eleven years, ago I suffered pain in my eyes, and I consulted Dr. Bell Taylor, of Nottingham; he galvanized my temples, and gave me a recipe for some pills, and afterwards I got some ointment from a chemist that he recom<lb/>mended, that gave me temporary relief only for a day or so—I derived no benefit from those various treatments—I told Dr. Bell Taylor that I could get no glasses to suit me; he said, "No, no glasses will suit you, the disease is at the back of the eye"—in July, 1893, in consequence of an advertisement in a local paper, I went to some of these Indian oculists at Welling borough—I saw Heere Shah—my eyes were examined—they lanced the temple, and placed something on it, I believe, and also placed some dressing in my eyes; it was made into a paste by dissolving it on a slate with water—that was not a painful operation—I have been under their treatment since, all through—I continued to take medicines—they were liquid medicines, and I took snuff and also cones—I have continued under their care up to the time they were taken into custody—I have in my pocket some of the cones which they gave me. (<hi rend="italic">Producing them</hi>)—my eyes have been better under their treatment; I have less pain; my sight is stronger, clearer, and a little longer sight than it was—I can see distant objects more clearly and distinctly—my head is much better; I have no pain in my head—I used to have head-aches—it was my intention to go on with their treatment—I have come here quite voluntarily to give evidence, at some cost to myself.</p>

               <p>seeing Mr. Bell Taylor I continued to read; the pain kept on—so far as the pain was concerned in July last, I was practically in the same condition, but my sight had got worse—I could still read, but it was dimmer and with difficulty—I never use glasses—the pain in my head was abso<lb/>lutely continuous, without cessation; it was nearly always a headache; I suffered great pain—I never went to any other doctor about it—the main disease was brain fever—the defendants gave me nothing to take inter<lb/>nally; afterwards they gave me some liquid medicines—that was probably two months ago; six weeks or two months after I first went to them—when I first went to them I did not tell them the history of my case—I may have casually mentioned my illness when four years old—they did not go into that; they simply examined—Heere Shah first of all worked the upper lid of the eye, and then examined me with a round magnifying glass which he held in his hand; then he examined my head, simply feel-ing, as a doctor would the pulse, across my temples; sometimes with two fingers, and then the two temples together—that was on the first occasion, and some paste stuff was put into my eyes—that caused no pain or smarting—then my temples were cut and blisters put upon them—I have heard indirectly that I had disease of the optic nerve, left by the brain fever—the pain in my head seemed all over, it seemed to move about a good deal, in different parts of my head—they gave me something for that some weeks afterwards—I have not got any of it here—I can't say what it was, the colour was red—it seemed a very good tonic—I am colour blind; it appeared to me to be red—I can't tell blue from violet, or red from green—it had a very good effect upon me—I took it twice a day, morning and afternoon—it had a strengthening effect, a regular good tonic, it did me a lot of good—the pain went, my general health is marvellously improved—I never had the curiosity to ask what the tonic was; it was bitter to the taste, but not at all unpleasant—the Indians told me I was suffering from a disease of the head; I can't say what disease, they never told me—I asked them to say in Indian what it was, and they said it, but I cannot reproduce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machine upper closer, and live at 64, Mill Road, Wellingborough—I am 63 years of age—previous to March, 1893, I had been blind in the right eye for seven years—in June, 1888, I went to the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital in Bloomfield Street, Moorfields, with this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I was examined by the surgeon there, Mr. Hulk; he examined both eyes—he said the right was blind, and the other ulcerated—he gave me some drops, and ordered me a pair of glasses; I gave 5s. for them to the optician belonging to the hospital—Mr. Hulk said if my left eye got worse I was to come again—on 3rd August I went again—I could then hardly see my way about, I was nearly blind—he told me to come in six weeks or two months, and I should then be totally blind—I could see a little out of the left eye—I have never seen out of my right eye for seven years—I did not see Mr. Hulk again; I believe he had left; I saw one of the other surgeons—he examined my eyes, and said my right eye was not any good, he could not operate on that, but said if I would go home for six weeks or two months he would try and see if he could get me sight in my left eye—he said by that time he thought I should be quite blind—after I got home I heard of these Indian oculists at Bedford; a friend gave me this bill—I did not</p>

               <p>go for a few days; I went first to the General Gordon's to ascertain if it was a fraud, to see if it was true—my wife took me there—that was in August last year, after I came from the infirmary; my wife took me to see some Indians—I cannot identify any of them; these were not any of them—I saw one of these gentlemen at Kettering—I went to Bedford for twenty-seven weeks under their treatment—I had a bill given to me in the street one day as I was going home from work—in March this year I saw Heere Shah, I think it was; he examined my eyes, and he said if I came to live at Kettering he would operate on one of them (at that time I could not see about with either eye, my wife had to lead me to the shop where I was at work)—he said, "Come and live here, and I will see what I can do for you"—he put some medicine in my eyes, and I went home for three days and went back on the following Monday morning, and then he scratched my temple and put some plaster on, and more medicine—I never had a blister—I don't think the treatment did good or harm—I went to him for nine days before he operated upon me; he then closed my left eye with a handkerchief, and took the cataract off—I can't say how it was done, and I don't think anyone else could—two of my sons were there—he said it was cataract in my right eye—there were seven people in the room—he did nothing to my left eye, only put some medicine in—after he had operated on the right eye he let me sit for five minutes; he then held up his hand, and said, "Can you see that?"—I said yes—then he held up a piece of cotton—it was like a transformation scene to me, I had not seen daylight so long; I could see all in the room—I could not see like that before—I can see now; I can see you plainly—after it was done I walked a quarter of a mile—they followed me home, and gave me instructions what I was to have done to my eyes—I adhered to what they told me—my sight got better ever day, and so it does now—I got my glasses from Moorfields last August, since the operation—I have another pair for long distance—my right eye now is as well as anybody else's, free from cataract—the left eye has cataract now—I could not discern anybody's features with it—I can with my right eye, as well as possible—the left eye would not heal—I can walk, I have come from Honor Oak Park this morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot speak to the names of the persons I saw at Bedford—what was done to me there was just the same as these gentlemen did; no difference whatever—my right eye began to get bad ten or twelve years ago—I had a snowball thrown at it and it caused inflamma-tion, and gradually got worse—seven years ago I had totally lost the sight of my right eye—my left eye gradually got worse—I went to Brompton Infirmary four or five times and had a change of glasses—I did not tell Heere Shah the history of my case—he never asked me any ques-tions, he just looked at my eye with a little round magnifying glass—he said he thought he could cure me—he said it was not him that gave sight it was God that gave sight, and he would give me medicine—after looking through the glass he said it was cataract; and nine days afterwards I had the operation—I cannot tell you what he did to my eye—I did not see what was in his hand—he bound up this eye with a handkerchief, and when my eye was liberated I saw him standing there, and two of my sons, and they could not see what was done—they are not here—there was no blood from it, not a bit of it, nothing of the kind—I saw what he had</p>

               <p>taken away; I picked it up, the cataract; I could have picked it off the ground—it was like a piece of skin; it looked to me like a piece of white skin—I cannot say how big it was, but I know I saw it—I saw it fall as soon as my cataract was removed, I saw light directly—it appeared to lie on my cheek; it might be as big as a sixpence—I could not see through it, I never had the chance—I did not see any scissors, I could not see anything used—he told me it was a cataract—I went to the hospital at Moorfields last August—I have never looked at the eye that was operated upon by Heere Shah to see if there was any mark on it—I did not tell the doctor at Moorfields what had been done to my eye—I went there for a pair of glasses, and I got them—I can see now with my right eye; I can see to read with it—I cannot see with my left; that went gradually after the other got blind—after the oper<lb/>ation the left got better—I can see my way about with my left eye—I can see with it a little, not much; not better since the operation, about the same—it seems a little better since I have had medicine, but I have had none lately—the doctor at Moorfields examined me and thought it was better for me to have glasses; he examined me in a dark room, and then they gave me the glasses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, of 15, Cumberland Road, Loughborough—I am a native of Staffordshire—previous to Sep<lb/>tember, 1892, I was blind for two years and a half—for two years before that my sight was beginning to go; both eyes were failing—I was recommended to go to the Infirmary at Nottingham, and I went there about the end of 1889—the doctor examined my eyes, and said I had got double cataract—a fortnight afterwards he operated on the left eye, and said, if they took the cataract off, I should see as well as ever I did in my life—the effect of that operation was that I have never seen since with that eye—he told me when he discharged me that I should lose the sight of the other, and I did—after some time he said that he had done as much as he could with the right eye, and as to the left eye, I should go blind, and there was not a doctor in the world that could give me sight; so they could do nothing for me—about six months after the operation on the left eye I went blind with the right—in September, 1892, I saw Kream Bocesh at Lough<lb/>borough; another Indian operated upon me; he treated me many times, and put medicine into my eyes for a fortnight—he said my left eye was gone entirely, but there was sight in my right eye, and he hoped, by the help of God above, he could get me my sight, and he did so in a fortnight—he just scratched my temple, and put on a kind of little plaster; it did not hurt me—I continued to go after the operation, after I had my sight, for many weeks—Kream Bocesh was not there during the operation; it was the other Indian, who is away—the operation was not painful; it was more like the prick of a pin—after he took the cataract off I could see his face immediately—he asked me if I could see, and I said, "Yes, I can see your face"—there were not a great many people in the room; after the operation I could see each of them—he tested my sight; he put his hand on his head and said, "Do you see where my hand is?"—I said, "Yes, on your head"—then he put it to his nose, his beard, and different</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was Dr. Truman who treated me at the Notting-ham Infirmary at the end of 1889 or 1890—I went to the Infirmary for about a year and a half—the operation on my left eye was performed some few weeks after I went there—there were two operations; he came again a day or two after, and operated again on the left eye—there was no operation on the right eye—I could see a little with the right eye at that time—it was one of these testimonials that led me to go to Kream Bocesh—I was quite blind at that time—he put some kind of stuff into the eye—I don't know what it was, and he gave me some pills and a little snuff—that treatment continued for about a fortnight—I could see with my right eye in a fortnight—after the operation, after the fortnight, the man who is not here operated on my right eye—my sight was not better before the operation—there was no change in my sight before the operation—I did not use glasses when I was blind; before that I used glasses, I found them of no use before the operation—I work with glasses sometimes, to read and write with—the operation in September, 1892, was a kind of something he put into my eye, and worked round the cataract, and took it off, and the moment he took it off I could see his face—it was something pushed into the eye; not at the back of the eye, just here (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>), and then went round the eye; that allowed me to see at once—the operator told me it was a cataract—he then bandaged my eye up—they did not go on putting the salve into my eye till a week afterwards—the hot brick was to ease the pain, but I had no pain—I don't know what effect it had; I did it, and I got better—with the glasses I have now I can see pretty well—I got them about a fortnight or a month after the operation—the Indians were still at Loughborough—one pair I got from Mr. Tyler, an optician at Nottingham; the other pair I got in Loughborough, for close sight, not at an optician's—I tried what would be suitable, and selected these—my eye was bandaged up for a fortnight, and then he took it off, and bandaged it up again—the purchase of the glasses was about a week or a fortnight after the operation—I told the optician when I went for the glasses that I had had cataract, and that it had been removed by an Indian.</p>

We get into the Indian Medical Service by competitive examinations—the study of the eye, and practice with regard to it, have advanced in India very much to the extent it has in this country—Dr. McNamara was my teacher, so that qualified eye-doctors know as much as they do here—in India the caste like the prisoners, practise among the poorer people, and sometimes rich people call them in as well—they treat the eye with Indian herbs, and perform operations, too—they are not prohibited by law from doing that—the obsolete operation of couching for cataract is practised by the caste of Indian oculists—I know it has been discontinued by the profession here for forty years, and that in India, they still perform it—this is the first time I have come to England—in India, we are water drinkers; I have never tasted beer—we eat meat; Hindoos do not—great numbers are cured by couching for cataract in India, and my mother used to do it; we cured many blind there—you get the white of an onion, and drop the juice into the eye, and in about three nights it would cure them—it clears the crystalline lens, and clarifies the conjunctiva—that was not for cataract, but for moon blindness—the operation of couching for cataract is very successful in India, and is very much practised by these oculists—I use a great many of my Indian remedies—if called in in India to an Indian patient suffering from cataract I should use the opera<lb/>tion of couching—I should remove the lens, that is the Indian method of couching; it consists in the whole or partial removal of the diseased lens—the juice of an onion removes the crystalline lens—moon blindness affects the curtain of the eye, more the lens, retina; the portion affected is the mucous thin membrane, the lens—I am not well up in it—I know the anatomy; it becomes in an opaque state and you cannot see—I can<lb/>not explain the pathology of it; I can in my own Indian way—the juice of a white onion cures moon blindness; I have cured hundreds—it must be a white onion; it might be a little superstitious—the operation of couching in India consists in first bleeding, opening the temporal arteries, and blistering too; then they perform the operation—in some cases they remove the lachrymal gland—they do the couching in curing cataract; we have a number of cases in India—I cannot explain to you in English terms what cataract is; it is a sort of disease forming in front of the pupil of the eye.</p>

I have not had the opportunity of examining Stephens—I have examined Randolph—he is suffering in his left eye, which was not operated on by the Indians, from senile general cataract—in the right eye, which was operated on, the lens is absent from its normal position—I could not find it at all, but it may be inside the eye—the pupil is undilated, and it is impossible to examine the inte<lb/>rior of the eye unless the pupil will dilate—I could find no trace of operation or external scar—taking his description, I think what was done was a couching operation—I do not think the cataract was removed alto<lb/>gether; I think it was pushed back into the eye—to have been removed altogether, it would have been larger, and left a larger trace of injury—there is a possibility that it may be removed altogether, but it is very im<lb/>probable—I should say that it was impossible that a patient could see a cataract removed, and fall at his feet—Whitehouse is quite blind; there is old inflammation and the matting together of the tissues in consequence of the inflammation; his eye is entirely worn out—in the right eye, which was the subject of the operation, the pupil is clear, but just behind the pupil a cataract is lying—I can see it with the ophthalmiscope, and I can barely see it with the hand mirror, throwing a light obliquely into the eye with this magnifying lens—what I think was done to him was typical couching, successfully performed as far as they could go—Walter Butler is suffering at the present time from congenital specific disease of the eyes, arising from syphilis, and existing, probably, from birth—the boy Tanner may have had the same disease, I cannot say; there are traces of past inflammation in both cornea, what we call nebulous starring; both cornea are clouded—the entire of both eyes is essentially diseased—he has inflammation of the retina, that is his chief trouble, and will be—there is considerable injury; part is destroyed, and that portion will not carry images to the brain—he cannot read big letters, he can just tell the time by my watch—if he gets better, he will see better, and if he gets worse he will see worse; but that will not remove the starred tissue; a portion of the retina is clear, but, unfortunately, that is not the portion most used in sight—if he can do what he could not do before his treatment by the Indians, that would be due to the clearing of the front of the eye, the cornea—I say that he had it from birth—the</p>

               <p>clearing of the cornea may have been dne to natural causes, or it may have been the treatment—the treatment might cause the hearing to improve, but you also get those changes by time alone; when the patient reaches puberty is a favourable time—James Palmer also suffered from congenital disease of both eyes—he has marked clouding of both cornea—he sees the small print on the back of a telegraph form very badly—I believe the deeper structures of his eyes are also affected, but I cannot see them because of the clouding—the ophthalmoscope is not operative—the cornea are both opaque—he sees distance badly; he has not enough light enter-ing his eyes—the treatment might do him good by producing excessive counter irritation, but it was coarse and brutal treatment; much milder methods would be better; counter irritation for that disease is rarely used now—it was a slow chronic disease; no treatment would hurry it up—in the course of many, many years he may improve very slightly—if after a week's treatment he could see objects half a yard off, I should put the improvement down to counter irritation alone—I do not think anything they could do to it would improve the sight—I cannot make out what the operation was—cutting out a fibrous growth would not cure it except so far as counter irritation is concerned in the case of Mr. Ralph the right eye was what we call <hi rend="italic">staphylomatous</hi> of the eye, a bulging—it is a stretched irregular bulging of the eye; it was in a state of chronic inflammation, and there is a cataract; the eye is practically blind—I can find nothing in the left eye; it is practically a normal eye as far as I can perceive without dilating the pupil—I don't think he could have been suffering from any serious trouble, or else I should have found the marks if there had been anything like <hi rend="italic">iritis</hi>, or any serious disease—they scarred his temples, that was for the pain—I say of that, as I have said with regard to every case, that it was excessive treatment, such scarring as that must have hurt him; it is possible he was not sensitive, some persons are less sensitive than others—as far as I can gather from Palmer, the plaster was simply a protective, so that the red-hot iron should not come in contact with the skin—I can't say any<lb/>thing about that case—we use such things in our profession as irritating ointment, a milder method which leaves no scar—in the case of Hannah Elizabeth Reeve, she was suffering from congenital specific inflammation of both cornea, they were both opaque, so that the interior back of the eye could not be examined—she has barely a conception of light in the right eye; she barely distinguishes light from darkness; with the left eye she counts fingers badly, and cannot tell the time by my watch at a distance of one foot—the treatment there was by blisters, she has marked scars on either temple—I can only repeat in this case what I said before, that it was excessive treatment; the improvement cannot be very much—there was a scar on the left upper lid, they must have done something there; I don't know what—I should say she would have sufficient sight in the left eye to avoid big objects—even a very small amount of sight is a very great thing—the boy Martin is now practically free from any disease; there is nothing the matter with him that I can find externally, he seems to me quite well—the conjunctiva of both eyes is thickened, as if from past inflammation, his lashes are slightly irregular, and from the history of his case I judge he has suffered from inflammation of the border of the lids, or <hi rend="italic">blathaidis</hi>—that would affect his sight—I believe he is long-sighted, that would be</p>

               <p>remedied by glasses—the treatment might have had specific action, I cannot say it would not, the presumption would naturally be that it did—I ought to add that this disease varies with health—given health and food, the disease would get better; taking cause and effect together, improve-ment would be a fair inference—in the case of Maria Hallam, the left eye was untouched by the Indians—in the middle of the upper lid of the right eye there is an oblique scar—she has a drooping of the right lid <hi rend="italic">ptosis</hi>—I was not aware that she had undergone cutting of the temple; I don't know what would be the object of that; there is no inflammatory disease; it might have been better done, but of course it beneficial; was if skilfully done the scar would not have been so apparent.</p>
