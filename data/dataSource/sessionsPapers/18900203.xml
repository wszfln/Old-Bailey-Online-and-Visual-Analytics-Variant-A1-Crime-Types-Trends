I am a costermonger, of 87, Harrison Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 16th January, about 2.30 p.m., I was in an elppie shop in Gray's Inn Road—two voting men came in, called for something, and tendered a half-crown; the shopman broke it in two and gave the pieces back to them, and they paid with good money—I went out first, and they came out, overtook the prisoner sixty or seventy yards from the shop, and showed him the two pieces—he took them in his hand, and gave them back to him, and he dropped them down a gulley—the man who had tendered the bad half-crown gave the prisoner some change, and he gave him another coin out of a paper—I was two or three yarns behind them, on the same side—I spoke to a constable in uniform, and we followed the three to the corner of Elm Street—the constable took the prisoner, and the other two ran away—I went after them, but lost sight of them, as there was a great crowd—the prisoner tried to break away from the constable, who took a package from his hand five or six minutes after he was</p>

I shall take you into custody on suspicion of causing the death of one of them, and for wilfully setting fire to the house"—she made no reply—she took from her breast a packet of letters, which she handed to me, also a small canvas bag containing a number of other letters—she never spoke, she simply handed them to me—I have looked at the letters, they are addressed, to different people—one of them is addressed to a Police-court that does not exist, and that was returned through the Dead Letter Office three days before this occurrence; the other letters were never posted—there was a stain on the back of the prisoner's hand and between the quicks of the nails, which I thought was blood—I took her to the police station—on the way she said, "God help you; if you had done as I have done you would have been doing some good"—at the station I sent for Dr. Mackenzie to see heir—she was charged with the murder of this child—she made no remark.</p>

On 17th January I was in plain clothes in Liverpool Street, at 12.30 a. m., when I saw the two prisoners escorting a drunken man, the prosecutor, one holding each of his arms—I noticed the prosecutor wearing his gold chain across his waistcoat; I followed them down Houndsditch a short distance, where they remained some short time; I kept them in sight all the time—all three returned again to Bishopsgate Street Without, the prosecutor a little in advance of the prisoners; the prosecutor had not got his chain on then—they went to Liverpool Street, Sun Street, where they all stayed a few seconds—Lewis left hurriedly, followed by Davenport—I spoke to the prosecutor, and from what he said I stopped the two prisoners together at the corner of Brushfield Street—I said, "Where is the watch you have taken?"—Lewis said, "I have not got it"—Davenport made no reply—I got the assistance of two constables, and the prosecutor and two prisoners were taken into custody, the prosecutor for being drunk and incapable—I handed over Lewis to Constable Linge, and I went a little in advance with the prosecutor and Davenport—I heard Lewis say to Linge, "I have got the watch"—Davenport said nothing when I took her into custody—I charged the prisoners with being concerned together in stealing the watch; they made no reply—this is the watch; the chain was foundinthe prosecutor's pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Lewis</hi> You did not tell me you had the watch, or that the gentleman gave it to you—the prosecutor said he did not wish to charge you—he did not know he had lost his watch till I told him.</p>

Next morning, when sober, he told the Alderman he did not know whether he had given the watch to the girls—I followed him about twenty minutes, because I saw he was drunk and incapable—I had no right to interfere with him—I believe Lewis said to Linge, "I have got the watch"—that was all she said in my hearing; she might have said something else—Davenport did not say the man had given the watch to Lewis, I am sure; she was close to me—she gave her address—when the charge was taken they talked to the inspector—neither of the prisoners said the prosecutor had given them the watch—Lewis said at the station, after the charge was taken, that Davenport had given her the watch, and that Davenport had stolen it—she did not say that in the street in my hearing, to the best of my belief—I believe she said it to Linge going along, but not in my hearing; I only heard she had got the watch then—I found the chain in the prosecutor's pocket—on Lewis I found 28., and on Davenport 2s. 5d.</p>

On the night of 17th January, Shepherd arrested Lewis, and handed her over to me—I took her by her two hands a short distance towards the station—she said, "Don't hold me like that, you have the watch there"—I took the watch, which was in her left sleeve—she said in Davenport's hearing, "She took it, and gave it to me," meaning Davenport—Davenport said nothing to me.</p>

Lewis said nothing when I caught hold of her first of all—I and Lewis were as close behind Shepherd and Davenport as we could walk—we were going to the station before Lewis said anything; it might be a minute or two after I took her, and after I took the watch from her, that she said Davenport gave it to her—several times she said it at the station—I did not tell the Alderman anything about it, I was stopped by the clerk—I was in Court when Shepherd gave evidence—I had not seen the prisoners and prosecutor earlier that evening.</p>

I live at 3, Malvern Terrace, Islington—about half-past one on this morning I was in the City Road, near Duncan Terrace, and heard a gentleman's hat fall off on the opposite side of the road—it was a little foggy—I immediately left my friend, and went half-way across the road, and saw four or five people on the off-side of the pavement; there appeared to be a scuffle—I went further, and saw what appeared to be a robbery, and I shouted out, "Halloa! what are you doing here?" and three men immediately ran down the City Road—two of them were the prisoners—I shouted, "Police!" and "Stop thief!" and ran in pursuit down the City Road, across Goswell Road, and then down another street, and a dozen paces round the corner the prisoners saw a constable coming and came back past me—several constables were five or six yards from me; I said, "Those are two men that were concerned in assaulting this gentleman at the corner of Duncan Terrace"—I did not lose sight of the prisoners, and I have no doubt they are two of the men—the prosecutor was following me, but I was the better runner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mann.</hi> I should think I was eight or twelve yards in front of the prosecutor, on the other side of Duncan Terrace—you ran into Winyard Street—when you turned round Goswell Road I was so close that I could almost have touched you with my stick—I did not want to catch hold of you—I recognised both of you at the station—I said you were particularly conspicuous by having a light suit on.</p>

               <p>was on duty in Alfred Street, came out—the prisoners ran into Sidney Street, where another detective joined in the chase—we kept blowing our whistles—they got into Goswell Road—two policemen heard the whistles, and turned the corner of Winyard Street, and the prisoners then stopped and walked back into our arms—I was in uniform—I took Mann, and another constable took Williams—Mann became very violent, threw himself down, and tried to kick our legs; we had to carry him—they were taken to the station—Mann made no reply to the charge—Williams said something about having come out to see a friend.</p>

Morgan were communicated with, so that the bonds should be stopped—they had just been put into Messrs. Baring's hands; I think they were deposited on the very same day they were missed—the coupons were stopped—the Chilian bond was a good security, at a premium—the total value of the parcel was £22,000—until the present inquiry nothing was heard of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of Belmont Villas, Southend—I have no office in the City—some time in October last year I made the acquaintance of the prisoner Clark—he was introduced to me by a man named Pilcher, at 16, Cornhill, at a friend's, Mr. Dain—he gave me this card, "Mr. Frederick Clark, 15, Cockspur Street"—he was introduced to me for the purpose of wanting to borrow, on a bond, £850 for a client of his, a wealthy old gentleman named Mr. Thomas Turner, who lived at 86,. Banbury Road, Plumstead—I asked him how it was he did not do it through a bank—he said, "There are times when a gentleman does not want to borrow through a bank"—I did not see the bond on the first occasion; I was to let him know whether I would do the loan or not—I wrote to him that night with regard to it, and I saw him, I think, the next day—I then told him I could only do the loan if he would allow me to sell the bond, and he was to give me a promissory note for £850, plus the interest, and I was to let him have another bond in six months' time—I mean I was to sell the bond, and on repayment I was to replace the bond—Clark said he would let me know whether it could be done in that way—I met him again the next day at Dam's, that would be the third interview—he then produced this bond to me; I took the number of it, 5,880—I made an appointment for the next day at the same place at twelve—I made inquiry about the bond the same day at Messrs. Morgan's, and on that day, the day of the third interview, I spoke to a person of the name of Turnour—the next day I met Clark again, and he handed me the bond, and I took it with me; arranging to meet him in on hour's time—he told me that I was to draw two cheques, one for £850 and the other for the balance—it was not mentioned what the balance was to be, that would depend upon what the bond produced—I took the bond and gave it to Mr. Turnour with certain instructions, and he came back and handed me the two cheques produced, one for £850, dated 24th October, and the other for £162 9s. 6d., drawn by Sir Robert Garden and Co., in favour of Thomas Turnour, Esq., or order—he also handed me the contract note for the sale of the bond—I went back to my friend's office and there handed Clark the two cheques, the contract note I kept—he said I was to have back the smaller cheque—I then left him—I made an appointment to meet him again the same day at the same place, or at Birch's, 16, Cornhill, I am not sure which; I did meet him later in the day, and he then handed me the smaller cheque for £162 9s. 6d.; it was then endorsed, B 2</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London County Bank at Woolwich—Turner had an account there—I have compared his account, which began on 31st May, 1888, with the bank books—this is the account; it goes down to the time he was taken into custody—the balance to his credit on 25th October was £207, including the £200—before that it was £7—the largest sum ever drawn out at one time was £150—it is my duty to examine all the cheques paid every day—I know Turner's writing—the endorsement on the £850 cheque is very different from Turner's usual signature; he always signed, "Hatfield Turner"—it has something of the same character, but it is different from his usual signature; I should think it is his writing—I think it is the same writing as the signature on the £50 cheque found on Clark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant of the City of London—the petition in the defendant's bankruptcy is dated September 9th, 1885; it was filed on the 22nd, the adjudication was on October 1st—I put certain questions to the bankrupt, which are called requisitions; they are attached to the depositions, and are dated May 5th—the answers dated May 8th are in the defendant's writing—the petition was presented by Mr. Mathews, of Weymouth County court—the assets are £3 15s., the gross liabilities are £18,571 7s. 10d., creditors fully secured £870—the proceedings were transferred to the London Bankruptcy Court by some creditor in London—in answer to the third question in the requisition, the bankrupt produced to me the account A B C D, showing what became of the £4,489 2s. 6d. and other sums which he received from the Members' Mansions—it is signed John Errington French and Thomas Ashwin—they appear to have been signed in the same ink, at the same time—on 6th July, 1&amp;87, an order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard, for an account to be filed between the defendant and French—this is the account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it first sets out the figures in the A B C D account, and then adds something—the total amount of further money due to French is £1,379 14s. 7d., and another sum of £110 put on the wrong side—that leaves a balance of £2,104 5s. 9d. due to French—this account gave me for the first time the particulars of expenditure—I caused investigations to be made with regard to the persons whose names are mentioned there, to whom payments were made, in consequence of which I had certain questions put to the defendant—on September 11th, 1886, we got these further particulars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the defendant, dated August 11th, in which he gave particulars of advances made by French to him, amounting to £2,200—in consequence of the statements made in the account A B C D, that he had spent £4,000 on behalf of French, I brought an action against French—paragraph 2 states that Mr. French holds the deeds for advances made to him by Solomon, and the judgment orders French to deliver them up to the trustees in bankruptcy—they have not been handed to me; the costs have been taxed at £159, and have not been paid, and therefore I took bankruptcy proceedings against French—a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Linklater; that was appealed against, but decided against Mr. French—I took proceedings against French for not delivering up the deeds, and affidavits were made by me and by Mr. French—on 31st October, 1889, Mr. Justice Cave issued a writ against French, for not delivering up the deeds—on the 3rd September, 1889, a clerk who I had not seen before called and made a statement to me—I do not know who he was; he saw me again on September 11th.</p>

               <p>the accounts between Ashwin and French—those accounts are the same as A, B, 0, D, so far as the figures are concerned—account B shows a balance against the defendant of £2,059 11s. 6d.; in account C an item of £600 occurs—£1,400 is mentioned on the other side, and the balance is carried out—on 11th August I put further requisitions to the bankrupt, which he answered, filing a more detailed account—a cash account was given to me of all money expended by Mr. Ashwin for five years prior to October 1st, 1885—in the account of 30th September, 1884, I find" by cash for sale of furniture and effects, £110"—he was examined by Mr. Hayes, of the firm of Newman, Hayes and Co., and I believe he produced the original of the accounts A, B, C, D, each signed by French and by Ashwin—I was examined before the Magistrate, but was not asked my opinion whether the documents were signed at the same or at different times, this is the first time I have been asked—the accounts B, C, and D were all signed after the year they bear date; they represent true accounts—on the second examination in bankruptcy on 20th December, 1886, he was again cross-examined by Mr. Hayes—on June 8th, 1887, the creditors were represented by Mr. Dennis—the order was made that he should file a supplementary account—I believe Mr. Thomas Hugh Horwood, of 67, Chancery Lane, was examined as a witness—he was said by Mr. Ashwin to be the solicitor who acted for Mr. French in 1884—the bankrupt said that he had deposited the deeds of the Wimbledon and Canning Town property with Mr. French, as security for advances which he had made—I believe he stuck to that story, but the examinations were voluminous, and there were contradictory answers in some places—he said that his brother Stephen died at the end of 1886—he was a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Ashwin—they had some disagreement, and parted company, and Mr. Stephen Ashwin claimed the deeds as his property as the legal owner—I have some recollection that Mr. Rymel obtained the property—the thing has been so complicated that I cannot recollect; his name is familiar to me as a gentleman said to have some claim on the property—there has been a claim by the executors of Stephen Ashwin, which was followed by a compromise made by me with regard to the property—Mr. Horwood came to my office after the committal, and produced a cheque to me for £1,170 5s. 5d., dated 29th October, 1884, payable to French's order, and endorsed by him, drawn to T. U. Horwood on Sir Samuel Scott's bank—a judgment was obtained by French against Ashwin on 19th November, 1884, for the balance of the account of £800 14s. 2d.—in the action against French in 1886. judgment was given against French, with costs—the costs were not paid, and I served French with a notice in bankruptcy, and got a receiving order—I did not see him till he attended as a witness at the Police-court, and he told me nothing personally—I swore an information, and no doubt I said that I was informed that French said that he had never had a penny from Ashwin in his life—I first saw Biddle at the Police-court, he never made any statement to me till he was called as a witness; I believe he made it to my solicitor—I believe there is an affidavit in existence stating that the deeds were in the possession of Thomas Smith Ashwin, and that Biddle had seen them in a bag in Ashwin's hand on the first day of the trial of Ball <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> French, and that Ashwin asked him to go into the box and produce them on behalf of the present holder—the first I heard of John Silvanus Tanner was</p>

C., was our counsel, and Mr. Justice Cave ruled that there was a case for us to answer—I did not see Mr. Ashwin go into the box—it being four o'clock, the case was postponed to the next morning—we ought to have put Mr. Ashwin into the box the next morning—he was there, but Mr. Jelf advised that it would not do for him to go into the box, for they would get it all along the line, and Ashwin said, "We want to get these deeds in; I will put Biddle into the box"—that was me—I was to be put into the box to produce the deeds—I did not see the deeds, but he had a bag, and lifted it up—when it was suggested that I should go into the box he handed up a bag to go with me, but I refused, as my junior counsel advised me to have nothing to do with it—Ashwin did not go into the box, and he took the black bag and deeds away with him—he was in Court during the trial behind my junior counsel—he had the bag both days—the result of it was that nobody appeared, and judgment was given in favour of Mr. Ball, and against us—a letter was received at the office from Ashwin about a fortnight after the action—I have made diligent search for it, and cannot find it—it was addressed to—Biddle, Esq.—I recognised Ashwin's writing—he said, "Ask Mr. Bennett if he knows anybody who will make an advance on these deeds"—those were the deeds of the property at Wimbledon and Canning Town—I found out on the day of trial that Mr. French was a man of straw, but Mr. Ashwin said that he was a man with £500 a year—he is the person who instructed me in Ball and French; he drew the brief for counsel—having discovered that French was not a man of large means, I attended the solicitors to see if an arrangement could be come to, and said to Ashwin, "If you give me the deeds I can get my costs;" he walked up and down, and said, "Suppose I have not got the deeds, or suppose the deeds are not here; "I always supposed they were in France with Mr. Toufflet—by an affidavit of documents it said they belonged to Toufflet—the whole of this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Ashwin's writing, it says, "Dear Sir, Mr. Biddle promises me faithfully to let me have the documents relating to Mr. Toufflet"—Mr. Ashwin had called at the office and wanted to see what Mr. French had sworn to; I could not find the document, and sent him the draft—in the meantime I received that letter to Mr. Bennett, and opened it—on 26th October, 1889, this telegram was received at our office, purporting to come from Toufflet.

                  </hi>. I was a captain in the Australian cavalry—I first became acquainted with Mr. Ashwin, I think, at the end of 1880—I was introduced to him by the Count de Croy—he said, I think in the spring of 1881, that he was buying the Members' Mansions, he had made some arrangement with a friend to buy them in his name; he said at the last moment that his friend had declined to go on as he thought there was some risk, but he assured me there was no risk—I said that if it was of any use to him, he was very welcome to use my name, and he accepted that; he told me there was no risk—he did not mention a client—he said he could put business in my way if I would help him and come up to town for the purpose, he would pay £100 a year towards my expenses—I did business for him, and received £100—on June 23rd, 1881, I went with him to the office of the Land Security Company and executed some deeds—the first was a deed of purchase of the Members' Mansions from the Midland Land Company; I believe the nominal sum was £68,000—the second was a first mortgage by me to the Provident Life for £55,000; that was not in addition to the £68,000—the third was a second mortgage by me to the Midland Land Company for £11,250—there was also a mortgage of £42,000 to the Land Security Company—I saw money pass from the Provident Life Company to the former mortgagees—saw a £1,000 note pass—in October Ashwin asked me to find some one who would lend some more money on mortgage—letters passed, but I did not find a purchaser—I employed a surveyor, who called upon me for payment—I communicated with Ashwin, and in consequence of his answer I went to see him, and he told me I was responsible for the interest on the £55,000 and everything else—he had made Mr. Ivory the manager, and I signed the papers—when he said that I was liable I objected very strongly, and asked him for an indemnity—he declined, and said that I had done it for a consideration, £100—I went to my solicitors, Messrs. Lumley, and joined Mr. Ivory as a co-defendant—previous to that action I received a notice from the Provident Life office to pay interest—I did not tell Ashwin that I had no property—the action resulted in a judgment in my favour for an indemnity, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189002030030"/>
               <p>the case went to the Court of Appeal—on 5th July, 1885, it was finally settled in my favour—I was present—Ashwin went into the witness-box—I never heard the name of Toufflet in connection with the Members' Mansions—he said that he had bought the Chateau La Rochebeaucourt, which was a very large property, and the vendor paid over £10,000 for the conveyance—on 5th November, 1884, Mr. Banks got a judgment against me on the second mortgage, and I brought an action for the indemnity, and got judgment on June 13th, 1885, against Ashwin for £9,769 18s. 11d.—I have never been paid any of that—the appeal was taken long before I knew Bompas—I left the Australian service in 1868—I was to have £100 a year as long as the connection lasted, but it had nothing to do with this—I first heard of the Members' Mansions transaction in 1881—I heard the name of French about the same time, but not in connection with the Members' Mansions—I never heard that there was an objection on the part of Mr. Ivory to the putting forward the name of French in this matter—I do not remember saying to Mr. Ashwin, "It does not much matter to me whether it is £5,000 or £5; I cannot pay, and I can sooner pay £5 than £5,000'—it was not for services rendered, it was for expenses, and it was not sufficient to cover them—it was never explained to me that the covenant in the deed made the mortgagee responsible to the mortgagor—he did not tell me that French was the principal in this matter—I never said that I had a friend who would buy—General Ripley, of the American service, was not going to buy, but I brought them together, and they spoke about it—the surveyor was not brought on the scene as a person who would assist in raising funds—I am sure General Ripley was not connected with that, as far as a man can be when it is eight or nine years ago—I know the Count de Croy—he was over here in 1880—I am not sure whether he was here in 1881—he was acting as agent for the Prince de Béarn.</p>

I live at Wimbledon—I once lived at Clapham; I made Ashwin's acquaintance in 1886; I was laid up with rheumatic gout in bed, and Mr. Ashwin visited me between July and October, 1886—he lived at Upper Park Place, Richmond, and walked over to Wimbledon—in January, 1887, I saw him at my house, and I believe he said he was going to Liverpool; he subsequently brought a brown paper parcel, and asked me to take great care of it, as it contained deeds of property, and put it in my tin deed-box—he said property at Wimbledon and in Kent—I put them in my deed-box; he returned a week or two afterwards, and I handed them to him—while he was away I sent to his house nearly every day for letters, at his request, and which I forwarded to him; he occupied a house with his wife and servants—I went there one day while he was away, and found a man in possession, and the furniture was removed under a bill of sale, and sold by auction—about that time he asked me to take over a claim on the Members' Mansions, and sue upon it; and after several long interviews, I agreed to do so—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purports to be an assignment to me of a debt of £450, due from Ivory to French, on the furniture at the Members' Mansions, and also an account for the balance which might be found to be due—I believe that was executed—I never saw French Mr. Ashwin gave me the deed, and it purports to be signed by French—that deed recites several deeds—Several other document were handed to me at the same time, all in connection with the same thing—when Ashwin put that assignment before me I wrote this cheque for £50 in favour of J. E. French, and cave it to Ashwin—he took it away; he asked me to do so to pass it through the bank to show the transaction—it was payable to French's order, and he brought it back to me endorsed by French—I did not pass it through the bank; it has never been through—I gave notice to Mr. Ivory; that was signed at the same time, and bears the same date Ashwin brought it to me to sign, and I gave it back to him—I was to sue Ivory, and Ashwin and I were to have the proceeds if recovered—I never saw French till I saw him at Bow Street the other day—I had an office in Chancery Lane from 1884, which Mr. Ashwin and his clerk, Mr. Clark, occupied with me, but Clark was at Liverpool the greater part of the time—we carried on business there from April to September—I carried on my own business, and Mr. Ashwin and Mr. Clark formed brewery companies—up to the time I left, Clark remained there in conjunction with Ashwin, and I have seen them together frequently since I left—when Ashwin was away Clark acted as his agent entirely, and I found the money for the office—I left the others to do the work.</p>

Ashwin"—that was sent to me at Geneva, with one or two other papers, and I signed them; I thought they were all right; I had every confidence in Mr. Ashwin, and signed them at his request; and the second, third, and fourth accounts in the same way on different occasions at intervals—I did not know that Mr. Ashwin received £600 for me in respect of the Members' Mansions, or £163 15s. 2d.—I know nothing about all these payments out on the right-hand side of the account—I did not authorise any of them—I did not agree costs and expenses at £750—I have never had a bill of costs from Ashwin, or a claim of any sort, or any of the items for costs—I do not know Taylor, Carter, or Lond—I did not purchase Mr. Ashwin's interest in the business of Ashwin and Company, agricultural implement makers, of Stratford-on-Avon, for £1,400—Mr. Ashwin did not give me a cheque for £100 on January 24th, 1883, or one for £200 on 2nd March, 1883—though I signed papers agreeing the balance, I know nothing about them; I did not read the items—I was living in Switzerland in September, October, and November, 1884—I</p>

French to Walter Graham—I signed this as I signed other papers—I have no recollection of signing it, but I recognise my signature—I did not authorise Mr. Horwood to issue a writ against Mr. Ashwin for £1,200, nor did I know that he had done so—he did not hand me deeds relating to property at Alexander Terrace and Road, Wimbledon, and Elizabeth Street, Canning Town; I never saw them; I first heard about them when I came to England a year ago, and I never had possession of them, and have never seen them that I know of—it is not true that I advanced him £1,200 upon them; I never had £1,200 to advance—I had a writ served on me at Geneva, in the action of Ball <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> French; I sent it back to Mr. Ashwin, as I did every paper I received, because the affairs were all in his hands, not in mine; I knew nothing about them; he had made no communication to me what I was to do with documents—I did not instruct him to retain Mr. Ben Bennett, the solicitor, to act for me, nor did I know till last year that he was defending—I did not pay any money towards the expenses of this action—these documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were sent to me at Geneva, and I signed them; two of them were sworn there—I received this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by post, written out as it is—I did not alter it in any way—I have nothing to do with drawing it up—I sent it to the Consul, swore it, signed it, and sent it back to Mr. Ashwin—I signed all the documents sent to me in a similar manner—I read them without understanding them—it was very foolish—I was asked to send them back by return of post, and I did so—I thought it was all right, I relied on Mr. Ashwin, I had the confidence in him of a brother—I never heard of an action being brought against Ashwin by Captain Boss in respect of the Members' Mansions, or that Ashwin said that the Members'</p>

               <p>Mansions were purchased for me; I never saw any details of that action—when the action of Ball and French was decided against me Newman, Hayes, and Co. wrote me a letter of 27th May, 1889; I sent it to Mr. Ashwin, not knowing what it was about. (<hi rend="italic">This informed the witness that Mr. Justice Cave had given judgment against him with costs, and had made an order for the delivery of the title-deeds which he had admitted were in his possession, and they should enforce immediate execution.</hi>)—I did not know that I had admitted it, or that an action had taken place—I took the letter to Ashwin, and he wrote me out the draft of an answer, which I copied and sent to Newman and Hayes; this is a copy of it; the draft remained in Mr. Ashwin's hands—it is addressed from Redhill, where I was staying, but it was written in London—I put it in my pocket, took it to Redhill, and posted it there. (<hi rend="italic">In this letter the witness stated that the deeds were not in his possession, he having transferred them some years ago.</hi>)—the statements in that letter are not true; I never handed the deeds to anybody, nor did I ever give notice that I had transferred them—a notice in bankruptcy was sent to me at Southsea—I sent it to Ashwin, and met him at Portsmouth Station—he had a document which he wished me to sign, and we went to a commissioner and signed it on 21st September, 1889—this is it; this is my signature—I did not read it, nor was it read to me—Ashwin was with me when I signed it—he took it away in his bag, and I never saw it again till I was at the Police-court. (<hi rend="italic">This affidavit stated that upwards of four years ago the witness assigned all his interest in the deeds to one Toufflet, of Rouen, and was unable to comply with the notice.</hi>)—it was not true that I had parted with the deeds to Toufflet—Toufflet is his Christian name, but a great many people call him Toufflet; he is <hi rend="italic">agent des affaires</hi> at Rouen—I never handed him any deeds—I did not authorise notice of appeal to be given in that action—I received at my house at Southsea a notice to attend the Bankruptcy Court, I sent it to Ashwin, and two or three weeks afterwards I went to stay with him at Bournemouth, where he rented a furnished house for the season—we talked over the matter of my having to go to the Bankruptcy Court—he said, "Don't be uneasy, it is all in liquidation," and he quieted me completely—I started from Southsea to London to be examined in the Bankruptcy Court, but I got out at Guildford, and sent this telegram to Mr. Registrar Linklater, of the Bankruptcy Court—that was by Ashwin's suggestion on the day we went to Portsmouth.

               <p>—it says, "As this letter is most important, I keep the original, and send you a copy, according to our custom"—it is about four years since I have seen Toufflet; he was then at Geneva—Ashwin does not know French, and I did not read it to him—I was not at Southsea on 28th October—I do not think I have seen these two letters with the London postmark of October 24th, and this registered letter of October 25th, addressed to me—I did not receive them at Southsea; I was not there at the time—I saw them in Mr. Ashwin's hands at 15, Cockspur Street, they were addressed there by my wife; he did not open them; he said, "I will deal with them"—I did not authorise him to write, "Mr. French having left England, it is thought better to return these two letters"—he told me of it afterwards—he wished me to leave England for a while, during which time everything would be settled between him and his brother, and I could return in a fortnight—he said, "Don't be uneasy, I shall settle it easily; it is all an affair between my brother and me"—he said that he would settle it by giving up the deeds—I said, "Give them up, and it will be all over"—I selected Dieppe to go to, but did not go—that conversation occurred at his lodgings, at Oxford and Cambridge Mansions—I never lived at Cockspur Street—I went with him from Bournemouth to London—we first went to a lodging in Catherine Street, near the British Museum, and stayed there a week, and then went to Oxford and Cambridge Mansions; he had a furnished flat there—I stayed there till about the middle of November—I stayed with him from 23rd September, 1889, when I sent the telegram from Guildford, till November 5th—I told my wife to address all my letters to 15, Cockspur Street; that was Mr. Ashwin's office, where he carried on the business of a solicitor—this telegram is not my writing—I cannot swear whose it is; but Ashwin told me at that time that he had sent a telegram, he did not say to who, concerning the delivery of the deeds—that was about 26th October—in 1886 I went with him to the Cheque Bank, Charing Cross, and he opened a banking account in my name with £1,175 5s. 5d.—I did not find the money—I drew it out in three or four different sums at his request, and handed them to him in notes—I have never had a banking account in England; I had one many years ago when I was in Algeria—I know nothing about the furniture of the Members' Mansions—I have. never seen Ivory—I never received or gave any money in connection with these deeds—this cheque for £50 was sent to me by Mr. Ashwin—I do not know whether it was at Geneva—I endorsed it and sent it back to him, and saw no more of it—it is dated February, 1887—I never had the money—I should say that these four letters (<hi rend="italic">from Arthur L.

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and am medical officer to the Board of Guardians of the Fulham Union—on 13th December I visited the house, 202, Latimer Road—I there saw the prisoner and her child Ellen, twelve months old; she was in a very emaciated condition, but I found no trace of any disease; it had its night things on—I saw no bed or bedding; I did not notice whether it was covered; it was taken up by the mother, and I examined it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see any rugs in the room or over the child; I can't say there were not any; I can't say they were not over the child—emaciation may arise from wasting produced in a number of different ways; it is not uncommon with children under twelve, sometimes caused by unsuitable food, sometimes by catarrh; sometimes cow-milk may possibly be undigested by an infant—I was told that a nevus had been removed from near the heart of the child when it was younger; that would not necessarily weaken an infant; I should not expect it; it depends upon how it is done; if done skilfully it would not be likely.</p>

I am the wife of William Henry Gearing, of Pember Street, Notting Hill—the prisoner and her family came to live there; they left about the 19th September—I never saw bed or bedding in the prisoner's rooms—I have on several occasions seen her rooms, when the door was open; they were in a very dirty condition—I had to send for the sanitary inspector, in consequence—the child Ellen used to sit a good deal on the steps leading to the kitchen in which they lived—the elder children used to mind it, and they used sometimes to leave it in the care of the two younger children—the prisoner was very often out; the child had not sufficient clothing—in order to get rid of the prisoner and her family I took proceedings to get a warrant of ejectment.</p>

In consequence of a warrant I received from the West London Police-court, I called on several occasions at 4, Pember Street—on the first occasion I did not find the prisoner at home—the second time I called was about the second week after I received the warrant, some time in September—I never entered the room till I called to eject them; I saw no bed or bedding in the room then—I saw three children sitting round the fire on some old boxes—I could not see a particle of food of any description, or any bedding whatever; the children were very poorly clad—I got them some food, and they ate it very ravenously—the prisoner afterwards came in and took the children away; on that particular occasion I should say she had been drinking, but before that I saw her outside the Black Bull—I then asked her name, and told her my business, that I had a warrant against her—she made use of obscene language; she was then certainly the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cooper, a wheelwright, and live at 210, Latimer Road—the prisoner and her family came to live in my house about the end of September—she was often ill while there, many hours at a time—sometimes she would be out for two or three hours, or four or five hours some days—on those occasions she was left with a little girl, the one next to her, to mind, very dirty, and hardly any clothes on her; some days she would be left without any clothes at all on her—she used to go out not to work; I have sometimes been out on an errand, and have seen her go into a public-house—she would go out at eight in the morning to go to work—I have seen a small heap of flock in the front room, that the man and his wife used to lie upon; it was flock that had been emptied out on to the floor—I have several times given the child Ellen food; she ate it as though she was very hungry—she was not properly fed and clothed during the time they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189002030043"/>
               <p>were in the house—I several times told the prisoner that I wondered at her going out and leaving the child with a little girl—she said, "I don't leave her with the little girl, I leave her with the other children," and I said they left her for hours—the husband used to go out about five in the morning, and come home about seven, with a basket on his back, if coming from work; I believe he is a bricklayer's labourer—sometimes in the morning there would be a woman come in and stay a little while, and then go out, and after that the prisoner would go out; they were drinking people.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the mother was out I sometimes saw the child lying on the bedding, not properly covered; sometimes when I heard it crying I would go in and coax the baby, and tell her that her mother would soon be in, and I would take her in a little tea and bread and butter—the prisoner was always out when I did that—the neighbourhood of Nothing Hill is very much occupied by laundresses—the child was a very delicate-looking little thing.</p>

But when asked to pay he answers, 'No fear, not a penny nor guinea for you, do you hear'"—on 5th January I received this telegram, "Just summoned for libel to Craven"—between 6th January, when I applied for a summons, and 14th, when it was returnable, I received these three post-cards of January 11th and 12th—at the hearing of the summons I expressed my wish to merely put an end to the annoyance, and said if an apology were offered I would withdraw the summons—the prisoner did not accept that offer, and was committed, being on his own recognisances—my wish is the same now as when I was at the Police-court.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am married, and have been the mother of nine children; five are living, one is married, one is at service, one at the Boys' Home, one at Sanger's Theatre, and this boy is the youngest—he will be eight years old in July—I say that this charge is false, and it would not have been made provided I had continued drinking with Mrs. Poulter, but because I refused to do so she made complaints about me and my boy, both she and her child; my husband heard it, and it caused several words between me and him—on this Friday I lent Mrs. Poulter 2s.—I was ordered to bed by the doctor; she said she could not pay me then—I said it did not matter—I sent her 6d. by my little boy, and she said, "Never mind, that will go off what I owe you"—I also sent her some bitter ale—she never offered to pay me the 18d., and I sent 6d. down to make up the rent—I was in her kitchen when she declared that if my boy was her child she would cut the tongue out of his mouth—she often said he was a very bad boy, and should not play with her children, and frequently I have been there when they had been playing, and her boy bit my boy, who cried—I have often gone out and found my boy fighting with other boys; he did so yesterday in the waiting room; the constables saw his conduct—I have merely corrected him in a proper manner, or he might have been doing the same as his brother, stealing—I have made a. pet of him rather than anything else—I have been too good to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I admit that I have corrected him, but not severely—he has aggravated me, and my husband brought this strap home on Christmas evening, but I never struck him with it—it is false that Mrs. Poulter and Mrs. Parks stood outside and saw me beating him with a strap—there is no ill-feeling between me and Mrs. Parks; I don't know her—she comes here because Mrs. Poulter fetched heir—I suggest that she is conspiring with Mrs. Poulter to take away my liberty—I always properly chastised the boy—I did not do the injuries found on him—his shoulder was bruised by falling off a gateway, and he went to the hospital for it; that was two years ago—if his right arm was contused, his forearm bruised, and there was a weal on his wrist, I can't remember whether I did it—I do not suggest that the doctor is conspiring with Mrs. Poulter—I did not tell the constable that Mrs. Poulter's little girl had caused the marks; I told him nothing about it—I do not know how to account for the bruises, but he is an audacious boy, and always fighting—I spoilt him before—three constables were., required to bring him home, one after the other—he did not knock them down, but they had to push him and make him come home.</p>

Don't hit me! Oh, my throat Leave my throat alone!"—with assistance I carried him upstairs, and placed him on a bed in a room by himself, and he shrieked for a good half-hour; in fact, till he came downstairs and vomited—I have to ask you to call the officers below to say how he behaved while we were waiting.</p>

At ten minutes past nine on Friday, the 19th July, I saw the prisoners Hyde and Whaley round the West Garden Dock gate. They were running. They went to Cannon Street to a coffee shop. I followed them, knowing them, and Hyde asked me to have some breakfast, which he paid for. We went to some public-house, and Hyde gave me 2s. He told me he had some money to divide between four. He told me he had got some money from the Duke of Kent that morning. He said they had taken it; he told me if I went to Twine Court I might pick up a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> or two, as they had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> some money there, coming along by some new buildings. Whaley was there all the time, and heard what Hyde said. I went to West Garden Gate. "The case was remanded from the 23rd July to the 26th July, when the evidence was read to Feeley, but no fresh evidence taken, and then it was remanded to 2nd August—I produce a charge-sheet of 3rd and 4th August containing a charge against Brooks and Brady—on 2nd August the prisoner was again examined—the Magistrate then was Mr. Lushington—the prisoner's evidence may have been again read to him; I cannot say—this is the note of his evidence taken on 2nd August: "They (referring to Hyde and Whaley) did not say which of them had gone into the public-house, and which had taken it, or what had become of the other two; on the 23rd July, after giving evidence at this Court, I was followed from the Court by two brothers named Taylor"—then he goes on with reference to that, I think, "On the 19th July, after what the prisoners had told me, I went to the station and gave information. On 20th July, Saturday, the Taylors knocked me down and kicked me, and I had to go to the London Hospital in consequence; on 23rd July they told me if I dared to come here again they would do for me; I know the Taylors are acquaintances of the prisoners Hyde and Whaley"—on 5th August Brooks and Brady were charged; this is the charge-sheet; it is almost exactly similar to that against Hyde and Whaley—on 9th August there was a further hearing, and prisoner was then recalled, and the whole of his evidence read again, and he was cross-examined as follows:—"I am a dock labourer. I was at work up till a few days before. I swear I saw Hyde. He took me to the Black Horse public-house. There was a lot of labourers at the West Garden Dock Gate. There is frequently a rush at the gate. I was looking for a day's work. I followed because I saw others following. I caught him up in St. George's Street. I did not know hen what he had been doing (<hi rend="italic">he</hi> is Hyde). He invited me to breakfast, and while he was eating so he told me. I did not have words with him on the Saturday. On the Friday evening I gave information to the police. Hyde was arrested at the Chambers. I have never been convicted in my life. I have no spite against Hyde at all. I do not know Tom Tosher. I know Tosher. Fenn was not with me"—that</p>

               <p>cross-examination was for the most part for Hyde, but I cannot say if it was by Mr. Young—on 9th August the two prisoners were committed to the County of London Sessions by Mr. Lushington.</p>

I took statements, among others, from Hyde and Whaley. On 14th October I took the statement from Hyde at Wormwood Scrubs Prison. In the course of that statement he mentioned the names of a number of persons. In consequence of this statement I made inquiries of and took from Joseph Jennings, Louisa Coffey, David Healy, Henry Andritt, and Margaret Gregory. Whaley's statement I took on 12th October, to the best of my belief. In consequence of this statement I made inquiries and took a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Louisa Coffey was not a witness here, nor Ottridge nor Michael Crawley."—"I have been making inquiries and had charge of this case. In the course of my inquiries on 8th October I saw the prisoner at Shadwell Police station. I took a statement from him, and wrote it down from his lips; it was read to him by me, and he said, 'It is true.' The statement is marked 'A.'—Police-station, Shadwell, October 8th, 1889. Charles Feeley says: I am a fire-wood cutter. I live at 225, St. George's Street. On Friday morning, 19th July last, I was at the West Garden Dock Gate waiting for work, when I saw Gleeson (Hyde) and Whaley running from the direction of Shadwell; eight or nine other boys were running after them. I thought there was going to be a fight, so I followed as well. I caught Gleeson up; he asked me to come and have a cup of tea. I went with him and Whaley to a shop in Cannon Street, about five minutes' walk from the West Garden Dock Gate; we breakfasted together, Gleeson paying for it. We then went to the Black Horse public-house on Tower Hill, where Gleeson paid for two pots of ale. He gave me 2s., and said: We have got a few shillings from the Duke of Kent public-house. When we were running through Twine Court I threw some money over a fence where they are building a new house, and if you go back there you may get a quid or two. I left them, and went back to the dock gate. I gave information to a constable. I told the constable about eight or nine in the evening. He asked me where I lived. I told him one of the prisoners (Whaley) lived at a lodging-house in High Street, Shadwell. I don't know the constable's number or name. I should know him again. Some nights afterwards I saw Sergeant Adams. I went with him to the lodging-house, and picked Whaley out from between forty and fifty sleeping men. I afterwards picked out Gleeson or Hyde in the same house. I gave evidence against them. I did not know Brooks or Brady, and gave no evidence against them. I never heard, except at the Police-court, that they were connected with Whaley and Gleeson in the robbery. Gleeson told me at Tower Hill the money they got was to be divided between four; but he did not say who those were. I had previously known Gleeson about two and Whaley four months. I did not search for the money Gleeson said was at Twine Court. (Signed-Charles Feeley.) <hi rend="italic">Roots' Depositions continued;</hi> "I also took statements from Edward Hyde, Richard Smith, Ann Higgins, Thomas Phillips, and Joseph Jennings. Hyde's signature appears at the bottom of his statement. Ann Higgins signed by a mark witnessed by me. Jennings also signed by a mark witnessed by me. In the course of my inquiry Police-Sergeant Smith handed me a black felt hat, which I understood was the hat left behind in the Duke of Kent public-house on 19th July by one of the thieves. This hat I took to the Wormwood Scrubs Prison and tried it on a prisoner named Brooks. It did not fit his head. I did not try it on Brady. I have never seen him. I took the hat and tried it on the prisoner Hyde. It did not fit him; I tried the hat on Whaley, it did not fit him. I took the hat to Chelmsford Prison, where Richard Shaw, otherwise known as Clements, was confined. Clements had his hair parted in the middle, with a curled fringe low down on either side, with the curl turning upwards. I tried</p>

               <p>the hat on him as people ordinarily wear their hats; the hat was small for him where tried on in this hat. I put the hat on the back of his head, exposing the fringe. At this time I had not heard as to the manner in which he wore his hair or hat. On 17th October I went again to Chelmsford Prison. The hat then fitted on the back of Clements' head. I remarked the fact to Police-Sergeant Bremner. I have heard in the course of this inquiry of Edwin Bryce. On 26th November I took Patrick Feeley to see Edwin Bryce at Pentonville Prison. Patrick Feeley saw him there. Bryce was in ordinary clothes. He was placed with fourteen other men, all in ordinary clothing. Feeley walked up to Bryce and touched him. He said something on touching him. On 25th November I took Patrick Feeley to Chelmsford Prison. There he saw Clements with fourteen other men in ordinary clothing. He walked straight up to Clements, made a statement, and touched him on the chest In the course of his statement he mentioned a particular sum of money. In the course of my investigation I never heard the name of Police Constable Papworth, or the number 372 H. I took a statement from Patrick Feeley on 20th November. This was taken in a similar way to the others mentioned. The statement is produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Charles Feeley told me he did not know the exact time. I am quite sure I wrote down at Feeley's dictation. If eight or nine is mentioned in the statement, Feeley must have said so. I did not take Phillips to any prison to pick any men out. Mrs. Higgins has been taken by me to Chelmsford Gaol to see Shaw, and to Pentonville to see Bryce, the same day that Patrick Feeley was taken. On 20th November Patrick Feeley did not say to me that he had told the prisoner that ho had been with two men, or what he had been doing, or what money he had. The conversation referred to in Phillips's statement took place at the docks. Patrick Feeley mentioned two sets of men he saw running, and Phillips one set of men. Patrick Feeley said he went away with the second two; he did not mention anyone else leaving the dock gates, except himself or Phillips. Phillips did not mention the precise date it occurred. He said it was morning, three months ago, between nine and ten o'clock. I remember taking a statement from Richard Smith. Smith did not mention to me that he followed with twenty other men, in company with Feeley and Phillips. Smith in his statement says he started about 11.30 a.m. with Crawley for Tilbury to get a job pea-picking. He does not say specifically where he started from. His statement is that going through Barking we met Hyde, who said he was tramping home from Tilbury, as he had failed to get a job in the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi>; we met him about half past one. Mrs. Higgins did not mention to me the time she saw the men run from the Duke of Kent; possibly it was an omission of mine. The statement was taken in a house under great difficulties. I remember taking Whaley's statement. I think I took three statements from police constable Adams. I took two statements. I saw him at Shadwell Station, when I took his statement down.</p>

Not impose on others to do your work; but I have not spoken to his superiors about him—I have not reported him—I could not say when I last spoke to him—we both went in occasionally—when he said he had to get his own back, I got up and dressed—I was taken to the station and detained—the barmaid and some tradespeople were brought to see if they could identify me—they could not do so—the officer in oharge of the station asked Sergeant Adams if he could not get other witnesses, and he said, "I daresay I can," and he was away two hours, and then he said, "I cannot get any more"; and then the prisoner was allowed to pick me out again after I was put among a lot more men—that was after he had pulled me out of bed—he did identify me—on the morning of 23rd I was brought before Mr. Saunders, the Police Magistrate, at the Thames Police-court, and charged with Whaley with having committed this robbery from the Duke of Kent—there were witnesses in Court, and I called on the Magistrate to ask them to give evidence, but he would not—I was remanded till the 26th—on 23rd the prisoner gave evidence against me—I was not represented by solicitor or counsel—on 26th the prisoner was not at the Court; no one was against me—I was remanded till 2nd August, when the prisoner gave evidence against me—I was not represented by any one—I was remanded till 9th August, and then Brooks and Brady were charged as well as Whaley and myself—on that occasion the prisoner gave evidence for the third time against me—I was then represented by Mr. Young, the solicitor, of Arbour Square, who cross-examined the prisoner on my behalf—I thought my witnesses would be there, and I applied for three days' remand</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189002030060"/>
               <p>till I could get them—the Magistrate would not allow it—he did not say I could call them at my trial—I was committed for trial on the 9th—on 9th August Brady said he told the police who it was, and that he had forwarded a letter in a way that the police would get it into their hands, giving an account of the men that committed the robbery, and the description of their clothes, and that sort of thing—it was produced in Court by Detective Smith—on 14th I was tried, with Brooks, Brady, and Whaley, at the County Sessions—I was not represented; I had no money—Brady was the only one represented by counsel, and he was represented by Mr. Purcell—I called Haley, Mr. Coffey, and Mr. Jennings, and they came and gave their evidence of their own free will, because they knew I was innocent; they were not subpœnaed—my witnesses were cross-examined—in the result I was convicted and sentenced to five years' penal servitude—I am now undergoing that sentence—after my conviction I sent a petition to the Home Secretary, dated 26th August—I had no communication with Brooks or Brady after my conviction; as soon as we were convicted we were put into separate cells at Sessions—on 14th October Inspector Roots and Bremner visited me in my cell—I gave Roots as full a statement as I could think of—in my petition to the Home Secretary, and in my statement to Roots I mentioned several names—Roots took them down, he was to see and examine them if he pleased—I heard no more of the matter till I was brought as a witness to the Thames Police-court on 21st December, when I gave evidence on oath—I did not see the prisoner on Friday morning, 19th July—he did not see me soon after nine o'clock on that morning by the West Garden Gate—I was not running past that gate at ten minutes past nine on that morning—it is not a fact that I and the prisoner went together to a coffee-house and had breakfast on that morning; or that I paid for the breakfast; or that I went with him to a public-house on that morning; or that I told him I had got a few shillings from the Duke of Kent; or that I had got the money to divide between four people who were concerned in the robbery;. or that I gave him a florin or half-crown, or any other coin—I swear to God I never saw him; I was not in London at that time—I did not tell him I had taken the money from the Duke of Kent, or that if he went to Twine Court he might pick up a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> or two, because I had thrown the money there as I was running away from the Duke of Kent public-house—it is not a fact that Whaley was in my company or the prisoner's on that morning, either at the coffee-house, or at any public-house, or that he was present when any conversation or any money passed between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not told by any man on any part of the 19th July about this robbery—I did not see Whaley that day—Bryce did not meet me on that day in Whitechapel, and speak to me about the robbery—when I got to the lodging-house after walking from Tilbury, I went down the yard and washed my feet there—no salt water or towels were brought to me by anybody—there may have been some linen to wrap up my feet in on the form I was sleeping on; not that I am aware of; I went to sleep on a form after I had washed my feet—no person gave me any linen that I am aware of—I have not written to any companions since my conviction—I wrote a letter to my father, and received one from him at Pentonville—at Tilbury, Haley went first through the gate, and</p>

               <p>Andritt afterwards—it is hardly any distance from the station to the gate; Andritt was a little way ahead of me and Haley—when the train arrived the gates were opened wide, but after the people got through they were closed—I was stopped at the gates—Andritt went on board the boat first—the policemen stopped me, and I said I didn't belong to the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania,</hi> but I might get a job if they were any hands short; they said, "You cannot get a job, you might stow away and get us into trouble"—the bed was put inside the gate, I told them it belonged to Andritt; they put the name on a piece of paper, and put it on the bed—Andritt came back, and we had a talk—he and Haley did not know I was stopped (perhaps twenty or thirty people were going on board the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi>); they did not see if I was inside the gate or not—I was not employed by the dock company to check you at your work, or anyone else—I was employed casually by them—you might be away for an hour or an hour and a half, and I said, "Why don't you turn it up? I will not work with a man like that"—if I had liked to check you it might have made it serious for you—I made no complaint to the Magistrate about checking you at your work—on the Friday a boy paid me three pence out of sixpence he owed me—I borrowed sixpence or a shilling of Mrs. Gregory, my landlady—that was not the day the boy paid me the three pence—Mr. Moore paid me a shilling; Mrs. Gregory lent me and John Donovan sixpence between us on the Thursday—I did not borrow fourpence on Friday night for my bed—I paid Mrs. Gregory threepence, and said I Would give her the other penny by-and by; I did not borrow fourpence of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I said to another man that I would not work with a man who was running away from his work, and the prisoner heard me say it; he did not answer, but looked at me—Mr. Moore gave me a shilling on the Thursday for work I had done, and stood me some beer and a shave—it was on that same Thursday night that Mrs. Gregory lent sixpence to Donovan and myself—on Friday, after my return, the threepence was repaid by the boy, when he saw me sitting in the kitchen—I paid threepence for my bed, and said I would pay the other penny afterwards.</p>

I live at 4, Market Hill, Shadwell, and act as foreman for my mother, who supplies ships with fresh water—I have known Gleeson about twelve months—on 18th July we were pumping fresh water into the <hi rend="italic">Macgarel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Scipio</hi> from a barge in the London Docks—among the men I employed to do that was Gleeson; I had employed him on previous occasions—on the 18th he worked for about an hour, more or less—after that I, he, and James Geary went into the Coach and Horses, Shadwell, where I paid Gleeson 1s. 3d. for the work he had done—we had some beer and some conversation—Gleeson told me where he was going that night—he left me about half-past nine, I should think—I did not see him after that, but some days after I heard he was in custody, and some little time after I was spoken to with regard to giving evidence.</p>

               <p>on Saturday the <hi rend="italic">Scipio</hi> left—the <hi rend="italic">Macgarel</hi> left on Friday—I don't remember going with Gleeson to the barber's shop and having a shave—I told the Magistrate we did not get written orders to pump water into vessels; we get verbal orders from the mate or captain of the ship—I believe the bills were produced in Court to show I was paid for the work—it was 1s. 3d. I paid Gleeson, I am positive—I did not go to the Police court when Gleeson was arrested, to prove that I employed him on 18th July, because I knew nothing about it; I was not called on—Sergeant Smith, I think, was the first one who came to me about this case—I cannot say if he told me where he came from.</p>

Phillips—I remained there about an hour after—I then went to the coffee-house called Paddy's Goose, with Timothy Crawley—after a short time there I left in company with Crawley, intending to go to Tilbury to get some work—we tried to go aboard a ship as stowaways to get a job, and if we could not go away by ship, to try pea-picking—we walked—we intended to make the whole journey on foot—we went by rail to Shad-well</p>

               <p>pushed me out of the room—Whaley slept there on the 18th, but did not pay for his bed, he had no money—I went my round at two a.m., and saw him in bed—he went to bed before eleven—I saw him in bed asleep next morning, between 9.30 and 9. 45, and he left the house about five or three minutes before ten; it was after 9.30—to the best of my belief that was the first time he left the house; had he left before, the watchman would have told me—next morning Gleeson and Whaley were taken out of my house, charged with robbery; I heard it one night in the next week; I was in bed—I did not go to the Police-court the first day they were locked up, but I did on the Friday—they were remanded to Friday—I got into the passage of the Court, and saw Sergeant Adams and the prisoner, and said, "Mr. Adams, you have two innocent men there, they know nothing about it"—at that time I had not only heard of the robbery, but I knew the date—I said to the prisoner, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "There are two innocent men there; they know nothing about it, and you know that"; and I said, "Sergeant Adams, they are innocent; they know no more about it than I do—I went into Court, but the policeman at the door told me to wait outside—Sergeant Adams was at the door, and prevented my going in—I remained in the street till the case was remanded—I was told by the policeman at the door to remain, and if I was wanted I should be called in, but I was not called in—I went again on the next Friday—they knew I was there, but they would not allow me in Court—Adams saw me and the prisoner—I was not in Court, and was not allowed in the passage—I was standing in the street—there was another remand till the 9th, when I went again, but was not called in—I did not go to the Sessions—I did not think I was required there, as I was not required at the Police-court—a man named O'Neall lodged with me on the night of the 18th, who is known by the nickname of <hi rend="italic">Ribs</hi>—he slept in bed No. 15, next to Whaley—the three beds were: Whaley 14, O'Neall 15, and Gleeson 60—15 is on the first floor, a bed behind the door.</p>

Bride's Wharf that week, but I could not say which day it was—I am quite sure this morning was the morning after I heard Gleeson's name and the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> mentioned—on Monday night, 22nd July, I was sleeping in the lodging house, in the same bed, and next to where Whaley was sleeping—I awoke about one o'clock, and saw Sergeant Adams there, and the prisoner and Gregory—What said to me, "Look here, Tom, they want to take me for stealing £4 10s. from the Duke of Kent, in Dean Street; you know I am innocent, don't you?"—I said, "Yes"—I had not heard this robbery spoken about before that—Whaley was in the act of dressing himself when he said this; he was putting his trousers on—shortly afterwards he was taken away by the Sergeant—I got up, and went down into the kitchen—while there the prisoner came back with Adams—they went upstairs, and came down with Gleeson—I went with them to the Police-station—I stood there among some others for the purpose of identification—both Gleeson and Whaley were in the group—Mrs. Higgins and Miss Stone were brought there to see if they could pick anybody out—they looked at us all, and they failed to identify any body—I afterwards heard that Gleeson and Whaley had been sent for trial—I went to the Sessions House at Clerkenwell Green, and gave evidence there about the Thursday night and Friday morning—Whaley was not represented there by Counsel; there was no one to examine me—I have never been in trouble—I have never been before a magistrate.</p>

I am barman at the Duke of Kent public-house—just before nine o'clock on 19th July I was there, and I heard Miss Stone call out to me—I ran into the bar at once, and in consequence of what she said I ran into Dean Street—when I got into Martha Street I saw two men running, and some people after them—I followed them; they went through Martha Street, Sutton Street, Cornwall Street, Dean Street, Cable Street, and Albert Street, where they went into the second house on the left—I did not follow them into the house; a constable was sent for—I did not see the faces of either of the men who were running; one man was taller than the other; the shorter one had no hat on—I afterwards identified the house in Albert Street—I was taken on the Saturday afterwards, I think, to the Police-station, where I saw about a dozen men, but I could not pick out any of them as being the men I had seen running—Gleeson and Whaley were not amour those men—Brooks and Brady were picked out by somebody else—after that I saw Gleeson and Whaley in the dock at the Thames Police-court—I could not recognise them at all—I am quite certain of the direction the men ran in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Higgins, greengrocer, at 33, Martha Street; our shop faces the Duke of Kent public-house—I remember the robbery taking place there; I cannot remember the date—before the robbery took place I noticed a man walk up and down several times, from half-past eight to nine in the morning; he had rather carroty hair, which came out in little curls on each side—he was rather pitted with small-pox—my attention was attracted to him—he looked into the bar; after that he walked up and down several times, and walked on his toes into the private part several times, and then went into the private side and shut the door; almost immediately afterwards I heard a scream and saw the man run out of the private-door—he had a white bag in his hand, putting it into his pocket—he ran down Martha Street—I went down Martha Street and into Sutton Street, and then I came back—I met the head barman, Mr. Moore, who was coming back, and I told him he had gone through Sutton Street into Cornwall Street—I was out of breath—about one or two a.m. on 23rd July Sergeant Adams took me to King David Lane Police-station to see some men—I did not recognise anyone—the man I had seen was not there—I went a second time and saw other men, but the man I had seen was not among them—I don't recollect speaking to Adams as to what I had seen on the day of the robbery—the man I saw go in the public-house had a round hat on when he went in, he had no hat when he came out—I was not asked to give evidence at the Police court, nor at the Sessons—I told Adams the men I saw at the station were not the men—I don't remember seeing Adams before—I don't know how he saw me.</p>

On 3rd August I took Brooks and Brady into custody, on a charge, with others, of stealing, on 19th July, £4 10s. from the Duke of Kent public-house—on 19th July I had received a hat from Miss Stone, which was left at the station—on 3rd August I fitted it on Brady; it did not fit him—on 5th August I tried it on Brooks; it did not fit him—it was left in the custody of the police until I handed it over.</p>

I have made inquiries as to trains from Tilbury—the first train from Tilbury in the morning to Shadwell is 7. 38, the next 8.23, and the next 8. 53—the 7. 38 would arrive at Shadwell at 8.40, the 8.23 at 9. 23, and the 8. 53 does not stop at Shadwell—the trains from Barking are at 5 a.m. reaching Shadwell 5. 31, 6.10 reaching there 6. 46, the 6. 53 reaching there at 7.20, the 7. 11 reaching there at 7. 46; then comes the 8. 8, which is the first train from Tilbury, and reaching Shadwell at 8.40—the third-class fare from Tilbury to Shadwell is 1s. single, from Tilbury to Purfleet it is 3d., from Purfleet to Shadwell 11d., from Purfleet to Barking 4 1/2 d., and from Barking to Shadwell 7d.—I find it is from 24 1/2 to 25 miles from Shadwell to Tilbury Docks by</p>

               <p>road; from Tilbury to Purfleet is about 6 1/4 miles; from Purfleet to Shadwell 18 1/4 miles—Barking lies half-way between Purfleet and Shadwell; it is 9 miles, leaving 16 miles between Barking and Shadwell—from the Duke of Kent to the West Garden Dock Gate by way of the High Street is about 425 yards, and by way of Martha Street, Sutton Street, Cornwall Street, Dean Street, Cable Street, and Albert Street to New Gravel Street it is about 700 yards—from the lodging-house in King David Lane to the West Garden Gate is about 280 yards—Paddy's Goose is about 80 yards off, just across the road—on 28th December I was at the Thames Police-court, when the prisoner was under remand, and evidence was being given against him on this charge; he asked that Constable either 472 or 372 might be called to give evidence as to his making a statement to him on the night of the robbery—he was found, and brought to Shadwell Station—I have a note somewhere of what the number was; I have not my note here; I think it was 372—I and Bremner found the constable together, and had him at the Court to give evidence—he turned out to be Constable Papworth; he was called by the prosecution; he gave evidence on the prisoner's behalf at the next remand.</p>

In July last year, one night, or early in the morning, I patrolled Cable Street, Albert Street, and King David Lane—later on that night I was taken to a lodging-house in King David Lane—the same night the prisoner came and spoke to me about a few minutes to twelve midnight—he said, "I know who the two men are who are concerned in the robbery at the Duke of Kent; I was standing against the West Garden Gate of the London Docks waiting for employment when two men ran past; I followed them through West Garden into St. George's Street (called the Highway by some people); I followed them along St. George's Street, into a coffee-shop; they gave me my breakfast, and paid for it, and half-a-crown; on my way when I caught them up I asked them what was up, and they said, 'We have done a job at the Duke of Kent'"—after giving him half-a-crown he said they said, "If you go down Twine Court, and over the palings by the buildings, you will find a sovereign there which we threw over"—he left me then—I asked him the men's names—he said they were Gleeson and Whaley—I asked him where they lived—he said in King David Lane Chambers—I put the names and addresses on a piece of paper, which I kept till the case was over at Middlesex Sessions, and then I tore it up, or destroyed, or lost it—the prisoner left me then—about twenty minutes afterwards I came across Sergeant Adams in plain clothes—I knew he was on duty for the purpose, and I told him what the prisoner had told me, and we went with him down High Street, Shadwell, within a few yards of Dello Street—I there saw the prisoner at the corner of the street, by a public-house—he was a few</p>

               <p>he was present when the conversation took place, and could hear what was said, I should think—he was at the side of the bed and I at the foot—if he had been listening he must have heard—I did not notice anyone in the next bed to Whaley at the time; he was sleeping next the wall—the prisoner called him Haley first, and corrected himself almost directly, and then Whaley, waking up, said, "My name is Whaley; "I am not very sure on that point, and I think the prisoner corrected himself almost directly—I think Whaley said, "My name is Whaley, "but I won't say positively he did—I am quite sure when the prisoner spoke to me out of doors before we got to the lodging-house he gave the name of Whaley—we left Whaley at the Police-station and returned to the lodging-house—we went into the room underneath that from which I took Whaley, and the prisoner went up to Hyde or Gleeson, and I told him the charge—he said nothing at all in reply—I brought him downstairs, and handed him over to Papworth—I am quite clear this was the morning of the 23rd—Papworth took him to the station, I and the prisoner following—I sent for Phœbe Stone and Mrs. Higgins and Mrs. Rolls; Gleeson and Whaley were placed with eight or nine others, but the three women could not identify them—Phœbe Stone said that neither of these men, to the best of her belief, was the man who assaulted her and took the money; I believe those were her words; that was not the morning she went to identify them, but some time afterwards—Mrs. Higgins did not, to the best of my belief, tell me they were not the men; I won't swear she did not; I don't remember it; she did not identify them, nor did Mrs. Rolls—I do not remember the two men being left among the others for the prisoner to go and see a second time—the two men were detained on the prisoner's statement, and on the 23rd were brought before the Magistrate; the prisoner's and other evidence was taken—they were remanded until the 26th; no evidence was taken then—they were remanded till the 2nd August, and then till the 9th—the prisoner did not appear on the 26th; on the 2nd he was present—he told the Magistrate he had been threatened, and that he was afraid to come up to give evidence against the two men; I think he said he had been assaulted by the two Taylors, and that was the reason he had not come on the 26th, but that he had come in consequence of a warrant on the 2nd—I apprehended him, and he was locked up for the night—his previous evidence was read, and he gave evidence on the 2nd—the two men were remanded till the 9th—on the 3rd Brooks and Brady were re-arrested, brought before the Magistrate on Monday, 5th, and remanded till 9th, so that all four might be brought up together—Mr. Lushington was the Magistrate on 2nd, 5th, and 9th—I had previously apprehended Brooks and Brady on the 23rd—people were brought, but could not identify them, and they were liberated—owing to further information they were apprehended again on 3rd August—I remember finding a letter on the mantelpiece in the charge-room on 9th August; I believe it was written by the convict Brady to me; my address was on the envelope; I don't know how it came in the charge-room—I glanced over the letter, and, seeing it came from Brady, and as the remand was coming on at eleven that day, and it was then quarter-past ten, I went to the inspector and asked him what I should do with the letter—he said, "You had better see the superintendent"—I took the train and went to Leman Street,</p>

What do you want me to say, Sergeant?"—I said, "Simply to speak the truth, that is all"—he might have said, "What <hi rend="italic">else</hi> do you want me to say?"—I swear he said, "What do you want me to say?" whether he added the word <hi rend="italic">else</hi> I don't know—I am quite certain I replied, "Speak the truth"—when he spoke about the 2s. and the breakfast, Moore replied, "I should think so"—Moore was listening to the conversation—I gave a statement to Inspector Roots on 18th October, in which I mentioned this conversation—I know I said to the prisoner, "Speak the truth"—whether I followed with the words, "Very well, Feeley; if you are satisfied that is all right, "I am not sure; I might have added it—this is my signature to the statement—my answer may-have been to him, "Very well, Feeley; if you are satisfied that is all right"—I don't remember those were the words I said to Roots—I might have said to the prisoner, "Speak the truth"—I would not swear it—the prisoners were committed for trial on the 9th—I saw Mrs. Gregory frequently while the prisoners were under remand—I saw Mr. Gregory and Papworth and Mrs. Higgins in the course of the case—I don't remember speaking to Mrs. Higgins; I may have seen her—Mrs. Higgins and Papworth were not called as witnesses; Papworth was there—the men were tried on 14th August at Clerkenwell Sessions, and convicted—7at the trial Papworth and Mrs. Higgins were not called—Phœbe Stone and Moore were called—I don't swear Mrs. Higgins was not called; I think I have no doubt about it; she might have been requested by the other Sergeant to be there—I don't remember that she was called—Gleeson called as witnesses Mrs. Coffey, Haley, and Jennings—with the exception of Brady, who was represented by Mr. Purcell, they were not represented at Sessions—O'Neill was called by Whaley; he was the only witness asked for—neither Mr. nor Mrs. Gregory were called—to the best of my belief Mrs. Gregory did not tell me during the remands at the Police-court that Hyde and Whaley were innocent; I don't remember her speaking to me in the passage of the</p>

               <p>the offices of which are at 118, Southwark Street—I have for many years carried on the business as manufacturers of asbestos in conjunction with my son—during all that time the defendant Davis was in our employment—he entered our employment in 1875; he was our works manager—it continued as a private concern till 1888, when it was turned into a company—during all the time ho was in our employment we had very great confidence in him; he was a thoroughly practical man, who was of great assistance to us in the business—boiler-covering is a large part of our business—it is a branch that has increased considerably of late years; it is covering boilers with asbestos—extra labour was occasionally employed by Davis—the boiler covering was entirely under Davis's control—there was a regular staff under him for carrying on the work, and who were paid weekly wages—I have from time to time seen vouchers for extra work signed by Davis—these vouchers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in Davis's handwriting—they are for different sums of money extending from January to June, 1889—in every instance they are drawn, "Pay Coleman for wages to this date"—I did not know Coleman as an individual—Davis never spoke to me with regard to these payments, or with reference to Coleman—previous to that Davis gave mo vouchers for payments—Davis had no right to pay any money except for wages—all these vouchers represent money as paid to Coleman for wages—the nature of the employment was boiler-covering, and is in every instance specified on the vouchers—on production of a voucher of this kind Davis would be entitled to receive the money from the cashier—a wages-book was commenced in July, 1888, after the incorporation of the company (<hi rend="italic">book produced</hi>)—on the date of 7th July I find an entry in Davis's handwriting of £15 charged to Coleman for "boiler composition under an agreement for work in hand"—on 14th July is a similar entry—week by week, from 7th July, 1888, to 19th January, 1889, there are items of a similar kind charged in the same way, sometimes £15, sometimes £20, and sometimes £10—from January, 1888, to January, 1889, Davis had no right to expend any money except for wages—he never represented to me during that period that he was spending money for any other purpose—he remained in my employment till February, 1889—when I discharged him I wrote him these two letters, one in my official capacity as chairman, and the other in my private capacity. (<hi rend="italic">Letters read:</hi> "Dover, 10th February, 1889.—Mr. Davis,—Having carefully considered all that I have ascertained in regard to you and what you have advanced on your own behalf, I have very reluctantly come to the conclusion that you can no longer remain in the service of the company. If I retain you it can only be in your present position, and your misconduct has made that impossible, as your remaining in the confidential post of authority you have held would be destructive of the discipline of the establishment. You must therefore understand that you are no longer in the service of Bell's Asbestos Company, Limited. The solicitors of the company will ascertain what is due to you, and that will be paid to you forthwith.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BELL</hi>, Chairman of Bell's Asbestos Company. ""8th March, 1889.—G. J. Davis, Esq.—Dear Sir,—In reply to your letter of 8th March, I have to say that for a considerable time it had been suggested that you were not loyally serving this company, but that much of your time, when out of doors, was otherwise occupied than in looking after boiler-covering jobs. Means were taken to ascertain what you were doing when you were off</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189002030091"/>
               <p>the company's premises, and it was found that a greater portion of the time for which the company paid you was passed by you in public-houses. For this reason you were discharged from the company's service.—Tours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C. BELL</hi>, Managing Director Bell's Asbestos Company, Limited. With regard to your account and the alleged omissions, will you please point out the omissions, etc.?")—about 5th or 6th February I asked him how it was those amounts received under these vouchers had not been properly accounted for and the accounts closed in the books—I called his attention to the absence of the voucher from a person who was stated to have received the money, and demanded an explanation—he admitted he had failed to obtain it, but said he would do so at once—at that time I had no personal knowledge of Coleman—a day or two afterwards Davis brought me this document, and said, "I have brought you Mr. Coleman's receipt; "Bead, "7th February, received of Bell's Asbestos Company, Limited, £620, at various dates from January, 1888, to date, on account of boiler covering, etc.; this includes previous receipts from November. Signed, Coleman"—it bears a receipt stamp—when he brought this receipt I asked what he meant by producing so un business-like a document, as I must have one setting forth in detail the names and addresses of the persons for whom the work had been done, the number of feet on boilers and steam pipes covered, and the several dates on which the jobs had been carried out—he promised to obtain that document; he made no suggestion that the wire had been used for any purpose except boiler-covering—n few days afterwards he brought this account in his handwriting—he laid it on my desk when I was not in—I found it in my office—it shows the amount paid to Coleman, £620, from January, 1888, to date; showing the amount of boiler-covering done, and the price at which it was done—it gives exhaustively details of how the number of feet was made up, the names of people for whom work was done, showing their addresses, the feet covered, and price charged by Coleman for doing the work—it shows a total of 48,167 feet at 3Jd. a foot—I am able to trace all those names in my books—after Davis was dismissed that account was handed to accountants for examination—I first had information that something was wrong with the account, in May—I then went to Messrs. Wontner—I was in bad health at the time, and went to the South of France from February to April; later in the year I went to America—on October 22nd, at a board meeting, there was a resolution to prosecute the two defendants—we had paid gratuities to persons where this work had been done—the work is work of rather a delicate character, and requires looking after—we have paid gratuities to secure special services of the men, that the materials might have fair play—Davis had nothing to do with that money—he never suggested that any of this money had gone in gratuities or commissions, until this matter was at the Police-court.</p>

I first became acquainted with Mr. Davis in 1875—he remained with me until February, 1889, nearly fifteen years—I had every confidence in him—I never charged him with taking a shilling of my money—the asbestos business increased very rapidly—we started the business of Bell and Sons in 1879—for the first year or so it was confined to about £2,000—I don't recollect whether in 1884 or 1885 it got to something like £30,000 returns, but it is very likely—if you say it increased to about £84,000 it is very likely, but I really cannot recollect the figures—the boiler-covering business becam</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189002030092"/>
               <p>very important part of our business—about one-tenth of our returns was in respect of the boiler-covering—supposing the returns were £70,000 or £80,000, the one-tenth would be about £7,000—the wages on that £7,000 would be about £900; no, I am wrong; I have no means of ascertaining the figures here—the £650 would be given to Davis to hand over to Coleman—my son Frank is managing director; he is here—my son looked after the payments and general outgoings—he would see these large payments made for boiler-covering, in addition to the actual persons in our employ—we had a number of men in our employ doing work for us—we had seven or eight men in the boiler covering regularly paid every week—Davis occasionally got orders for us; very occasionally; not frequently—I said at the Police-court, "He was works manager, he was allowed to travel about for the benefit of the company, getting orders for the company;" that was his position—the wages of a boiler-covering man would be about 33s. 6d., and the juniors £1—I did not see these vouchers of Coleman's during 1888; it was not my business to examine these vouchers—the accountants would examine them—I never saw a man named Coleman about the premises—there would be a cheque drawn weekly for wages; the bookkeeper would write out the cheque, and it would be signed by two directors and the secretary; the directors would most commonly be my son Frank and any other director that could be got—he would have a list put before him of what was wanted for wages for asbestos—my son would know what would be paid per week for wages Mr. Giles, the cashier, would get the money for distribution—each man would produce his voucher, showing what wages were required, and Giles would pay on that voucher—Davis would make out the vouchers for the wages for the other departments—that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Davis's handwriting—as a rule the wages would be paid to the men who present the vouchers; I did not know the amount paid by Giles to Davis for wages from March 1888, to January, 1889—Giles has not told me, nor has my son—Davis was discharged in February, 1889—my son Frank was then already in the company; Herbert came in later; he did not come in at the time Davis was dismissed, not till June or July, 1889—I got this document in February—I consulted Mr. Wontner in May; I did not prosecute until 22nd October—the names on this blue paper are all real customers; the quantity of work in it is quite correct; I know that Davis joined a rival company; I cannot say at what date; I did not know of it till July; I did not know it in May; I swear that—I knew he was trying to form a company; I knew he was trying to do business with people to whom I had been in the habit of selling—he brought an action against us on 17th May, 1889, for wrongful dismissal—I did not know it till the 25th—I received a note from my solicitor on the 25th, saying that an action had been commenced for wrongful dismissal—a defence to that action was put in by my solicitor—I did not delay putting in a defence to the action until I knew Davis was charged with fraud—I do not know that the defence was not put in till the 18th November; I can't say anything about the date— Messrs. Stibbard, Gibson, and Co. were the solicitors in the civil action—I do not know that there was a counter-claim against Davis for sums I had entrusted to him to lay out for us; I know nothing about it—I don't know what the solicitors have done in the action at all—I do not know that the whole of the sums in</p>

               <p>this indictment have been put in the counter-claim—I know nothing at all of what is going on in the civil action—I entrusted no money to him; he got the money by fraud—I have ceased to have much personal supervision of this business for the last year—I had given personal supervision during the year 1888—I had been in close intimacy with my son Frank in that year and in the previous years—I knew that money was being given for the purpose I have already stated—I never knew that money was given to persons to get orders; nothing of the kind—I had a traveller named Perry in my employment—my son never told me he was directing the travellers to promise 10 per cent, commission on all orders received—I knew letters like, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were leaving my place of business in 1885—this letter was written by my son in 1885—I believe it means Mr. Abury was to be told that he would get 10 per cent, on all orders he gave—"collaring engineers" is giving tips to engineers in the employ of persons on whose behalf they are to give orders—if you don't tip these men, our goods don't get fair play—our travellers did not tell me the men were afraid of taking money lest their names should appear on the business being turned into a limited company—I was there in 1888—I never heard from my son of that letter from Archer; I was very likely in America when it came—I go every year—my son kept me posted up in important matters arising in the business—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read the letter from Archer</hi>)—I don't know who the R. M. Company are—a traveller in our employment named Elmslie had an account at the Birkbeck Bank into which he paid a cheque which we paid him for commissions; he then drew his own cheques on that bank to the persons who received the commissions—I have heard that—I cannot say when I discovered that; it did not strike me as strange—there was nothing at all in it—there would be no difficulty in tracing the money in his hand from the company's account—our company was formed in May, 1888—it is quite likely that I gave Mr. Elmslie £20 about 28th September, 1888, to be distributed among the <hi rend="italic">employés</hi> of the London and South-Western Railway—Mr. Higgs, manager of the machinery department there, may have had £15 for commission'; I have no doubt about it—he looked after the working of engines—he does no labour with his own hands—the commission books were removed from 18, Southwark Street to the Hop Exchange, where we took another office—we did not put our name up till we were summoned—we only took those books there first of all—on the day we did that all the clerks concerned in keeping the books received notice that they need not attend during the day—I know nothing about it—the clerks kept a careful record of all we paid—I never paid much attention to that department—it is highly probable we gave Elmslie as much as £125 to pay away in commission—very likely it would be difficult to see an account of ours wherein we had not given commission—I deny it was for obtaining orders—this "Gas Light and Coke Company, Beckton.

               <p>"W. Clark, £5"—I don't know anything about it—I don't know that Elmslie has paid £125 to one man—we gave him £125 to distribute—travellers had not discretion as to what they should give to the persons with whom they were dealing—they would submit an estimate for what they require for this purpose, and if that is approved, the money is given—the estimate is not brought to me; to my son Frank—in the case of Elmslie, we gave him the money to pay—I believe Perry had money occasionally to convey—you will have to get from my son the names of travellers who have had money to pay for commissions—Mr. Wayland has got orders for us—my son Frank is married to Mr. Wayland's sister—I have not given money to Wayland to pay to men who were to receive it—I do not know that it was done; I know nothing about the details—I do not know of money being sent to Smart for distribution—all this information you can get from my son—among the travellers there was no one who had discretion to promise money to persons who gave orders—Davis had not authority to promise money to persons from whom he got orders—he was not a traveller; he obtained orders for us—he would come and make a proposal—I believe we have a book called the warehouse order-book—I don't think Davis would enter much in that book—I don't think that orders would be entered in that book; Davis would ask as to what he should give; I don't know whether what he gave would be entered in that book; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order-book—I do not know of such a book as the warehouse order-book—if I have given Davis a single shilling, it would be entered in this book—if there is no entry, we could not have paid him the money—it is untrue that he had orders under the name of Coleman—a man named Stuchelschied was in my employ; I believe he took away copies of some of my books and papers; he stole them—I did not suppose that he had got the warehouse order books; I never heard of warehouse order-books—(<hi rend="italic">letter produced</hi>)—this is a letter to Stuchelschied from my solicitor, stating that the managing director has instructed them to make application for two warehouse order books; I am not the managing director; this is dated June, 1889—solicitors may make mistakes as to the name of books, as you have done—I don't know who has got them; I knew nothing about it—I don't know what they contain—my son did not employ Davis to try and get the books from Stuchelschied, and to pay him £10 for it; it is absolutely untrue—I gave a declaration of fifty shares in favour of Davis in payment of old service, provided he was with the company five years—that was given in August, 1888, and I dismissed him in February, 1889.</p>

               <p>Mr. Willis as to getting hold of this or that man—this commission-book was regularly kept, and the sums paid entered, even down to a penny—it contains a list of the customers in the first column, then the invoices, and then a statement of the commission, so much per cent., carried out—that book and every book was regularly submitted to the accountants for audit.</p>

In some cases our travellers were paid by salary, but generally by commission—the larger the order they got the greater their remuneration; that gave them facility in the way of gratuities to obtain orders, and so increase their emolument—Davis was not in the capacity of a traveller; he had permission to get orders if he could—he had a fixed salary of £300 a year, and a commission of 2 1/2 percent, on the profits of his department—his income would not depend on the orders he got; that was a kind of addition to the income he received.</p>

                  </hi>. I was engaged with my father in this business for about seven years, and then with the company for eighteen months—this matter of commissions was entirely under my charge—commissions were given as a rule on all orders obtained; there was no difficulty in obtaining the first order, but to retain the account commissions were given, as is the custom in this trade, to the engineer or whoever controls the ordering department; if commission was not given, the goods never went right; if it was given they went right—in that way orders were influenced by the commission given—every invoice was entered in the commission-book, and then the engineer's name was placed against the invoice account and whatever he was to receive; and against the traveller's name was put 5 or 2 1/2 per cent., or whatever it was, to help me to understand the position and amount of importance of the men, and then I filled in what they were to obtain and sent them what I chose—about 4 per cent, a year on the turn-over was paid in that way in commissions—it came to about £4,000—that covered all the business—the proportion for boiler-covering was considerably less than on other portions of the business, because boiler-covering composition is mainly made up in labour—there are wages for putting it on, and I should not pay commission on labour, which is included in the price we do it at; and therefore we only pay commission on the amount of stuff used—if £7,000 was the entire turn-over in the boiler-covering department for a year, probably £300 would be paid in commission all over the jobs—Davis occasionally came to me to recommend persons who ought to have commission—I cannot recollect any specific instances where I let him have the money to do it, but I have no doubt he came to me occasionally, and I certainly carried out what he proposed or recommended, because he had better knowledge about the job than I had—Davis certainly had not authority to give commissions without an order from me—I don't know that I should have objected if he paid a small amount like half-a-crown or 5s, or even a sovereign, if he gave a proper reason; but he never had authority to do it—there is absolutely no truth in the statement that he had authority to pay £620 in one year by £20 or £15 at a time—I did not know he was doing it, or purporting to do it—he produced vouchers to the cashier, and I never saw them—I have only vouchers for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189002030096"/>
               <p>a portion of the money, because it was inserted in the wages-book by himself, and then he would not require a voucher—that was after the system was changed, and instead of vouchers entries were made in the wages-book—I have no doubt that after 2nd June, 1888, the entries appear in the wages-book—the two systems did not overlap—I did not see the vouchers—we trusted Davis, and believed he was correct—we should have trusted him in every respect for any amount; we are sorry now for our confidence—we left it to Giles, who honoured the vouchers presented by Davis, and gave him the money—I demanded no explanation from Davis of what he had done with the money—I never looked into it—I found it out when the accountant asked me what these vouchers were for—sums appearing in the wages-book would be for wages—up to the time I was before the Magistrate I never heard it alleged it was for commission—I never gave him authority to deal with the matter pretending it was wages, it being commission—there was no necessity to do so—we did not, in order to blind the shareholders, let it go under the head of wages instead of letting it go under commission; otherwise, why not have done away with the commission-books?—these books have been open to the shareholders—we are not afraid of anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. I have heard it suggested in my father's cross-examination that moneys received under the name of Coleman had been used for the purpose of making presents and paying commissions—I was turned out of the Police court when my father was giving evidence—I don't think I heard it there—I never heard one word of my father's evidence then—I was there on every day this inquiry was held—I heard that the idea of the defence was that this money taken in the name of Coleman was used for commissions, and that my father kept saying he did not know, but his son would know—I don't know that Mr. Grain, who appeared for the prisoner, kept asking that I should be called—after my father's evidence I believe I was told he did—I was not called—I have known Davis a very long time—I gave Davis £10 to give to Stuchelschied to hold his mouth, because Stuchelschied had been in the commission department, and knew so much that he could do us serious injury by publishing the details of the business in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—Davis represented he had so much power over Stuchelschied (which he has proved since he has) that he would stop his mouth to prevent him doing damage to us, and we gave Davis £10 to procure papers from Stuchelschied—we never sent for Davis that I know of—I sent that telegram to Davis on 20th February, asking him to come at once to see me—I knew he was aware of the way in which the business was conducted; he had the papers already—when I first had an interview with him I knew the papers were in his possession, and I knew I had written very imprudent things which I did not wish to be published, and so I gave Davis £10—I have nothing to do with the defence to the action—there was a warehouse order-book in our business; we have produced everything that can be produced—that book would show any orders which Davis got—I cannot be absolutely certain that every order would be inserted—there were so very few orders that he obtained—I did not write in the order-book the money that was to be paid by him—he may have made notes in that order-book of moneys he had paid away; I cannot say—he did not get an order for us at Whiteley's—we paid money there; I don't know how much; the books will show—I don't think Davis paid</p>

               <p>that; I don't swear he did not—I have a slight recollection he came to me about the Whiteley affair, and asked for £5 to pay to the men—if he did the vouchers will show it; the entry would be there, or he would not have obtained the money—I did not enter very fully into a system of bribery—I <hi rend="italic">palmed</hi> people right and left in order to retain orders, not to get them—I may have <hi rend="italic">palmed</hi> to get orders—I promised if orders were given they should get a commission—I wrote this letter, "North London Railway.—Go and see Weal…. You must see Brigan, assistant to Mr. Parke; he is <hi rend="italic">palmed</hi> by me. Don't mention Parke, but <hi rend="italic">work</hi> him well for packing, jointing, etc."—we had had loads of orders from the North London Railway then—I have no doubt they came from Mr. Parke, the locomotive superintendent—Mr. Brigan, his assistant, had no interest in the thing; he could not influence an order—I did not <hi rend="italic">palm</hi> him to get an order; he has no power to give one, nor to get an order from Parke—"Work him well for packing and jointing" was so that the material might be worked well—I certainly wanted the orders; I wanted nothing else—I wrote, "Gas Light and Coke Company, Beckton; Mr. Oilman, storekeeper. You must get this man's orders, and <hi rend="italic">palm</hi> him well, Get him to send an order for packing and oil"—that was to tell him if he sent us orders he would be recognised in the ordinary course of business—I thought of distributing one thousand brace of grouse; I have done it several times—I don't know that Davis has paid for birds that have been distributed among our customers—he did not, I won't swear it; if he did, the firm paid him—my father does not know the internal working of the business—I wrote this letter or gave instructions for it with a list of recipients for grouse, to be sent at the latter end of August to managers of sewage, gas, and water works, and such concerns, and surveyors of local boards—I did not go abroad when the Act of Parliament came in which rendered it a criminal affair to give anything to anybody in the employment of a public body to induce them to give orders—Mr. Goodyear did not complain of having the cigars—I do not know he complained of others having them; I don't know that we altered our method in November, 1889, after the Act came into operation—Mr. Perry used to be our traveller; this is my letter to him. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a copy of the abstract of the New Corrupt Practices Act for him to peruse carefully', and said that in future no commission must be paid or any presents made either at Christmas or any other time to anyone coming under the terms of the Act, and that if any commission had been paid or present made to any person coming under the terms of the Act, steps must be taken to get such moneys refunded, and a receipt obtained; and that no deviation could be made from these instructions</hi>)—I have the warehouse order-book now—there are the names of the Gas Light and Coke Company, London and South-Western Railway, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company; large sums—large sums have been paid by us in former years; they are all in the books; very probably the steward of Lord Salisbury has received something—the Great Eastern Railway engineer did not—the Lambeth and Kent Waterworks are there—I wrote, "The storekeeper is right"—the storekeeper is the man we keep right very likely—I <hi rend="italic">palmed</hi> Mr. Cleverly—then there are the General Steam Company at Deptford, Taylor Bros and Company's works—J.

               <p>refinery—I cannot say what the total amount is, because Mr. Dakin has gone up a tree; you can refer to the books—my father knows nothing about Woolwich Arsenal; I do—my father's way of putting it was that nothing was given to anybody except he was going to look alter materials, and so on—it is not mine perhaps, and never has been—I don't know if Major Clark had £5—Elmslie evidently had instructions from me to pay Mr. Clark £5—I don't know if that is Major Clark—I should say certainly it was not—he is one of the engineers at the Arsenal, I should say—I believe it was paid to a common man—I wrote, "Gas Light and Coke Company, Pimlico. Square this place thoroughly up"—I know nothing of "Gas Company, Horseferry Road, J. H. Peterson, storekeeper, big thief; get his address; had cigars at Christmas"—"South Metropolitan Gas Company; "Frank Livesey is the chief engineer, and Tanner used to be foreman—I paid large sums of money to the Union Steamship Company on the representation of Elmslie, and I have good reasons to believe he never paid a farthing of it away—I believe Mr. Dusetoy has had nothing—trusting to Elmslie, our traveller, who made representations to me, we paid large sums away—Mr. Dusetoy did not tell me he had received money—he received some for a testimonial he wrote years ago—I cannot say I know of no moneys paid by Davis, but probably I could give information respecting them—I do not recollect his giving anything at Brandon Brothers, Rotherhithe, or at Maudesley, Son, and Field's, or at Harrisons, Barber, and Co., Wandsworth; he never gave anything there I am certain—he never paid anything to my knowledge at Gray, Dawes, and Sons, Austin Friars—he had 2 1/2 per cent, commission on the entire turnover, and on boiler-covering composition; all jobs taken at 18d. a foot—I affixed my signature to the cheques for weekly wages in conjunction with another director—I did not see what was requisite before I drew them—I did not have placed before me the sums of money for which every sum. was required; no statement was laid before me—the cheques were written out by the head bookkeeper, who received instructions from Mr. Giles—I only looked approximately to see what sums I was drawing—I have not the slightest idea what the" wages were in 1888 or 1889 for boiler-covering; and my father knows nothing whatever about it—I don't know if I should have been surprised and looked at it if I saw £20 for wages—I think we had about twenty men to pay every week; my father knows nothing about it—he stated what the books stated—as far as I recollect the wages came to about £80 a week—I don't think my father was correct when he said men worked at boiler-covering at about 33s. a week; various men were employed at different wages, and that department was entirely Mr. Davis's, and I never looked into it, I trusted Mr. Davis implicitly—I don't know how many men there were, there were a great many—Davis might have employed men we knew nothing about; he might have robbed us right and left—I knew we had a great many orders in hand; I did not look to see how many men were required—the warehouse order-book showed what work was in hand, but there were new orders every week—Davis never got more than half a dozen orders—I drew cheques between the third week in June and 7th July, when the wages-book begins, on precisely the same state of circumstances as existed before 7th July—I don't know where the vouchers for that period are.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother—I live in Paradise Street, about ten minutes from the prisoner—I saw the child at its birth—it appeared healthy—it might have been three months old when I saw it again, and seemed as if it would go on all right—I first noticed a change in it when it was about fourteen months old, when it looked poorly—I asked the prisoner if she had taken it to a doctor—she said, "Yes"; and that the doctor said it had consumption of the bowels—that was the spring of 1889—I saw it again about four months before its death, when it appeared to be wasting away—the prisoner fetched me about 6 a.m. the day it died—she said, "Come round, I think baby is dead; I picked it up to give it the breast, and it fell back in my arms"—she was crying—I washed the child and laid it out, and I saw the skin was rubbed off the hips and buttocks—the prisoner said she had given it a rood wash the day before—I only used a soft bit of flannel and soap—at the inquest Dr. Farr asked me, in the prisoner's presence, about the condition of the child's skin—I told him it was so when I washed it—the sores were not bleeding—there were two little narrow strips of skin off the buttocks—the prisoner told me that the child being so delicate, she had kept it to the breast—she was always suckling it when I saw her.</p>

I am one of the visiting surgeons of the Royal South London Dispensary—the first letter the prisoner had was on 18th April—I found the child very anemic, i. e., bloodless, and thin and emaciated, and since I have heard the evidence I have no doubt that I told the mother it was suffering from mesenteric disease, or tuberculosis, and required nourishing diet as much or more than physic—she appeared to be very kind to it—I visited it in June—I saw no improvement—I do not think I should have said there was no hope—all cases of consumption of the bowels are serious—I don't think I continued my visits after 18th May; if I did she got another letter—a letter lasts a month.</p>

I am forty-seven—I was at work at the Gas Works at Vauxhall, and sleeping on the premises up to Saturday, 18th January—on that evening, at 7. 30, I went out, having not long left off work, and being sober—I went towards Kennington Lane, and into one public-house, and had a pint of ale with a friend—about five minutes to ten I went into another public-house, the George and Dragon—I there had a pint by myself—I was sober—I noticed the two prisoners when I came out—I came out with a woman, who walked with me to Spring Gardens Walk, near the Albert Embankment, and by the railway arch there I was knocked down by James with his fist on my temple, I fell on my back—Hawkins gave me a blow on my mouth which made it bleed, as I was lying on my back calling "Police!"—Hawkins took my belt off and James put his hand in my left pocket, and took £1 and half a sovereign, and Hawkins took 1s. 6d. from my other pocket; then they ran away—I got to my feet as soon as I could; I met the police—the woman was gone too—I ran after the prisoners, leaving my belt and hat—the police took me to two public-houses that night—I knew no one in the first—at the second I pointed out James, who was standing up drinking by a tub—I followed the police and James to the station—as we went along somebody went to put something in James's pocket—I did not hear what was said—the officer tried to do something to him—I did not see what was previously going on—on the following Tuesday night I was taken to the station, where I recognised Hawkins among thirteen others—I had previously given a description of him to the police.</p>
