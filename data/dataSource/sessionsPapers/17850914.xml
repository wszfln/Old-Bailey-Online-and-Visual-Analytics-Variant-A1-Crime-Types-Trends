               <p>Did any thing pass between the prisoner and the people that appeared to be in his company? - I cannot take upon me to say, I was rather in liquor at the time.</p>
               <p>As you was in liquor, then can you take upon yourself positively to say, that the prisoner was one of the persons? - He was the person that first struck me, and gave me a shove, then the prisoner asked me if I would fight with him, I said, I would charge an officer with him as soon as I could get one, and several people being round me, I felt one of them pull at my watch, but who it was I cannot say; I was almost knocked down but not quite, I was against the wall, they made two pulls, and I lost my watch, a steel chain, and two silver seals; it was a very small watch, both cases silver, I held the prisoner by the coat while I got assistance, I am not certain whether I lost any money.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner appear to be sober? - I cannot inform you, for I was very much in liquor myself, and I cannot tell in what condition he was, but to me he appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>How many were there that appeared to be in his company as you suppose? - I suppose at least there might be seven or eight, and one of them held me by the hair while another hit me over the face, I look upon it, that it was the prisoner that robbed me, but I cannot be positive.</p>

               <p>I was coming along at the same time, behind the prosecutor, and I saw the prisoner shove the prosecutor against a public house, the corner of White's-yard and afterwards the prisoner asked the prosecutor if he would fight; then he went into the house opposite, and as soon as he came out again, five or six men came out, and the prisoner put his head between the prosecutor's legs, and after sometime he pulled the watch out of the prosecutor's pocket with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I then called out that the gentleman's watch was gone, and then all these men that came after him went and pulled the gentleman about, and said, what watch? and then the prisoner called out let him fight; he then had his head between the prosecutor's legs, then the other pulled the prosecutor by the hair of the head, out into the middle of the road, and the prosecutor held the prisoner by his coat, the prosecutor cried murder! they got him down a gateway, I then went to a butcher's over the way, and asked where the runners were kept, then I sent a boy from the public house for one, and the prisoner and the prosecutor were taken into the public house, the prosecutor still kept hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Were the other men got away? - They might have got away, there was a great croud.</p>

               <p>How far was that from Edmonton church? - A mile, the man presented a pistol to me, and said, Madam, your money or your life, I begged him to take that from me, and I would give him all I had, he told me not to be frightened, I should not be hurt, and I gave him two half crowns, and sixpence, and he left me immediately, I went to Wynchmore-hill, I suppose he went from me, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at him? - Yes, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>How long might he stay with you? - I suppose four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you so long getting out the half crowns? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body go by at the time? - Not anybody, I did not see a creature near me till I was out of the field in the lane.</p>
               <p>Is it a public path? - A public path from the church.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a day labouring working dress.</p>
               <p>What sort of a hat? - A very old shabby hat flapped round his head.</p>
               <p>And had you a fair opportunity of seeing his countenance? - Yes, my Lord, I stood with him some minutes particularly begging he would not hurt me, and pleading to save one half crown.</p>
               <p>You mean to tell the Jury, the prisoner is the man? - I am too sure he is the man, if I had had the least doubt I would not have come into this Court.</p>
               <p>How long after was he taken up? - The 17th of July.</p>
               <p>Court. That was two months after the time, did you recollect him again immediately? - I recollected him the instant I saw him, I mentioned the robbery as soon as it was committed, I was walking with Mr. and Mrs. Dale and Mr. Holmes after tea, and in a lane near Salmon's brook this man met us, and I instantly said that is the man that stopped me on the Whitsunday, the reply was, are you sure of that? and immediately Mr. Dale and Mr. Holmes seized the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that near the place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140005"/> you had been robbed before? - It was some distance, I cannot tell exactly how near.</p>

               <p>Was it loaded at the time? - No, it was not in a condition to fire at anything.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Holmes. Do you recollect whether that was the sort of pistol that was presented to you? - Yes, my Lord, as near as one pistol can be to another, when I came home, I said it was like an old great horse pistol.</p>
               <p>Dale. He said at the time he overtook her, he would not hurt the hair of her head, he is an easy quiet poor creature.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I can say nothing more than to coroborate the evidence Mr. Dale has given, except I asked him how he came by the pistol, he said he did not know he had it, I said that was impossible, then he said he carried it to protect himself, I afterwards remonstrated with him, and he said, being a gardener he carried it to frighten the birds.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know him to carry this pistol about? - I never saw it before then,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140006"/> I asked him the use of it, and he said, he had it to frighten the birds, I asked him which way, he said, he struck it down at them, and by striking it down it frightened the birds off the trees.</p>

               <p>This man has worked in my garden for five years, in the country; I had a very high opinion of him, he behaved extremely well, he went in when he pleased, I had not the least doubt in the world about him, I had no idea of anything of this sort, I never was so astonished in my life; the man was the most regular in his work I ever saw, and he worked there till the evening he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Do you know anything about his carry-a pistol? - I have heard some of my servants say, he had a pistol in the garden, which he told them was to frighten away the sparrows; that is all that I know of it, I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Court to Dale. What was the defect in the pistol, that it could not be fired? - The flints were n ot fixed for firing.</p>

               <p>I came at two o'clock to water the road on the 15th of July, and I saw a drover turning some sheep into Brook-street, and he said what are those people doing there on the leads, and I looked across the way to Staples-inn; and at a side window I saw a couple of men on the leads, I turned towards them, and they jumped off, and two stood below, I kept my sight as well as I could on one of them, that did not run, the other three run.</p>
               <p>Did they jump off into Staples-inn or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140007"/> into Holborn? - Into Holborn, the leads are over some shops, the one that I kept in my eye was the prisoner Munday; Griffiths I believe was the other, but I will not be positive of any other but Munday, as I was flurried; I took Munday in Brook-street, I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Munday. My Lord, I was drinking at the pump when he took me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the windows opposite to those leads when you observed the men, were they open or shut? - The glass of the casement was broke, and the casement was open, I charged them with a constable, and I told the porter that I saw another in the window half in and half out, but I could not tell who it was; Munday was let go out of the watch-house, there being nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles Counsel for the Prisoner Munday. You do not come to water the streets, I suppose, till day-light? - It was not very light.</p>
               <p>You could have seen the face of any of your companions that were passing by that way? - Yes, and it was as much as I could do.</p>
               <p>Where was Munday when you came up to him? - He was stopping at the pump to drink.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say, or do you know that that was the way to his mother's house? - Yes, he said so.</p>

               <p>And you have found it out to be so since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you call to him to stop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He returned to you voluntarily? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came he to be discharged? - The constable asked me if they charged him, and I said no; I only was in the room at the chambers at that time.</p>
               <p>Was not this man examined several times before the justice? - Only once when I was there.</p>

               <p>Do not you know he has been examined twice before you appeared? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the justice you knew he was taken up? - I was told so.</p>
               <p>Then did not you think it your duty to appear when you first heard he was taken up? - I am a stranger to these things, I went when I was asked to come.</p>
               <p>Who asked you to come? - Jackson, the runner.</p>
               <p>Is Jackson here? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Now, I suppose, he did not tell you it would be worth your while to come? - He told me I must come.</p>
               <p>Did not he give you some hint that you might get a little money for coming? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What was to fall to your share? - He never promised me any thing, nor never spoke to me about the money.</p>
               <p>Who was that man that did promise you any part of the reward? - I have had no talk with any of them for the reward.</p>
               <p>You knew though I suppose that you was to have at least a share of forty pounds? - There were some people of my kind that told me here and there, that I should have it.</p>
               <p>Yes, I thought so, now if you could have strained yourself a little further, you would have a share of four times forty pounds? - I would not wish it.</p>
               <p>No, I suppose not! that is well done; your employment is a waterman? - I have done it several seasons.</p>
               <p>How much may you get a-day by it? - Fourteen shillings a-week, sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think you said that Munday was one of the two that jumped off the leads? - Sir, I did say that he was one of them, as I believe.</p>
               <p>Are you satisfied that is the man that you saw jump? - I believe so, Sir, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you keep him in sight from the time he jumped off till he was taken? - I think I did.</p>

               <p>Can you swear to them? - There are other buckles, I suppose, of the same pattern, but I can swear that the buckles I lost were exactly of this pattern and size.</p>
               <p>Court to Duncan. Did these leads communicate with Mr. Rooke's chambers? - Yes, they did, I had no other reason for suspecting my son, but his being out of his lodgings at an improper time of night.</p>
               <p>Jackson. After the buckles were taken out of Duncan's pocket, he was brought to the bar, and Sir Sampson asked him, whether he had any other person that was with him or not.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell any thing that Duncan said that tends to charge any body but himself; was any thing said by him importing a denial of his being concerned, or a confession that he had been concerned? - He owned that he had been concerned with four or five more, and mentioned their names.</p>
               <p>What was he charged with before the Justice? - With breaking and entering Mr. Rooke's chambers, and stealing the property we have here, and he told his father in the Brown-bear, he had hid some property belonging to Mr. Rooke, and I went and found it; I went to No. 11, Mr. Townsend's chambers, and in the cellar I found three silver spoons, a pair of silk stockings, a pair of thread stockings, and a neckcloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These spoons I believe to be mine, they are marked B. R. M. N. the neckcloth is mine, I know it by the mark; the stockings have no mark, but I believe them to be mine, having lost a pair of silk and a pair of thread, and the silk of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. At what examination was it, that this waterman attended? - It was the second examination.</p>

               <p>I live at Shoreham, between Seven Oaks and Dartford, in the county of Kent; I heard from my shepherd on the 1st of September, that I had lost one score of sheep, and on Sunday morning the 4th, between ten and eleven I heard there was a man taken on suspicion of stealing some sheep, which was on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of sheep were they? - There were nine lambs that were shorn, and among the nine one ram lamb was saved intended for a young ram for a breeder; and there were nine wether sheep and two ewe sheep; they were all south downers; the lambs were marked in the neck with oker, and the wether lambs marked separate across the loins with a thin streak of oker to distinguish them from the ewe lambs, the ewe lambs were not marked across the loins, the wether sheep were marked across the shoulders with a narrow stripe of oker at sheering time; as to the two ewes we were not certain whether they were both marked or not, if they were marked they were marked with a streak of oker down the rump; I never saw any of the sheep since, but I have seen the skins, they were laid all tumbled about together, and a many of them were cut and mangled, but amongst them there were several whole skins which were quite perfect, clear to be my mark; the skins began to smell very much, I found them at the public house, the sign of the Bear, just by Sir Sampson's office.</p>
               <p>Court. From the description you have given of the marks that you used, are they such as enable you positively to swear to your own skins: - Yes, they are very clear, and have the oker being marked in three different places, and the different wideness of the oker.</p>
               <p>Court. Do the other farmers in your neighbourhood use the same sort of mark? - Not that I know of, I believe there is no farmer in that neighbourhood that keeps south downers but myself; I am trying to recollect if there is one; no, I do not recollect any; the south downer sheep are short legged, close wool, and black faced, their legs and face are black and smutty, and they are fuller of wool than the other sheep, and the wool is a much finer wool.</p>

Says he, I have got a score, they belong to no butcher; says I, is there any butcher's mark on them, and I looked at them; why says I these things are certainly stolen; says he, I know nothing at all about it; I goes away and went to Bridewell, and made the complaint, and two people were sent down and he was brought up to Bow-street; I counted them, they were all dead; I saw two with the skins on, and the rest of the score dead, and I saw them told over in the shop; I observed the two skins that they were taking off, they had the same mark that the farmer has spoken of.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Nugent. Was not you charged with this watch? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did Walker say at the watch-house that I was not one of the men? - I did not hear him say any such thing.</p>

               <p>The watchmen sprung their rattles, I am watchman, and I came to their assistance, and I saw a parcel of people running, and I ran to the first man that I saw running, which was Mr. Banks, one of the evidences, and I took him, and brought him up to the prosecutor in the street, and asked him if that was one of the men, says I, Sir, you will excuse me, I must detain you, I did, and the prosecutor had a doubt upon him whether he was the man that ran away or not, and he said no, with that I let him go, and laid hold of one of these men that were in custody of the watchmen, when we came to the watch-house, Mr. Banks said he apprehended one of the men, I spoke to him, and replied, he must be very wrong to say so, when he was in my custody at the time they were apprehended, so that gave us a strong suspicion that he might be a party concerned himself, and the prosecutor gave charge of him on suspicion of his being one of the party, and said, he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140013"/> prosecute him if he had a good character, but his character was dived into, for the prosecutor said, that if his character proved amiable, he would not prosecute him; therefore one of the beadles, and somebody else went, and it proved that he was employed by some attorney as his clerk, and therefore he was discharged, and he came the next day to the office and appeared against them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nugent. Did not you hear Mr. Walker say I was not one of the men? - While they cross examined the prosecutor in the watch house, he was rather disguised in liquor, I did not hear what answer the prosecutor gave, but the prisoners said they did not know one another; the prisoner Nugent said there you hear he says I was not one.</p>

               <p>On Monday night between twelve and one, the prosecutor met us just at King-street, and in Holborn he called out watch, watch, I have been robbed by three men, and the two prisoners at the bar run up the street; there were four run, the two prisoners, the prosecutor, and Banks: I am very clear to one of the prisoners, and the other I am clear in his dress, but I did not altogether take notice of his person.</p>
               <p>Which is that? - The prisoner Burke, they run very hard up King-street, and I followed them, and I turned my rattle; the prisoner Burke never was out of my sight, he was taken in King-street by Glover, and Glover said that the prisoners had thrown some thing away, I looked with my lanthorn, but found nothing; the prosecutor came up immediately, and said that was one of the men that robbed him; immediately the other prisoner was brought up, and the prosecutor said he was the other man; we searched Burke, and found nothing but a tobacco box, and knife, I did not search the other, but I did not hear any thing was found upon him.</p>

               <p>I was going home to bed, and when I heard the rattles I run left I should be taken up disorderly in the streets.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was Walker sober at the time or not? - He seemed to be disguised, and had a doubt, the constable asked him whether he was sober, he said he had been at his club, but he was sober enough to know he had been robbed, and who robbed him; he was a little disguised.</p>

               <p>On the Monday after the gentleman was robbed, he came and gave information, he said he knew the man very well; I went with him, and I went to the publick house; the prosecutor said he was a pale faced young man, dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, corderoy breeches, and mourning buckles, the prosecutor said immediately that is the man, he was dressed exactly as he described, he said he saw him the Sunday after he was robbed, but he had nobody with him; he had nothing in his pockets but a common penknife.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about what coloured hair he had? - I do not remember, I think he said darkish hair.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that the knife? - It was a larger than that to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to describe the person who robbed you, if you knew him so well, to have lank black hair? - It appeared so to me then.</p>
               <p>But if you knew him by sight before that, you knew what colour his hair was before? - He has had his hair cut since, it was in curls then, it appeared to me to be black, I never saw him close, I am quite positive this is the man.</p>
               <p>When did the little boy go away? - I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Grays Inn, I have chambers there, I am not of the law, I am a coal merchant, I know the prisoner, he was servant to Mrs. Hales, No. 82, Queen Ann-street, when first I knew her; I was at Mrs. Hales's drinking tea, and spending the evening on which the robbery was, which I believe was the 2d of July.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect it? - When I went again the Wednesday following, the servant told me, good God! poor Jack is taken up for a robbery; and when I went into the parlour Mrs. Hale told me the same; I had spent the evening the Saturday before, and on that night I believe about ten, I went into the garden or yard; Mrs. Hales stables and coach-house stand in the garden, but no communication to it; I saw a light through that window that looks into the garden, I was a good deal alarmed thinking it might be fire or thieves, and I knew that young Mr. Hale and the foot boy were below somewhere; I called Mrs. Hale out, says I, have you any body in the stable, no, says she; I immediately went round, and took the present foot boy with me, the watch was then going his rounds; I stopped and made the boy get a ligh from a woman in the Mews, and I still saw the light in Mrs. Hale's premises, all at once it was put out; the watchman was then going ten: I took the key and opened the door, and who should present himself in black, but the prisoner at the bar, says I, good God! Jack, what do you do here, he rather seemed to hesitate, I insisted on knowing what he did there, he said he was looking for a dog, I told him it was a very improper hour to look for a dog with a light, I believe by this time the watch was going half after ten; the prisoner then came out, and went to a cottage over the way in the Mews, but whether he went in there I do not know; I came back to let Mrs. Hale know, and she then told me that her son had just told her, he had given him leave to sleep in the stable, in the coachman's room, to save a lodging while he was out of place, but that it was unknown to her before.</p>
               <p>How old is Mrs. Hales son? - Between fifteen and sixteen, I believe; upon that she was very uneasy, but I took the watchman and went and examined very carefully, and found all very safe; I saw no more of the prisoner after he went out to go to the Mews, but that very evening I called there, I said I will cross the rope walk, in going over two men attacked me, and made a push at me, and bid me stop, and one of them was so like the prisoner, that had the prisoner been at liberty, I could positively have sworn to him.</p>
               <p>What was that young man dressed in? - I do not know, it was a very dark night, he was in a dark dress, the man who stopped me appeared to have prodigious black hair, I observed he was a very black man, but I cannot swear to his hair.</p>
               <p>Was this young man's hair when you first knew him lank or curled? - I cannot say, I did not take any notice, he used sometimes to wear his hair curled when he was with Mrs. Hale, but it was oftener lank then curled.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far may it be from this stable, to the place where this gentleman said he was robbed? - I imagine it is near four hundred yards, you are obliged to come up Queen Ann-street, and down Ogle Court, and down the rope walk.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Hales lives three doors below me.</p>
               <p>What clothes was the man dressed in when he stopped you on the Wednesday? - I believe he was in black, I sprung from him, and gave him his own salutation back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140016"/> again, which was not a very gentleman-like one, there were two men.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lived with me and my son four years, and behaved exceedingly well, and had my son been living, he would have appeared in his defence, but he is dead; he looked after the horses, he laid in the house on the Saturday night before he was taken up; he laid in our stables that particular evening, my youngest son saw him about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when he was taken up? - I heard of it about three or four days after he was taken up; the robbery was on the Saturday, and he was not taken up till the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>When did you hear he was taken up? - Upon my word, I cannot say, it was two or three days after, I fancy it might be about Wednesday or Thursday, a gentleman came and told me of it, a coach-maker that does our business came and asked me about it, I did not know that he laid in the coach-house.</p>
               <p>Was it with your knowledge that he lay in your stable? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When did you first know it? - That very night, that was on the Saturday, a gentleman that supped at our house went in the garden, and said, there is a light in your coach house, and he came back, and said, there is Jack there; and then my son said, mother, he lays there. I have frequently entrusted the prisoner with money and drafts. That gentleman was Mr. Kinnersley; it was about half an hour past ten that this happened.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Brown. Do you recollect about what time it was that your apprentice was out? - He was not out above ten minutes, I believe it was not above ten minutes under or over half past ten, I cannot be more particular.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was there more than one in black, at the time of the robbery? - No there was not, they had short jackets on, I think one was a butcher.</p>
               <p>Have you any means of fixing what o'clock it was when this happened to you? - It was about half after ten, I cannot fix it more near.</p>
               <p>How long has the prosecutor lived with you? - Two years.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the person of the prisoner, seeing him at any time as a neighbour? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you know where Mrs. Hales lived? - No, Sir, not then.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner? - At the public house, it was after he had left his place.</p>

               <p>Where had it laid before he took it? - I cannot say, we were very busy that day.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take it at all? - No, not at all, I had no suspicion of him till I saw it bulkey under his coat.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of last July, about half after nine, or rather better, I was going up Cornhill, and I saw the prisoner stand at Mr. Hardy's door, I thought he was a lad belonging to the shop, till I saw two others about a yard distance come up, and speak to the prisoner, then that gave me a suspicion it was thieves, and I went across the way, and stood behind a hackney coach, and in about a minute or two I saw the prisoner stop himself, and go in at the door.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion had he to stop to go in at the door? - I do not know that, my lord; the other men paraded backwards and forwards the mean while; he was in the shop, as near as I can guess, about two minutes, and I saw him come out with two parcels under each arm, two bundles of hats, then he crossed over the way, and the other men followed him, the other two were men grown, they were a great deal taller than him, as soon as he had crossed over, I went and laid hold of him directly with the property upon him; as soon as I laid hold of him, he cried out Shimerah! Shimerah! as loud as he could, which I understood to be his companions, he struggled to get from me, and my foot slipped, and I cried out stop thief, for fear the others should come up to take the goods away, and a waterman belonging to the coaches came up, and laid hold of him, and picked up the things, and gave them to me; we took him into Mr. Hardy's house, and he was committed, the other two made off.</p>
               <p>You are sure the things that were given to you were the same he had under his arm? - Yes, they were never out of my sight.</p>

               <p>Court to Hardy. Look at these hats, are these the hats that were brought back by Johnson, when the prisoner was brought?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140019"/> - They are my property, they are my work.</p>

               <p>I was walking along that night, there was a parcel of men crossing the way to the coach stand, they chucked a parcel of hats down under my legs, and I stooped and picked them up and looked at them, and that man came and catched hold of me, my friends are gone, and my mother did not think I should be tried to day; my mother lives in Whitechapel, and is a chair woman, I live with my uncle at Wapping.</p>
               <p>Jury to Johnson. What are you? - A smith, I work in Bagnio-court, Newgate-street, with Mr. Hill, the boy's mother said she would discover who the two persons were that were with the boy.</p>

               <p>- HARWOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>This padlock I found upon the prisoner, on Sunday morning about one, as I was crying the hour in Mason's-yard, I catched him, and searched him, but no key was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140020"/> to be found; the prisoner was creeping in upon his belly, all but his ancles; I was crying the hour down Duke-street, and through Mason's-yard, I saw the prisoner in Mr. Hutchinson's house.</p>
               <p>Was he trying to get in at any other door? - That I cannot say, but the hinges were broke, where he was trying to get in, it was a room that contained property, I seized him by the feet, and dragged him out, and then I collared him, and went and alarmed the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Was that padlock on the outside of the door? - Yes, I saw it hang upon the staple at twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was locked at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you try it? - I did, and it was fast then, and at one, when I was calling my round, I found the door open, and the man upon his belly.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you the key of the padlock? - Yes, I have it, but it is at home.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the padlock? - Yes, I am sure it is the padlock that was on my outer door, and I believe my man knows it to be so.</p>
               <p>Have you any means of saying that that padlock was fast on the night of the robbery? - I am sure it was in the day, about four to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Fullwell. I remember it being fast in the day, but I cannot say how it was at night.</p>
               <p>Had you unfastened it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Hutchinson. Had you ever unfastened it at any time after, the day you locked the door? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten it with the key? - I locked it with the key, I left it at home.</p>
               <p>About four you say? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Fullwell. It was about three or four.</p>
               <p>Court to Harwood. You was saying that the prisoner was all but his ancles in the outer room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what means could he get into the other room, all but his ancles? - There was a kind of a bit of shutter, and he dragged that in; I cannot explain what the fastening was, it was a kind of a shed, where he was endeavouring to get into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This was a shutter that I fastened at the bottom with two burt hinges on the outside, the top was fastened with a pulley to the rope on the inside, so that nobody can get in at it; and he had forced the bottom of the shutter from the hinge that remained, and part of the shutter, had got that down, and was getting into the back house where my property principally is.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you are not satisfied of this offence being fully compleat, as it is a capital offence, to be sure it is your province to judge of the case, and as the account that has been given is a very puzzling and perplexing one, you may acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Was it drawn or in a scabbard? - When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140023"/> I saw it, it was not in the scabbard; they asked me for my property, I told them they should have it; I gave him a shilling, and he asked me if that was all, I told him I thought it was enough, says he, I must have more; he then rummaged one pocket, and found nothing, then he put his hand on the outside of the other, and took out a guinea; that was the prisoner Silvester; he then took three penny worth of half-pence out of my waistcoat pocket, and left one penny, and then rummaged every pocket I had, and finding there was no more, he had nothing further to say to me; he left me, and came to the other side where my friend was that the other man was robbing, who is not taken, and they took four plates that my friend had got in a little basket, and then they went away.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you altogether? - I suppose it might be five minutes, I discerned the men before they came to the chaise.</p>
               <p>Had you leisure to observe the men sufficiently to know who they were? - Quite so.</p>
               <p>Do you know which they were? - Yes, I am convinced these men are the men, I picked these men out of fourteen prisoners.</p>
               <p>Were they dressed as they are now? - Barnes was in a brown coat, and the other was in a drab coat; the one that is not taken put a handkerchief into his mouth, and I am not clear whether Silvester did or not, but I think not.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect which of them was in the chaise with you? - Silvester was in the chaise.</p>
               <p>When were they taken up? - The next day, I believe one of them was taken up in Wardour-street, in London, they went across the fields towards Hampstead as we understood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you ever see either of their persons at all? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was considerably surprized? - No, Sir, I was not, I never met any thing with so much resolution; I paid my attention to the prisoner, I saw his face as clear as I see yours.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him before he stopped you? - Yes, about 20 yards from me, coming towards me, he and another.</p>
               <p>What passed when he stopped you? - Just before he came to me I saw something glitter from under his coat, which was a pistol, he put it to my breast, but not quite close, and said, damn you, your money, and your watch; I said, I have no watch, and I had but a little money, and they should have it, but not to use me ill; then they asked me how much I had, I said between six and seven shillings, and I put my hand in my pocket and gave it him, and he put his other hand to look it over, then he asked me if I had no more, I said I had not, and the other man who was in soldier's clothes said, look whether he has got a watch or not, and I said I had not, they might search me, and before that he said pass, and then as he was going away, he turned about, he says, there are two more men in the hollow, but if they stop you, you say bob; the prisoner was taken up the 3d of July; it was a very fine clear night.</p>

               <p>Was it dark? - No, far from being dark.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the countenance of the men? - Exceedingly of this man, but of the other I did not, because of the other man I had not an opportunity, this man held the pistol to my breast, the other man went round me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man? - I am very positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did his figure strike you at the time? - Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>If you had described him now when you went home, how did you describe him? - I described his visage, a black swarthy man, about five feet ten inches, he was dressed in a lightish coat and red waistcoat, but I could not distinguish what cloth it was, as to his lower part I could not see, he had nothing over his face, his hat was flapped.</p>
               <p>When you saw him ten days after was you sure of him at that time? - Yes, I was very positive of it, as he accosted me in a very odd manner.</p>
               <p>How so? - On the 3d of July, as I was going home, I had a great coat on my arm, and a large bundle in my hand, I met him this side of the Bunch of Grapes, by Brompton road; there are new buildings there just began, I was looking over my hand to the buildings, and he said good cheer, old man! and at the same time said, damn your blood, do not be sulkey.</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing to him? - His voice struck me, and I stood still, but he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140025"/> did not, I says do you know me? and he says, damn you, I know you, and the next time I meet you, I'll do for you; he said I will meet you, and kept on going, and uttered many more oaths that I did not hear distinctly, but I never heard any oaths pronounced with such vengeance; I ran home and was quite astonished at it, and there was a trembling came upon me.</p>
               <p>I thought you lived at Hamstead? - Yes, but I came to Brompton to see my wife, I went and told my wife I had seen the man that robbed me; I did not stay with my wife a quarter of a minute, then I met two men, and I asked them to assist me, and they said they did not like to do such a thing; then I met with a good stout lad, I sent him for a constable and bid them follow me; I saw the prisoner go into the two brewers, and there I followed him, and the constable came in just after.</p>
               <p>The night you was robbed going towards Hampstead, was you perfectly sober? - Yes, Sir, I had only part of a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>You never saw the man before? - Not to my knowledge; I was not so much frightened at the time, only afterwards his telling me there were two men to meet me frightened me; I am clear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Now Mr. Fletcher, you are a gardener at Hampstead? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far may that be from Knightsbridge? - I suppose it does not exceed six miles.</p>
               <p>Knightsbridge is not the road to Hampstead from London? - I did not go by Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Is Knightsbridge in the road to Hampstead from London? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Now the first thing that drew your attention to this man on the 3d of July, was his speaking to you? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Otherwise you would not have seen him? - No, I did not see him till he spoke.</p>
               <p>That put you into a sad trembling, that same swearing about frightened you dreadfully, even almost out of your senses? - It did.</p>
               <p>But when you had two russians accosting you, and one with a pistol, you was not affraid? - I thought by my using no resistance they would not use violence.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you or was you not afraid? - I certainly was a little, but not so much.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this story in Bow-street? - I did.</p>
               <p>They took down what you said there, did they not? - They did not take down all.</p>
               <p>Did they take down any thing about Bob? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it is not here, not a word you see about Bob? (looking at the examination) - I am very clear there was.</p>
               <p>Who laid hold of this man? - The beadle is here.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the beadle left him at liberty till the next day? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that from the beadle? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired who this man is that is at the bar? - No, no farther than the account that he gave of himself.</p>
               <p>Have you searched his lodgings? - No; he had a red waistcoat on, and his voice struck me first.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was you robbed on? - Thursday, it was a very light night, the moon was at the full the day before.</p>
               <p>Now recollect whether the moon rose earlier than eleven that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You will swear that it was up, and shining at the full? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw this man before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What should you think about it if I was to call you six people to prove he was in another place? - I could not believe it.</p>
               <p>I believe these twelve gentlemen will, and that will be a better thing.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning this man came to the two brewers at Knightsbridge, and charged the landlord to take up the prisoner, whom I knew very well, he said I have nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140026"/> to do with prisoners; what is the matter; says he, he has robbed me? then says he, you must get a constable; says he, take hold of that man; what man says I, what Belton! there the man stands, I know him very well, I laid hold of him, and we went before Mr. Justice Gilbert, the same day, and he was committed, then Mr. Belton said, I should be glad not to go to prison, let me lay at the public house, or at the constable's house; says Mr. Gilbert, I have committed you, but if the constable and you can agree, I have no objection, so we went and had a pot of beer, and I took him home to my own house, and kept him all night, and the next morning I took him before Sir Sampson Wright; I have known Mr. Belton for two years, he is a shoemaker at Knightsbridge, he lived along with Mr.

               <p>Had you any light in the room? - No light.</p>
               <p>How did you see him then? - I followed him, see him I could not, I did perceive him, but not to make any thing at all of him, we had a scuffle, he run out of doors, and I after him, and caught him at the bottom of the yard, and there we had a long scuffle, he was rather the best hand in getting over the pales, and I tore the skirt of his coat off, which is here; after the coat began to tear, he swore he would kill me, and he turned himself short about, and I perceived his features, and I knew him; he was on the other side of pales in a ditch, and he looked up at me, then I knew him perfectly well, he used to use my shop, I keep a chandler's shop; when the coat tore he got away, he was taken I believe the Sunday following; I found this pound of tea without the door, tied up in a handkerchief, and on that side of the coat which I pulled off, were between seven and eight shillings in halfpence, I found nothing else upon him, but I lost my watch, and about forty shillings in silver, the silver was in the next till to the halfpence, and my watch was in my pocket, and the key of my bureau; in my breeches pocket, which lay in a chair by my bed side; I never found my watch again.</p>
               <p>How did this man get into your house? - He got in at the window, and undid the door, he took a pane of glass out, and took off the casement; the house was all fast when I went to bed, I am always the last up, I went to bed about ten, I saw all the doors and windows fast myself.</p>
               <p>What family have you in the house? - None but a little girl fourteen years old; two quarries of glass were taken out first, but there was a shutter prevented him there, and then he came round backwards; I am sure to the man, quite thoroughly satisfied it is the man; it was not moon light, but bright star light.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say positively that this was the man, when he was on one side of the pales, and you on the other? - I had the fuller view of him.</p>
               <p>Had you lost any halfpence? - Between seven and eight shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Did you find the silver? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the till locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it broke open? - He had got the key, that key was laid between two drawers upon the right hand behind.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of July in the morning, sometime about the hour of four or something after, I cannot tell particularly the time, being in the room where I lodge, I heard a great cry of murder in the next house, I live next door to the prosecutor, I run down stair as fast as I could, and got into the back yard adjoining Robert Rudd's yard, and there I saw upon a little shed in Robert Rudd's yard, the prisoner making up the shed to a high wall, seeing him all over blood, I thought there must be something extraordinary, and hearing Mrs. Rudd say something. I pursued him over the shed up the wall; I never lost sight of him, only so far as when he jumped over a wall, the wall hid him till I got upon it; I immediately pursued him as fast as ever I could, I thought he got the advantage of me, but at last I took him, after a considerable struggle, and

You have been fortunate in the circumstance which, in point of law, intitled you to be acquitted of that part of the charge of this indictment which would have affected your life, if the jury had thought themselves warranted to bring in a general verdict of guilty; for your conduct was such, it would in all probability have excluded all hopes of mercy from your Sovereign, and certainly as far as depended on me I should have thought you most clearly a person proper to be made a public example of; for you were not only guilty of the most atrocious offence, but after the fact committed, and when you had an opportunity of making, or at least attempting to make your escape, not content with that you returned again, and, as far as lay in you, endeavoured to deprive the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140032"/> prosecutor of his life: under these circumstances therefore there could not be a more fit example of public justice than you; but the jury have justly and rightly acquitted you of that part of the charge, and I am perfectly satisfied with their doing so; for however acrocious the crimes of offenders may be, it is our duty to administer the law with mercy and justice; but I cannot do my duty to the public, without passing the severest sentence upon you that the circumstances of your case will admit, which is, that you be</p>

               <p>On the 28th day of July I saw a gentleman's carriage at the gate, this boy let it through, being one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street, I thought it would be well to take notice of what was upon the road; the boy went to the window and put his head in, and put the key in; this was at the time that the gentleman's carriage had passed on, it might be a minute, the turnpike gate was not open, nor anybody there but two ladies that got out of their carriage, he then went to the window, and put his hand in, as I supposed with the key, and shut to the window; at about two minutes after I heard a carriage coming along, it stopped again, the boy went and put his head right in, and took the key and let the stage coach through, and I heard the stage coachman say, here boy, where is the turnpike man, here is six-pence, and if you do not keep it you ought to be d - d; he opened the gate and let the stage through, after the gentleman's carriage had gone through.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Why I thought you always fastened the gate at night? - It was fastened.</p>

               <p>When you saw him twice go to the window, did you see him open the window? - I saw him open the window and take out the key of the gate.</p>

               <p>On Thursday afternoon, the 18th of August last, as I was passing down the back lane leading towards <placeName id="t17850914-21-crimeloc101">Stepney-fields</placeName>

               <p>What do you suppose it to be worth at the time it was taken? - I do not know, it cost me three shillings, I am not acquainted with the value of old handkerchiefs, I suppose it is not material.</p>
               <p>But it is material? - Then if it is material, I wish to value it as low as possible; I only come here to do justice to my country; I wish to exercise the feelings of humanity at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman cannot swear I picked his pocket, I was playing with some other boys.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said before the Justice he lived at Brentford, he was playing at hoop; he appeared in a very indifferent situation, I gave him six-pence at the time, and I gave him six-pence after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, If the indictment had been proved as laid, it would have been a capital offence, for if you find him guilty of privately stealing from the person to the amount of more than a shilling, it would exclude the benefit of clergy.</p>

               <p>I lost some leaf gold, upwards of two ounces, out of my shop, on the 2d of September.</p>
               <p>Is your shop a part of your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see it there? - I saw it there within an hour.</p>
               <p>At what time did you miss it? - The next morning at six my people missed it; I saw it the night before at eight o'clock, and at nine I saw the prisoner come in, he came in to sell some skewins, which is a kind of gold that the gilders and coach painters rub off after they have used it, with cotton.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the shop? - It might be ten minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140037"/>Did you buy any of these skewins? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where was your leaf gold at that time? - It was lying on a board in the shop; after I missed it I sent out persons to different parts of the town to have it stopped; the first let him go, the second would not buy it, the third only stopped the gold, and not the man, the fourth stopped both gold and man; Mr. Stubbs has it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. Did this man ever tell you any of this article before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop; - I can say there was my son in the shop, and I called my boy to get change, and I believe my daughter went to the door of the shop.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a silversmith in Holborn, I produce this gold leaf which the prisoner brought to my came there the 3d of this month at about twelve, and asked me if I bought any gold, I told him I did; he told me it was gold leaf, he had not got it then, but he would go and fetch it; he went out immediately, and in the space of five minutes he brought this gold to me; I asked him if he had any more of it, he said, yes, he had, but he could not get at it at present; then I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it the corner of a street; I told him immediately I had had information that morning twice, that Mr. Durnford had his shop robbed of a quantity of gold, and that I was desired to stop both man and gold; and if he came by it honestly, he would not mind being examined; accordingly I put him in the parlour, and Mr. Durnford came down, and said, the prisoner was the man that was in his shop the night he lost his gold; I asked him where the remaining part of the gold was, he said he had given it to another man, and could not get at it at present.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This part of the gold that was lost, I have a duplicate of it in my pocket; as to the melting, and manufactory, it is in such a state as I am sure of, it is my own work that I was upon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Is it not usual, Sir, to manufacture gold in that way? - Certainly, but it is in the same state, the same melting, the same ingot and colour.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How much is there of that? - Here is a five penny weight, which is about the eighth of it.</p>
               <p>- FARLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gold-beater, I produce this gold leaf, which I received from a person, but I cannot tell who it was, I conceive it to be the prisoner, I am not positive; the person said it was not his own property, it belonged to a person that found it; there was more of it, and he had given him this to sell.</p>
               <p>What quantity is there? - About sixteen shillings worth, he went away to fetch the person, and I sent to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>- BADGER sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is my master, he told me at Bow-street, that they had not got all the gold, there was some hid, he did not say where; I went in search of the gold, and I found the skins, some bits of gold were in a stable, the skins were found close by the shop, in a hole with some dirt over it.</p>
               <p>(The skins produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. CLOCKIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I found these skins in Mr. Durnford's shop, brought there by this man.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these skins by many marks, they have been through my hands, I suppose two thousand times.</p>
               <p>Did you lose these skins at the time you lost the gold? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was there gold between every skin? - May be not between every one, but between the major part.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Those are such skins as gold is usually beat on, manufactured in that way? - They are.</p>
               <p>I suppose there are many thousands of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140038"/> same sort? - Without doubt, but I know the skins by many marks.</p>

               <p>Suppose you saw that gold any where else, would you swear to it? - I could not particularly swear to such a thing.</p>

               <p>Do you remember his coming to the house? - Perfectly well, it was on the 26th of July, between six and seven o'clock, he brought a draught to the house for payment, we told him it was past the hour, and we could not pay it him; he said he had been early by our house that morning, and was going to Cheshunt that evening, and he must come to town again on purpose; we thought it reasonable to pay him after consulting a little together, and the draught passing through the hands of two or three, we told him we must give him notes, he desired to have cash, but he took a 30 l. bank-note, a 15 l. bank-note, and 7 l. 10 s. in money, he did not seem to count it readily, he seemed to turn the notes over as if he could not read them; I told them over to him, he took them without counting them, and put them in his pocket; after he was gone, a confusion having been observed, I desired to look at the draught, and having reason to suspect it, I looked at some other draughts of Mr. Prescott's in the house, and they differed materially; he told me his horse and chaise were waiting at the Basing-house, we sent there, but we could not find any person there that answered that description.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the Basing-house? - It is a public-house where they water their carts and horses; I put two marks on the draught immediately on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Did you know the number of the notes? - Yes, clearly, I entered them in the waste book.</p>
               <p>What are the numbers? - The book is here, the number of the 30 l. note is 7477, and the 15 l. note is 2476.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. How long have you been a clerk to Mess. Prescot? - Between six and seven years.</p>

            , many of us know, lives mostly at Theobald's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He generally draws by draughts? - He has frequent occasion to draw, I am one of the paying clerks, I have very frequent opportunities of seeing his hand writing, this draught was tendered to me.</p>
               <p>You have had frequent opportunities of seeing Mr. Prescott's draughts? - I have, the draught was tendered to me for payment, it was tendered after five.</p>
               <p>You are very sure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often may that happen? - We very frequently oblige gentlemen.</p>
               <p>I believe you do not pay after five, but to customers? - This was not a customer.</p>
               <p>So I see, and I wish the Jury to remember that of course, after you have done paying your hurry is over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140044"/>Then a man coming after the hour of paying, he must be subject to more notice than he would be in the hurry of business? - He certainly caused more notice to be taken.</p>
               <p>A man coming with a forged draught would be glad to get away, I should think? - He would rather have had cash.</p>
               <p>At the time you paid it, you believed it to be the draught of Mr. Prescott? - If I had not, I should not have paid it.</p>
               <p>Upon comparison then you suspected it? - I did.</p>
               <p>That suspicion however did not then decide you that it was a forgery: now I ask you, as a conscientious man, upon your oath, whether at that time you could have ventured to have sworn that that draught was a forgery? - I could not swear it was not his signature.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prescott we all know, or at least I do, has a very large estate at Theobalds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has very many occasions to sign his name? - He has.</p>
               <p>He is a magistrate for the counties of Hertford and Middlesex? - He is.</p>
               <p>He is likewise a commissioner of the land-tax? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Now from the strong likeness in this draught, was not you induced to believe, and had not you suspected, that somebody had substituted this to Mr. Prescott, as some other paper he intended to sign? - It never occurred to me.</p>
               <p>You did not go with Mr. Smart to the prisoner's house? - I did not.</p>
               <p>I take it, that even now, looking at the draught alone, without comparing it with any other writing of Mr. Prescott's, you would not have ventured to have sworn it was not his hand writing? - I have heard nothing from any body on the subject, I have compared his draughts, and there is a great difference.</p>
               <p>I ask you, if that draught was put into your hands at York, where you could not compare it, upon the bare inspection would you venture to swear it was not his handwriting? - Not the signature I would not.</p>
               <p>Then if this thing had been offered to you any where but in Threadneedle-street, and you had been disposed to have advanced money upon it, would you have done it?</p>
               <p>Court. That is a consequence of its being Mr. Prescott's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>I am likewise clerk to Mess. Prescott and Co. I remember the prisoner's coming to our house; I have not any doubt as to his person, I am sure he is the person that brought the draught: on the 25th of July, he came about six-in the evening; with a draught of Mr. Prescott's for 52 l. 10 s. drawn by Mr. Prescott, on a plain piece of paper, and not stamped.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by that observation, that it was on a plain piece of paper, and not stamped? - I never saw one of the kind before, as I recollect on a plain piece of paper: the prisoner asked if we could oblige him with the payment of that draught; that he was past our house about six in the morning, had been to Richmond, and was going to Cheshunt that evening; that he was to meet his friend at the Basing-house in Kingsland road about six, and would be much obliged to us to let him have payment; upon shewing it to the head clerk, this being Mr. Prescot's draught, we concluded on paying it; we asked him how he would have it, he said in money, as he might find some difficulty in getting notes changed in the country; we had locked up our cash, and told him we should be obliged to pay him in notes; we paid him a 30 l. note, and a 15 l. note, and 7 l. 10 s. in money, which was paid him by Mr. Clayton; he seemed confused, he did not seem clear whether it was right or not.</p>
               <p>Court. It is sufficient that you upon inspecting of the draught, from such inspection of it you suspected it, tell us what you did? - In consequence of such suspicion, the draught was shewn about to the different clerks, and it was shewn to Mr. Hollingsworth, then we sent down to Mr. Prescott's with a description of the person, then Mr. Smart came up to me on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140045"/> Thursday, and I went with Mr. Smart to the prisoner's house, but he was not at home, the next morning I saw him with Mr. Smart; Mr. Smart turned round and asked me if that was the man that brought the draught, I said he was, and I was sorry to say it; we had a post-chaise waiting at a little distance, and I went with him, Mr. Smart came with me and the prisoner, we came to Threadneedle-street, we took him into the office; Mr.

               <p>What time did you go the next morning? - Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>That was on Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that from Monday to Friday this note had been in his possession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe in that part of the world it is very well known, that Mr. Smart is the agent for Mr. Prescott? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>What was the date of the draught? - It was the 18th of July, a week back.</p>
               <p>It was payable to bearer? - It was payable to Geo rge Scott or bearer, payable on being presented.</p>
               <p>Those in general I believe are presented the day, or the day after? - It is most common, but not general.</p>
               <p>A man coming at the distance of a week then would not be less a subject of observation? - We do not pay great regard to dates, unless they are dated forward, if they are backward we do not.</p>
               <p>But in order to know that, you must look at them you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many of you had looked at it? - Three, Mr. Clayton, Mr. Woodhouse, and myself, Mr. Woodhouse is the head cashier, we supposed the signature to be Mr. Prescott's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>If that draught had been tendered to you at York, would you have believed it to be Mr. Prescott's hand writing? - I think I should the signature.</p>
               <p>Whilst you was in the chaise the prisoner asked you if Mr. Prescott was angry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he been told the draught was a forged one? - I was not present when Mr. Smart went with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>- SMART sworn.</p>
               <p>I am agent and steward of the courts to Mr. Prescott, but not land steward; I was at dinner when the description of forgery came in, I went to town, and in consequence of that, and of what I heard in town, I went to Edmonton to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - He is a school master, he served his time with Mr. Draper, master of the free-school there; Mr. Prescott is acting magistrate there: when I went to the prisoner's house in the evening, I asked his wife if he was at home, she said no, he was gone to Mr. Flacks; there was a house between that and Mr. Flack's, which I thought he sometimes used, he was not there, we returned and went there the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140046"/> next morning, and as soon as I saw him, I said Banning, how could you be guilty of this forgery on Mr. Prescott, you must go with me to London, he positively denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect in what terms as near as you can? - He said he had done no such thing, or he knew nothing about it, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what it was that had been forged on Mr. Prescott? - I hold him it was in vain to deny it, it was for fifty guineas, and that one of Mr. Prescott's clerks was at the door waiting to identify his person.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make to that? - None, I then put my hand upon his collar, and led him to the door, and beckoned to Mr. Foster, and asked him if he knew that man, he said he was but too sure.</p>
               <p>Is that the man the money was paid to? - Yes.</p>

             both use, that he was but too sure, what did he mean by that? - I believe no otherwise than that he was sorry any man should be guilty of any such offence, I believe only general tenderness; The prisoner then asked leave to discharge the children from school, and to clean himself, which I permitted; I went up stairs while he discharged the school, and put on a pair of shoes, instead of a pair of slippers which he had on before, he then came down stairs, and as we went to the post chaise, I taxed him with having copied it from a warrant, signed by Mr. Prescott, the only answer he gave me was, was not Mr. Prescott very angry when he found it out, was there no way of getting through it, them were the words, or very near them; we then reached the chaise, and I handed him into the chaise, and put Mr. Foster with him, and no other conversation passed till we came to Mr. Prescott's banking-house in London, there Mr.

               <p>Did the number correspond? - We found it did not, there was nines instead of sevens.</p>
               <p>Which book did you compare it with? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Clayton.

               <p>In what particular? - By altering it from 2476 to 2496, I carried Mr. Bowles another 15 l. note, and he gave me that which is now in my possession; this is the note that I found at Mr. Bowles's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you compare that with the book? - Yes, upon our return the number was 2476.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Prescott? - I have done business for him for seventeen or eighteen years, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Clayton. Look at that draught? - This is the draught I received from the prisoner, this note has two marks, the one has the initials of the person's name that gave it me, W. for Woodhouse, and C. L. for clearing book, where I had it from, I am perfectly clear it is the note I marked, and the note I received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Clayton. When draughts are paid in the paying hours what becomes of them? - We file them directly we pass,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140047"/> three times in a day we clear the file, we take off the draughts and put them in another place.</p>
               <p>You take them off, post them, and deposite them somewhere else? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you often seen Mr. Prescott write? - I have seen many hundreds of his draughts.</p>
               <p>Look at that hand-writing? - I do, the body bears no similarity at all to his hand writing, the signature bears a distant one, he has a method of writing rounder with his Grat the bottom, and the turn at the end of Prescott commonly goes the contrary way; if this had been offered to me as one of Mr. Prescott's draughts I should have immediately stopped it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner's house is on the road from Theobald's to London? - I left a fictitious message.</p>
               <p>What was it? What message did you leave with his wife? - That I called about Captain Peters's business.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner know you? - For many years, he certainly knew I was his attorney; I left word I would call as the next morning.</p>
               <p>At what hour? - I believe about ten.</p>
               <p>Did you then find the prisoner in his business? - His wife called him out of the school to me.</p>
               <p>Then you found him in his business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You described him in his slippers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not in the dress of a man going to fly? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>He came to you directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He came with you willingly? - Yes, he shifted his coat in the room above stairs, and I staid in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Was anybody in the room above stairs where he shifted? - Only his wife.</p>
               <p>Did you search his wife? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Did you take her to London? - No.</p>
               <p>If she had had any property given her she might have concealed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She might have burnt it? - Yes. When we came to London he delivered me that bank note, as I before stated.</p>
               <p>Then instead of being put under his bed, given to his wife, thrown out of the window, or put down his throat, he carried it to London? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>When he came to Mr. Prescott's house he instantly produced the one, and directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140048"/> you where to find the other? - He did.</p>
               <p>Without any sort of hesitation? - He did.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you this, what are the sort of instruments which you have been accustomed to see Mr. Prescott sign? - I have seen him sign letters, deeds, and draughts.</p>
               <p>And abundance of other things, orders of removal, orders of bastardy, and the whole of Burn's Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many hundreds of the one do you suppose for one of the draughts - I suppose I may say two thousand to one, of those in preference to draughts.</p>
               <p>Now pray do not you know that Mr. Prescott adopto another character of handwriting in those instruments to what he uses in his draughts? - They are so much alike I cannot tell the difference.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, excluding from your mind all comparisons of hand-writing, whether looking at this draught you will venture to swear it is not Mr. Prescott's hand-writing? - I will venture to swear that I do not believe, nor that I should never believe, it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Without any comparison of hand-writing? - I should have ventured to swear I did not believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Will you venture to swear that Mr. Prescott uses precisely the same character of hand-writing in these instruments and in draughts? - I ask you whether there is any intentional difference? - I believe none; when I taxed him with copying his handwriting, then he denied it, and asked if Mr. Prescott was not angry.</p>
               <p>Without offence one may ask whether Mr. Prescott would not be angry that any person should receive his money who had no right to it? - Mr. Garrow would in the same situation.</p>
               <p>- ATKINSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a clerk in Mr. Prescott's house, I never saw him write.</p>
               <p>Look at these two bank notes? - Here is my hand-writing, Dimsdale and Co. on both; the 30 l. I am very particular in; I received it on the 25th of July, and the 15 l. appears from the book to be received on that day, but I am not so particular to one as the other, as I have omitted putting dates to them; I do not know to whom they were paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it for granted you are what we call an out-door clerk? - No, I am not; I receive these in exchange of draughts, I received the 30 l. from a customer, it is customary in the clearing house to put a letter. I have very good reason to know it comes from there; after I bring home the bank notes, I give them to the clerk, and what becomes of them afterwards I know not.</p>

               <p>Look at that draught? - I do not believe it to be his hand writing, it differs in the G, in the first place, and in the flourish after the stroke across the T.</p>
               <p>If you had seen that note any where else, should you have taken it to be Mr. Prescott's hand writing? - I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Whether, independent of all you have heard, upon a bare inspection, you would not have taken it to be his hand writing? - If the note had been tendered to me for money, I should not have given money for it, I should have looked to the signature of it, which I am so well acquainted with, and upon the inspection of it I should have been satisfied it was not.</p>
               <p>Would you upon the bare abstract view of it have sworn that it was not his hand writing? - I certainly should.</p>

Gentlemen, I ought to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140049"/> state to you what has passed between the banker's clerk and me just now, the two different notes appear to be entered without any dates, they are entered once in the clearing book when the clerk brings them in, then they are entered again in the book with the bills set down, the numbers correspond, and both entries are made, not one book from the other, but both from the notes themselves; so that it appears from the books scarcely possible that there could be a mistake in the figure in both the books.</p>

               <p>On Sunday last about six in the afternoon, as I was going in <placeName id="t17850914-27-crimeloc132">Tottenham-court-road</placeName>

               <p>Court. Was this assembly of people near any pond? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a large pond? - Yes, it has been gravel pits, and there is water in it, and my wife, and friend (the wife of another tradesman) crossed the road, and went to the north side of the pond, and when I came there I saw a boy about fifty or sixty yards distance in the water, about five or six yards from the shore, he appeared to be about sixteen or seventeen years old, he was above his middle in water when I first saw him, I left my wife and friend and went to the place where the boy was, and when I came near the place the boy was crying and holding up his hands, and begging that the people would give him leave to duck himself; just as I came to the pond side the boy took his hat off his head and flung it into the road near the pond where I stood, I thought he was going to duck himself, but he did not, he dipped himself down into the water.</p>
               <p>Court. How high did the water come then when he dipped himself down? - As near as I can recollect about his navel or above his breast, he said he could not swim and begged they would give him leave to duck himself, and then somebody persuaded him to come out, he came out near the shore, an d some man, as the boy was coming out, in a blue coat, a genteel looking man, spoke to the boy and said a rash word, but what it was I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he speak with warmth or how? - He spoke with warmth, and the boy as he came out came near where I was, and I had a hard matter to keep from being pushed in, he came so near to me, the prisoner at the bar says give me hold of him or give him to me, I cannot say which, I was so flurried.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the prisoner? - He stood by the side of the pond about five or six feet from me, he then took him by the side of the collar and the boy fell down and begged for mercy as he could not swim.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you mean fell down on his knees, or how? - He tumbled down. The prisoner took hold of him by the thighs or some part of his body, I cannot say what and lifted him off the ground and threw him into the water, and as he threw him into the water, the boy holding fast by the prisoner pulled him in, they both went into the water together about a yard from the shore, or hardly so much, when they were both in the water, the boy either got loose from the man or they were severed from each other.</p>
               <p>Not by any other persons assistance? - There was no body in the water but themselves; then the prisoner took the boy a second time and ducked him under the water.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he hold of his hand then? - He had hold of some part of his body, his clothes, or something; then he gave him a push from him, and the boy went a couple of yards from him, swimming, as I thought; I then saw him struggling for about a minute at the top of the water. I never saw any body so near death, and I never saw him more.</p>
               <p>Court. When the boy was struggling on the surface of the water, what did the prisoner do? - The prisoner was on the side of the water standing; a woman standing by me said, she was d - d if the boy was not drowned; I said to the people by me, I think it proper that the man who threw in the boy should be secured. I turned about, and saw the prisoner on the outside the people; I went up to him immediately, and took him fast by the collar; says I, you rascal, how dare you to drown the boy? He made some reply to me, but what, I really do not recollect; there were several people assisted me, but as the man had been in the water I was afraid of getting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140051"/> myself wetted and dirtied, I let go of him; somebody laid hold of him; he was at the edge of the pond, and he went into the water; I saw him in the water, when he was in the water: I then left them, and went to my wife, that was about fifty yards off: what I am telling you now was what I omitted when I was examined before the coroner. I went to my wife, and told her that the boy was drowned; that I had taken hold of the man that threw the boy into the water by the collar, and that I would go and see whether the prisoner was secured; she begged I would not, but I did; when I came to the pond I saw the prisoner in the water, and a good way up to his middle; there were a couple of men stripped that were diving after the boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner diving too? - No, Sir, he was not above his middle; he was standing about breast high in the water.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to do any thing? - I did not see him.</p>
               <p>For what purpose could he have got up to his middle in the water? - I cannot say; when I returned from my wife to the water I saw the prisoner in the water, but his purpose I do not know.</p>
               <p>How far was he from the man? - About four or five yards; he did not return till he found he was out of the depth; where the man died was a very deep place, and where he stood was not deep.</p>
               <p>How large is this pond? - A largish pond; it had been a gravel pit, it is now a pond, where boys go a bathing, and where they get logs and swim about.</p>

               <p>From the circumstance, and your observation, what do you suppose was the purpose of the prisoner being in the water up to the middle? - I suppose he went to see if he could get the boy out; he went near the place where the boy went out, but when he found it was deep he returned; when the prisoner came out of the water the second time, somebody laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you saw him the last time? - About a couple of minutes; I went and looked at him, to see that it was the same person, and then I left him.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the prisoner is the same person? - I really believe he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Can you be positive? - He has the same dress, and the same appearance.</p>
               <p>The question is, whether he is the same man? - I really believe he is the same man, I have no reason in the world to doubt it is the same person.</p>
               <p>What number of people do you suppose might be assembled about this pond? - Near the place where I was there might be one hundred; but there were people all round; a great concourse of people.</p>
               <p>The charge against the boy was, that he had picked some body's pocket. - Yes, Sir; I was not there at the first.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the boy say any thing about that? - No, Sir, only the boy was begging for mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you see the boy and me down together? - Yes, I did, when he first threw him into the pond.</p>
               <p>Did not you see me follow the boy, and then, says I, my good Sir, I cannot swim, I went out of my depth? - I never heard him say any such thing, but I saw him, I suppose that was twenty minutes after I lost sight of the boy.</p>
               <p>But you staid talking with your wife some time, and telling her you had collared the man, then you went back to see the man again, and then it was you saw him so deep in the water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You see, gentlemen, he did not see him go into the water the second time, but when he returned he was in the water.</p>

               <p>What did you see of this unfortunate business? - I was coming up Tottenham-Court Road between five and six last Sunday afternoon, and I saw a mob with a pickpocket, and I went up to the water, and I saw a boy, I knew him very well; he used to draw beer.</p>
               <p>How many people were there? - Nigh upon a thousand people; I knew the boy, and I called to him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140052"/>Where did you see the boy when you came up? - In the pond.</p>
               <p>How far in? - In, I suppose, five or six yards from the shore, and I called to him; says I, Tom,

            , and I said, come out, nobody shall hurt you in the world; he was a long while before he could see me, but when he could see me he made to me, and came to the shore-side to me; some gentlemen says to me, as I was catching hold of the boy's hand, oh! this is some fellow of yours, so I turned round to look at him, and the boy just caught hold of my hand, and the prisoner then came and catched him out of my hand, and he said, come here, my man, says he, I will take care of you; as soon as ever he caught hold of him, the boy fell a screaming, and he took him under the hams, and by the collar, and threw him into the pond; afterwards, whether the prisoner did go in himself, or whether some body pushed him in, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How far did he throw the boy in? - I suppose a yard, or a yard and a half, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was in the water himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But whether he went in, or was pushed in, you cannot say? - I cannot; then the people that were there said, why do not you follow him? the poor little fellow is sinking, the boy is drowning, the boy is drowning; the people hallooed out all to the prisoner, what is the reason you do not catch hold of him? and he made answer, I cannot swim, I cannot swim; the boy struggled greatly, and then two men began to dive after him.</p>
               <p>How far did the prisoner go in, do you imagine? - I suppose about five or six yards</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner come back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you that the prisoner went as far as he could for the depth of the water? - No, I imagine not, he was much about breast high, and he cried out to the mob of people that he could not swim.</p>
               <p>Do not you think that the prisoner meant to use his best endeavour to save the boy? - I did not see him make any offer to plunge in after him.</p>
               <p>Court. I think, when a man has got as high as you point out, unless he can swim he must necessarily be drowned himself, do not you think so? - I do not think but the man would, if he could get at him in his own safety, but he was afraid of his own life to go after him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you of opinion that the man exerted himself to the utmost to save the boy? - He never went any otherwise than breast high.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think that the man would have saved the boy if he could? - I do imagine he would, if he could, if it lay in his power.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy taken out? - No, Sir; when he came out of the pond it was in Squire Mortimer's field; and when we had taken hold of the prisoner we secured him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy taken out? - No, I saw him the next day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the boy upon the water when the prisoner went in after him or had he sunk? - They were in both together after he threw this boy in, he was in.</p>
               <p>Was that declaration that he could not swim, before the boy had sunk or after? - After.</p>
               <p>How long after? - About half a minute, the boy was in first, but he was down directly after him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I pull off my jacket immediately as I was pulled in the water and go after the boy immediately? - Yes, you did pull your jacket off, and went as far as you could go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The boy's hair and his head were above water, as far as his eyes.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray is the pond a level pond or an unequal pond? - It is very unequal.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where did the man take off his jacket, when he was in the water or at shore? - I saw him without his jacket, but where it was I cannot swear.</p>

               <p>How did he put him into the pond? - They forced him into the pond, I was glad to get away from the pond for fear of being ducked myself, I went away a little distance from the pond, and I saw the last witness go and call to the boy, he said, young Wadham come out; the boy was close to the pond side, and Elliott had hold of the boy, and with that the prisoner at the bar took him out of his hands, and chucked him into the pond, he caught hold of him and flung him in by main force; after the boy sunk, the prisoner who stood by me, took off his jacket, and went into the pond with intent to save him, he told the mob he could not swim.</p>

               <p>I am come voluntarily of my own accord to give evidence of what I saw of the matter, being there present; I was going up Tottenham-court-road, on Sunday evening about six o'clock, and opposite to Midford-place I saw a mob, I went to see what was the matter, and among the mob I met with a Mr. Gascoine, who lives in Monmouth-street, who I knew very well; he told me that two men had been fighting, and that it was over on account of a boy having picked a pocket, and they were going to duck him; I went close to the side of the pond, and I saw the boy forced into the pond by a gentleman in blue, whom I supposed to be the gentleman that had his pocket picked, the mob hallooed out to the boy to duck himself, and the boy begged and prayed, and desired that he might not be ducked; and said, he had rather be whipped, or anything rather than be ducked; upon which he drew backwards to the pond, the length I suppose of five or six yards, he made an attempt to duck himself, but never ducked himself higher than his shoulders; this man Elliot called out to him, then he came out, and when he came to the bank of the pond, somebody put their hand to him, I saw a hand put out, but whose it was I cannot say; upon which several of the mob cried out he had not been ducked half enough, and one man swore he ought to be ducked over head and ears; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140054"/> at the her took him by the collar of the coat, and the waisthand of his breeches, as nearly as I can recollect, in order to throw him in; the boy clung to him, and went in with him; the boy, almost instantly as he was in; I look upon it he was not above two yards from the shore, he began instantly to sink, I suppose it to be from the weight of his clothes; several cried out that the boy was drowning; upon which the prisoner pulled off his jacket, and the prisoner and several people used their best efforts to save the boy.</p>
               <p>How nigh did he go? - He went so high at one time, I could but just see one of his shoulders; there was a boy floating about in the pond upon two large pieces of timber, like a Saint Andrew's cross, and he came so near to the place where the boy sunk, that I had my apprehensions whether this timber might hinder the boy from rising; they were very large timbers, almost as long as that table each of them.</p>
               <p>Court. From what you observed upon this occasion, you have no conception of any intention in the prisoner to destroy this boy? - Not in the least, I look upon it in no other light, than he was the dupe of the mob.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner know of your coming? - No, Sir, not in the least; I live with Mr. Croft, a silk mercer in Fleet-street, and I told him I should be glad to come, and he gave me leave; I sent my direction to the prisoner this morning, and desired I might be sent for when his trial came on.</p>
               <p>Jury. We have heard nothing from any of the other witnesses, respecting this cross piece of timber.</p>
               <p>Elliot. I cannot discern it was nigh the boy, it was further off than from here to the window.</p>
               <p>Jury to Wallis. Did you see the piece of timber? - I saw it, but it was at a distance, the mob hallooed to the boy to come out.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in order to direct your attention to the evidence, it may not be improper for me to make an observation previous to the summing it up; which observation I have stated to my learned brother, and the Recorder, and they concur with me. Gentlemen, this common error of punishing pickpockets by ducking, is a thing that happens, we all know, very frequently; certainly speaking in general upon the subject, it is never accompanied with an intention of the parties acting in it of taking away the life of the offender; according to the course of the law of this country, certainly such a procedure is not strictly justisiable; the constitution of this country has provided a punishment for such offenders, which is to be inflicted on them if they are guilty, upon conviction, in the ordinary course of justice; but yet, gentlemen, we are to consider, that we are men, and that the law gives some indulgence to the infirmities of human nature; and it is in common experience before you all, where certain provocations are given, and a man is stain on those provocations, the law indulges the infirmities and imbecilities of human nature, and allows a jury, from that provocation, to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter; and I should conceive, in a case like the present, that although by no means it would be a strict justification of the prisoner, yet, it is competent to the jury, taking the circumstances of the case into their consideration, and seeing that there was no particular malevolence or design to destroy the person, to admit that consideration to mitigate the charge, and to reduce it from murder to manslaughter: gentlemen, that is the general idea that I entertain upon a subject of this kind, and in these sentiments my learned brother, and my friend Mr. Recorder, concur: I will therefore now state the evidence: [Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added] This is an observation which, I think, may be made, that, at least, speaking for myself, this is the first instance that ever I knew of so unfortunate an event following the punishment of ducking; so that you must see there has not been any precedent to give a caution to those people that act upon the sudden effort of passion from the detestation of this business<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140055"/> of picking pockets; there has not been any occasion for any precedent to put people on their guard: I did at the onset take notice to you of the indulgence of the law to the infirmities of human nature, and it does seem clear to me upon this occasion, and the witnesses seem to speak very plainly and evidently, as well as what the last witness concluded with, that the prisoner had no ill intention or malevolence whatsoever; I should therefore think, gentlemen, that you will be well warranted, if you see it in that light, to reduce and mitigate this charge against the prisoner from murder to manslaughter; but if you think that the man had a diabolical intention to destroy one of his Majesty's subjects, (whether he had any personal enmity against him or not, does not signify) then you will find him guilty of murder, but I cannot see any ground to raise such an inference from this evidence, but if you do, you will find him guilty ge nerally upon this indictment.</p>

               <p>I live in Brunswick-row, Queen-square, and I was returning home in a hackney coach, at one o'clock on the morning of Monday the 2d of September; the coach was going pretty fast, and it stopped so suddenly, that I thought some accident had happened, or that one of the horses had fallen, I was on the left hand corner of the coach, and was just going to let down that window to ask the coachman if anything was the matter, when that instant the right hand door opened, and two men rushed in at the door, and one of them put his right-hand against me, and both of them at the same instant, said, your watch and your money, quick, Sir; quick, be quick! they repeated it several times; the other man who afterwards made his escape, a much shorter man than the prisoner, seeing he had an instrument in his hand, I could not tell what it was, I put my hand into my breeches pocket, where I had some gold and some loose silver, when at that very instant to my great surprise both the men who demanded my money vanished from the door; I heard a voice say with some expression that I cannot recollect,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140059"/> or mention, what do you stop my coach for, and about the distance of five yards, I saw two men struggling together; it was extremely dark, and I got out of the coach as fast as possible, the coach door was put too again, when I came up to the spot, the coachman said master, I have got one of them, but the other has made his escape; when I came up, I found the coachman and prisoner struggling together; it occurred to me at that very instant, from a manoceure of the prisoner as he was turning himself, that he meant to make his escape by pulling off his coat; I had no arms, nor a stick, I struck him with my fist, and he fell backwards, and I then seized him by the collar, and held him down and called out watch, and it was some minutes before the watchmen came, but when they did come up, they explained the circumstance of their not coming up immediately, for they were calling the hour, and were at a distant end of the street, and when they did come up, I will do them the justice to say, they used every attention and zeal in taking the man; the coachman was so active, that he left his coach and horses without any person on earth to take care of them, because he would secure him; the man was taken to the watch-house, he had no arms of any kind about him, he had not a knife at all; this is the whole of what I have to say, but I think in justice, I must add this, that he made use of no abusive imprecations whatever, or dreadful expressions of any sort, and he had no weapons about him of any sort; it would have been impossible if we had not secured this man at the instant, that I could ever have recollected their features, for I was coming by the rails of Bloomsbury Square, to Queen's Square, and they were with their backs to the lamps, therefore I could not see their faces.</p>

               <p>Was that the prisoner? - To the best of my recollection, and to the best of my belief he is, I will not swear positively that he is the man, the man was committed; the prisoner took us to a man that lived in Carnaby-street, one Crook, where he had sold it at a penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. James, Prisoner's Council. Then the prisoner went voluntarily and shewed you where the grate was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to observe, Sir, whether the prisoner was intoxicated or not? - He did not appear to be much intoxicated, there was a sort of stupidity about him; it was an old grate, and had been mended.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the situation of this grate? - There is a plate under the grate, it is under the street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Do you know who was at the expence of putting this grate there? - A person that belonged to the Duke of Queensborough.</p>

               <p>Were these the particular expressions he made use of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you positive of that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Vardy. After you have passed Cork-street before you come to Vigo-lane, the outside of the house is pallisaded in the coach-way.</p>

               <p>Court to Cowper. What part of the street was it in? - In the road-way, quite from the kirb, it was detached from any buildings, it was laying by itself.</p>
               <p>Was it in the street that communicates into Saville-street? - It was laying upside down, quite in the middle of the coachway, not on the pavement.</p>

               <p>What time of day? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do not you know whether it was morning or afternoon? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>If your memory is so very uncertain, how can you undertake to recollect the circumstance, did you see the prisoner come into the shop? - Yes, she came to buy some cotton handkerchiefs; I did not wait upon her; the person that served her is here.</p>
               <p>Is that lady here that saw her take them? - No.</p>
               <p>You understand that she saw her take them? - Yes; on that I immediately jumped over the counter, and cried, Devonshire, a word we use when we suspect any body; then the people were all on their guard; I was going to untie her apron, but she undid it, and shook her cloak, and a little boy that is here saw the handkerchiefs drop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. They were my own feathers, I sold to him last summer.</p>
               <p>Court to Crooke. What does your family consist of? - A wife and one child, and my house consists of creditable lodgers, and I believe my lodgers and neighbourhood in general will give me an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon my word it has a very bad appearance? - Undoubtedly it may have an indifferent look upon me, but I hope it will be rightly considered that it was not meant - .</p>
               <p>Court. It can only be rightly considered if it is considered by you, and that the event of that consideration should be that you never will traffic in this way again: I desire Mr. Clerk of the Arraigns, that you will take down this man's name, and if ever he appears here again, that it may be mentioned, that he has been twice examined here in one day, as a receiver of stolen goods, and you know the punishment of that, to be transported for fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Crooke. I am much obliged to your Lordship, I will readily resign the business, for I find I cannot carry it on without being deceived by crafty people.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of July last, between nine and ten at night, a few doors off my house a gentleman told me my pocket was picked of a silk handkerchief, I found it was gone, the prisoner was close to me, I turned about and charged him with it, he denied having my kind of knowledge of it whatever, I told him I should take him to the watch-house immediately, and on endeavouring to secure him, I saw him put his hands behind him, and throw it into a gentleman's area; I then took him to the watchhouse, and gave him in charge; I did not stop to take up the handkerchief; as soon as I had secured him I returned for my handkerchief, and the servant immediately brought it up to me from the area, and gave it me in the presence of the gentleman who informed me I had been robbed; that handkerchief was mine, I am sure it was the handkerchief I had in my pocket, I am quite sure I saw him throw it down.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 31st of July, between nine and ten at night, being in the street where the prosecutor lives, I observed a man take the handkerchief out of his pocket, and drop it, the prisoner took it up, and put it in his right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was the prisoner to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140075"/> the other person? - He was behind the other person.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner so situated that he could see the other take it out of his pocket? - I should suppose so, he was but a very little behind; I saw the prisoner when he picked it up, not before.</p>
               <p>Court to Elliot. When you laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with the handkerchief, did he deny having the handkerchief? - Positively, several times.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of July at two, I went with the watchman part of his rounds, and going up Haberdasher's-walk, at half past two, I told the watchman to take charge of that young man, because he had a bundle in his hand which I thought he had stolen, so he sprung his rattle, the prisoner set off upon a run as fast as he could; I knew him, I have worked with him; I sent the old man after him, and I went to the watch-house to tell the constable of the night; the watchman saw no more of him at that time, and I stood in the road and saw him jump into a garden, and just before his own house I took hold of him by the collar, with the bundle in his hand.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a gardner.</p>
               <p>Who was present when you took him? - Nobody, he then said for God's sake John let me alone, I have only been into the country for a few flowers, and I told him he should go to the watch-house; when I brought him out of the passage, I saw the constable, and one of the watchmen, and I took him into the watch-house by myself, and the bundle too; then I enquired amongst some gardners, and found out the prosecutor; we did not examine the bundle till after we came to Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Who was left at the watch-house with the bundle? - The watchman who is not here; the prisoner said before the Justice that he found them, that he saw two men drop them, and he run and picked them up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140076"/> he then called to me, and asked me if I would not give him his apron again, so if he had found them, he found them in his own apron, by his own account; I gave him the apron, the eleven bunches of flowers were tied up with green oats, twisted round and round.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any oats near Renton's garden? - Within twenty yards, at the head of the garden.</p>

               <p>Court. Now, Mrs. Colless, you may stand up, and with great propriety mention what you was going to mention before? - From a girl of that innocent appearance and age, I asked the pawnbroker's man how he possibly could, as to my knowledge he did, receive things from her with different marks, and at different times, without asking her how she came by them; he said I was a very impertinent woman, I said, I hoped not, but I said I knew he had more in his possession, though he basely denied it from a supposition that the girl would deny<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140078"/> it also; he said I was impertinent to come and teach him his busines s, why did I not get a search warrant; the constable was present. I told him upon his peril to stir out of that shop, till I got a search warrant, he sent a little boy, who upon my honour, was not gone out of the shop half moment, I said, Sir, I will not believe that child, it is your place to search; he again abused me, and insisted he would not, I told him I would make him, he dared me to do it; I went home and was ill, I went to the girl and told her the consequence, she said, she had not pledged anything at this man's shop, I went back again, he said he would be upon his sacrament he had nothing more. he utterly denied, and swore upon his oath he had not; I was more irritated with the pawnbroker than the girl, and three nights ago, I went to the house of the pawnbroker, I cannot say I was in temper, I then said to him, Mr. Payne, I had not the happiness of seeing you before, I acquit you of ill behaviour, provided you as an honest man, and a man of feeling, and a fair man, will give up the shirts, you have in your possession four shirts; the man immediately looked at his master, and said, we have no shirts; Payne himself behaved very ill, he likewise refused one of my spoons, and swore he had but one, and in opening a pair of stockings another spoon was found.</p>
               <p>Court. You have done very right in exposing to the public the conduct of this pawnbroker, it may therefore be worth considering how far Mr. Payne may yet be the subject of prosecution himself, his man who has been examined cannot, but Mr. Payne may.</p>
               <p>Lightfoot. My Lord -</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, your own conduct is sufficient, this is not the first time in which your conduct has appeared to the Court in an improper light: if you had not been admitted to give evidence, I should have directed a prosecution against you: the Court will keep an eye both upon you and Mr. Payne, I assure you.</p>

               <p>Who run foremost? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was there anybody running before the prisoner? - I cannot say, but I believe there was, I believe he had a great coat on.</p>

               <p>Did you see that? - Yes, I saw a pair of shoes and buckles brought to the woman by a boy, they were brought while I was pursuing the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On Saturday morning the 16th of July I saw the two prisoners at the bar, coming down what they call the back road Islington, with two sacks on their backs; by their appearance I thought they looked disorderly, I stopped and they passed by me, I looked after them, and there was a foot of something hanging out of one of their sacks, so I looked after them, and this Broome had something rolling in his sack I stopped them and they put down their sacks, I opened one, there were three geese in it, I did not open the other's sack then, so I took them to Mr. West of Islington, a cow-keeper, they said they would go with me where I liked, they said they bought the geese in Holloway, of a waggoner, who was going into the country, so I had them committed; in the other sack there were two geese, and two pieces of iron, a kind of a crow.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the colour of these? - I did not take particular notice, Lufkin came, the Tuesday following, and claimed the geese, and swore to them before Justice Blackborough.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Thompson's on the 3d of August, and the prisoner came and asked for a catalogue, I gave him one, he went up stairs and then down into the kitchen again, I thought he had something in his pocket, I desired my fellow servant to look after him, I went into the kitchen, and missed three candlesticks that were below; I went after the prisoner, and met him in Oxford-road, I brought him back, and these are the candlesticks he took out of his pocket; I only found two, they were in the kitchen before; I took him to my master, he asked my master to forgive him, he told him it was the first time.</p>

               <p>I lost some money the 28th of August, in the morning, four guineas, two half-guineas, and seven shillings in silver, out of my pocket; I put my breeches underneath my pillow, and my breeches were taken from underneath my pillow, and the money taken out.</p>

               <p>How came they there? - I went with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where did you meet with her? - At the Green-dragon in Bishopsgate-street; I was locked out of my lodgings, and I called there to get two penny-worth of gin and water, and this woman sat down with me, and persuaded me to go home with her.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Green-dragon? - Half an hour.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in bed? - Three hours.</p>
               <p>When you awoke was the prisoner there? - She was gone.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had it? - Because I felt for it in both my pockets before I laid my breeches under my head; the silver was loose in the right hand pocket, and the gold in a purse in the left; the prisoner saw me put it there, and nobody else; I took the prisoner the same evening at the same house, the Green-dragon; I found none of my money; she had other clothes on, and was very gay rigged out; I never got any of my money again; I was not in liquor, but I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>What did you drink at the Green-dragon? - Two penny-worth of gin and water?</p>
               <p>What a clock was it? - It was about one in the morning; we had been at the bean feast; it was on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Was you sober enough to take upon yourself to say upon your oath that you had this money in your pocket at the time you went to bed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did they appear to you as if they meant to avoid you? - Yes, I stopped them at the corner of Green-street, I asked them where they were going; I spoke to Goddard, who had the bag, and the other stopped; they both stopped with one another, and my partner came up to me; I asked him where he was going, and what he had got, he said ducks; I said, where are you going with these ducks, and he said, to Leadenhall-market; I asked him to whom there, and he said Jones; I asked him what Mr. Jones was, and he said a salesman; I asked him where Mr. Jones lived, and he said at East Acton; he said he had been hay-making there; he said I might see the ducks, I said I should see them; the ducks were all dead; I saw by the killing of them they were not properly killed by a market-man; I seized one, and my partner seized the other; the prisoner said he was not concerned; going along Park-street, just by the Barley Mow, Goddard desired to stop, I stood very close to him the same time; I saw him hustle very close to the corner, and he put his right-hand into his left hand waistcoat pocket, and I put my hand in, and found this piece of wire, and this piece of iron; in the examination they were deemed picklocks, and I took them for such; there were some things of no value, and a pewter spoon, but they are owned by nobody; nothing was found on Lovejoy but this little knife; I took the prisoner to our watch-house in Mount-street, and immediately set off for East Acton, where the prosecutor lives; I went to Mr. Bedford's to ask if he had lost the ducks, and described them no further than as seven ducks; I had no discourse with the servant about the ducks; when I shewed them to him the servant knew the ducks, and said they were his master's property; they were of the Muscovy breed; I did not observe that he said any thing about the marks.</p>

               <p>And had you no supper at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What drink had you then? - Only we had beer and gin plenty.</p>
               <p>How much, recollect, I do not mean to confine you to two or three pots, but whereabouts? - I do not know how much we had indeed, I cannot remember when I am in liquor.</p>
               <p>How much had you to your own share? To my own share, upon my word I cannot say, Sir, I drank pretty hearty.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner drink pretty hearty? - Yes, Sir, he was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>Some of them spent more than that, did they? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Had you any gin? - I believe so, yes, we had some gin.</p>
               <p>How often was gin called for? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Four or five times? - Upon my word, Sir, I do not know how often, we had it too often I think.</p>
               <p>Which of you went away first? - Let me recollect; Wallis went away first, I think to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>And which next, do you remember? - I and the prisoner went together across the way.</p>
               <p>Where did you part with Wallis? - At the corner of the alley that faces the Shovel.</p>

               <p>How much do you think your share was? - Upon my word, Sir, we were all in liquor mostly.</p>
               <p>Cannot you form some judgement? - I cannot remember when I am in liquor, indeed, we were none of us very sober.</p>
               <p>You was sober when you went in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much may you drink before it got into your head? - A little thing gets into a person's head sometimes to what it does at others, we might have two or three pots besides gin.</p>
               <p>Would two or three pots make five of you drunk? - No, I do not imagine it would.</p>

I stopped their proceeding towards London, and expostulated with them to return my watch, and I must in justice to one say, he would have returned it, he was coming back, but the other threatened that he would shoot him if he stirred an inch, that was the taller prisoner Winderback, that would have returned it, Browning said to his companion, I will shoot you if you stir an inch; in favour of the other who had the pistol, I beg leave to mention that he did not fire, though the pistol was loaded: when I lost sight of them by the winding of the road, I proceeded as fast as I could to Wimbly Green, then I saw two men with horses at the leaping bar, I applied to them, they were men from London, I told them of the robbery, they pursued them, and within twenty minutes after I had been robbed I met some gentlemen of Harrow, who told me, some men, supposed to be the persons I described, were apprehended; and when I saw them they were the same; I saw them in a field about a mile and a quarter from the place where I was, Browning was in custody of

               <p>No such thing had happened to your sister? - No, my Lord, but I was rather frightened, and was glad to say anything to get away from them, but they were very civil.</p>

             came up to my assistance; the young man with sore eyes said, he would not come on; Mr. Barlow hit him over the head with a stick; Mr. Barlow searched them both, he found nothing on them but a ram-rod and a knife, they had no arms at all; as I was riding by them, I judged they had dropped something, I did not actually see them; there was a horse pistol found, and in about fifteen minutes the prosecutor came up, it was all done in less than half an hour, we took them to the alehouse, and afterwards to Justice Lamb's; the prosecutor came and said they were the two men that robbed him.</p>

               <p>Were they searched again before the Justice? - The Justice would not have anything to do with them, he delivered them up to the Shepherd's-bush patrol, belonging to Sir Sampson Wright, who searched them, and found nothing upon them; I said I believed I could find every thing in the field, and I took a stick out of one of their hands and stuck it up at the place they were taken from, and I looked in the field; I went from the stick by my horse's tracks, by his foot tracks, it was high grass, and I judged I should find something, and the first thing that I picked up was some shot and some powder, that was about fifteen yards from the place where I took them; the next thing I found was this cutlass, and the gentleman brought the sheath, and said it answered the description.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the sheath, in the road where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Towne. The next thing that I saw was a farmer's man pick up this pistol, it was charged, and he let it off, but what with I do not know, it made a great report, it was primed; going a little way further I saw a little girl pick up this watch close to me, this was all within fifty yards.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I did not recollect the number or the maker's name, nor do I now recollect the number, though I have looked at it several times; it has all the appearance of being mine, I have had it ever since the year 1767; I have not the smallest doubt but it is mine; I believe it to be gold, I was told so, but I cannot swear it is; I remember the two first figures of the number, which are one and three; I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140097"/> not remember the rest, and there is the name of Gordon on the inside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council, to Towne. The prisoners did not attempt to get away? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not this the shooting season? - There are partridges about you? - I do not know, I never carry a gun out.</p>
               <p>There is a good deal of powder and shot in that part of the country? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is common small shot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Browning. On which of us was the ramrod found? - On Winderbank, but there is no place for the ramrod in the pistol.</p>

               <p>I joined in the pursuit of the prisoners, and after they were stopped, we found the things in the same field, within the course of forty yards, we observed a part of the field that the prisoners had gone on by the track of Mr. Towne's horse, I was within two yards of the track, my horse made a fault, and fell down into a gravel pit, so I was not up so soon as Towne, but I saw the things found; I did not see the watch picked up, I searched that man, and took a knife and key from Browning, and the other, Winderbank, had a ramrod, the prosecutor immediately said that is the man that held the pistol to my horse's head, that was Winderbank; and that is the man that stood with the cutlass, and took my watch, that was Browning, and the gentleman said that Winderbank would have given him his watch back, but Browning said he would blow his brains out; I am sure of their persons.</p>
               <p>Towne. I cannot recollect positively which it was he said stood at the horse's head, but I think he said the shortest, Browning, and the other took his money; my recollection in that circumstance differs from Barlow's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Captain, your ship was just arrived, I believe? - She had been arrived a good while from Jamaica.</p>
               <p>How long was you in your outward bound voyage? - About nine months.</p>
               <p>This box of hats was a part of the outward bound voyage? - Yes, they were merchants goods, shipped on board by merchants in Jamaica; I should never have known what it contained, unless it was broke open.</p>
               <p>How long had you been delivering your homeward bound cargo? - I cannot say exactly; I believe about five or six days.</p>
               <p>How many lumpers might you have had on board? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You naturally enough I suppose came on shore as often as you could? - I was on 'Change every day.</p>
               <p>What is the nature of your contract? - To deliver goods in the like good order I received them, unless I meet with damages by sea; I carry the things to the keys, if I deliver any thing short, I must pay for it.</p>
               <p>Court. He is certainly answerable to pay for the delivery of the goods.</p>
               <p>I was going to ask whether the proprietor of the cargo does in fact send down a lighter for it? - No, the people where we land our goods, generally find lighters.</p>
               <p>Do they do that at the expence of the owner, of the master, or of the proprietor? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who pays the expence of carrying them from the ship to the Customhouse? - The proprietor.</p>
               <p>Where was the box? - On board the ship.</p>

               <p>Where were they searched? - They were only felt upon deck as they came from below to see if they had got anything;

             stopped the prisoner, and desired he might be searched again, immediately the mate searched him and found a hat in the back part of his trowsers, and saw it taken from him, pulled out of his trowsers, I immediately looked at this chest and found it broke open, and some of the paper of the hats laying about; he said it was a hat that he had found in the cable tier, and that I had told him it belonged to a passenger.</p>
               <p>Had you said so? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had the care of the delivery of this cargo? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many lumpers had you on board? - I cannot tell you positively the number of the whole, but there were four down with me.</p>
               <p>Had you had any rough weather? - No, no rough weather.</p>
               <p>Steady breezes out and back? - Yes, the chest was taken aboard at Kingston, I remember bringing it with others in the long boat, we had but indifferent weather outwards.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not it very like that this chest carried out and brought back, might not be broken in the carriage? - No, I verily think it could not, it stood in a steady place.</p>
               <p>Did you know what it contained? - After I saw it broke open I knew.</p>
               <p>So should I, but before you saw it broke open you did not know any more than I did? - To be sure I could not see through a deal board.</p>
               <p>Has it always been customary to examine the lumpers as they come up, to see they have not embezzled the goods? - They all know that they shall be searched when they come up. The prisoner had been searched that same day, he had a coat on, or a jacket, I think it was a canvas frock; this box was whole in the morning, and the hat was found inside his trowsers or breeches, I am not clear which; he had both on.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of July about four in the afternoon, the prisoner was in the gun dock at work with some more lumpers, they were called on deck, and some of the witnesses saw something concealed in the prisoner's breeches, I asked him what he had there, he said nothing; I made him unbutton his trowsers, and I pulled a hat out that was concealed; we immediately went down to the gundock, and found the box broken, and several hats missing, and the paper that covered them strewed about, and three more hats were concealed in different places; he said he found it in the cable tier, and that he thought it belonged to some of the passengers.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at work on board this ship, and I found this hat stowed in between two cable tiers, I put it into my trowsers, to ask the mate about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Lamb. Was not a hat found afterwards in a moulded state, which must have laid among the cables for some time? - That was the next day.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to have been in that place for some time past? - No, it was only the dirt.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you first asked him what he had in his breeches, what did he tell you? - He said nothing then, the first time, then afterwards he acknowledged he had something there which he before denied.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140108"/>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Does the invoice mention the number of hats? - I never saw the invoice.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was that box carried out from here to Jamaica or not? - To the best of my recollection I think it was, but I cannot be sure, I am sure it came from Jamaica.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being at the Post-office on the 6th of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the little boy at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening? - About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140110"/>What was his business? - He used to bring up three bags from the Post-office, with letters in them.</p>
               <p>From where? - From Wapping; the bags that he was to bring were Lambert's, Saunders's, and Allen's, there were two bags from each office, and a sack that he brought them in, and the number of the letters, with the money on them.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the name of the receiving office? - Mr. Allen of Wapping; at six I saw the boy there; he always brought three bags up every evening; be brought but one that evening in the room of three, I took and turned his bag out, and inside were these two bags full of letters, and he delivered me one, which I opened, and took out the letters and the money from that one bag; I then asked him where the other two were that he should have brought with him, and he told me he had but that one.</p>
               <p>Did it happen that you took from the boy what he bore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The boy gave you one bag instead of three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do with that one bag? - I opened it, and took out the contents, and put his empty bags with the other empty bags; I then asked him where his other two bags were that he should have brought, and he said he had no more.</p>
               <p>What does that one bag from each office contain? - The letters that were not paid, and a post-paid bag, with a small bag that is on the inside, the money is in the inner bag of all.</p>
               <p>What ought he to have delivered to you that night? - Three small bags, with money and letters, that is, one from each office, the three larger bags were to have been delivered to the stampers of the office, not to me.</p>
               <p>Court. The boy brings the sack to the office, with three bags in them sealed, these are first presented to the Comptroller, who examines the seals, and in his presence they are opened, then they are emptied of the letters which they contain, which are the letters not paid; and the other bags are taken out of them which contain the paid letters and the money; these bags ought to be brought to you, they are sealed also? - It is my duty to see they are brought and sealed, I receive the money and the paid letter.</p>
               <p>The boy brought to you but one of those bags? - No.</p>
               <p>Which of the offices was that from? - I think it was from Lambert's.</p>
               <p>Then he brought none from Allen's or Saunders's? - No, and he said he had no more.</p>
               <p>Upon that what did you do? - I searched his bags, the three larger bags, and kept him till Mr. Potts came to the office.</p>
               <p>What did you find in these larger bags? - I found these two small bags on the inside of the large bags; the bags each contained letters and money; the money was three shillings and five pence; I gave them to our Comptroller; when I found them I kept the boy till the Comptroller came.</p>
               <p>What did the boy say when you found them? - He told me if I would not speak to Mr. Potts he would not do it any more; I asked him what he meant to do with them, he said he did not know; he had them then, he said he would not take the bags any more if I would not tell the Comptroller of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other witnesses? - Only the master of the boy; the boy has acknowledged it to several other people.</p>
               <p>Court. You see the chasm.</p>

            , about the 16th of August, high on nine o'clock, and when we came to turn into Heydon-square there was a cry of thieves different times, I ran and stepped into the middle of the road, I saw two men rushing out, to the best of my knowledge they rushed out of the square near to where she lives, one of them, Gray, had a bundle with a light coloured great coat, I could not perceive Blackhall had any bundle; Tidy attempted to take Gray, he struck Tidy over his nose, and cut open his nose, I pursued him, and the two prisoners ran one after the other, crying stop thief, stop thief, as hard as they could, Blackhall fell in the Kennell, I left him in the kennel and pursued Gray, I never saw him any longer; Gray dropped a bundle when he struck Tidy.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Councel. How far had Gray run? - It might be upwards, not much more than an hundred yards, through a long alley leading into Mansel-street, I never lost sight of him; I was close to him almost, the alley was not dark, but I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - I never lost sight of him till I caught him.</p>
               <p>Had he any unlawful weapon of any sort? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - I did not search him, nor I was not present when he was searched.</p>

               <p>I pursued Blackhall as soon as the alarm was given, I had full sight of him, and pursued him close, and when he just veered round to the left, he fell down, then he kept close to the right, and went round the great square about forty yards further, where I followed him; I did not see any thing with him, I never lost sight of him from the time I began the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had he any bundle? - I never saw any, he was searched, I do not remember anything was found upon him.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of August I was going down the little Minories to fetch some beer, and as I came out of my house, I saw two men standing at the bottom of my neighbour's door, opposite to the door, and that young man in the white waistcoat on the ledge over the door; that young man Blackhall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140115"/> was in Mrs. Abbot's room, the day was withdrawn about an hour, a candle had been lighted; if you recollect the time past, it was a beautiful moon-light night, and in the middle of the square, which is a very small square, there is a lamp which gives a great light, the lamp is fixed on a high post, and Mrs. Abbot's house is opposite to the lamp, her house is to the right hand of my house; seeing them, I gave the alarm of thieves, very loud, with that the man at the bottom ran off immediately; Gray, when I called out thieves, looked very violent round at me, I thought he meant to run at me, but he jumped off the ledge which is what shelters the door, Blackhall made what way he could out of the room, he put his right leg out upon this ledge, I saw him get out, my eye never went off the window till he came out; he tumbled out, he had a dark waistcoat, and atop of it he had a nankeen jacket with long sleeves, and no hat on; there was so much light I could plainly distinguish anybody in the square; I have no doubt of their being the very men distinctly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You gave the alarm as soon as you came out of doors? - I take it from the first of my calling out to the time they were off, it could not be above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Did I understand you right, that lamp stands in the middle of the square, opposite to Mrs. Abbot's house? - This lamp stands in the middle of the square, opposite to my door, and her door being on the other side it stands just opposite to it.</p>
               <p>Then the lamp was between you and the persons? - No, Sir, the lamp is about a yard further from my house than her house is.</p>
               <p>You were a great deal frightened? - Yes, I was indeed.</p>
               <p>How long was it before anybody was brought back to you? - I apprehend about five minutes, but seven minutes was the outside, it could not be above eighty yards; I never saw the men before; I could not be so particular to the two men that stood at the door; I did not see perfectly what it was Gray had, but it was something rolled up under his arm.</p>
               <p>Was there a light in the room? - It seemed so to me.</p>
               <p>What did Gray's bundle contain? - A counterpane, which was all over blood, by knocking a man down.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Council. What is your profession? - I am a coal merchant and wharfinger, I was at my wharf, these barges were moored; I have known the prisoner Bear for some time, and knew his barge had delivered a freight of lime at the next wharf, there is nothing parts it but a row of pailing, this was a large bulk of deals.</p>
               <p>Did Bear know you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He must know that your situation was near to this noise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You looked out, but you could not sufficiently observe, who the persons were that were making a noise? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know the apprentice Hyser; - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Davis? - He works in barges, he worked under Bear.</p>

            , I remember going down the river by myself, I got down to Purfleet, where Bear's barge was loading with lime, I saw no signs of the deals all about the place; I went down to Northfleet, and upon the ballast walk there, I found fifty deals.</p>
               <p>Did you find any person who claimed those deals? - Mr. Green, a carpenter at Northfleet.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate to him, that the deals had been taken from your wharf? - I did, after he acknowledged that he bought them of the prisoner Bear.</p>
               <p>Could you speak with any certainty as to the deals so lost at your wharf? - When I saw the deals, I knew them to be like the deals that were in our wharf.</p>
               <p>Then you speak to the likeness? - Yes, I brought them up, and immediately upon their arrival, they were shewn to Mr. Remnant, and to Mr. Jameson; I left Northfleet at eleven o'clock, and returned at two, and communicated it to my father.</p>

               <p>Did he say that he had them in a barge? - I do not remember, I believe he said he had them in the barge: on Sunday after service in the afternoon, I walked down to see where these battens were, and when I saw them, I saw they were deals and not battens, and therefore I never put my fingers upon them.</p>

               <p>Now tell me one honest day's work, that you did for any human being in that six months? - I never took any thing from any body while I was there, I should have been there now if my master had not sell out with him.</p>
               <p>Can you state the name of any human being, that you have done one honest day's work for these six months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Hyser. Why do not you answer my friend by asking him the same question?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Fielding. I have held many briefs of yours during that time.</p>
               <p>Court. What was you to have for this? - I did not know I was to have any thing, I dare say they would give me something.</p>
               <p>Do you know what Davies was to have for it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did Davies and you know that these deals were to be moved before you were called up that night? - I did not know, and I dare say Davies did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140119"/>Upon your oath, did you or did you not know that these deals did not belong to your master, that he had not bought them, or was not employed to carry them away, but that you were doing a wrong thing? - Yes, Sir, I have owned that there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Remnant. Are you able to speak with any precision to the property? - The deals that were returned were the same sort that were in the barge.</p>
               <p>Only the same sort; can you say you believe they were the same? - We know them to be the same sort by the marks at the ends of them; they bore the same marks at the ends that the remaining ones bore.</p>
               <p>Court. And did the numbers tally? - The numbers that we were short were thirty-seven, but there were only thirty-one returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have said very fairly that you believe these to be the same sort of deals? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they narrow deals? - Yes, two and a half Frederick stand; there were upwards of five thousand in one ship; I did not take the whole of the cargo; they were distributed among half a dozen or eight people; they are marked with red chalk, or red paint; I never saw them marked in England; they are marked in the country where they are cut.</p>
               <p>Then the whole five thousand had the same mark as these? - I believe they had.</p>
               <p>So that the deals, for any thing you know, may be the property of somebody else of the same cargo? - It is possible they may.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Saint Giles's, High-street.</p>

               <p>Do you know Hyser? - I was always very suspicious of him when he was with the prisoner; he was turned away when he was with Bear for theft.</p>
               <p>Phelps. With respect to the boy, he robbed my craft of two shirts and two pair of stockings; he has a very bad character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Bear called six more witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I am the brother of the prisoner, I came home on the evening of the robbery between eleven and twelve, and my brother was in bed, I went to bed to him, I am sure he did not go out that night any more.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Great Eagle-street Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>Court. What night was this? - The 25th of July.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the 25th of July? - I am no scholar, any further than I got a gentleman to put it down to the best of my knowledge, my uncle put it down.</p>
               <p>How came that? - Because my brother being in trouble, he put it down for a memorandum, it was on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What night was it you was robbed? - Between twelve and one on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. When was it you desired your uncle to put this down? - The day after, or in the course of the week.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. From the evidence there does not seem to be that sort of violence that will constitute a highway robbery, it is a felony.</p>

On Friday night, about a quarter after eleven, I was standing at one Mrs. Taylor's door, who keeps a chandler's shop, a man came and knocked at the door facing that, which is a farrier's shop, Mrs. Taylor says, what do you want there, says he, I have been robbed of my money, Mrs. Taylor says, you have not been robbed there, and I made answer, and said, good man, you could not be robbed here, for that is a farrier's shop; there is nobody lives there; with that, he says, I am sure I have been robbed here, then, says he, I have been robbed some where about here; says I, do you know who robbed you, why, says he, it was a tall woman, with a dark complexion, and her hair was very curly here (and he put his hand to his head, as I may do now) and a man; I said, should you know the party again, I do not know whether I should or no, says he; but are you sure they robbed you, says I; yes, says he, because I felt a woman's hand in my pocket, and she slid it away, and the man put his leg out, and he tripped me up, and I fell down, and I could not see any more of them; with that the prisoner, whose name is

Now as to you prisoners, I think it right that these persons who have been the hearers of your defence, and of your trial, should also be the hearers of your sentence, for this Court has always made it a rule, wherever they detect persons committing the crime of perjury in order to clear prisoners, to punish those prisoners who set up such defences in the severest manner; had you been convicted of this offence unaggravated with the crime of perjury, the Court would probably have thought, that whipping each of you, with six, or at most twelve months confinement in the house of correction, would have been a sufficient punishment of your offence, but the Court consider your perjured defence, in which opinion I must entirely concur with the Jury, so great an aggravation of your guilt, that the Court must pass an additional punishment upon you; therefore the sentence of the Court is, that you and each of you be <rs id="t17850914-96-punish479" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>I saw the prisoner come out of the house of the prosecutor with a bundle in his hand, on Sunday the 28th of August, as nearly as I can recollect, about half past three, or a little before four; I was within a yard, he passed me very quick.</p>
               <p>Did he run or walk? - He ran, and I ran after him through several turnings about Shoe-lane, till he came to New-street, and I followed him down another court into Shoe-lane, near a public-house, but I lost sight of him near half a minute, and I was informed he was gone into this public-house, that was the Eagle and child; I went to inform the prosecutor's father-in-law, and he and I, with a constable, came up to the prosecutor: when we went in I saw the prisoner run out at the door that he went in at, and that we went in at; he was the same person I pursued; we were at the back part of the house wh en I saw him run out; he was pursued, and ran into a chandler's-shop about a dozen doors from the public-house, and the constable and two or three more followed him, and took him there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you by profession? - A hair-dresser, I live in Bell-Savage yard, Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Are you a master hair dresser; - I live with my father.</p>
               <p>Is your father a hair-dresser? - Yes, I am not a master, I am journeyman to him.</p>
               <p>Were you alone in Fleet-market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know this man before? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your sight before you lost him? - Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>How long was he out of your sight? - A whole minute.</p>
               <p>So that a man passing quickly by you, and who was in your sight about a minute, you swear to him? - I think I can.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand you have some doubt? - I think I can positively swear to it.</p>
               <p>Can you swear in a case that affects a man's life? - That was the person that I saw for a minute, one person is like another, I should be loth to be too positive, I can only say to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How often was this young man examined before a magistrate? - I do not know, I was not at the examination; I was not known, they did not know who I was, he did not know me notwithstanding I lived in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>How did they find you out to go before the Grand Jury? - It was mentioned at a shop in the neighbourhood, and they said the person that gave information to Mr. Cover was absent, and they did not know who it was; and the shopkeeper said I can tell you who it was, it was young Chitty; that was about three days after the Sunday that the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>When was he committed? - I heard the day after.</p>
               <p>How long might the person that you watched in the Eagle and Child have continued there, while you went for Mr. Cover and the constable? - About ten minutes, Mr. Cover lives a few doors from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>You never shewed yourself to Kelly on the Sunday? - After the person was taken into custody I went about my business; I am quite a stranger to these matters; I did not know whether it was material or no.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not know that Mr. Cover did not know you personally? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140136"/> did not know but what he did, I knew him, and I thought he knew me.</p>

               <p>Did you find any property at the Eagle and Child? - I saw a handkerchief with halfpence in it, but I cannot say whose possession it was in, he was fastened in the room, I believe the constable broke the door, he said he had nothing there but what was his own, and denied knowing any thing about it, and said we might search his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were his lodgings searched? - Triflingly searched, and there was nothing found, there was a pistol and vast quantities of keys hanging about, he denied at first giving any account of himself, at last he said he was a locksmith.</p>

               <p>I live in Blackhorse-alley, Fleet-market, I was standing at master's door, on Sunday in the afternoon, and two men came running up the court, there was a gentleman in a blue coat and red cape, running after them, that was Mr. Chitty; he said he saw the two men come out of the tallow chandlers, they ran up the court, and they had a bundle under each of their arms, and a stick in their hands, they ran up Fleet-street, we ran after them, there we lost one of them, we ran up King's-head-court, there we met one of them coming by the King's Printing Office, with a bundle under his arm, I am quite sure that is one of them; a man in half mourning cried that is the gentleman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140137"/> then he ran back through Robinhood-court, and I saw him go into the Eagle and Child in Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>I lived at the Eagle and Child when this affair happened, but I am come away since; I saw the prisoner in the Eagle and Child, he had a bundle in his hand, and put it under his coat, and when he saw somebody come in doors he threw it down.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come in? - No; I cannot say who took up the bundle, I ran out with the mob, I know the bundle if I see it, I am sure this man at the bar is the man that had the bundle, he had a kind of half mourning coat when he came to our house, but he changed it when he got in his room.</p>

               <p>Between three and four in the afternoon I heard a noise, and I went down to see, and I saw Mr. Cover and Mr. Chitty talking together, and they asked me to go with them, I said we had better have a constable, so I fetched Mr. Rush the barber, in Shoe-lane, so we went to the Eagle and Child, and we walked backwards, the tap room is backwards, we turned ourselves about, but we could not see the person we were looking for, while we turned about, somebody said there he goes, there he goes; Mr. Clare run first after him, when he first went into the house where he lodged, he locked himself in, we went and searched for him and found him in the two pair of stairs, and the door was fast, we could make nobody hear there; we were going up further and somebody says he is in that room I believe, it was some child; the constable said if you will not open it, I will break it open, and the constable forced the door, he was stood up in his shirt sleeves the prisoner said what is all this about, says I we came to look after such thieves as you, and I charged the constable with him, we searched the house and found a little bunch of keys, and there was a box, I insisted upon having it opened, there was a pistol hanging over the chimney, there were several old locks in the box, and small keys in bunches, then he was taken away.</p>
               <p>What coat did he put on? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Clare. He put on a kind of a sky blue coat, and there was an old great coat that hung over the other.</p>
               <p>He was without a coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the coat he had taken off? - I cannot tell, I did not find it, I did not look for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They searched the room when they came in, and they found no other coat but the one that hung up, and a great coat, I never had a grey coat in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The constable looked expressly for that coat did not he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>(The halfpence handed up to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is there particular in this tying up? - I always tie them up in half a sheet of white brown paper.</p>
               <p>How do other people tie them up? - In coarse I believe, I did not tie up this blue paper; I can take my oath these are my tying up.</p>
               <p>How, how? - I generally put sixpenny-worth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140138"/> worth of farthings in every five shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was examined before the Alderman? - Yes, I there swore these bundles were my tying up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That young woman generally does tie them up.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 28th, I went into the Eagle and Child, and called for a pint of beer and the paper, I did not see the girl; immediately as I went in a man got up from his seat, and went hastily out of the house, I went and sat in his seat, I went out after I had drank my beer, I went into my own room and laid down, and pulled off my coat and hung it up; they knocked at the door, I opened it directly, they searched the bed and every place, they took down a brace of pistols I had to clean for a gentleman who was here last night, but he was obliged to go into the country; at last the gentleman said he was sure I was the person, and I had a grey coat on, they looked all about and found no grey coat, I know nothing of it, if I had been guilty, I should not have gone to the house I had used in the neighbourhood where I was known.</p>
               <p>Court to Clare. Was there any other man like the prisoner at Brown's house,? - No, Sir, there was nobody in the box but himself when I went in, there is one box with a hole in it four or five inches square, that looks to the street, the prisoner sat in that box; I never lost sight of the person that came out of Brown's house, there was nobody but himself before me, that went into the house where he was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow observed, that there might be amongst these half-pence a considerable quantity of bad half-pence, which would reduce the value.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, with submission to your Lordship, I have a witness that was in the Eagle and Child when I came in.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I will hear the evidence of that witness, though a little out of course.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Do you know the Eagle and Child? - Perfectly well, I was there about four in the afternoon on Sunday the 28th of August, I went in to call for a pint of beer, I staid, I suppose, about five minutes, when the prisoner came and called for a pint of beer, and sat down in a seat where a man had just gone from, just as I had come in and sat down.</p>
               <p>Did you see that other man come in? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did you go out of the house? - Just about four?</p>
               <p>How long were you there before the prisoner came in? - I look upon it to be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the other man go out? - Yes, just as this prisoner sat down.</p>
               <p>Did you see any bundle? - None at all, not till after the prisoner came in a second time, the prisoner went out a little time after the other man.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay out? - I look upon it about five minutes before he was brought in by the constable; I did not see anybody follow him out, there was a disturbance when he came in; there was a search for a bundle; somebody said a man had come in and left a bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care what you say; will you swear that before this prisoner went out of the house there was no bustle in the house? - As the prisoner was going there came in several people, and made a piece of work just about the time he went out, and in five minutes he was brought in; I did not see any bustle before he went out.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Chitty there, or the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140139"/> constable? - I saw the constable and Mr. Cover.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did they not come in before the prisoner went out? - I cannot say, I did not take notice, I cannot take upon me to say, I do not remember any thing about it.</p>
               <p>How long was the other man gone before they came in? - He went before the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>How long was he gone before Mr. Cover came in? - I suppose near ten minutes in the whole.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Cover. Look at that young man? - I have been looking at him, I really do not think he was there, there were several women, and a man or two like a smith, but I do not think he was there at the time; I have no knowledge of his face.</p>
               <p>Clare. I did not take notice of this witness; I took notice of two or three women in the box, and two or three men with them, but who they were I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I live in the Strand, keep I a sale-shop; the prisoner came to my house about five weeks ago with a silver handle of a knife for sale, I asked him how he came by it, he said it was his own property, an old family knife, it was of no service to him, and he had broke it up for the sake of the silver; he made a creditable appearance, and I purchased it of him, and he came again two or three days following, with another handle, either knife or fork; he came without his hat, and a plate in his hand, which convinced me he lived in the neighbourhood, to look at some things we had for sale; when I found his residence, then I sent to Mr. Cox, and in the evening I called at Mr. Cox's, and asked the prisoner if he knew me, he answered no; I then produced these handles, and asked if he knew them, he denied having any knowledge of them; the box was sent for in the room where he was, and it was opened by himself, and there were some empty bottles, and a spoon, and two other knife handles, and some other things of inferior value, which I do not recollect; he immediately begged Mr. Cox's pardon, and said he had the spoon to take physic with; upon which Mr. Cox sent for a constable, and sent him to the Compter; he gave no reason for the knife handle.</p>
               <p>Produce the knife handle that you had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140140"/> from the prisoner? - I cannot tell which it is, I cannot positively swear to them, they being cut up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. When Mr. Essex came to my house we sent for the prisoner, and Mr. Essex accused him with these things, which he denied afterwards; I sent for the box, and he had the key of it; he opened it, and there was in it a spoon, engraved with Mr. Cole's name, Mitre Tavern, which is my property, I succeeded Mr. Cole; and there were the handles of two knives silver, and some bottles, they were my knife handles; he seemed to deny it, but I asked him what he did with the third knife handle that he offered to sell to Mr. Essex, he said, one of them was his; there were butter and cheese, and candles, and bottles, and several things.</p>
               <p>(The spoon and the knife-handle deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You say the name Cole is on the spoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Mitre tavern is a very old tavern I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe it is the custom of that house to serve all in plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many of these spoons have been sold or lost at times? - Yes, some, but not lately.</p>
               <p>You do not know the knife handles from any thing but their resembling the others? - No.</p>
               <p>To Essex. You deal in old silver as well as other articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Sir, I had the spoon up to take physic, there was physi c in my box, I had the spoon three days in the house, the box lay on one side where I used to clean the knives and they dropped in.</p>
               <p>How came you to carry them to Mr. Essex to sell? - No, I do not acknowledge that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Cox. The key was in his box? - He lays in the room below stairs by the door, there is never a lock to it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Skinner, on Monday the 15th, in the morning, I found the ware-house doors open, I took particular care to lock it on Monday, on Tuesday morning I found it open again, and while we were looking about, the patrol came and asked if we had lost any tobacco, we could not miss that particularly.</p>
               <p>(The tobacco produced by the constable.)</p>
               <p>Constable. I have had it at the watch-house ever since.</p>
               <p>Brooks. It is damaged tobacco, and over pressed, it has laid a long while with us, and it is dry.</p>
               <p>Wilson. I swear to the tobacco, it was a particular hogshead that we could not manufacture, it was not to the sample, it was rather damaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140143"/>But there might have been other damaged tobacco? - Yes, but it has gone through my hands so often, that I am clear in this tobacco, I could have said it was his tobacco if there were fifty hogsheads.</p>
               <p>Do you know the bag? - I know particularly well moving that tobacco, and I covered it with that bag; I know the bag going through my hands so many times, but there is no particular mark, I cannot swear to the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Council. You say very fairly you cannot swear to the bag? - No.</p>
               <p>If you had seen this unmanufactured tobacco, where it might have been mixed with a great many other casks, would you have ventured to swear this to be your master's? - I think I could.</p>
               <p>You might distinguish this from that which was not damaged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what does this differ from any other hogshead of damaged tobacco? - There might be some like it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had fifty bags of them, I cannot swear to the bags, I know the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Mr. Skinner, I shall not despair after this, to hear a man swear to a tumbler of water; be so good as to give some reasons to the Jury? - This tobacco was sent to me on the 15th of November, and opened in the month of November, and there it has laid ever since, and there is never a manufacturer in London would keep this tobacco so long in the state I have done; I can swear to it among twenty hogsheads, I certainly know it as well as if it was a fixture to my house, and marked.</p>
               <p>Now you argue that no other manufacturer in London would have kept it in that state? - Because it is an article they use more than I do; this is a tobacco for snuff, I have more of this sort than I could use.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to swear this is not Fletcher and Yeates's? - No, it was not, because it was in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>I do not like to treat a man of character, as I am obliged to treat you; do you know, of your own knowledge, that it is not Fletcher and Yeates's; their warehouse as I recollect, is within two or three hundred yards of your place? - No, it is more than that.</p>
               <p>I ask you as a man of conscience, knowing that they had at that time tobacco of that sort, can you say it was not this? - This is dry.</p>
               <p>Do you know theirs was not dry? - I do not.</p>
               <p>For all you know, they might have had some precisely like this? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>I do believe that you have the most conscientious persuasion it is your tobacco? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I will be bound for it you have; but I must advert to my old course, I see there is no discriminating; will you venture to swear that is your tobacco? - I will.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, in what does that differ from the tobacco, which you know was in possession of Fletcher and Yeates? - Because the case was packed up loose.</p>
               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I know this tobacco by the quality of it, I believe it to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Supposing a man had been found with this tobacco, at the warehouse of Fletcher and Yeates, could you have sworn then it was Mr. Skinner's? - No Sir, no such thing.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming along, and a person asked me to take this to Islington for a shilling, they had some in a handkerchief, and they asked me to put some into my pocket, he was a stranger to me; I asked him his name, and he told me his name was Farmer, I could not rightly tell, but I was glad to earn a shilling, I am as innocent as a child.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a clockmaker in Shoe-lane, I work with Samuel Row, who lives the corner of Harp-alley; I am not come with a design to vindicate the conduct of the prisoner, nor do I know any thing of the robbery; I am come to let you know that I am sensible there is a man here that would not be here if it was not for the reward; a few days after the prisoner was committed, Woodward took an opportunity while I was in the shop with him, I am a shop-mate of his, to propose bringing ten pounds to me to go into the country, to be in partnership with him; this was after the prisoner was committed, he said I seemed surprised how he should come by ten pounds, he told me if I would keep it a secret he would let me know; he said he had an affair in hand that would bring in some money, upon which I promised secresy, not knowing the business; at this time nobody was present but us two; he then told me, he had stopped a thief, I observed to him I did not think it was in his power, because I thought he was so slight; he then acknowledged that Woodward took the watch out of his hand, and gave it to the owner, and that there was forty pounds reward, and ten pounds from the parish, and that he and the Irishman would have it between them, I told him that I thought it was more likely that the prosecutor and constable would have the reward; he said that he knew better how to go about the business this time than he did the last, alluding to a similar circumstance, and that the patrol and the constable, and the prosecutor would have none of the money, for they did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>How came you to think this would be at all material to the prisoner? - As I was convinced in my own mind that he was actuated by a bad principle.</p>
               <p>No bad principle at all if he speaks the truth.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Has this witness misbehaved? - He was one of those at the Pitt's head that was abusing Woodward, and called him blood-hound, and I told him yesterday that if he persisted in that behaviour in order to intimidate an evidence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140145"/> I would bring him into court, and he desisted upon that.</p>
               <p>Woodward. Upon this they they have discharged me from my business.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He has been with me once or twice to get what he could out of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Was Woodward attending here upon the court when this man insulted him? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>This man knew that he was attending for that purpose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear Woodward to that and I will commit this man to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Woodward. Please your Lordship, he has been about to all the masters of the trade to hinder me from business.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very imporper conduct, but not within the jurisdiction of the court? - We were in the publichouse yesterday getting a little refreshment, and he came in with two or three more, and he stood up, and after that he called out of the window as far as ever he could see me, ah! you blood-hound, you blood-hound, and the people got round so, he has done all he could to hinder me from attending upon the court.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be committed to Newgate.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been in Court all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you know of this horse that your brother bought? - The prisoner went by the name of Jones in our country, and he called upon me one morning, he had a horse that would suit, I went with him, but he wanted to sell the horse, this farmer wanted to try him, and he put him into a cart and drew him, but they did not deal, and I believe the very same day was fair day, and the next day my brother appointed to meet with him, and Jones recommended my brother to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So he did this as publicly as any man could do, for he took you for a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. LANGHORN sworn.</p>
               <p>We know you are a very considerable dealer in horses? - My father keeps a repository.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - We have sold for him within these two years a great number of horses, and likewise he has bought several in the fair way of dealing.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you known the prisoner? - About six or eight months.</p>
               <p>When did he deal with you last? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>What name did he go by? - Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Court. Is Aldridge here? - No, it is his selling day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mr. Horam whether he bought the horse by day or night? - By day, the 26th day on the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sold him the horse on the 25th, at the Five Bells, at Shaftsbury, where I always use to quarter.</p>
               <p>Horam. I was not in the house that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, we did apply to put of this trial till the next Sessions.</p>
               <p>(The Jury desired to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I think Gentlemen you ought to take it into your consideration when you go out, that it is too much for us here to ask him how he came by the horse, we cannot put such a question to the prisoner, we ought not to do it; at the same time he has made affidavit that there is a person he bought it of, and he has requested<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140147"/> that he might have time to bring that person here, but the Court in my absence refused to put off the trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The man made affidavit with a subpoenae annexed to it, for a Mr. Grassman by name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. The reason why the Court would not put off the trial was, he swore that he was advised, he was material witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Advised and believes; he was advised by me that such a witness would be a very material one, therefore he believed it to be true.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew some time, and returned with a verdict</p>

             the constable clapped two of them on the shoulders, and said what do you do here; then I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my box with half a guinea in it, and a little bit of a receipt for an illness, this is the receipt and box; I swear to the box, I had it when I went to church.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of the prisoner being the woman? - I am sure the woman that was committed was the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. There were a great croud round you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was the person that was taken in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say about this? - Just as I say now, when they went to search her, I said it was not she that had the hat on.</p>
               <p>You said before the woman she was a pockfretten woman? - That was the person the man found the box upon; but that was the woman that said I pulled her cloak, I did not particularly mind the other woman.</p>
               <p>- ISAAC sworn.</p>
               <p>I attended this charity sermon, I happened to go into the church, just at the time that the hymn was beginning to be sung by Mrs. Wrighten, and I saw a shuffling piece of work between this lady and this woman, I took out two women, one with one arm and one with the other, and the box lay down just by the prisoners feet, I cannot pretend to say from which the box fell, I said before the Justice, I believe it fell on her side, and that it might drop from her.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you take the prisoner for? - This lady said they were about her picking her pockets.</p>
               <p>Jury. You knew them before? - I have seen them, Sir, I cannot say how often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. If I understand you right, it was only a conjecture of yours, that it dropped from that woman? - That is all.</p>
               <p>That is what you said before the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not directly charge the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Isaac. Had not you seized these two women for something, before this lady made a complaint? - Yes, when I heard the noise, I took them both out together.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three women with whom she had worked, who all gave her a good character.</p>

            , I told him I did, and that I heard he was in trouble, which I was very sorry for, never hearing the like before; but says he what can I do, I am a soldier, and all my necessaries are in pawn; and I said what can I do in the affair, why says he, as you are a house-keeper, if you will be so kind as to sign a note for twenty shillings and pay me five shillings of it, as you know him, I will say no more about it; and I took a second consideration, and I thought he must be a very bad man, so I thought I had better pay for a pot of beer and go my ways.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, all this is a fact? - Yes, Sir, it is.</p>

               <p>Are you a soldier? - Yes, I went to the Crown along with another young man, he told me he could help me to the other man that ran away from us.</p>
               <p>Did any of that conversation pass which Mr. Laney has sworn now? - So far as this, he said he was sorry, and I said I was sorry; but no money was required, never a word passed about the twenty shillings, and five shillings down; I never made any offer of that kind about a note, I went the next morning and told Mr. Foxhead about the circumstance, and we went to Laney's house the next day, and there we saw the other man that run away from us, we were affraid to take him then.</p>
               <p>Court to Laney. Did either of these prisoners ever lodge with you? - Neither of them, Underwood has worked for me, and did so the same week, on the Monday; I know nothing of the other.</p>
               <p>What man was that that was at your house, when the other witness came? - I cannot pretend to say who it was that might come there, I was present at the time, there was a man that came to buy a pound of old nails, and I sold him some for two pence halfpenny, but who he was, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Foxhead. Who did you see there? - I saw the man that was with this man, I am pretty sure it was him that was in Mr. Laney's back kitchen, he turned his back; and I said to him in the presence of Mr. Laney, young man, you was with them, but I have not taken you.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer and constable at Guildhall; on the 2d of July last, I saw the prisoner Bradbury, with a piece of wood on his shoulder, and the other in company; I saw them under the Piazza; we had lost one piece about two days before, I saw Bradbury take the piece of timber, and put it on his shoulder, the other was in company all the time; I followed them into Aldermanbury, I got a man to assist me, I took him, and he threw down the timber. The prisoners talked together some time before they took the piece.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner Bradbury alone move this timber, and put it on his shoulder? - He took it without any assistance.</p>
               <p>Did you see the other man do anything? - No further than go away quite close together in company, he was rather before him.</p>
               <p>Did any of them say anything? - The other man said, what do you take me for, what have I done? as soon as I collared him.</p>

               <p>I called at Mr. Blackburn's with an order on the 24th of June, the prisoner at the bar came in while I was there, he said he wanted to look at some low priced mens silk stockings; Mr. Blackburn reached them down, he said he wanted two or three dozen, Mr. Blackburn said he had them at the trimmers, and should have them in the course of an hour or two, accordingly the prisoner left an order directed to No. 1, in Bow-lane; I let Mr. Blackburn have some of the stockings that the prisoner had, I sold him a dozen of mens white silk stockings, and six pair of womens; and the six pair of mens he parcelled out, and I saw Mr. Blackburn go out of the shop with some stockings; I took the prisoner in Saint George's Fields the day the balloon went up, about eleven weeks ago, I think it was the Wednesday or Thursday; after he had been in the shop, there was another gentleman with him, he came back with me, and I asked him what he had done with the stockings, and he told me he had pawned six pair, six pair he had at his lodgings, and a dozen and half he had left with Captain Richardson, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140154"/> brought him to Mr. Blackburn's shop, and when the constable took charge of him, he would not give any direction to this Captain Richardson; in examining his pockets the constable found in my presence a duplicate for six pair of stockings, and he had two or three bills upon him on some of the first houses in town that were past due.</p>

               <p>You heard when I agreed with Mr. Blackburn for the prices? - There was no agreement at all, you said you was not particular to prices; you left an order for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Blackburn. What time was it when you brought them stockings home to my lodgings? - Five o'clock, but I understood they were for the Captain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the stockings in the shop; I told him to bring them to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you sell the stockings to him in the shop? - No.</p>

               <p>Court.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Jefferys, in Thames-street, he is an ironmonger; I first saw him with this tobacco about him, opposite to Dice's-key, between one and two; to the best of my knowledge and judgment, there were twenty four or twenty five pound, there was as much as would fill a large hay basket; my master stopped him, the tobacco was concealed in his coat, and his pockets, and up as high as his breast, he had a great coat on, it was in the pockets of his great coat, and in the pockets of the other, it was buttoned up between his great coat and waistcoat; when my master stopped him, he asked what he had there, he said he had a little tobacco from on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Did he say what ship? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he describe what sort of a ship? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he use he word ship, or lighter? - Ship; my master charged the watch with him; I went by my master's orders to get a constable, and during the time he came down, I assisted him in taking the tobacco from the prisoner; the prisoner said, pray let me throw the tobacco into a passage, which leads to our house by a private door, but that was objected to; I told him not to throw it in, but throw it out before the watchman who had charge of him, which he rather seemed to object to; and when the tobacco was all thrown out from his clothes, I went and fetched a basket from out of the shop, and put it in, and I had much to do to press it down, and after pressing it, and kneeling upon it, there was more than would fill the basket; the prisoner very much objected to be tied.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How happened you to be out at that time in the morning? - I was with my master.</p>
               <p>What were you doing? - My master had a few friends at his country house, and in going home with his friends he was insulted by the watch, he told the watchman he did not understand his meaning in being insulted; he went home with his friends, and came back to his house, and begged of me to go with him to the watch-house, I went to the watch-house, and enquired into the ill behavour, and ill treatment of the watchmen towards him, they did not seem to pay any attention to what he said; coming to the door I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was anybody with you when you met the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Where is your master's country house? - At Hackney.</p>
               <p>What time did you return? - Near ten.</p>
               <p>A little jolly? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>How had he spent his time till half past one? - In going home with his friends, in coming back, and going to the watch-house; he went home with his friends to Water-lane, near the Custom-house, he returned between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>What did he do with himself from that time till half past one? - He went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was not your master out of humour that night? - I do not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Was he or was he not out of humour? - He was not Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, he was in as good humour as he is generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140157"/>Then this good humoured man, at half past ten went out settling a dispute; do you mean to swear that he was in perfect good humour, and that he staid three hours and a half? - He was two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Then this good humoured man was two hours and a half settling a dispute, you admit that? - Well then, Sir, it shall be so.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this prisoner stating, that somebody had stolen this tobacco, and that he ran after them and picked it up? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he bailed afterwards? - I heard so.</p>
               <p>What Judge bailed him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it was one of the Judges of the King's Bench? - I presume nobody else can.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your master saying anything about paying the piper for all this? - What is paying the piper?</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him say any thing of that import? - No.</p>
               <p>He never did say it? - No, not till the transaction happened.</p>
               <p>Ho! ho! how long have you been an ironmonger, they have spoiled you very much! did not your master say something of this sort, that the watchman having used him very ill, he had resolved to make the prisoner suffer for it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You swear he did not? - I will, he never said he would take up any watchman, or make a watchman suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Was not you in liquor? - I never was any ways disguised in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did this transaction happen as you have stated it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person on whom the tobacco was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>HUMPHRY JEFFRYS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an ironmonger, I have nothing more to say than what my young man has related; on the 3d of July my friends came to see me at Hackney, and staid till ten; at ten I arrived in Thames-street, I then went with them to Water-lane, and went from their house between ten and eleven, and I saw some very suspicious people; I says to one of the watchmen, I wish you would give some little attendance, for I see some people that appear very suspicious; this is a watchman whose name I do not know, but I gave information to the constable; his reply was, d - n you, I do not know anybody looks more suspicious than yourself, and if you do not get away I will send you to the Compter or the watch-house, and I thought he would; I told him I would pay him another visit, and I went to my friends, and staid half an hour, then I came back, and saw this watchman off his stand, and two men attempting to steal something; I then went and took my young man, the last witness, to the watch-house, to make a complaint to the constable of the night, and to the watchmen, and he went with me to the watch-house, and when we got there he was gone his rounds, and I staid there till he came in, and in coming back I stopped the prisoner at the bar, very much stuffed, I imagined he had something that was not his own property; ther e was nobody with him.</p>
               <p>At that time he was quite a stranger to you? - Yes, I never saw him before, to the best of my knowledge; I stopped him near Dice key gate-way, he was walking towards the Custom-house, I asked him what he had there, he said a little tobacco; I asked him where he got it from, he said from on board a ship; I charged him with the watch, who was near me, he went into a passage, and there he begged to unload himself; I saw the tobacco pulled from him, he had it all about him, particularly about the skirts of his great coat.</p>
               <p>Had he any between his coat and waistcoat? - I am not particular to that, I gave charge of him and the tobacco; my young man put it into a basket, like a hay basket, and he had a good deal of trouble to put it in, but that may be the lightness of it, the constable has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was not till the third examination that the prisoner was committed, did you attend at the first and second? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140158"/>Did you tell your story? - Yes, my servant did not attend; I told my story as I have done now, with the same particulars, the first, second, and third time.</p>
               <p>You swore to your account, did not you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you at the second? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive notice of the news of the persons that would be bail? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was he going the direct way to the Custom-house? - No, I think not, the direct way is the foot path, he was in the road way.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was he or was he not in the direct road to the Custom-house? - He was not, because he was not on the foot path.</p>
               <p>We have had evidence that you are a good natured man, do not put yourself in a passion, I will have an answer if I sit here till midnight; upon your oath, was he in the direct way to the Custom-house? - Upon my oath I do not believe that to be the direct road for a foot passenger, because he was behind the corner of some buildings.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, whether that street is not the direct road to the Custom-house? - It is certainly; but I will not be brow beat by any man.</p>
               <p>Nor am I so young in my profession to be brow beat by the greatest ironmonger in the kingdom; the man was in Thames-street, and Thames-street was in the way to the Custom-house? - Yes; when it was weighed it weighed twelve pounds and three quarters, but from the appearance it was more.</p>
               <p>Was that cask out of which it was taken ever weighed or no? - I know nothing of the cask.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was weighed or no? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What sort of tobacco was it? - It was tied up as tobacco generally appears out of ships.</p>
               <p>Unmanufactured? - I am not a judge of it.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know what it is called by those that are? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Have you looked at it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>How soon must this man have come within the view of the watchmen of the Custom-house if he had gone on? - In ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of himself before the Mayor? - That he saw a man drop it, and he ran and took it up, and was going to carry it to the Custom-house, and he produced a white bag.</p>
               <p>Would it have been the cause of this man's discharge from his employment as a watchman if he had been found absent without such an excuse as that he was going to carry tobacco to the Custom-house? - I am so much unacquainted with the Custom-house business that I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me such as comes from abroad? - I only saw it separated about; my young man and him took it up, he did not come the foot path, but turned into that corner.</p>

               <p>Was not you near enough to observe whether he observed you or not? - I do not think he did see me; he might see the watchman opposite.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did I hear right that you do not think he saw you? - I think not, at the time he was passing; the constable has had the tobacco ever since.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jeffrys sent his young man to the watch-house; I came to the watch-house, Mr. Jeffrys was there with the prisoner; Mr. Jeffrys seemed to be very troublesome, and asked what watchmen I had on; he sat there two hours, and was very troublesome; indeed I went down when he said the tobacco was in Mr. Jeffry's passage; he shewed me the tobacco; I have had it ever since; it is now in Court. (Produced.) it is now unmanufactured as the other was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe this is like a great many thousands of hogsheads, so that if you had lost it out of your pocket last night, you could not have sworn to it today? - Not at all, I have not compared it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140159"/>Fennel. The prisoner told me going along, that he had got the tobacco from on board a ship, that is all that he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Jeffrys had been at the watch-house some time? - He was there a long while, and when I came back he said the watchmen had been using him very ill, I took the watchman off for his abuse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jeffrys was a little out of humour that night? - I believe he was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>He is not a good natured man in his cups? - I have been a constable in that part three years, I do my duty as much as I can.</p>
               <p>Then you would not by choice, if you had a parcel of stolen goods, come through your beat? - We do our duty as well as we can, I belong to the same employ as the prisoner; I had the first charge of the lighter that evening, it was all safe at twelve, no tobacco was missing; in the morning the head of one of the hogsheads was out, and about six pounds gone; I could not know the tobacco again; all tobaccos that come to the keys are in that way; the ship watchman was not there at six in the morning; I have known the prisoner three years.</p>
               <p>Is Thames-street the nearest way from that lighter to the Custom-house? - Much handler than going through the keys for the casks, I should have come that way myself.</p>
               <p>I need hardly ask you what his general reputation was, was it a good one? - I never heard any complaint in the world; he has a pretty place in the India House; I do not believe this quantity of tobacco could come out of that hole.</p>
               <p>There is a vast deal of this tobacco smuggled, as we all know? - Yes, it is a common practice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Do you know on Saturday night the 9th of July, how the house was left? - Every thing was left safe, all the watches were in the shop, we supped in the shop, and when we went to bed, about five minutes before twelve, every thing was safe; we were not alarmed in the night; my master called me about four, he got up about three, the shop was broke open, and all the watches gone; the lead-light was taken out of the back window, and taken into the garden; there was no casement; I am sure the light was there when I went to bed safe, at dusk they got over two or three people's gardens out of Christopher's-alley; there are two walls that the person got over, they are as high as that wainscotting.</p>

               <p>After the robbery at Mr. Moore's did he give you any information of any particular circumstance? - He sent for me on Sunday morning about half past six, and shewed me a metal button shanked, that he said he found in the shop.</p>
               <p>Look at that button? - I am sure this is the button; he gave the button into my hand, says he, there is a number of people that comes to your house, take it and enquire for any person that wears such a button; accordingly I took it, and kept it three quarters of an hour, and delivered it to him again, then he told me what had happened, and desired if anybody should happen to come to our house with such a button and coloured coat, to take notice of them; he said, he found it under the vice board in the shop; I told him I did not see anybody that answered the description then, but on the next day about eleven in the forenoon, I was at the door serving two people with some liquor, I saw the prisoner come by with the same coloured coat, and the button was off; his coat was buttoned and his hands in his pockets; he turned his head towards the window, he made no stop, but I thought he walked rather slow, that was before he came to me, then I took particular notice that he wanted a button, and I went and told Mr. Moore that I thought the man was gone by that committed the robbery; Mr. Moore, me, and another, pursued him down Crown-alley, there we lost sight of him; we saw him again, and he was stopped, he made no resistance whatever.</p>
               <p>When you stopped him did you observe whether his coat had lost a button? - At the Justice's I did, it was from his breast, it appeared to be torn out, it being set on with cloth of the same colour; he did not deny that the button matched with his own, but said that he was in an affray on Wednesday in Kingsland road, and might lose his button there, and another person might pick it up and drop it at Mr. Moore's, enquiring for a watch, might throw it over the sash; but the sash did not run.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he did not say positively whether it was his button or not? - No, he seemed to signify that it matched with it.</p>
               <p>Was he then told where the button was found? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What is the reason you was not at Mr. Wilmot's to give your evidence? - I was there, but nobody was called in but Mr. Moore, and the man that took you.</p>
               <p>Did I refuse going with you? - No, you went along easily, you said you would go anywhere with me.</p>
               <p>Was not I searched at Mr. Wilmot's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You remember there was no sum of money found about me? - I did not see him searched.</p>

               <p>Did you make any remark on the rest of his dress? - He had an apron on, and when the apron was pulled up his breeches were ragged, that was all the observation I made, I cannot say whether they were ragged or torn by accident.</p>

               <p>Did it appear to be fair worn, or torn by accident.</p>
               <p>I should think it must be torn by accident, they were torn in strips, he did not take off any other of his clothes.</p>

               <p>What last month? - No, the month before.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean the 9th of August? - Yes, I do, it was last month, now I am sensible it was last month.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, this is September, you say it was the 9th of August? - I am sure it was, I am positive that night he was with me, on the 9th of August, about six weeks ago, i was not farther back, it was not June or July.</p>
               <p>Where was he, Sir, with you on the 9th of August? - I must tell my story as near as I can, and I will do it with as much justice as I can; he called upon me on Saturday evening, he sent for me out of the playhouse, we drank a pint of porter together, and he and I went home together, and my wife was gone to a sister of hers who was in labour in Ratcliff-highway, I live in St. Martin's-lane, we waited at our house till four o'clock.</p>
               <p>You remember the time particular by the labour? - I will tell you presently; he told me he was taken up for a robbery in Moorfields; says I, you could not, you was with me that night, my wife's sister was in labour; I said the 9th of August but I was mistaken, I will swear it was on the Saturday night the 14th.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that it was the 10th of August? - I will swear it was the Saturday the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a carpenter, I live in St. Martin's-lane.</p>

               <p>Can you tell us any thing by your books? - I have not my book, it is six or seven weeks ago; I do not come here with a studied story.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to say that it was not in September? - Yes, it is longer ago.</p>
               <p>What makes you think it was not July? - I have sworn before he was with me on the Saturday night, on the Monday I saw him in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>On Saturday the 9th of August? - I will swear it was the 9th of August.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts in St. Martin's-lane do you live? - Next door but one to May's-buildings; I have lodged at the butcher's shop about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Who do you lodge with? - The landlady who keeps the house, she keeps a publichouse in Red Lyon Square, her name is Treble, one Mr. Buir keeps the butcher's shop next door to Mr. Treslove, there is a baker on the other side whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with? - At Covent Garden theatre.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This is an aukward circumstance, such a one as will make any jury pause much upon it, at the same time it is but a circumstance, and I must say that I do not think it by any means a conclusive one; you, however, are the proper judges; it is not for me to impress upon you what I think upon it, but I confess, as the man's life is to depend on a single circumstance, I could with that circumstance had been more conclusive; but if it is so convincing in your minds that you cannot get over it, you will discharge your consciences; if there is a probability that it was not his button, if there is a possibility that it was not his button, perhaps you may think it too much to take away his life upon a single circumstance.</p>
               <p>(The Jury desired to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, before you withdraw, my brother Gould wishes me to mention to you what is extremely proper, that though many people have been convicted upon circumstances only, yet one cannot recollect a case in which a man has been convicted on one single circumstance, several circumstances combining together have great weight with a Jury: but where there are no circumstances to corroborate each other, but a case depends on one single circumstance; there to be sure the weight of it is very much abated.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to the prosecutor, on Wednesday the 31st of August last, about seven in the evening, a woman and a boy came into the prosecutor's shop to buy a pair of buckles while I was engaged with the woman and a boy, the man came into the shop, I looked at him, and asked him what he wanted, and he went down the steps to the door, in the mean while the woman and the boy kept me in conversation respecting the buckles, they bought the buckles, and they went out of the shop, I saw the woman go out of the shop without a cloak on her shoulders; she was a meanish looking woman, I followed to the door suspecting nothing of it, when I returned back I missed the shew-glass.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man that came into the shop if you were to see him? I think I should.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140167"/>Are you sure you should know him? - I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him since? - Yes, I saw him at Guildhall, and then I knew his face, I think he was but a very little time in the shop, I saw him and another walk backwards and forwards before he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say you should know that man that came into the shop, and stepped out again? - The prisoner I believe is the man.</p>
               <p>From the very slight opportunity you had of observing him, can you swear positively that is the man? - I cannot positively swear it, but I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man go out as well as the woman and the boy? - Yes, he stood with his back to the door, then I spoke to him and he went on the step, then I saw nothing in his hand, I supposed he belonged to the woman and the boy, the woman and the boy kept me in talk for a few minutes after he went out.</p>
               <p>Jury. In what part of the shop was the shew-glass? - Upon the counter, about a yard and half from the door, my back was to the show-glass, I was obliged to watch the woman and the boy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your shop is but a small one I understand? - Yes, in 'Change-alley.</p>
               <p>What age might the boy be? - I suppose about fourteen.</p>

               <p>Court. Are there any rooms over your work-shop? - None at all, nor any communication to the house: on Thursday morning I went out, and I locked up the shop, the inner door, with a padlock, hasp and staple, and the outside door upon the spring lock; I came home about twenty minutes after eight, as near as possible, in the evening, and I found the box staple wrenched back, I went in and felt in the dark, and I missed my vice, and then another; I got a candle out of Mr. Scandret's house, and the prisoner came out of the house, and came into the shop to me, and he says, God d - n you, this is the third time your shop has been robbed; I said, I know it has; he said, why did not you take your vices and lock them at Mr. Scandret's, as you did the second time you was robbed; then I came into the public house, and he brought me a pot of beer, and says, God d - n you, here, drink, you will find it out in time; I went down into the vine vaults, and I received information that the prisoner was the man that robbed me, I went to the neighbouring pawnbroker's, and I found the vice at Mr. Ferris's; I am sure of the vice; I found it within ten minutes, and I found the other that is here at an old iron shop in Shoe-lane, at one Mr. Kent's; one vice is broke in the spring belonging to the flower, and the other is broke in the second turning in the worm in the box; there are not, I suppose, two such vices in the kingdom; I came back again to Mr. Scandret's house, and there the prisoner sat drinking; I took him out of the house, and got assistance; I took him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140177"/> the corner of Stone Cutters-street, and there he began to cry, and begged for mercy, and acknowledged he had robbed me; he said he would give me my property again.</p>

               <p>Did you make him any promise? - None at all; he wanted to go into a public house, and I took him out of the same house, and there he said he had not made away with much of the money; he said he had pawned one for five shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to ask the witness whether he was not tried capitally at this bar; another thing, I have it not in my power to employ a council, and I hope you will look over that bit of paper before my trial goes on; I hope your Lordship will have the kindness to do me justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the witness been ever convicted so as to disqualify him? - I was tried in this court, doubtless, but it is many years back; I was not called on my defence, I was honourably acquitted.</p>

               <p>Most honoured Sir,</p>
               <p>I most humbly beg that your goodness will be pleased to excuse the way of proceeding which I have taken, and most humbly beg that you will be pleased to take my hard case into consideration, and extend your Lordship's goodness and mercy on me, as far as you may think me worthy of it, when you hear my hard case, and the primonary that I drawed into innocently; the particulars of which is as follows:</p>
               <p>On the fifteenth instant, about seven o'clock, I was drinking with Mr. Davis, who is one of the witnesses against me, and I having occasion to go to the door, when I was at the door I was accost by a man who came up to me, and telling me that he was a stranger, he would take it as a favour if I would inform him where there was a pawnbroker, and I not thinking of the consequence that might attend a thing of the kind, I took the things which he had, and went and pawn'd them for him, and brought him the money; and by obliging, he asked me to drink, but I return'd him thanks, and told him that I was engag'd at the house he saw me come out of, therefore I wished him good night, and return'd back, and in the space of about half an hour the prosecutor came in and said his shop had been robbed, and on his mentioning these words he went out, when the witness Davis went out after him, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140178"/> both return'd in the space of fifteen minutes, and said they had a suspicion that I had robb'd the prosecutor's shop, as they had found the things was pawn'd by me, I told them I knew nothing of it, but was willing to go any where with them, and accordingly they took me to the Compter, and I was taken the next day before the Alderman, who committed me for trial, and as I am intirely innocent of what is laid to my charge, I hope your Lordship will extend your goodness so far as to inspect into my prosecutor's character, as he has been tried in this court twice for his life; and I am well convinced this is done out of spite, because I worked for him some time ago, and not liking his proceedings, I left him; and he keeps an infamous house in George Yard, Field-lane; therefore your Lordship may judge what sort of a person he is, and as I have an undeniable character, and was never before in a primeary of the kind, I hope your Lordship will inspect into my unhappy case, and I, as in duty bound, shall ever pray;</p>
               <p>And I am your Lordship's most devoted, and most humble servant,</p>

               <p>Court. What are you? - I work at sawing sometimes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of employ? - A fortnight very near.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Lad-Lane, at the Crown.</p>
               <p>Have you any father or mother living? Yes, in the country.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, I have known him by sight above two years.</p>
               <p>Are you much acquainted with him? - No, only I have drank with him.</p>
               <p>Did he behave in any improper manner at any time, and when? - On the 29th of July, my landlady sent a young man to sleep with me, and she and I quarrelled, I lodged at the George at that time, I told her I would not sleep in the house, and the prisoner was there, and he said, go home along with me Dick, so I will says I, Sweetman.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Between twelve and one, when we went to the prisoner's we went up stairs, and went to bed just after the clock struck one, I went to sleep before the prisoner got into bed, I do not know that I heard him, and about two o'clock I awaked, and his arms were clenched round me, and he had turned me on my face, and he had got his instrument between my thighs, and I twisted myself and made him break his hold, I got my breast on the bedstead, and I took hold of him with my left hand, and gave him two or three good pelts over the head, I laid hold of him by his breast, the fleshy part; then I asked what he thought of himself, and what he deserved, he said, do not tell, do not tell, my dear, do not tell, several times over; then I said, what do you deserve, says I, you take care for the future, never offer any such thing any more to any man, if you do you will get into a hobble: I laid till morning, and he laid on the other side, and never offered anything more.</p>
               <p>Why did not you leave him directly? - I was disposed to go to sleep, and he laid very still afterwards, after I gave him a knock or two.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell this to any body? - I cannot tell exactly to the day, I told it to a porter that I knew, that I went house with him, and he wanted to serve me and so, and he said it was a nasty affair; I never made any complaint to any Justice till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>How was you found out? - A man, an acquaintance of the prosecutor on the last trial, stopped me, and told me the prisoner was taken up for a crime I was talking of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor and me were both very much in liquor, that is all that I can say.</p>

On the 20th of April last, a Mr. Tait, who is a clerk of Mr. Hankey's, was in the office for the purpose of paying the draughts that were brought, and then it was that the draught, the object of the present enquiry, was brought by the prisoner; Mr. Tait, upon looking at the draught, had some suspicion, he thought there was an evident dissimilarity in the writing, he went to a drawer where there were two other draughts which we say are forgeries, and which had been presented a little time before, but on comparing this note with those, and their appearing alike, he was induced to pay it; however, the circumstance itself caused him to suspect the prisoner, and made him take a more than ordinary notice of him: Gentlemen, undoubtedly the evidence of identity will be always received with considerable caution: probable it is, very probable, that persons may be deceived with respect to likeness, and with respect to recollection; but where there are circumstances that aid the memory, and induce at the moment particular observation, people in cases like this, may be enabled to speak with as much certainty as any human creature can do from memory; and you well know, many of the transactions in life require we should rely on memory, for seldom do we come to demonstration; if Mr. Tait therefore speaks certainly to the man, there will remain nothing but for you to go into the other circumstances of the forgery, which I shall then proceed to lay before you, and if they are proved to your satisfaction, it will then become your duty to find the prisoner guilty of the charge.</p>

            ; I speak of the partnership in April last.</p>
               <p>Lock at the prisoner, have you a recollection of him? - Yes, Sir, I think I have a very strong one?</p>
               <p>Did you see him in April last, and where? - On the 26th of July, at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Did you see him on the 20th of April? - It struck me very forcibly that he was the same I saw on the 20th of April.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of April a man came to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day? - About ten in the morning, as far as I can gather from my own book, this is the draught I have in my band; I looked at the writing, and I saw a sensible difference to Mr. Wood's usual way of writing; I took the opinion of my fellow tellers at the counter, and they told me it certainly must be his writing, they thought it was; I was not perfectly satisfied, but referred to a drawer, in which Mr. Wood's draughts lay, I looked at the draught, and found it the same hand-writing, I paid sixteen guineas and a half, and six shillings, and the gentleman returned me two shillings as bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, one of the prisoner's counsel. In what shape did you pay the draught? - Sixteen guineas and a half, and six shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Have you a memory of the person that so presented the draught to whom you paid the money? - I had a very strong recollection then, I had rather speak to the time that I saw him on the 26th of July.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask the person who presented the draught any questions? - None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you take any observation of the person? - Yes, I looked at his person, and I apprehended in myself he was a relation of Mr. Wood's, because I thought there was a kind of family likeness in the fullness of his eyes to Mr. Wood's son, but I found it was quite different.</p>
               <p>On what occasion was it that you saw him at Hoxton? - He was taken into custody by a constable.</p>
               <p>Look again at the prisoner at the bar, is he or is he not the person that presented the note; what is your opinion of him now, that you can warrantably say upon your oath? - I believe him to be the same, on recollecting that it struck me so forcibly then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Does your memory serve you to say whether that was the man or not? - I will not say, but upon that recollection.</p>
               <p>Do you believe him to be the man? - I belive him to be the man that presented the notes, but I only belive it upon the strength of that recollection.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very fair and candid evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know Mr. Wood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, Mr. Tait, I am disposed to hope, as the court does, that you mean to give a very fair and candid account; it is that hope that induces me to give you a caution, because I have here your information before a Magistrate; now, you have told my friend, with some difficulty, (which certainly is in favour of your testimony) that after all the corroborating circumstances that you have put together, you do believe that the person at the bar is the person that presented the note.</p>
               <p>Court. He says he does not speak from his knowledge now, from his recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now I ask you, abstracted from all you have heard, from all you have done at the bank, and all that has been told you on the subject, I ask you, without these corroborating circumstances, will you swear the prisoner is the person that presented the note? - I hesitated, as you remember before, about that question, nor can I answer it now; I say I am uncertain.</p>
               <p>That is a very fair answer, and just such an one as I expected you to give; you have told us very fairly that you are uncertain, I believed that you was, because I observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140188"/> that in the catalogue of reasons you gave before the Magistrate, your recollection of the person is not to be found; you was examined, I believe, by the Magistrate on the 29th of July? - On the 26th in the evening.</p>
               <p>Then your examination was reduced into writing, and signed by you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that examination I see you enumerated several reasons which induced you to suspect, (for it goes no further than that you had great reason to suspect) upon several accounts, that one

             was concerned in this forgery; now, amongst those several reasons, though so close on the time, there is not one single mention of the person of the man that tendered you the note; the person, whoever he was, who received the payment, appears by your books to have taken it in cash? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No notes composed that payment at all? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You was some time examining the draughts, and comparing? - Perhaps a minute.</p>
               <p>And there was nothing in the conduct of the prisoner or the draught, that induced you to stop the draught? - No.</p>
               <p>The person who received the money returned two of the shillings as bad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you before the Magistrate say you did not recollect him, and could not swear to him? - I might say I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>That was in July; now, in September, having clapped together a variety of circumstances, you believe he is the man; the draught was tendered in April, and you did not see him till July, and then he was in custody for forgery? - He was in custody then.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the house of the prisoner on the 25th of July? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know, however, that there was an application made to him on this subject on the 25th? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>And you have reason to believe it, it was made by your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was found in his own house the 26th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time do you begin paying in a morning? - Nine.</p>
               <p>What is your high time? - Between one and five; we have but little to do of a morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Mr. Wood keeps money in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the account between Mr. Wood and Hankey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is the book here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the book in your hand-writing? - I have signed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is only an attested copy of better evidence; you may as well hear my friend's brief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Your Lordship very well knows my friend would object to Mr. Wood, and I shall not call him without a release; I shall call others who know his hand-writing perfectly well.</p>

               <p>Wood. He cannot be gone above five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I have done, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. If young Wood was here, I should think it incumbent on Mr. Fielding to call him, especially after the manner of the last witness giving his evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I have no further evidence in this case.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is impossible to call on the prisoner for a defence in this case; it stands merely that a person brought a draught to Hankey's and Co. which one witness swears is not the hand-writing of the person whose writing it purports to be, for payment; no questions were asked that person, payment was made; and now one witness swears, that he believes the prisoner to be the man, but is not sure of it: in the first place there is no reason to believe that that person, whoever he was, knew it to be forged, his conduct in returning two bad shillings is reverse to that, and if the mere taking money for a draught would make a man guilty of forgery, a man would never take a draught; at the same time it is but justice to the prosecution to say, that though the recollection of Mr. Tait is very uncertain, and that uncertainty is greatly increased nearer the time of presenting the draught, yet such recollection is a proper reason for commencing this enquiry.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Montcrief. She promised to walk with me, and she did, and I gave her a breakfast, and kept her till Monday.</p>

               <p>Was the market full of people? - It was on Monday, there was a good many people about, I came back and asked the prisoner if she had got it, and she said no; I told her she must have it, and she said to satisfy me she would go to the Justice and take her oath that she did not know any thing of it, I went to Bow-street and go a constable, and he took her to Bow-street. I heard her confess that she took it, before Justice Addington; she came to me about two minutes before I went before the Justice, and said she hoped I would not be severe with her, for it was her misconduct, and she took the silk, for she wanted money to buy strawberries; I had said nothing before, and I gave her answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You had not carried home the silk at? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where had you purchased it? - In Swallow-street.</p>

               <p>Was the old woman at the stand when you came first back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she say that she found the silk laying on her stand, and that she had pawned it, and if you would swear it was your property, so that she might be satisfied, she would restore it? - No, Sir, I said if she would restore my property I would pay the expences.</p>
               <p>Was that before she had told you she had taken it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Counsel. Can you take upon you to say that you did not drop your own watch? - I think I can.</p>
               <p>Are you positive of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did you hesitate so much in the answer to that question? - Because I was recollecting.</p>
               <p>Then you have some doubt? - No, I have no doubt, but as you put the question to me, it being a serious one, I was endeavouring to recollect.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Rather merry.</p>
               <p>Rather in liquor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been out spending the evening with some companions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking a little? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was about one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All of you pretty merry? - We were rather merry.</p>

               <p>Was Price drunk or sober? - He was rather mellow, but far from drunk.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, My Lord, if you look to the King's pardon, it is fourteen days from the day in which he shall be discharged out of custody; there were a number of civil detainers against him, and he had of course taken no pains to supersede them till he got the King's pardon: I mean to submit to the Court, that it is incumbent on the prosecutor to shew the precise day of his discharge out of custody, I contend that that case may well be presumed in favour of the prisoner to have happened, which in point of fact has happened in the present instance, and that the onus probandi is on them: supposing a man to be detained on civil actions till the whole fourteen days are elapsed, the purpose of the King's gracious pardon would be defeated, and the keeper would say you have broke the King's pardon, and according to the argument of to day (strange as that argument is) you have committed a capital felony by remaining here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you the warrants there? - No, I have them at home, here is an entry of the day on which he was discharged, I know nothing of it of my own knowledge; Pitt discharges.</p>
               <p>What is that book? - This is a daily book that I keep of those that go in, and come out, this is a book for the entry of debtors, he discharged his debt the 25th of February, and it appears here, he was discharged in the month of March.</p>
               <p>Is that book kept solely for entering the discharges? - Discharges and commitments of debtors, as well as criminals of the master's side, and he appears to be of the master's side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know nothing personally of your own knowledge concerning the discharge of this man, but what you heard from the turnkey? - No.</p>
               <p>So that if the turnkey neglected his duty, or imposed upon you there might be a false date on your book; for if there is no day marked, you conclude it is that day, but if it is the day after you copy that which is so marked on the warrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who writes that on the warrant? - The turnkey.</p>
               <p>What do you do with the warrants? - I file them, and keep them regularly.</p>
               <p>Court (looking at the warrant.) Here is nothing written on this warrant, how came he to be detained till the 9th of March.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I know Mr. Akerman excused him his fees as he very often does; for the man had not a farthing in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lords, I must beg<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140196"/> leave to trouble your Lordships, with an objection to this proof, for as to all questions that have been addressed to Mr. Newman, he has freely confessed he does not know; this is not the original entry, it is the first book on the subject, but not the original minutes; they have evidence perfectly good to produce, but Mr. Newman, knows nothing personally on the subject; says he, it is the duty of the turnkey to apprize me of it as soon as he can; but if a riot should happen in the gaol, if the turnkey should fall asleep, or anything else should prevent him, possibly (which is enough for my argument) he may not apprize him of it at the time, and to cover such neglect may impose upon him a wrong day: my Lords, I may ask what hinders them from producing that turnkey, what hinders them from producing the memorandum of the turnkey, that would be the best evidence, but this is the second best, this is but a copy of that memorandum. Now, suppose, my Lords, the case of a brewer, who wants to prove a delivery of a certain number of casks, and his servant who delivered them is dead: we know that there are authorities which say, that the entry in the hand writing of that servant will be evidence of the delivery: but was it ever contended that the ledger of the brewer copied from the day book will be evidence? no such thing. I submit this is not the best evidence, and therefore ought not to be received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I own, for my part, I am inclined to think this is evidence to be received: it is not like a book of a private tradesmen, it is not like a ledger, but it is a long established practice, people put a confidence in public officers, and their evidence is to be received with due caution. I think prima facie there is evidence that this man was set at liberty on the 9th of March, then he is not taken till the 26th of May, therefore that is more than fourteen days after the discharge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paron Botham. I am inclined very much to concur with my learned brother Gould, for it does not seem that Mr. Newman has any interest in this book whatever, he is the officer who records this transaction; undoubtedly any party may falsify the book if they can, this being such a kind of book in which he has no interest whatever, but faithfully recording the transactions, unless it is impeached some way or other it ought to be received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The evidence on the part of the prosecution being closed, I must now, my Lords, take the liberty of troubling the Court with some objections in point of law on this case. The offence charged against the prisoner at the bar, is that he having been convicted of a felony, for which he was liable to be transported for seven years, did receive such sentence, and was afterwards found at large in this kingdom, before the expiration of that term, without any lawful cause. Your Lordship have it in evidence, that he was discharged in consequence of his Majesty's pardon, granted on condition of transporting himself, and by virtue of a warrant under the hand and seal of the Recorder of Londons. By the common law of this country, every man is entitled to the full and uninterrupted enjoyment of his personal freedom, and he can only forfeit his liberty by the commission of some crime, therefore one is obliged to resort to the statute law, to see what that crime is; and I cannot find any one statute that makes this man guilty: the indictment has not charged that the sentence of the Court, which was originally passed upon him, had been altered by his Majesty's pardon, and I understand that the reason was, that it is to be argued that the condition of that pardon not being complied with, it is to be taken like the condition of a grant, as if no pardon had been granted at all: now, my Lords, to a certain extent, I am perfectly ready to admit that argument, if it be only contended that Mr. Aikles has forfeited his claim to his Majesty's mercy, and therefore ought to be remanded to his former sentence: But if it is to be contended, that he has committed a felony, then I am to find some statute law in this country, in which that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140197"/> offence is described.

Now I say, my Lords, that Mr. Aikles is not in the list of cases described in that act of parliament; he has not agreed to transport himself to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America, therefore he has not been indicted under that clause, as he could have been, and the pardon set out: Your Lordships see the condition of this pardon, is generally to depart the realm, not to transport himself specifically to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America; then comes the act of the 8th of

            . which I mention, only because it is one of the acts that is found in the code of transportation laws; it relates only to persons recommended by the Judge of assize to his Majesty's mercy, and who by that mercy are ordered to be transported to America. Your Lordships know, that you no longer have the power to transport to America, or at least you no longer exercise it: Then I say that the legislature, by the act of the 19th of the present King, c. 74, has made an entire new code of transportation laws, in which the case of Mr. Aikles is entirely counted: and when I say that, my Lords, it becomes me to state what I take to be his case; I take it he is not now an offender, under sentence of transportation to America; but in a case analogous to those mentioned in the statute of the late King, who had agreed to transport themselves; with this difference, that extended to America, his case is an agreement to transport himself generally, and not to those colonies and plantations: The act says, persons convicted of crimes, punishable by transportation to America, may be ordered to be transported to any parts beyond the seas; then comes the other clause,</p>
               <p>"or if his</p>
               <p>"Majesty, his heirs, or successors, shall</p>
               <p>"extend his royal mercy to any felon,</p>
               <p>"upon condition of transportation beyond</p>
               <p>"the seas," then all the laws relative to transportation were to take effect: but your Lordships see, that those who penned this act of parliament, have confined it to such as are attainted, or convicted of crimes without benefit of clergy, whereas Mr. Aikles's case was not an offence for which he was excluded the benefit of clergy. My Lords, I come next to enquire whether he stands on his old sentence, and whether the King's pardon having been granted to him upon a condition, and that condition not being complied with, he has committed a felony? I contend he has not, as he is at large within the realm, with a lawful excuse; that lawful excuse is Mr. Recorder's warrant, and that warrant granted on his Majesty's pardon if I shew your Lordships that at any one moment he was at liberty, with lawful cause, I should wish to know when that ceased? In the present case, your Lordships cannot extend the law beyond the letter of it, under the several statutes under which your authority arises; then I say there is no statute law which says, that if the condition of his Majesty's pardon is broken, that the person breaking it shall be guilty of a felony; and I am entitled to presume that the legislature in the act of the 19th of the present King, meant purposely to exclude such cases as the present, and thought it enough to tell a man in the situation of Mr. Aikles, you have trifled with the King's pardon, and shall therefore return to that situation in which that pardon found you; but, that they thought it a great deal too much to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140198"/> say to him you shall be therefore guilty of a felony I ask again, where is the statute law, that makes the not complying with that pardon a felony? and I ask, why was not the condition of the King's pardon stated in the indictment? My Lords, there is a case which appears to me to be previously in point, the case of Maxamillian Miller, referred to the consideration of all the Judges; it was in the year 1770, from this place; he was indicted for being found at large, after having accepted the King's pardon, on condition of being transported; but when he came to be tried, a doubt occurred to the Judges who presided at that time on his case, and the Judges have never, I believe, communicated any judicial determination of that case, but they did that which was tantamount to it, for they remitted him to his former sentence: I know that in that day, very absurdly as it seems, the condition of the King's pardon was, that he should give security, to the satisfaction of the Recorder, to depart the country within a limited time: I know that the form of the King's pardon has been altered by the present learned Recorder; the condition now is not, that he should give security to depart, but that he should depart the kingdom, and not return or he found at large, without sufficient cause: but it goes on to say, that the King, who by law had a right to say he shall be released from all his offences; that competent authority has said, that upon giving sufficient security he shall be discharged: now it is in evidence, that he gave such security, that he was released out of custody, then he was once at large, with a legal excuses In Miller's case, the condition of giving security to the Recorder, preceded his departure from the kingdom, and the court held that he could not be convicted of a felony, he having the King's pardon to discharge him, on doing a certain thing. My Lords, it does not occur to me, that I can state the argument more clearly than I have done and to sum up my objection, it is this, that if the offence is that he has not performed the condition of the King's pardon, then there is no statute law existing which calls it at an offence, but there is a late act of parliament, in which that offence is not revived; and I contend that, though it may vacate a pardon, yet, as of course it cannot be an offence at common law, and there is no statute describing the offence, your Lordships, upon the authority of

I have to lament my Lords, that in a case of so much consequence to publick justice, the support of it should be left to my feeble abilities, in the absence of a gentleman much more versed in the cr iminal law of this country than myself, from him I have received this brief, without any idea of an answer being necessary to such an objection as the present, however, I will endeavour to suggest to the Court what arises to me, caught up in a moment upon what has dropped from my learned friend: I take it, my Lords, that there are two clauses in the act of parliament which attack strongly on this prisoner, the first is, that if any person shall he at large within the time for which he is ordered to be transported, that he by that act becomes a capital offender; there is another clause of it, which says, that likewise the person who is sentenced to be transported, and shall agree to transport himself, and return into the kingdom within a limited time, shall be a capital offender: I take the offence certainly to be within the first of these clauses, because he has had sentence of transportation passed upon him by a Court competent to pronounce that sentence; this defence is set up, his Majesty has been pleased to grant him a pardon, which pardon is said to give him a lawful cause for being found at large: if this pardon was, as former pardons were, on condition (only) that this person should give security to the Recorder of London, to depart the nation; I hold his having given that security is all that can be required of him, and thought the security is forfeited of course, yet, he is at large with lawful cause, and there would be no possibility<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140199"/> of his being indicted for a capital offence; but the pardon now granted to him, is upon condition</p>
         
               <p>"that he the prisoner depart this kingdom within fourteen days: the words are</p>
               <p>"And our will and pleasure further is (which certainly is a distinct, opposition from what has gone before) that upon giving due security to the Recorder so to do, he then should be discharge out of custody - If he be found at large within the fourteen days after his discharge, he then is at large with lawful cause. But though he gives this security, that does not take away the precedent condition of that pardon, for it is perfectly separate, and distinct from it: it is contended this act of parliament is repeated by the 19th of

            . the reason of passing that act was that in consequence of the unhappy rebellion which took place in our colonies in America; they could not send the felons there; then another act of parliament was necessary as to the transportation of these offenders, and it says, not that the, shall be hereafter transported to any other place, but that it may be lawful to his Majesty in such cases, to transport them elsewhere if his Majesty so pleases; I hold that the two acts run together, and the one only extends the powers of the other, but does not repeal it in any shape whatever now when a pardon is granted on certain conditions, and they are broken, that pardon is as if it never had had existence; the prisoner has a pardon granted him, and shall either accept it to comply with the conditions of it, or refuse it, and remain under his former sentence; he knows the conditions, and his ability or inability to perform them, and if after having accepted it, he finds himself unable to perform them, he might have surrendered to any Magistrate, he might have been in legal custody. If this pardon never did take place, being upon condition which had not been performed, it certainly can be of no avail to the prisoner; as to Miller's case, I never saw it, I think it must turn upon the different made of wording the pardon from that now adopted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I think it is necessary to make a final decision in this point; we perfectly well know that by the common law, the King may grant his pardon upon condition; Lord Coke says in the first institute 2746, if a villain is manumitted, every condition on that manmmission is utterly void; but, says Lord Coke, the King may grant his pardon on condition: the sense and meaning of that must necessarily be, that if the King's condition of the pardon is broken, it makes it a nullity: as for the argument upon these acts of parliament it was extremely well enforced by Mr. Garrow, that it is not in the power of the Judges to make a felony if the law has not made one: therefore now according to the old law, where felonies were capital, where the benefit of clergy did not interpose to save them; if the party had undertaken to depart the realm with all possible speed, if he did not use all due diligence to depart, I know perfectly well, as in Stamper's case, he was remitted to his former sentence, he was to be executed, supposing the sentence was capital, according to that former sentence, and the reason they gave for it was, that there could not be two attainders for one crime: so stood the ancient law: then when this system of transportation took effect, the act of parliament made the returning before the term a felony, and then the subsequent act of parliament that Mr. Garrow has mentioned, putting it more at large, and to facilitate the conviction, saying, that if he shall be found at large within the realm, before that term of transportation expired, it shall be a new felony; that put it upon a different plan, from the common law, therefore, suppose the party came into a new description of the act of parliament, you are under the necessity of indicting him for a new made felonony: this man is convicted of a clergyable felony, and receives sentence of transportation, his Majesty is graciously pleased to interpose on his part, and to pardon the crime; these are the terms of the King's pardon, upon condition that he should depart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140200"/> the realm within fourteen days after he should be discharged; but it is proved, and does appear to us in evidence, that he was discharged according to the true spirit and meaning of his Majesty's gracious act, and that he did not comply with that condition, but was taken at large after the expiration of fourteen days: it is very true, that this act of the nineteenth of his present Majesty seems to have perplexed the matter a little, because it takes up felonies not excluded from the benefit of clergy where the sentence is transportation pronounced by the court; and then it says nothing at all upon the King's pardon on condition of transporting themselves, but only makes provision with respect to those capitally convicted; but this act has not repealed the former statutes, so far from it, that it provides in the clause that I would have been glad to have referred to, that all the clauses in the fourth of

             the Second particularly should be applied, and put in force with respect to all persons that were sentenced to be transported under this act of parliament, or something of that kind: now, what was the sense and meaning of that act of parliament? By that act of parliament courts of justice were restrained, and obliged to order their transports to America; nay, and it has been determined to my knowledge by all the Judges upon a question arising on the fishing act, referred by Mr. Justice Bathurst, that when the act says a man shall be transported for seven years without saying where, it should be to America; that was the opinion of all the Judges, I remember that case well.

             the Second this man's case is; he was sentenced to be transported to America, and, as Mr. Garrow states faithfully, no doubt, that act of parliament speaks of the condition that he should transport himself to America: the King does not model his pardon in that way, but he says he should depart the realm, but the party does not do this; the consequence is, that and giving complied with the terms of that pardon, as it at present (I do not give my upon it) that he was then that statute of the 16th of Geo I then, the instant the fourteenth day expired, was at large without any lawful authority: with respect to the objection, that this is not stated in the indictment, I shall not give any final opinion upon that neither, but the indictment is perfectly regular, and in due form, and it states it, and it is incumbent on the prisoner to shew on the one hand the lawful cause why he was at large; he has entirely broke his Majesty's pardon, and the pardon is at an end. These are my present sentiments; if there is any doubt with my brother Hotham, or the Recorder, I will reserve the case for the opinion of the twelve Judges.</p>

            . In this case the argument, as Mr. Garrow put it, was unquestionably strong, and the prisoner cannot fall within that part of the clause of the sixteenth of the late King, because he has not agreed to transport himself to America, and he cannot fall within the act of the nineteenth of the present King, because that respects pardon granted to people who had been capitally convicted; but the doubtful part of the case is, whether the pardon is not absolutely and entirely done away, and the case now to be considered as if no pardon had been granted; if it be, then, see how it stands on these two acts of parliament: if the King's pardon is actually done away, may it not be extremely questionable, whether this man having been sentenced to be transported beyond the the seas, by the operation of the act of the present King, is not now subject to the pains and penalties of that act: I think it is so doubtful, that without giving an opinion, I think fit to join with my brother Gould, in reserving it for the consideration of the Judges.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. I must confess, notwithstanding the diffidence with which I wish to express myself in the presence of the two learned Judges on such a subject, that it does appear to me, that this case requires a solemn determination, more from importtance than the difficulty of it; it seems very clear it does not come within either the clause of the 16th of

            . which respects persons who have agreed to transport themselves; nor within that clause of the 19th of the present King, which relates to pardons granted by the King: Mr. Aikles has not agreed to transport himself to America, and the clause not being repeated, I think we cannot extend it: it does not come, I think, within that clause; and it does not come within the clause of the 19th of the present King, because it is not a pardon for a capital offence, and capital offences are spoken of by that statute: it seems to me at present that the indictment is perfectly supported under the clause of the 16th of Geo. II. which make it a capital felony to be found at large, within the term for which a person has been sentenced to be transported to America. The prisoner was so sentenced, that sentence has been proved, and that the prisoner was at large, after the time of that sentence, and before the expiration of the term; so far therefore upon that evidence there is the simple case made out under the statute, but it appears also that he was at large under a warrant from the Recorder, founded upon a conditional pardon granted by his Majesty, and it is contended that having been once at large, by lawful cause, he cannot be guilty of felony in being at large, under a sentence of transportation, and that if he has broken the condition of his Majesty's pardon, by means of which he became at large, the utmost consequence must be that it shall not be in force. From the reasons which Mr. Justice Gould has laid down, I am perfectly satisfied, and I always did think the pardon being broke, becomes totally void: it is not so only from the common law, but it is laid down in more modern books, and such care is taken that pardons should not be abused, that it has been held that upon an allegation that the King was deceived in the circumstances on which he granted that pardon, the pardon should be void: and it has been held necessary, that they should recite the crime<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140203"/> for which the pardon was granted: upon every authority and principle it seems to be established, that where the condition of the King's pardon is broken, it becomes a nullity.

            , which happened in all out remembrance, the Court acted upon that principle, though there was no adjudication of it; he had been capitally convicted, and was pardoned on condition of transportation; he was afterwards found at large; he was not indicted for a new felony, in being so found at large, but he was brought up, and the court being satisfied from his own admission, that he was the same person, he was called upon to assign a lawful excuse for being so at large, and the Court remanded him to prison under his former sentence, on this principle, that the condition of the King's pardon being broken, the pardon was gone, and the party remained precisely in the same situation that he was the day before the pardon was granted. Now, what was Mr. Aikles's situation before his Majesty's pardon issued? We find him then in the situation of a felon under sentence of transportation; the pardon being gone he remained, and remains still under that sentence; he therefore was in a situation in which, if he was found at large, he committed a felony; he had no lawful cause under the King's warrant for being at large beyond the term of fourteen days, therefore on the 26th of May he remained in the situation of a man under sentence of transportation, and without any lawful cause, for the lawful cause does not extend beyond the fourteen days, and therefore on the 26th of May he was at large in the kingdom, without any lawful cause; the pardon therefore being void, it seems to me that the indictment itself is good, and is fully supported by evidence: and the inclination of my opinion at present goes one step further, that if the indictment had stated the pardon, and that he had broken the condition of the King's pardon, and that therefore he would have been guilty of a felony, it would have been bad; for it is not a felony to break the King's pardon, except in the two cases, in the 16th and 19th of the present King: the 16th of Geo. makes it felony, first, in persons who are sentenced to be transported to return; next in persons that have agreed to transport themselves to return; in the first case, it is a distinct felony being at large under the sentence of transportation; in the next case, where the persons have agreed to transport themselves: in the 19th of the present King, it also makes it a felony for capital convicts to be at large after they have been ordered or received pardon, on condition of being transported, because they then become under a new sentence, the sentence of death is done away, and they would not have been guilty of a capital offence without that clause; therefore it was necessary to put them in the same situation, in the case of a capital felon who agrees to transport himself; and it was not necessary for the 19th of

            . to take up that, in the case of a capital felony, because it was needless to make that a new felony, where the party was liable under his former sentence; therefore the legislature in the 19th of the present King, seems to have omitted both those cases, upon this very principle; I think therefore that the indictment is supported. I have seen a correct state of Maximilian Miller's case; there it was on condition of giving security to depart the kingdom, and the Judges never made any solemn adjudication, but in point of fact the prisoner was remanded to his former sentence.</p>

               <p>Did he appear to you to be very indigent? - Very much so, and his wife and a gentlewoman, Mrs. Brookes, came to me, and undertook to pay me; he was not in a situation to pay me at that time.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. All laws must be considered with liberality, and a sort of equity, in order to pat a due construction on the meaning of them; and I confess, gentlemen if you are satisfied, that thro' ill health, and this distress that you have heard that the prisoner was in, he was prevented from performing the conditions that the pardon required, that it would be too strong to impute to him, that he was feloniously at large in defiance of this pardon: the act says, lawful excuse; certainly illness, and sickness, the visitation of God will operate as a lawful excuse, and if you should be satisfied that there was no fiction in this case, but that in reality and truth this was what prevented the man from going abroad, and that he meant and intended to go abroad; I own, in that case I think you should acquit the prisoner; on the other hand, if you think this is an artifice, not founded in reality, then you will find him guilty.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys, prisoner's counsel. How long did he remain at your house at that time? - Only that night; he went immediately with his mother to her house at Hamondsworth, near Langford, I was down there, and saw him there; he remained there in a place, he was at work till he came to London to my house; I made frequent applications while he was with his mother for a ship to get him to sea.</p>
               <p>He had no money at all of his own I believe? - None at all.</p>

               <p>Would his father-in-law assist him at all? - Not at all; I offered to pay five pounds towards the passage, his father-in-law would not give him any; it was five or six weeks after before I heard of the ship going to America; ten guineas was the least sum I could get him to go for; I know he was employed, but I never saw him at work; I have seen his father-in-law at work, he was to have gone from his mother to Portsmouth, he was wholly unable to have gone for want of money; it was his desire to have gone; he was kept a close prisoner; he was at his mother's, and was very ill; he had a rash, and the irons made his leg bad; he got employed in emptying a mill-pond; his father-in-law said he would give ten pounds to have him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Court. Has your mother any property, or your father-in-law? - Yes, I believe they have upwards of one hundred pounds year.</p>
               <p>What sort of property is it? - Leasehold houses.</p>

            ; I first heard of a ship in about a fortnight; we could not get a ship for less than ten guineas, and they would not take him unless the whole money was paid down; the lad was very desirous of going abroad in any way; I applied to a gentleman to recommend him on board to work his passage.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if I were now obliged to decide the law upon this case, I should find it my duty to tell you, that I think the prisoner's defence well warranted, and that in point of law he ought to be acquitted of this offence imputed to him by the indictment, because the condition of the pardon being, that he should give a security to the satisfaction of the Recorder, and having done so, I think that by that he has literally fulfilled the condition of his Majesty's pardon, and that the consequence of his not departing the kingdom, pursuant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140206"/> to the King's intention, is the forfeiture of that recognizance in himself, and in his bail: but there has been a former case exactly similar, in which from what fell from the Court, though there was no solemn opinion given, yet the Court then appeared to have an opinion different to mine; if therefore the case turns out to rest entirely on this point, the safest way will be for you not to rely on my opinion, but to find the prisoner guilty of the fact, with assurance that he will have the benefit of the law: the prisoner says, that he not only was discharged by lawful warrant, and by that means had, as he thought, literally fulfilled the condition of his pardon, but, says he, I did all I could literally and substantially to follow his Majesty's intention; I did all that lay in my power to quit the kingdom; now it is my duty to state to you my opinion in point of law on the nature of that defence: intention is necessary in all cases to constitute criminality, and that is a maxim of criminal law I hope will never be forgotten either by Judges or Juries; but a culpable neglect is a breach of the law certainly: there is another maxim of the law, which is, that the law does not expect or command things impossible, it would be perfectly absurd if it did; now, see how far these two maxims apply, which are clear and undoubted law; the first, that intention is necessary to make a man guilty of any criminal act; the next, that the law does not require impossibilities: first, the prisoner says, it was not with his own will that he was at large at all; next he contends, that it was not in his power to quit the kingdom, and that therefore the law could not require him to do what is impossible; now, although the prisoner has made out an extremely favourable defence, yet, I have doubts how far it does or does not amount to a strict legal justification; for although the law will not impute crime without intention, and he must be wilfully at large without probable cause, yet, a palpable neglect is within the intent and meaning of the law, and the question is, whether you think the prisoner did every thing in his power to complete the condition of his pardon, and could not have done more? he appears really to have endeavoured to obtain a passage to America, and actually off red to work his passage over, which seemed to be all he could do in that respect; he states that is the only place where he could get a livelihood. therefore he did not try to obtain a passage at any other place; he might, without difficulty, have got leave to have gone to some of the near parts on the coast of France or Holland, but then he would be a stranger in a foreign land: you are to judge whether the difficulty he found in departing from the kingdom, in the manner I have stated to you, amounted to all due diligence; it is my duty to tell you, if you are satisfied that he was not wilfully and intentionally at large, you ought to acquit him: you are to consider whether he was wilfully and intentionally at large, and whether there was that sort of impossibility to excuse him in point of fact; if you believe that he was not wilfully at large, but did all that in him lay to obtain a passage out of this kingdom, in that case I think that in law as well as in justice you will do right to find him generally not guilty of this indictment; if on the other hand you think that though it may be a favourable case, so as to set the prisoner in a situation deserving of future mercy from his sovereign, yet, that he might possibly have done something more than he did to facilitate his departure from this kingdom, and to shew his willingness for such departure; in that case it will be resolved into the first point of law, and if you think it comes to that point, you will find him guilty, and that point will be reserved to be hereafter determined by the Judges.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. The case that you have made out in evidence before the Court is so favourable, that I think there would be a hardship in detaining you in prison against my own opinion, especially when the learned assistance that I have now the advantage of, both the learned Judges and my friend Mr. Rose, are of my opinion,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140207"/> and as there is no judicial authority to detain you in prison; but I would recommend it to you to take an opportunity of leaving this country, and I think I can recommend to you a way of carrying that into execution, you have entered into a recognizance in one hundred pounds, and two other persons in fifty pounds each, to perform that condition, you and they have most clearly forfeited that recognizance, and therefore the only means your securities have left to avoid the payment of those sums, which I will take care they shall otherwise pay, will be to supply you with money for the purpose of your getting out of the kingdom; therefore, you will apply to the two persons who are your bail, and inform them that unless they supply you with money for that purpose, I will take care that they shall be served with process. Let the prisoner be discharged out of custody.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. The perjured defences set up on behalf of prisoners, has long been the disgrace of the criminal courts of this country; I have thought it my duty, ever since I have sat in a criminal court of justice, to pay great attention to that circumstance, and to do all that lay in my power to prevent the continuance of so wicked and so dangerous a practice; for the mischief of such perjured defences by no means terminates in an unjust-acquittal, if believed; for that, though a failure of justice, and consequently a great mischief, is but a very small one to the mischief that follows from the frequency of this kind of perjuries, because they induce a court and jury to look with a suspicious eye on the defences of prisoners even when true; they require to be more strongly proved than any other kind of defence, in order to gain credit with the jury, so that the innocent may as often be hurt as the guilty: this is therefore the worst of all offences, except that most horrid of all offences, of which it falls very little short, the crime of murder; and no perjury can be more mischievous than that which frequently occurs in the defence of prisoners. I have therefore made it a point, where there appears strong and cogent grounds before the court on the trial of prisoners, to induce them to suspect, or rather to believe, that a witness is perjured, to put the matter into a way of trial, and to pursue to justice and condign punishment the offenders, if on a full and impartial hearing of a second jury they should be found guilty; and it appears to me that no trial can afford the party accused a better chance of justification, because, before a party can be found guilty, there must be the concurrent testimony of two juries; therefore, it would be idle and nugatory in me, and in the court, to direct a prosecution of that sort, and where it was afterwards supported by clear and satisfactory evidence, to pass a slight sentence on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140210"/> offenders; for such sentence would be a mockery of justice: however, considering the situation of the prisoner, the court will remember at the same time a degree of mercy with justice, and will nor pass so severe a sentence as might be passed on this prisoner; supposing that the might be ignorant in some degree of the full enormity of her guilt; sentence, however, somewhat severe, it is the duty of the Court to pass, and it is the sentence of the Court, that you,

               <p>Mr. Fielding, of counsel for the defendant. My Lord, I am sure you will not be surprized, in a case of this kind, that I should wish all the witnesses to retire before Mr. Morgan opens.</p>
               <p>Court. Let lists of witnesses, except to character, or those that are to prove what passed in Court, be given to each party, and let them all go out of Court; there can hardly be a subject that requires a more serious and solemn investigation for the security of the subject on the one hand, and the safety of the defendant on the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan, of counsel for the Prosecution, then opened the case as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please you, Mr. Recorder, and gentlemen of the jury, to favour me in support of this prosecution; you are already informed this indictment is for perjury, committed on the trial of

            ; upon that trial, which was for a highway robbery, there was not any witness to the fact of the robbery but the prosecutor himself; there was no other material evidence obtained on the trial but that which was given by Harvey, and that that was material, you will in a few moments, I think, be properly convinced: fear and slight are in general pretty certain signs of guilt; and supposing what the defendant swore on that trial is false, he knew the consequences of his evidence by charging Newberry with having exhibited those two signs of guilt; after stating that he had been to the place, and came back, being asked if he had found either of the prisoners, he answered thus;</p>
               <p>"No; I</p>
               <p>"went back to Limehouse-corner between</p>
               <p>"fifty and sixty yards, where the affair</p>
               <p>"happened, and went into a public house,</p>
               <p>"and I looked round the taproom, and</p>
               <p>"there was the prisoner Peter; but I not</p>
               <p>"knowing him, he passed me as I was</p>
               <p>"drinking a glass at the bar, and he went</p>

               <p>"into the street, and the prosecutor was</p>
               <p>"leaning over the post at the corner of</p>
               <p>"the street, facing the public house, and</p>
               <p>"he called out constable, constable, there</p>
               <p>"is Peter, there he runs; I ran after him</p>
               <p>"directly, and he ran through a narrow</p>
               <p>"passage out of Fore-street into Ropemakers-field;</p>
               <p>"he kept running on, but</p>
               <p>"I lost sight of him; then he went into</p>
               <p>"a little alley, but I took him about ten</p>
               <p>"yards from his lodgings, where I had</p>
               <p>"been to search for him; the prosecutor</p>
               <p>"and the man who called me to his assistance</p>
               <p>"were leaning on the nosil of a</p>
               <p>"pump; the prosecutor was bleeding; I</p>
               <p>"brought the prisoner Peter to him, and</p>
               <p>"said, is this the man you want? he said,</p>
               <p>"this is Peter, and this is the man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140211"/> " took me by the throat; and I took him</p>
               <p>"away immediately, and put him in the</p>
               <p>"cage." After reading the evidence, I need not repeat the observation,</p>
               <p>'that it</p>
               <p>'was very material?' I shall only observe, that no other evidence respecting Newberry was given but by the prosecutor that any ways affected him. Gentlemen, upon the evidence, I may say of these two men, the prosecutor and the defendant, both the prisoners were convicted: it being afterwards heard by a variety of people, who knew the prisoners, what evidence had been given at the Old Bailey; they insisted upon it that the evidence of both the prosecutor and Harvey in the most material parts were false: an investigation took place, I believe some affidavits were procured, and, if I am not misinstructed, laid before the Recorder, he inquired into the circumstances, and his humanity induced him to procure a respite for these two convicts the day before the day appointed for their execution; the matter afterwards underwent an investigation before the King in Council, and in a fortnight a pardon was issued for the two men. Gentlemen, as this is a prosecution instituted merely for public justice, I shall not make any observations to inflame your passions, or to mislead your judgments, I shall content myself in submitting to you simply, and in as plain a manner as I can, the evidence I mean to produce to you on this occasion. I understand the defendant means to call witnesses, if he does, and I think it necessary and proper, I may trouble you with a few observations on that evidence. Gentlemen, I have no wish on this occasion but that justice should take place; this poor man,

            ; Goodman got his living that way; he had been at work all day, and just before the present defendant, and the said soldier, who alledged he had been robbed were in search of Newberry, Newberry had been out, and was returning home, and a person met him, that I shall call as a witness, and told him there were the old soldier and the defendant Harvey, whom they knew to be a kind of constable, pretty active in taking thieves, and they advised him not to go home; his answer was, I have done no harm, I am not afraid of any one, I certainly will go home: the witness went with him to his lodgings, and saw him go in, and when the prisoner entered the lodgings, the old soldier and Harvey were up stairs searching for Newberry; on his coming in, a woman called to him, and told him here is Newberry; Newberry is come in; upon which the old soldier and Harvey came down stairs, and in the lodgings within the house took Newberry into custody. I am instructed, and shall call another witness, who advised the man not to go home, and his answer will be proved by four or five, if not more, witnesses, who were all present at the time of the caption of Newberry, and they will, upon their oaths, tell you, that Newberry had been taken in the lodgings, and consequently had never been guilty of these two great signs of guilt, fear and flight. Gentlemen, if upon the evidence you should be satisfied, that what the defendant has sworn is false; if you should be convinced that what my witnesses say is true, it will then become your duty to convict the defendant of the crime imputed to him; but if you have any doubt, in that case you will acquit him: I shall press it in no manner, I shall make no observations without I find it absolutely necessary.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140215"/>How came you to think they would? - Because I saw Harvey there.</p>
               <p>How came you to judge that they would put Peter in the watch-house if he had done nothing? - Because I thought he had been wrangling with him.</p>
               <p>Had you heard that before now? - My mother said, she would have Lockell beat for going to her customers to sell wood to them.</p>
               <p>Had you set Peter to beat him then? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to think at this time that Peter had been doing anything to Lockell? - I did not know anything of it, only that he said he would have young Peter, if he found him anywhere, let him find him where he would he would have him, he said so at the door, when he came first with Harvey.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell this gentleman so just now, when he asked you very particularly? - Because I did not think of it then.</p>
               <p>Then your mother had quarrelled with Lockell before this, and wanted him beat? Yes, Sir, that was before he went away, then he took it into his head, and my father was bad a-bed, and he went away.</p>

               <p>You told this gentleman a little while ago, that the door always stood open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then what occasion to come down to open it? - It is open, not locked or latched, but it is shut too close, it goes too of itself; it is open always, only not locked or latched.</p>
               <p>Peter had lodged there before? - Yes, so had Lockell.</p>
               <p>Then he knew that your door stood always open, without being locked or latched? - Yes, but he knocked at the door, he did not push it open.</p>
               <p>Though he knew that your house was never locked or latched, he did not attempt to come in? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>But knocked as though he wanted to take up a person in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you came back with Newberry, how long was that after Harvey had been the first time to the house? - I cannot tell, indeed, how long.</p>
               <p>Do you know what public house they went to? - Yes, they went to the Pink.</p>
               <p>Did you see them go into the Pink? - Yes, Sir, and my father went with him; I did not see my father and them go into the Pink.</p>
               <p>How far is the Pink from your house? - It goes down a turning close by our house.</p>
               <p>How far altogether may it be from your house? - I believe it may be twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Then I think you say you met Peter about the length of this court from your own door? - Yes, Sir, in Ropemakers fields.</p>
               <p>You met him and told him that these people had been looking after him? - Yes, and he said he had done no harm, and he would come home; I was out of sight of my own door; our door does not look towards Ropemakers fields, because the ruins are broad; I went back directly with Peter, I was only gone the time I should be walking the length of this court and back again, after that we came home again.</p>
               <p>Then though your father and mother and Lockell had gone to the Pink public house, yet they had made such haste that they had got back again, and had got up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your father up stairs then? - Yes, they were coming down and they met Peter in the lower room, and took hold of him, there is no passage, we go through the lower room to the stairs; we all knew he was gone to the sawyers.</p>

               <p>Then your father took them to the Pink on purpose to take them out of the way? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>You told that gentleman here when he asked you, that you saw the door of the house open and Harvey and the soldier in the house looking for Peter, how came you to say that? - When Peter went in he shoved the door open and then I saw Harvey.</p>
               <p>Then it was not true that you saw the door open before. and Harvey and Lockwell in the house? - No Sir.</p>

               <p>You remember the time he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you on the evening of that day? - In my own house.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Harvey and Lockell came the first time? - Yes; they came and Lockell knocked at the door, and my wife looked out of the window and said, what do you want; then she went down and opened the door.</p>
               <p>You continued up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what conversation passed between Lockell and your wife? - Yes; my wife said what is the matter with you, Harvey said, I do not want old Peter, that was me, but I want young Peter, and my wife said young Peter was gone to the Sawyer's, then she called me down stairs, and I came down to the door, and then I saw young Lockell stand facing the door, and Mr. Harvey on the side by the wall, so then Lockell asked me if I knew where young Peter was gone, and I said I believed he was gone to the sawyer, at the public-house; he asked me what public house, I then told him I did not know the house, but I knew the sign, so then I went to the public house to shew it him; the sawyer was gone home to his own house, it is some distance from our house, the sign of the Pink.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the public-house? - No longer than I could ask for him; they said Peter was gone home; then I went to my own house again, Harvey and Lockell went with me; I went up stairs and began to split wood; Harvey and Lockell went down the street to the water side; they did not go along with me, but in a little while they came back again and came up stairs; Lockell and

             both together came up into the one pair of stairs where I was splitting of wood; I suppose I had been at home almost a quarter of an hour to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was Newberry with them at that time? No Sir.</p>
               <p>How soon after Harvey and Lockell came back the second time did you see Newberry? - When they came up stairs again I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140220"/> Lockell to go up stairs to see that he was not come home.</p>
               <p>How soon after this did you see Newberry? - About some few minutes after he had been up stairs and came down, Newberry came into the lower room, somebody called Harvey here is Peter; me and Harvey and Lockell were then up stairs.</p>
               <p>What became of Harvey then? - Then Harvey went down the stairs and took hold of Peter, and said you are the man I want.</p>
               <p>Where was Peter then? - He was in the lower room, in the middle of the room, where he had been sawing wood all day.</p>

            ? - Yes; he lives just by; I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Newberry I understand is a countryman of yours? - No; he is a Swede.</p>
               <p>How long has he been on this side the water? - He has lodged with me about half a year.</p>
               <p>Your wife and Lockell had had some quarrel before? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear her say she would have Lockell licked? - No, I never heard her say so.</p>
               <p>What time do you go to bed? - When we leave off work we all go to bed together, sometimes at eight, sometimes seven; I was at the trial at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>What time did you say Newberry went from home? - It was past six o'clock; Iverson is my countryman, I knew him before; I knew the time he came last from Greenland; I had not seen him in my house in the course of that day.</p>
               <p>Did there exist to your knowledge, any intimacy between them? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not send your little boy of an errand then? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you ever suffer him to be out in the street of a night? - No.</p>
               <p>I take it he cannot walk very fast? - No, he cannot.</p>
               <p>Where was this boy when Harvey and Lockell first knocked at your door? - He was up stairs binding of wood; the boy was up stairs from that time to the second time that Mr. Harvey came; my wife called me down when they came; I went with them to the Pink, when I came back again I found my boy in the same room.</p>
               <p>Those people who came back with you the second time, Harvey and Lockell, they went out of the house again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the boy? - The boy was in doors.</p>
               <p>All the time? - Yes, all the time.</p>
               <p>From the first to the last time they came to the house, was your son ever out of the house? - At the time they came last to the house I believe he went down stairs.</p>
               <p>But did he go out of doors? - To be sure he did.</p>
               <p>But how far did he go? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now how long was this before somebody said, here is Peter? - It was a little before that time that the boy went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the boy did not go down stairs till after the people called out here is Peter? - Oh yes, he was down before.</p>
               <p>How long did the boy go down before the people called out here is Peter? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Where was the boy when Peter came in? - He was along with Peter; I stood upon the stairs and saw him.</p>
               <p>Any person standing on the outside of the street-door might have seen all the people in the passage? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then, that person might have seen your son as well as Newberry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before that moment had you seen him? - Five or six minutes; I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Then your son was lost to your sight for about five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say that you went first with Harvey and Lockell to the public house to look for Peter? - Yes, I left him there, and I came back again, and he was there.</p>
               <p>Then he staid till Harvey and Lockell came again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was the door shut or open? - I was up a pair of stairs, I cannot be positive as to that, he clapped his hand to the jam of the door, and stood a trifle of time, a minute or a minute and a half, and then he went into the house, and as I understood the soldier and Harvey, they endeavoured to take him to the Compter, but they all three came out together in a little space of time.</p>
               <p>Mr Fielding. Where did they pick you up? - Sir!</p>
               <p>When was it that the attorney or anybody in his business applied to you to come here? - I will tell you Sir, I was in bed, when I was sent to first, and I was called out to a job as I thought, when I went to the house where this attorney was, as I understood to be his attorney, and Mr. I do not know his name, who keeps the public-house, served me with a subpoenea, and gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Any thing to drink? - Yes, there was three pots of beer, this is three weeks ago, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was three weeks ago the first time that was you spoke to? - I never was spoke to, nor never had any imitation about this business.</p>
               <p>Do you commonly wear a white frock? - In general.</p>
               <p>You saw Newberry in the custody of Harvey in the streets? - I saw him in the street before he was in custody, and afterwards.</p>
               <p>What should have led you to the window then? - There was more noise before than there was after, he was in custody, there was an uproar about a robbery, that led me to the window, the man said he wanted his money.</p>
               <p>Court. That was publickly made a noise of about the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Newberry come home alone, or did anybody come home along with him? - I saw nobody come home along with him, but I saw him, I know him perfectly well, the street was wide to one person as well as to another.</p>
               <p>Did you see anybody go into the house along with Newberry? - No, Sir, he went in voluntarily of his own accord, as I could observe, I saw him plainly go in.</p>
               <p>Did any body go in with him or not? - I did not see any person, I did not see any person, I did not know the confidence of the affair, I never expected to come into any behalf till I was subpoenaed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. You remember the night that Lockell was robbed? - Very well I do.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the calling out to Harvey, constable, constable? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Gentlemen, I am now to solicit your attention at this late time of the day, to the case of the defendant that stands before you, and I am sure if it were to strike me as necessary to offer any apology to you for the time I must necessarily take, you would think that apology would be impertinent; for I am sure you will be heartily inclined to give a fair investigation to this case. Gentlemen, although I stand here an advocate for Harvey, and he has a right to expect the exert on of my feeble abilities; yet I go with the learned Judge who tried this cause, in all the observations I have heard him make on the crime of perjury: I perfectly agree that there is nor a crime more deserving punishment; that if committed in the extent suggested here, punishment should fall on the wretch without the accompanying commisseration of any one soul; for if it be true that the man standing before you has committed a wilful and corrupt perjury, on the trial of two men for their lives, my desire is that he should be punished with the utmost severity; at the same time you will be cautious of letting that indignation set aside the weight of the evidence necessary to criminate the person that you have before you: Gentlemen, I cannot say I feel the task upon me to-day of vindicating the defendant an arduous one; because added to the consciousness that I persuaded myself of before I came into the Court, of Mr. Harvey's innocence, I now am more and more confirmed of the propriety of that persuasion from the evidence that has been laid before you: Gentlemen, you know very well that to constitute the crime of perjury, the will must go with the action, and there must be a corrupt motive all through; and whereever therefore that crime is imputed to a man, you will necessarily enquire into the motive: Now what can be the motive of Mr. Harvey for the commission of this crime? Gentlemen, it is necessary for me to state to you a little more at large the nature of this trial, and the reason of Mr. Harvey's being now prosecuted for this as a perjury at the Old Bailey: two men, foreigners, Newberry and Iverson, were tried for a supposed robbery, committed on a man of the name of Lockell; Lockell, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140228"/> that trial was the prosecutor, and the man before you was the other witness; and my learned friend, with some little ingenuity I must say, introduced that circumstance to you, pointing where the evidence of Mr. Harvey became material, for he seems to suppose that you will be persuaded of Mr. Harvey's being conscious of such materiality of his evidence, when he told you that the materiality of the evidence depended on the circumstance of flight; if he could have established in proof a fabricated lye or falsehood, that would have been a different matter from what you have now to consider; but let not the guilt of the prosecutor Lockell lay at the door of Mr. Harvey; if Lockell was brought to justice, then every man would be satisfied and pleased with the verdict, but there is not the least idea, it is not insinuated that there is any privity at all between Harvey and Lockell, or that Harvey spoke to any other circumstance than merely the apprehension of these two men. Then, gentlemen, permit me to ask you, what could have induced Harvey to go a little beyond the truth in his evidence on this prosecution? I will tell you, because it is the only evidence that can be suggested, in hopes of gaining a part of the reward on their conviction; now, this is the circumstance they are to make out, that he, being apprised of the effect of a flight being given in evidence, had confined his perjury to that idea; trusting to that idea having the effect of convicting the two men at the bar. Gentlemen, that you may clearly understand the nature of this case, let me tell you the story of Mr. Harvey; he was the constable of Limehouse, and the evening, when this robbery was committed, about seven in the month of January, it was dark, he was at that time at home in his house, he was called out by the alarm of a robbery that had been committed; the person supposed to be robbed was very near at hand, and he saw him instantly: upon his coming up to him he told him that he knew the men that had perpetrated the crime, that one was Peter, and the other was Will; that he knew where Peter lodged, and in consequence of this information Harvey went to the house of Peter; now, part of this evidence, that you have heard in support of this prosecution is true, for it hardly ever will be the case, that witnesses will come before a court with a story that will be false throughout; Harvey went with this man to the house of Peter, he knocked; he was answered by a woman from above, and he got into the house; Peter was not to be found there; then Harvey went away; he went to a public house; he had not an idea of missing in this public house the person he went to look for, but as he was drinking a glass of liquor at the bar, Lockell, the prosecutor, from without, called out to him, constable, constable, there goes Peter; there had been a man that left the house merely on the arrival of Harvey, whether it was or was not Peter, I am not able to produce to you, more than the assertion of Harvey; Harvey thinks that man was the person; Lockell calling out to him, he necessarily followed; a chace took place; some times he had him in view, and some times he lost sight of him, but as the man was going towards the house of Goodman, Harvey took hold of him; Harvey's evidence say this, that he took the prisoner Newberry within ten yards of his door, but the evidence of the witnesses in opposition to this say, that Mr. Harvey did not take Newberry within ten yards of the door, but in the very house; now, how could it have entered into the mind of the man before you, that supposing there was a difference, supposing the fact to be, (which I deny) that he was taken in the house, and that Harvey had said he took him within ten yards of the door, could it have suggested itself to a mind like his, that any materiality would have depended on that part of his testimony? Does it strike you so? Here are two or three persons committing a robbery, and immediately one of them is pursued, not the least doubt of the person, the prosecutor swearing positively to his having committed the crime, and by he bye, suppose I say one word, as it is fair here, upon the supposed guilt of these women<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140229"/> that are now luckily pardoned; if the evidence of Lockell or his story had gone to complain of one man only as taking this property, I should have thought it fabricated, but when Lockell speaks of two men doing it, either of whom might have proved himself at a different place, I should presume there is a strong reason to suppose Lockell is not hasty in his opinion of these two men; his property was not much that he lost; he was extremely ill used; he was bleeding; they call you evidence to that, and that little boy said his face seemed as if it had been scratched by women; that circumstance convinced me that I had very little to expect from the ingenuousness of a boy so young; he says he is eighteen, perhaps he may, I am sure he possesses the craft of eighteen; but, however, now to return to the situation of Mr. Harvey: in taking this man within ten doors, what could have induced Harvey to have said more to the Court than that he took the man in custody; could it have appeared to him to be a material distinction, whether he had taken him within ten yards or ten feet, or in the house? But I am to call witnesses to you in support of that story that Mr. Harvey has told, and as to the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, I would recount their contradictions, if it was not that the extreme ingenuity of the learned Recorder will, I am sure, amply supply that defect; certain I am, however, that the boy is materially contradicted by the father; certain I am that the boy is materially contradicted by Mrs. Milledge, and it seems to me as if the only evidence I had to apprehend the least possibility of danger from was the evidence of Mrs. Brookes; for, I rely entirely, as to the other witnesses, on the observations which I am sure will be made by the learned Recorder. Mrs. Brookes standing up here, seeing her called on their part, I thought her a decent looking woman, coming with a child in her arms, I thought there would be more regard to truth; and altho' I observed confusion, I thought it did not signify: but, gentlemen, when I call your attention to the circumstance of the case, I am bold to say that her evidence cannot be true, if much of that evidence which has preceded it be true; therefore, wherever there are contradictions as they cannot be both true, the safer way I take it, is to reject such evidence entirely; if the evidence of Goodman be true, the evidence of Brookes is not true; if Brookes's is true, Goodman's is not true; the safer way, and that which has always been taken, as I conceive, by every Jury, is, to reject that testimony entirely; and therefore when I recur to this, that Harvey acted merely in his duty, and if he is here prosecuted without great foundation, deserves the compassion of every man in Court; when I say he has interfered only in his duty, and there cannot be any positive motive assigned to him, except that one of the reward; and when you take into your consideration the probability which yet remains of this robbery's being committed in fact; I say you will attend carefully to the evidence; I say you will dispassionately attend, never presuming guilt, always intending innocence, carefull to give weight to the evidence laid before you, but not to let it hastily involve a man in guilt. On the other side, the evidence I shall lay before you on the part of Harvey will be extremely satisfactory as to the beginning of this business; afterwards I shall lay before you in evidence, a character, which I am sure ought to have, in a case like this, the first weight; not that it will be necessary as I think for your verdict, but that he may return with honour and credit to his neighbourhood. I have the satisfaction of seeing a prosecution like this fairly contradicted and reprobated. The Recorder has with great liberality and ingenuity investigated this business, and he is still to lay before you the result of that testimony; I persuade myself that an equal attention will be paid to our witnesses, and I wish it should; if any of my witnesses should deserve a severity of treatment in cross examination, or if there is any suspicion of their veracity, I wish they may go under every possible trial; but if you think so, the acquittal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140230"/> of Mr. Harvey may perhaps lead to some investigation of the author of this business.</p>

               <p>Court. Give an exact account of all you heard and saw? - I know nothing at all of it, but that I saw him take a man in Vine-street; I recollect nothing that I heard besides.</p>
               <p>Where were you? - I cannot say whereabouts I was , I saw Harvey take hold of a man.</p>
               <p>Was it near the house? - No, it was near a pump.</p>
               <p>Did not your curiosity carry you a little further than that? - No Sir, my business called me away.</p>
               <p>Were there many people about in the street? - There might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you know Newberry? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know his person? - It was dark, he came to our house three days after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Once in your lifetime you saw Mr. Harvey take up a man in Vine-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me pay you the same compliment my learned friend has paid most of our witnesses; where did they pick you up for a witness, you are a notable one? - I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>When? - The 20th of September.</p>
               <p>Who first applied to you? - The subpoenea was brought to me, I was surprised.</p>
               <p>I rather supect that, you know that is no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140231"/> answer to my question; who first applied to you to be a witness for Mr Harvey; - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon that oath that you have taken, who first applied to you to be a witness for Harvey? - No body at all.</p>
               <p>Who subpoenaed you? - A boy brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that before that you had not talked to anybody on this subject? - No, Sir, nobody at all had advised me on the subject.</p>
               <p>Did I ask you about advice? - Nobody at all talked to me, I did not tell any body at all, I was not applied to at all to be a witness.</p>
               <p>You have sense enough to answer the question, do you mean to state to the Jury, that without anybody having applied to you, and without your having applied to any body, you are come to be a witness for Harvey? - I told no story, that is the true state of the case.</p>
               <p>Court. Do attend a little to the nature of the question, it is not whether anybody made any improper application to you to be a witness, but the meaning of the gentleman's question is this, how came Harvey or anybody concerned for Harvey to know that you could say anything upon this subject? - I do not know, I very likely may have said so, upon my honour I cannot tell you, I never troubled my head about the business, Mr, Harvey might have seen me there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not you see him there? - I saw him, but I do not know whether he saw me or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Cannot you fix the time when you saw this? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What month was it in? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is it a twelve-month ago, or is it two years ago? - I am sure I cannot tell you, I dare say it is not two years ago, but I cannot say how long ago it is.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell no nearer than that, can you tell whether it is seven years or a week? - I cannot say, there was a piece of work or a noise in the street on that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your evidence goes for nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What was the noise about? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you hear anything about it? - It was not so long ago as seven years, but I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Where do you live, young woman? - In Fore-street, Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Who with? - With my father and mother.</p>
               <p>What countryman is your father? - He is a Dane.</p>
               <p>Was your father willing you should come here to day? - Yes, if he had not I suppose I should not have come.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Harvey that very evening, that the very man he afterwards took hold off, was Peter? - Me! no, Sir. I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you call God to witness, girl? - I did not, no, I did not, I would not wish to tell a story for any man living.</p>

               <p>Court. You have heard the oath, it is to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; now if you answer to any question, and say you do not know it when you do, it is perjury? - I say, I do not know what that gentleman asked me.</p>
               <p>Was this that you saw three days ago, or three years? - I am very sensible it is more than three days.</p>
               <p>Was it so much as three years? - I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Was it two years? - Upon my honour I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath are not you sure it was less than two years ago? - I do not take my oath at all about it.</p>
               <p>But you must take your oath upon it, are not you sure that it was within these two years? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>If you do know, I only tell you that you are perjured, and liable to be punished? - But I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Go about your business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Ah! go about your business.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>What is the estimate of Mr. Harvey's honesty? - A very good one.</p>
               <p>Harvey. I have a great many more witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, as far as evidence has weight, we are to take this man's character to be a very good one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Gentleman, I shall only take up two minutes of your time; on behalf of the prosecution seven witnesses have been called, who have sworn positively to the man's being taken within the house, and that into that house he went a volunteer; some contradictions have arisen, not very necessary for me to repeat, as the Recorder will make his observations very attentively and accurately, as he always does, which will (as they ought) have much more weight with him than any observations that can be made by me; only one observation strikes me, which is, that though several contradictions relative to trifling circumstances have arisen in the course of the evidence, they might be the effect of want of memory, not of design: after having said that, let me advert to the evidence that has been called by the defendant, his character is as good as can be; however there are times when a man forfeits a good character; and, permit me to observe, that the evidence which he has called by way of defence amounts to nothing; recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140234"/> in the first place, the evidence that he gave on the trial; now the evidence of the master of the publichouse is this, that he and Harvey walked to the door together, and I take it that had Peter been there, it was impossible but he must have seen him pass by him; whereas the master tells you, that he saw this man, who he says Harvey took on the other side of the way; and his other witnesses flatly contradict each other: Gentlemen, this is the case requiring a great deal of your cool deliberation which I am sure you will give it, if you are satisfied that the prisoner is not guilty, you will acquit him; if you are clearly convinced of his guilt, you must be under a necessity of convicting him.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this trial has taken up a great deal of your time and and attention; but not one moment longer than justice requires; for you have been called upon this indictment to decide upon as important an enquiry as can well come before a Jury and Court of Justice: the prisoner is indicted for perjury; a crime in itself, and under all the circumstances, where it is wilfully and intentionally committed, with a corrupt intention, of very great magnitude; a crime that cuts up by the roots the only bond of confidence that can subsist between man and man, and the only security that we can have for the due administration of justice both between party and party, and between the public and those that are accused of the crimes; but if a perjury of itself, is a crime of such magnitude, when we consider the circumstances under which the present defendant stands charged with that crime it raises it to a height still greater; for the perjury that is charged against the defendant, is stated to have been by him committed upon the trial of two men for a capital felony, and the evidence given against these men, is charged to be false, and to have been knowingly and corruptly given; and therefore if that is true, the whole catalogue of crimes does not contain one of greater enormity, for though, in the denomination of law, such an evidence, if the event of it should be to take away the life of an innocent person, does not come under the legal description of murder: yet, in point of malignity, it seems to be a murder of the foulest die. The question therefore for you to decide this day is, whether the defendant has in defiance of the laws of God and man, committed in the face of his country, knowingly and corruptly, a perjury, with a view to take away the lives of two innocent persons; or whether an innocent man having appeared for the sake of public justice on a former occasion, stands charged with a crime of so much enormity: you therefore will not grudge your time and attention in this enquiry; it has been stated to you in the opening of this business, that from persuasion of the falsehood of the evidence given on the trial of two men, Newberry and Iverson, they have since, upon great deliberation, and with the intervention of those concerned in a judicial capacity, obtained the King's pardon for the offence: the first part of my duty therefore is to tell you that you ought to lay that out of the question; and not to let it make the smallest impression on your minds, for there might be just and wise reasons for that pardon, without the smallest imputation on the truth perhaps of all the witnesses, but certainly of Harvey's testimony; for though his evidence was necessary, yet the truth of that evidence is perfectly consistent with the innocence of both the prisoners; and that that circumstance may be wholly erased from your minds, I think it right to let you know that a conviction of truth or falsehood of Harvey's evidence never came under consideration, when that pardon was the subject of deliberation, but it arises from circumstances in which the account given by Lockell, with respect to himself and his own situation at the time, threw such a suspicion on his testimony, that it was thought unsafe to run the risque of executing two men on the evidence of a single witness, who stood impeached and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140235"/> contradicted: you, gentlemen, are called here to decide, whether the defendant has sworn falsely in the evidence he gave on the trial, and if he did, whether it was done with a corrupt intention: the latter question, which is always the material one to constitute the crime of perjury, will depend on your attention to the nature of the cause, and of the evidence given, and I will therefore state to you, from the indictment, the evidence which Harvey has now been proved to have given on the trial of Newberry and Iverson.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge repeated the evidence as read by the Short-hand Writer.)</p>
               <p>Now, it is manifest, that the effect of this evidence at the time was to shew a consciousness of guilt in Newberry, and to confirm the testimony of Lockell, for the sum of the evidence of Harvey was, that when he went in quest of Newberry, Newberry slipt out of the public house when he saw the prosecutor come in, and that he actually ran away from him, and escaped, and that he actually took him at some small distance from his lodgings; the effect of that evidence was to shew, that Newberry fled from justice, which is always considered as a circumstance of guilt; then the indictment charges that the evidence was false; that he did not run after him at all, nor did he run away; that he did not keep running, or go into a little alley; and that he did not take Peter about ten yards from his lodgings, but, in fact, he did take him in custody immediately on his coming into his lodgings; now, the evidence given by Harvey on the trial being material in the light I have stated to you, if you believe it to be false, it is difficult to suppose that he could have been mistaken, for it was a fact within his own knowledge, and which it was his particular duty as a constable to attend to, therefore if it was false, and if, instead of pursuing him, and taking him in the street, he never, in fact, pursued him, but took him in his lodgings; Harvey must have known it was false, and if he did, I believe you will not find much difficulty in concluding, that a person, who knowingly gives false evidence against a prisoner, must necessarily do it with an evil and corrupt intention: the principal question therefore for you to decide in this case seems to be, whether the evidence given by Harvey upon this trial was true or false; for if false, the nature of it seems to leave very little room to doubt tha t Harvey must know it, and give it with a corrupt intention; but if it was true, he is an innocent man: the principal question is therefore this, and that upon which the present trial turns, whether you believe, on the whole of the evidence, that he took him in the street, or that he took him in his lodgings? for the story told on the part of the present prosecution certainly does, instead of shewing the consciousness of guilt in Newberry, shew the direct contrary; that Harvey being searching for him at his lodgings, he went home to those lodgings voluntarily, into the very hands of the people that were in quest of him; and that, in that very house, Harvey being in quest of him, took him; a great number of witnesses has been called, most of whom have positively swore to the fact, that Harvey did take Newberry in his lodgings, and not elsewhere; but in swearing to that fact, they have been called upon to state the circumstances; and it is one of the principal advantages in the mode of administering justice in this country, that the examinations of the witnesses are publicly conducted in the presence of the parties themselves, their counsel and agents, as well as the courts of justice, so than an opportunity is given of not resting satisfied with swearing merely to a fact, which, if the depositions were taken in writing, he might do, but there is an opportunity of enquiring into all the cases attending that fact, in order both to judge of the probability and consistency, and to compare that testimony with those circumstances, and with the evidence of other witnesses examined to the same fact; and it is not because one or two, or ten witnesses, positively swear to a particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140236"/> fact, that a Jury are bound to rely on that evidence, on the contrary, they are called upon to exercise their own understanding, and apply it, and fist out the truth by the comparison of the testimony of the different witnesses, and by an attentive consideration of the evidence that has been related: you will therefore judge for yourselves upon the whole, which of the two facts you believe, to wit, that this man, Newberry, was taken in his lodgings or in the street.

            , a young looking lad, and his evidence is, that Lockell and Harvey came to the door of his father's house, and knocked at the door; that his mother opened the window, and asked what was the matter; and upon their telling her they wanted Peter, but not what for, she came down, and opened the door for them, and that after going into the house, they went away again; and that when they did go away he himself knowing where Peter was gone to, went to tell him that these people had been after him to take him up, and to advise him to keep out of the way, that he met Newberry a short way from the house and he gave him that advice, but he trusting in his own innocence would go home; the witness went home with him, Lockell and Harvey were returned to the house, and took Newberry as soon as he came into the house, so that by his account they were twice in the house, and had gone away in the intermediate time, and he had taken the opportunity to go and apprize Newberry that they were in pursuit of him; in order to fist the matter more fully, he was much further cross examined, and the first enquiry will be how far the account he gave on his first examination is confirmed or rendered probable by his own testimony on cross-examination; the next enquiry will be how far it is consistent with or contradictory to the evidence of the other witnesses, on the part of the prosecution, he said the door of the house was quite open, and added, their door always stood always open; he describes himself as going out to look for Peter, and his meeting him within not more than the length of this Court off his own door, they not stopping or going anywhere else, but returning directly back, but he says that Harvey and Lockell came twice, and that they went after the first search to a public house, and were come down again and near the bottom of the stairs when he came back with

            ; now it is scarcely possible that this account can in all these circumstances be correctly true, for if they came twice, and went up stairs with a view of searching for them, and his father went with them to the public house their enquiries there, their return, their going up stairs again to make a second search, and coming down again, all must have passed according to his account, within the time that the witness would be walking the length of this Court: when he first said the door stood always open, I dare say it would not suggest to your minds that it was latched, and if it stood always open Lockell must have known it, and therefore would not knock at a door which he knew was always open. The evidence of Stones does not very materially differ from the account given by the boy, he speaks only to the last time of Lockell and Harvey going into the house, he rather increases the time, he says on his cross-examination that Peter came home by himself, and shoved the door open with his left hand; Goodman the father swears that the boy was up stairs till he came back from the Pink, and then he went down stairs, and was absent a few minutes; it is very remarkable that the evidence of the father, whose knowledge if they were relating a true fact, would be more likely to coincide with the son than other witnesses, is more directly contrary to him than any other witness, he describes the time between the first and second search very considerable, he makes it from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes between the first time of their coming and the time of their apprehending Newberry; but he directly contradicts the evidence of the boy. The story therefore of the father and the boy cannot both be true: by the account of Reynolds,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140237"/> instead of their coming and enquiring for Peter without alarming the house, there was an uproar about a robbery, the man talked about his money, so that the idea suggested by his evidence, and that of the father and the son, who swore he only guessed they wanted Peter, is extremely different. The boy mentioned nothing of Peter's stopping at the side of the door to listen; Brookes also contradicts the boy; the boy says they were upon the stairs near the bottom of the stairs, when he and Newberry went in, and that he saw them the moment he came to the door; the other witness, Mr. Stones, says, they were in the lower room, and this Mrs. Brooks says they were quite upstairs out of sight when Peter came, and that they did not come down stairs till Harvey was called down; another important contradiction is, that if these men came but once, the whole story told by the boy and the father, which is so contradictory in every other respect, must be a fabrication as to the twice coming; here are seven witnesses on the part of the prosecution, who all positively swear, that the man was taken in the house, but in relating the circumstances under which he was taken, it is hardly possible to conceive greater variety in the examination of witnesses, or in the different parts of the examination of the same witnesses. You are to judge whether you think these contradictions could occur in a story that was absolutely true, whether they arise from witnesses speaking to different facts, or whether they arise from witnesses coming to speak one fact, and not being prepared for questions that they have been forced to answer, you will judge. The general observation is with respect to the propriety of the whole story, whether it is likely that this man Lockell, in search of a man, truly or falsely, that he said had robbed him, should go and knock at a door he knew was open. No observation can arise against the defendant from the evidence of

            , but if it did make any impression, it must be the other way; there are witnesses who are called to confirm the evidence originally given by Harvey at the Old Bailey; you are to judge whether you think it likely that a man of that character, for the mere hope of sharing in the reward of blood, should have been wilfully guilty of such a crime; you will take the whole into your consideration; you will take the positive evidence and the contradiction, and whether that is to be imputed to the defect of memory or to fabrication; if you are satisfied that this is not a story against the defendant, but that in point of fact the man was really taken in the house notwithstanding all the contradictions of their evidence; in that case it is a crime of an enormous magnitude, and loudly calls for punishment. If on the other hand, you think that the circumstances of the case, together with the evidence that has been called in support of the testimony of the defendant, though not so numerous as the witnesses for the prosecution, yet tell a story more probable and consistent in itself, and without those contradictions which occur in the evidence for the prosecution, in that case you will find a satisfaction in acquitting the defendant, and restoring him to that credit which he has formerly enjoyed, and it is to be sure a most painful consideration, on the one hand, that a man of an extraordinary character should have been for a very small temptation, guilty of a crime of the blackest die; or that on the other hand, a most wicked conspiracy has been framed falsely to accuse him of that offence.</p>
