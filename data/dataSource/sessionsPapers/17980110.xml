             sworn. - I live at Southgate: I looked after the Woolpack public-house for a man in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any cattle coming to that house at any time? - A. Yes, four or five, about the latter end of July, as near as I can judge; there were two cows, I did not particularly notice them, but there was a fat beast.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the person that brought them to your house? - A. I do not know his name; I never saw him but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he the person that brought them there? - A. No, the man seemed to be a drover; and he wanted the cows to be in the yard a little while, while he went round to the gentlemen's houses to see if he could sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it? - A.Between ten and eleven in the morning; he was gone an hour and a half, or two hours, and then came back with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is the prisoner's house from your house? - A.About two miles and a half; they went into the yard and looked at the two cows that were in the yard, and Reynolds asked him the price, and he asked him twenty-two guineas for them, and he bid him twenty pounds, he would not let him have them; he then dropped to one-and-twenty, and the man persuaded me to get him to have them, because they were a good bargain; I told him, then he must drop half-a-guinea lower; at last they agreed for twenty-one-guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him pay for them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these cows since? - A. Yes; they went away together, and drove them towards Edmonton; the drover said he had got more cattle on the road that he wanted to meet; I saw these cows yesterday morning at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they the same cows that the prisoner agreed with the drover for? - A. Yes, they are she same.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any knowledge of the value of cattle, to say whether it was a fair price? - A. No, I am no judge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You did not see the money paid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you may know that, in point of fact, no money ever was paid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this was a counterfeit sale? - A. I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any thing to cause you to believe that all that bargain was counterfeit? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear any thing said to that effect? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any thing about it, whether it was counterfeit or real? - A. I never heard any talk about it, I think it was real, in my judgment, because I always believed him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw these cows yesterday morning? - A. At Bedfont, a boy was driving them to the common.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was it you saw them? - A. About ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken for the express purpose of seeing if they were the same cows that you had seen at your house? - A. Yes; I went down on purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What were the marks of these cows? - A. One was a red and white pole cow, the other yellow.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A.About three quarters of a year; I live two miles and a half from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A cordwainer.</p>
               <p>Q.What is he? - A. I do not know; only he used to sell milk, and go to day-labour.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of St. Martin's in the fields: On Saturday, the 6th of this month, the prosecutor brought the woman into the watch-house, he had hold of her right hand; he charged her with robbing him of a guinea and some silver; he said nothing about a seven-shilling piece, to my knowledge, at the time he charged her; I then took her down into the watch-house hole below, she was rather obstreperous, and I was obliged to get the beadle and watchman to hold each hand while I searched her pocket; in consequence of searching her pocket, I found a guinea, four shillings and sixpence in silver, two pennyworth of halfpence, and a seven-shilling piece covered up in this piece of paper, (produces the money); she said, there are three shillings of my own there; I then took her up stairs, and wrote the charge in the book; while I was writing the charge. she wished me to give him his money back, and let her go about her business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was saving up my money to redeem some things; the guinea I had sent from a person in the City, towards getting my things again; and half-a guinea I had had a fortnight; going along I saw this man, he wanted me to go along with him, and I would not; and he pulled me about, and broke my apron-string; and the constable used me very ill; it was my own money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at all perceive him take this gown? - A. I had not the smallest idea of it, I had had it in my hands not two minutes before; I had laid it upon a place that we have under the counter to be sent up stairs, and after we have done business the lad carries up the goods again; it was fetched down for a customer, it was the wrong one, and had not been carried up again.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of the capital part; it is not a shop, it is a pledge, not an article for sale, and cannot come within the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I thought so myself, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it within his reach? - A. Yes, just over the counter; I was going to the watch-house, I left him in custody of the watchman to go back for the gown; when I returned, I did not see either watchman or man, but was pursuing my way to the watch-house; just at the end of Chancery-lane I secured him, after a great deal of resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much wounded with that resistance? - A. Yes, very much; my hand is not well now, it was sewed up in four places; and he cut me very much over the eyes.</p>

               <p>JAMES BERRY, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I live on Sunbury-common, near East Bedfont: I did not know that I had lost any sheep till I had an application on the 7th of December from the constable of Staines; I sent my servant with the officer to Staines to look at the sheep; I was present when my stock was examined the next morning, about eight o'clock, when we missed two ewe sheep; the officer of Staines brought back the two sheep that I had lost about eleven o'clock the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q.Were those your sheep that were so brought back? - A.They were; the prisoner at the bar has been employed by me for some time, but not at the time of the robbery; he was a shepherd employed by my farmer, and looked after them when they were sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Who marked your sheep? - A. The prisoner marked them, and sheared them; the mark is a B surrounded by a ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner was not a servant of your household? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you know of any other sheep with the same mark upon the common? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know a little about age, perhaps-what age were these? - A. What we call two years sheep.</p>

I am a butcher at Egham: The prisoner came, on Sunday the 3d of December, to the Nag's-head, at Egham, in company with his son, and sent for me from the King's-head, I was at a vestry; I went to him, his son was fuddled, and very rude, and I could not have any conversation with him; then he himself appeared to be very sober, I told him to come out of doors, I would have nothing to do with his son he was so rude; he accordingly came out, and told me he could help me to some mutton; I asked him whose they were, or what they were; he made me no answer to that, but said, he could help me to some at half its value; he then said, would I have them dead or alive; I told him I had rather have them alive, and then I could kill them myself; he said the sheep belonged to a gentleman, that they were turned out upon the common without counting, and he could help me to some at any time; he asked me how many I would have; I said two; he said, I might as well have three, and he would get them up on the Wednesday following;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100007"/>I asked him at what time; and he said, at nine o'clock, at his house in Bedfont-lane, that was all that passed on the Sunday; accordingly I went on the Wednesday to the prisoner's house, having first gone to Sir

No, not near the value of them; I then got into the cart, and drove away; when I had got to the turnpike, I stopped my horse, got out of the cart, and returned back to his house; I met him at the corner of the house, put a pistol to his breast, and told him he was my prisoner, he must go along with me; by that time the constable, Bridger, came up, and we took him, and put him into the cart along with the sheep, and drove to Staines; on Thursday, the 7th, we took him to Sir

               <p>Q.And it was not till Wednesday that he was to get them up? - A. It was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by getting them up, getting them off the common? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say as you had just come out of the church, that you had goodness and charity enough to say to him, why, no, don't you go and rob your neighbour? - A. No, I did not think any thing about it at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q.You had just come from church, had not you? - A. No; I was at the public-house, I had not been at church that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it a bad thing then, that he should steal his neighbour's sheep? - A. I thought it was a bad thing, and I thought it right to detect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him not to go on in that way, that it was bringing himself, body and soul, to destruction? - A. I did not think of giving him a caution at that time, because he had told me he had had some before.</p>

               <p>Q. You must not tell us what passed between you and him? - A. On the Wednesday following, in Charter-house-square, I met Mrs. Carney, a person I never saw before in my life, I was very sure that the bonnet she had on was one that was made at our shop; she passed me, and I came back, and begged her pardon, and said, Madam, pray did you buy that bonnet in Cornhill, that was the satin bonnet; she said, no, Sir; but pray why do you make this enquiry of me; I asked her if she knew Mrs. Hilliard; she said, no; I said, I cannot let you go, I will treat you like a gentleman, but I cannot let you go till I know where you had this bonnet; she went with me, and told me she would take me to where she had the bonnet; she took me to a two pair of stairs room in Grub-street, to the room of a Mrs. Clements; there was a conversation between them, and they said, they were willing to come forward to bring the prisoner at the bar to justice; Mrs. Clements said, she had it of the prisoner; I left the satin bonnet at a gentleman's house in Bunhill-row, Mr. Bellamy's, who is not here, and it remained there till the Thursday; the next day, when we went before a Magistrate, a young man brought it to the Magistrate, whose name is Madder.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it to be the same bonnet? - A. I know it by the make of the bonnet; and the caul had been cut by Mrs. Carney to get her head into it.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say, with certainly, that that is the bonnet that was upon the table when the prisoner was there? - A. I believe it was, and I have no doubt of it; I will not swear positively that it is, but I will positively swear it is a bonnet that was made at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many may you have made of that sort? - A. Thirty or forty, more or less.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am incapable, from indisposition created by the horrid confinement of a prison, of entering into a long detail of defence; I shall only state (here the prisoner swooned away, upon recovering himself, he proceeded as follows): I beg the attention of the Court for a few moments: My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am incapable, from indisposition created by the horrid confinement of a prison, of entering into a long detail of defence, nor is it my wish, in a case which has originated in my own imprudence; I hope for mercy from God, and this Court; I never did an act with any intention of dishonesty; I look to you, my Lord, and the prosecutor, for mercy; I have been guilty of a very great error, but as to having done it with any intention of dishonesty, I never did; it has been occasioned by speculating, which has caused me to do that which is against my heart; as I now stand at this bar, I hope you will look upon me as a youth unexperienced in vice, it is the first false step I have ever taken: Under these circumstances, I hope I shall not be looked upon as one who has often appeared at this bar. My Lord, I can proceed no further, I rely entirely upon the mercy of the Court, the prosecutor, you, my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury; I hope for mercy, knowing the generous disposition of a British Court and Jury; I throw myself upon your mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Had your master endeavoured to persuade him to confess? - A. No; he had not; my master then sent me for a constable; I fetched the constable, and while he and my master went to search, I staid with the prisoner; there was a gentleman in the house besides; they came down again to fetch the prisoner, for they could not find them; I went up with them, and just as I had got to the top of the yard, where she hay-lost was, they were found in a bag, the prisoner was present when it was examined; there were two coats and a waistcoat, one was a great coat, and the other a superfine close coat; we then went into the house again, and then I asked him where the other coat was, and he denied knowing any thing about it; then we had him to the cage; the other great coat was found by the landlord, he is not here.</p>

Yes; by a girl in the yard; the things were found at the very instant that I brought the prisoner to the place; I did not hear any conversation with the prisoner; the things were put into my possession, and they were carried before the Magistrate the next day, when they were marked by Mr. Cosier, and delivered to me; I delivered them to Mr. Cosier, he has had the custody of them ever since.(The clothes produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Cosier. I had cut them all out myself, I know them to be mine; the Bath-coating great coat I helped to work myself, till six o'clock in the evening, that Saturday; and this superfine coat I helped to make that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of the things; I was up in the lost dressing the horses; I was up there two hours, and the lost window was open all that time; when I had done, I locked the stable door and the lost window; and the next morning, I fed the horses, and went up to the farm, and did my milking; I brought home my milk, and went up and unlocked the lost window and the stable door, and they were open about an hour and a half; and then I went in to have my breakfast; and as soon as I went in, and stood by the fire, Mr. Cosier<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100016"/>came in; I said to Mr. Cosier, you have had a very bad loss to-night; he clapped his hand upon my shoulders, and said I was his prisoner; I said, what for, and he said I knew what for, and then he sent for a constable; whilst

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You do not begin bricklayer's work so early as that on the 27th of November? - A. Being a very light morning I got up, thinking it was day-light.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps it was moon-light, the first quarter of the moon was the 26th; now what sort of light was it? - A.(Hesitates).</p>

               <p>Q. How far is this barn from your house? - A. I believe, about an hundred and twenty yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you found it was not day-light, how came you to ramble so far? - A. That is not far, in the country.</p>

               <p>Q. He had no business in Mr. Davis's barn, or upon those premises? - A. I never knew that he had any connection with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from Mr. Davis's? - A. Better than three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. As you saw him coming out of this barn with a sack, how soon did you tell Davis of it; did you tell him of it for a week? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A fortnight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Three weeks? - A. It was the day before Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>Q. And not before? - A. No; but I had to another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps this man staid at his own house till he was taken up? - A. I cannot say; he did not that I know of; I know he was taken at Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there might be a quarrel between you and this man? - A. I never passed three words with him after he had been guilty of the action.</p>
               <p>Q. And, perhaps, you had never paid him what you owed him after he was guilty of the action? - A. I did not know that it was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife tell you he had been there, and was very troublesome? - A. I was not at home if he did come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife tell you he had been there for his money? - A. Yes, she did tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Davis of it till after your wife had told you that he had been troublesome, and insisted upon his money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Thomas Dobson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you say to him that you would send this man out of the country? - A. I did not, to my knowledge; I do not remember that I said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Dobson is here - now will you swear that you did not? - A. I cannot swear that I did not, nor that I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You have heard of it in the public-house over the way, perhaps? - A. I have not been there much; I have heard several people speak of it, but I cannot recollect any particular person.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard it from a great many people of whom you are perfectly ignorant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the reward is, in this case? - A. No; I do not know who it goes to.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that you are to have a share of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You come here, no doubt, for the public good? - A. Yes, as a soldier ought to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if the Recorder should think you entitled to any share of it, you will refuse it, as a soldier ought to do? - A. As a soldier ought to do.</p>

             sworn. - I lodge in the prisoner's house; I was present when the serjeant and corporal came to his house, he lives in the front room; the serjeant said, I do not want you, you must go up again, and I went up directly; I came down again the next morning, and his wife tied the things up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing himself? - A. No; the things that she gave me, were a pair of half gaiters, a regimental book, three pepper-casters, and four tops; I took them to serjeant Gill, before he was out of bed; I gave them to him, and told them one by one; I will take my oath, that I brought but three pepper-casters up, and when the serjeant brought them before the Justice, there were four; there had been one put in after I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were in the house, and heard the bustle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man had been crying for mercy, you would have been in a situation to hear him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him? - A. No, I did not; I stood listening at the door ever so long, but did not hear any such word.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have heard it, if there had been any such thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desired by any body to swear there were more than three pepper casters? - A. No; the serjeant said, here is all you brought, and I said, serjeant, I brought but three casters, and here are four; and he said, well, there they are, I do not know how they came there.</p>
               <p>Q. But you swear you brought but three? - A. No more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said before, that when the serjeant told you he did not want you, you went up stairs immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not listen there? - A. Yes, I did stop some time.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gill). Q. Did you see the four casters? - A. The handkerchief never was opened after he brought it me; I never opened it till it came to the office.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is it true that he told them out one by one? - A. No, he did not; he put down the handkerchief, and said, there are some things that Evans's wife has sent you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. At the Magistrate's, did he put them down one by one, that is what he has sworn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Milton. I put them down one by one in his room, and I asked him separately, if they were his, and he said, yes; there were three pepper-casters and four tops.</p>
               <p>Court. There are but three casters in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Gill). Q. Do you mean to swear they were never opened in your room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Milton. He opened the window-shutters in the front street, and I said, I have brought some things here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the handkerchief, and shew him them one by one? - A. Yes; in his own room, upon his own trunk; he was then in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see you do that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he look at you when he was talking to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have seen you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You held up the articles and shewed them to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Holding them up directly one by one? - A. Yes; in both hands.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the office in Queen-square, Westminster; On the 14th of December last, I was sent for to the First Regiment Hospital, to take the prisoner; I took him from there to the office; I searched him, and found a metal watch-case and part of the works, and a pair of leather gloves; I afterwards went to his apartments, No. 7, Little Canterbury-place, there I found a pair of regimental gloves, a regimental shirt, three hat feathers, and some implements of house-breaking, a saw, a large borer, and a chiffel that is broke; I tried it with the door, and it matches where he broke the door open; I suppose there are a dozen marks of a chiffel upon the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Let me look at these things, did you never see such things before? - A. Yes; a great number of houses have been broke open with such things, lately, in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not such things to be seen in every carpenter's shop? - A. Yes; but he does not appear to have been in that line.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as ignorant, I take it, of a forty pounds reward, as the other witnesses? - A. I am wife enough to know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation about the reward to-day? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a single word has escaped your honest lips? - A. Not a word; I have been to get two more bills; I had not been much with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What are those bills, have they rewards belonging to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you shall be entitled to a share of the reward? - A. I do not know that there is a share allowed yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think you will be entitled to a part of it? - A. Yes; I should look upon it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give directions for this indictment? - A. Mr. serjeant Kirby ordered it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present at the time the indictment was given instructions for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you write the instructions, now? - A.No, I did not; only our names to the back of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the clerk of the indictments what you meant to indict for, whether for forgery, highway robbery, sheep stealing, or murder? - A. He asked what time of night it was, what was lost, and what was the value of the things, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, you gave no instructions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when the corporal gave the account of the things that were lost? - A. I was backwards and forwards, but I gave no instructions.</p>
               <p>Gill. The two cases and part of a watch I can swear to; and the two first letters of my name are upon two of my shirts, and the other I know; upon one of the shirts there is a D and two eights, upon another there are two eights and a figure of four, and upon the other shirt there are two G's and three ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the memorandum book, is there any writing in it that you know it by? - A. Yes; there were a great many receipts and papers in it when I lost it, and when it came back, they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.What is the value of that book? - A. It is of great value to me; but, I suppose to any body else, it is not worth above sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. D and two eights are not your initials? - A. It is my shirt, it was given to me by my wife's brother; I have had it almost two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish that from another shirt with a D and two eights? - A. Yes, from my wearing it; and it may have some holes in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mark them yourself? - A. Yes; I did mark the other two, myself, with India-ink.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men have you in your regiment? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no other man that may have the same mark of two G's in the regiment? - A. I do not know, there may be more.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these three shirts? - A. They may be worth, mayhap, three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long have you had that watch-case? - A. I suppose, ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a common metal case? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing? - A. No, only it is broke to pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know the prisoner is a soldier? - A. Yes; he has only been in the regiment eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if he followed any business? - A. I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going past the end of serjeant Gill's house and found the two bundles, I went home, and had not been home an hour when serjeant Gill, and the corporal came in; they asked me how long I had been at home; I told the serjeant near an hour; he said it was a lie, for he had seen me within that time; he asked me whose hat that was; and I told him my brother's; he then collared me, and said, you villain, you have robbed me; I told him I would give him the shirts; him and the corporal took me to his house, and called a woman, who said she spoke to me, and saw me in the room; I saw no more of serjeant Gill till the next day, when he came with the officer to take me to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who had known him ten years, and gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live in Cheyne-street, Bedford-square; I have known the prisoner some time, he has been a customer of mine for several years; he applied to me to lend him four or five pounds the latter end of August of beginning of September, or if I could not, if I would accept a bill for him, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that? - A. That is the bill I accepted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he provide you with any money for the purpose of this bill? - A. The bill was due on Saturday the 18th, I think, and on the Tuesday preceding, I was serving some customers, he told me the bill was almost due, and said, because he would not put me to any inconvenience to find the money myself, he had provided the money as he had promised me, and laid me down three five pound Bank-notes; he told me there was the fifteen pounds, and I believe, went out of the shop immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of those three notes? - A. I looked at them to see that they were properly signed, I folded them up, and put them into a pocket-book, and in the course of the week, I made several payments, but whether I had those notes when the banker's clerk came to me, I do not know, but I rather think I had; when the note came to me, it was brought by a banker's clerk, I think from the house of Glynn.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pay him in Bank-notes? - A. I paid him all in Bank-notes, but whether they were the same three or not, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. There was nothing in that saltpetre itself, by which you can undertake to swear to it? - A. There is a great difference in the fineness; I believe there is no one in town, but Mr. Strong, in Clement's-lane, and myself, who make it so fine; I cannot pretend to swear to it, but I really believe it is mine, it is remarkably well refined, the prisoner was my servant, and had been so about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all employed about the places where the saltpetre was? - A. He drove my cart, and had access to every part of the house; he was in my employment at the time I saw the advertisement, he had been with me from July 1796.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you sent him out with any refined saltpetre a short time before the 3d of January? - A.Every week, and almost every day; we have it from the Company's warehouses, in order to refine it, but this was refined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to send your saltpetre out in bags of this description? - A. No; in casks of a hundred weight each to druggists, oilmen, grocers, and other tradesmen, and some in papers of a quarter of a hundred sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. But never sent it out in these sort of bags, which had brought almonds to your house? - A. Never; they were used for getting beans and barley for my horses, or other common purposes, I have had them four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Your only reason for knowing the bag, is that mark of Smith and company, and the figure? - A. Yes; Smith and company is in red, and the figure in black.</p>
               <p>Q. That name and figure was upon them, when you bought them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And consequently might be upon hundreds besides? - A. It might.</p>

            , in Whitechapel-road, an oil and colourman; on the 28th of December, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and offered some saltpetre to sell contained in this bag; I knew him by sight, and had dealt with him before for articles of the same kind, which he brought in a paper bag.</p>
               <p>Q.Refined saltpetre? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Well refined? - A. I am not a judge of the niceties of saltpetre; I have been in the habit of selling saltpetre in London these seven years, it was refined saltpetre; the last time he came, when he brought the bag, I went up and told my master, he desired me to ask him his name, what he was, who he was, and where he lived; I came down stairs, and asked him these questions; he said, his name was Jones, he lived in Brick-lane, and was a saltpetre refiner; I got a pen and ink, and desired him to write it down, and he did; I went up stairs, and gave my master the paper, and told him what he said, my master told me to go down stairs, and tell him he would not buy it; I came down, and told him so, he swore he would not take it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hint why you refused to buy it? - A. None at all; he said, he would call again for the saltpetre in a day or two, I think, but he did not, the saltpetre remained in the shop where he had left it; I went the next morning to enquire, in Brick-lane, but could hear of no such person there, a saltpetre refiner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Brick-lane from Whitechapel? - A.Brick-lane comes into Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, if there had been any such person as a refiner in Brick-lane, you must have known it? - A. No; we do not deal largely in it, we do not buy it of the refiners; finding no such person, we applied to the Police-office, Lambeth-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100026"/>Whitechapel, and the officers took the bag away from the shop to the office; I marked the bag with a brush, and sealed it, before it was delivered to the officer with the saltpetre in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much may you have bought of the prisoner at different times? - A. From ninety to one hundred pounds weight.</p>
               <p>Q.Without any enquiry till this last time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any suspicion of him? - A. Yes, we had, but we had nothing to identify it till this bag came, with the mark of E. Smith and Company, No. 13. We could not find any body in London of that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine Directories? - A. No; but we enquired of tradesmen, both chymists, oilmen and druggists; it was advertised from the office, and on Thursday, Mr. Jones claimed the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.There was nothing particular in this saltpetre, except that it was refined saltpetre? - A. Yes; it is rather larger than common, and of a brighter colour than common, it is finer.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not such saltpetre as you can swear to on account of its fineness? - A. I think I could swear to that in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time it was in your shop, the shop was open to all sorts of customers, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were sometimes in and sometimes out? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. (Produces the property). I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel office: On Wednesday, the 3d of this month, the prosecutor applied for a warrant to search the prisoner's lodgings; he procured a warrant, and in company with Nolan, I went to execute that warrant; I went to the prosecutor's house, in a court in Ratcliff-highway, he gave me charge of the prisoner at the bar, I did not search his apartment; I took the prisoner into custody, and brought him to the office; I asked him what he had been about, that should induce his master to give charge of him to me, the poor fellow fell a crying, and said, it was concerning a little saltpetre; I had not before acquainted him with what the charge was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make him any promises of favour? - A. I did not, I knew it would be contrary to my duty so to do; I asked how he got it, and if any person was concerned with him; he said, no; seeing so many persons concerned with the premises, I asked him how he could get it without being perceived; he said, he took it while they were at dinner; I asked him what he had done with it, and he said, he had sold it at a shop in Whitechapel; I asked him, if he had sold any before; he said, he had sold a little twice, but not so much as this; I then brought him to the office, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after Mr. Jones had been to the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He had heard from Mr. Jones what he was taken up for? - A.He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you gave him no encouragement to say what he did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones). What sort of a character did he bear? - A. A very good one, or I would not have kept him; he has a wife and two small children.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bag? - A. I can swear to the figure 13, the saltpetre is as much like mine as it can be.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HARTSIDE sworn. - I am a smith: I never saw the prisoner till I took him, it was on a Friday; I took him in Church-lane, Whitechapel, with the glass upon him, about a mile from Mr. Derry's house; I had heard that he had taken a glass from Mr. Derry's and I pursued him; when I took hold of him, I said, my friend, how did you come by this glass; he immediately replied, he had bought it, and paid for it; I held him till the owner of the glass came up; as soon as Mr. Derry saw the glass, he said it was his; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know how long a time took place between the time you heard of the loss and the time you took the prisoner? - A.Half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.Then of course, when you set out upon your pursuit, you saw nothing of the man with the looking-glass for some time? - A. No; I kept strait on; it might be about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore for any thing you know, any body else might have taken the glass, and given it to him to carry? - A. Yes; but he told me he had bought it and paid for it.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the man dress that went into the house? - A.Exactly like the prisoner, in a smock frock; I went towards the house when the officer was in the act of handcuffing them together.</p>

             sworn. - I am a City constable: On the 11th of November, Mr. Colebatch came to me in the morning, and in consequence of his request, I went into the Borough, about nine o'clock or a little after, I had a brother officer with me, Mr. Davis; we waited in the Borough for the cart coming, the prisoner was driving it; I let him pass me about twenty yards; I followed the cart, and sent Davis to get a warrant; when I came to the Fishmongers' Alms-houses, at Newington, I missed the cart, and stopped opposite Miles's; the carman was behind the cart about six or seven yards, and the horses knew the door very well; they stopped very naturally at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any call out to the horses to stop? - A. No, none at all; the prisoner came up to the side of his cart, and stopped against a stall where there were some old iron things laid upon a board; Miles's house is in a sort of a garden, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100028"/>there is a wooden bridge to go to the house; on each side of the bridge were benches where he exposed his goods; the prisoner looked over a few articles upon the bench, and after he had done that, he stood a little while, and turned himself towards London again, to see whether he could see any body coming, I suppose; Miles them came up to him, after a little conversation Miles went into his shop, the prisoner followed him, they stopped together about five minutes, and the prisoner came out; I observed him go to the near side of the shafts, and take off a coat, he took it into the shop, he returned, after some time, with the coat upon his arm as he took it in, he staid at one of the stalls about a minute, Miles came out also, and stood by him, and I apprehended them both; then Davis and Collingbourne, another officer, came, and on the right hand, in a little room, upon a round table, I found the ironmongery named in the indictment; I perceived upon the fire some paper burning, but I could not get time enough to take care of it; by that time Mr. Colebatch came and claimed them; there were some deals standing in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no deals moved? - A. No, there were none; we searched the prisoner's lodgings, and, under the bed, found the horse-cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What distance were you at the time the cart stopped? - A. I suppose, about a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that horses will stop upon being spoke to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the carter had not called to the horses? - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up, was he not bargaining, for some time, for horse steams? - A. He did take up many things.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not take up a pair of horse steams? - A. He might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the house? - A. I cannot particularly say, he might be four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his own great coat that he took out of the cart? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not tell you he wanted to leave that coat there, because it should not be dirtied with the wheels of the cart? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was found upon him-five shillings, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the duty of a carter to take home a horse-cloth when it is done with? - A. It may be so</p>

               <p>Q. At your opening the door and going out, did you make a noise that could be heard at Mr. Oldham's? - A. I do not know, I did not make much noise, because I was afraid of waking our family.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the morning did you observe these footsteps? - A. Between nine and eleven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. Q.There were women residing in your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And those women sometimes walk in your garden? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it upon the gravel walk, or where? - A. Upon the mould, on the borders; the footsteps went both ways towards Mr. Oldham's, and back again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the woman's foot distinguishable both ways? - A. No; only back again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100032"/>Court. Q. Will you undertake to say that it was the impression of a woman's shoe? - A. It appeared to me to be so.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a constable of St. John's, Westminster: I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, on the 22d of December; I found upon her, a table spoon broke, two tea-spoons, a pair of silver tea-tongs, part of a silver bottle label, upon which the word Sherry had been, She remained upon it, and fifteen counterfeit shillings; I found nothing else relative to this charge, (produces the property); I apprehended her in Compton-street, upon another business; I found these things in her left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. Q. This was on the 22d, a week after the robbery? - A. Yes; she said, that she came by them honestly; but the marks could not be sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prosecutor, in this case, offered a reward of thirty guineas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received any part of that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not fifteen guineas? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.But you expect it in this case? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Oldham). Q. Are there sufficient remaining of the marks for you to know that they are your property? - A. There are upon all, except the bottle label.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are the marks? - A. T E O; I have some more of the same sort, (produces both table and tea-spoons); there is one of the tea-spoons that I know from another mark, having met with an accident, it was bent in the bowl, and has been since straitened.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me put it down? - A. No. He said he did not mean to take it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When had you last seen it in its place? - A. Some hours before; my nephew had seen it very shortly before.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I was drinking tea with the last witness; I heard a noise like the rattling of halfpence; I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Running or walking? - A. Walking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him have hold of any thing in the shop? - A. No; about three minutes before, I saw the till in its proper place; when I went into the shop it was drawn out, and put upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the till locked? - A. Yes, but the key was in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had just left work, I looked in for a glass of gin, and as I went in at the door a man struck me, and knocked me backwards; I am quite innocent of it.</p>

             M'GREGOR sworn. - I searched the prisoner, and found upon her this tea-spoon; she told me she found it in a company up stairs, and had put it in her pocket for safety.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Townsend.) Q. Did you keep any thing of a public-house? - A. Yes; I keep a lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Gregor.) What is the prosecutrix - does she keep a lodging-house for men or women? - A. I believe, both.</p>
               <p>Q. In Covent-Garden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. She keeps the Key bagnio, a most infamous house; the spoon was up stairs with a sea-faring captain and two women, and I put it in my pocket to take care of it; she takes in women and children all day long; her women steal her property, and then she lays it on innocent servants.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you occasion for the things you carried with you? - A. Yes; I packed up the things mentioned in the indictment, they were all my property, except the towel, and that was my father's, I tied them up in one of the handkerchiefs; I know nothing of the prisoner, except that I met him the night before by Temple-bar, and he, out of friendship, said he would shew me the way to the ship, he was an acquaintance of my friend that I was going to see; the first time I had ever seen the prisoner was with my friend, about a month ago; I never was on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever been at your house before? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you met him at Temple-bar? - A.About seven o'clock, as near as I can guess, he asked me if I was going on board a ship next day; I told him I was; he asked me if he should come and shew me the way, that he was sure I should never find the way by myself; I told him he might come up to shew me the way; he came, and waited till I had tied up the things, I put them down upon the table in the room where he was, till I had prepared myself to go; when I was ready to go, I was going to take the bundle up to carry, he said, no, it would be too heavy for me to carry it, he would carry it; I said, no, I would carry it, I did not wish to give him the trouble of carrying it; he told me not to mention the trouble, for it was none; accordingly he took the bundle off the table, and walked down stairs immediately; I walked down immediately after him, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs, he was absent, I did not see him go; I made endeavours to find him along the Strand, through Exeter-street, and up and down every street where I thought I might be liable to see him; I did not see any more of him till he was taken prisoner on the Monday evening following; I was told, by an acquaintance of his, where he slept, I went down with the watchman, and took him up; it was in a house in Ship-yard, Temple-bar, I told the watchman that was the prisoner; he said, if I gave charge of him, he would give charge of me; I told him he was very welcome to do that; when he got to the watch-house, he said, he was knocked down, with the bundle, as he was going across Stepney-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not to go to this ship without you? - A. No; he was to go to shew me the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of these articles again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you got any more witnesses here? - A. No; my father is out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. The watchman is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to take this bundle to the ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Stepney-fields is in the way to Blackwall? - A. Yes, I believe it is; I am a stranger to that part.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us what business your father was - what business are you? - A. I work in the muff business, in a shop in the Strand, near Templebar.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100034"/>Q. You know Temple-bar very well? - A. Yes, I am often that way.</p>
               <p>A. Sometimes of an evening too? - A. Never unless my business calls me.</p>
               <p>Q. But does your business call you there frequently? - A. No, unless my father should want me to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew the prisoner lived in Ship-yard before? - A. I knew he lived in Shire-lane, but did not know the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the prisoner lived in Shire-lane? - A. Because this friend that I was going to see told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A.Noble.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. He has got a place on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. A single man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. You have frequently seen him? - A. Yes, in that neighbourhood; because his mother keeps a house in Ship-yard; I know his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You frequently went to see him? - A. Not to see him; his mother did keep a shop in the fruitery line, and I have been there to buy things.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you seen the prisoner before this happened? - A. Three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen him? - A.Frequently, in that neighbourhood, in the street passing by.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were you going there? - A. My father was coming to me on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to stay on board the ship? - A. Yes; there was a young woman there I was going to see.</p>
               <p>Q. You had packed up these little articles to stay on board the ship with Mr. Noble for three days? - A. I was going to stay till Sunday.</p>
               <p>Court. Her connection with Mr. Noble has nothing at all to do with this case; let it be what it would, she is not to he robbed; and the robbery is distinctly proved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have known this girl upwards of a twelvemonth; I was on the Wednesday night in Shire-lane, in company with this sailor, this girl came there, and the sailor told her, he was going on board a ship; this girl asked him whether he would let her go with him, and he said, yes; he told her, he should come to her house the next morning, with me, at seven o'clock, to go on board; she told him, there was a string to pull the door, if the door should be locked; we parted that night, and came again the next morning, and he said, it was of no use for her to go with him, and he asked me if I would go on board ship with him that day, and I went with him on board, and then I came home from the ship, and he asked me if I would go for her the next day; and I accordingly did call for her, about one o'clock, and she asked me if I wanted any thing to eat; I told her, yes; and she gave me a bit of bread and cheese; and then she asked me, whether she should take any thing on board; I said, if she was going to stop, she might; then she said, she would stop on board; she accordingly packed up some things, and she asked me, if I would take them for her a little way; she said, she would carry them some part of the way; I told her, yes, I had no objection to it; she then asked her father, how long she might stop; her father said, he did not care how long; her father gave me a towel, and asked me, if I came up the next day, if I would bring him some biscuits; I told him, if I did come up, I would bring him some; then we both came down stairs, and she stopped to put her pattens on, and told me to go on; accordingly I went on; going on, I missed her on the way; I thought she had got on before me; I went down towards Limehouse, and coming along Stepney fields, I met with two sailors, they asked me, what I had there; I told them, I had a few things to take on board a ship; they asked me, what ship I was going on board of; I told them the name of the ship; and while I was telling them, one took the bundle away, and the other struck me, and made my nose bleed; I did not know what to do, I thought it would be the best way to make my way towards home; and making my way towards home, I came along Wapping, and I met a young woman that I knew; she asked me, what I had been about, and I told her what had happened; she told me, it would be best for me to go home; I told her, I was afraid to go home; and in a night or two after, I met with this girl in Shire-lane, and she did not say any thing to me then; and soon after, she charged the watchman with me, the same night.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Prosecutrix). Q. Had you met the prisoner in Shire-lane that night, before he was apprehended? - A. No, I had not; I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you not been making merry on New Year's Day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on foot or on horseback? - A. On foot, I met the three prisoners at the bar between the three and four mile stone; one of them passed me first, the second came to me, presented a pistol, and demanded my money; I lifted up my stick to strike him, and it was taken from me immediately by one of them, I cannot say which; I then ran a little way, and the prisoners pursued me; upon one of them saying, shoot, I stopped immediately, and the three prisoners came up, each with a pistol, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What size were the pistols; - A. They appeared to me to be pocket pistols; I begged of them not to use me ill, and I would give it them; I gave them 5s.; they asked me if that was all, and I said, no, I had another sixpence, and they gave me a shilling back again, and took my watch from me; when I had got a little further towards Town, I met some countrymen, and I asked them to pursue, we pursued them immediately, but did not find them till near two hours after; at last we found them exactly facing the gibbet, about a mile further from Town than where I was robbed; we took them to a public-house, and searched them; I saw my watch found upon them, and I saw two pistols taken from them.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was it? - A. It was after dark, but the moon was rising; I saw their faces very clearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the men at all? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect, before any of them came up, hearing any conversation about the father or mother? - A. I think I heard one of them say, I wonder what my father would say to this; I understood it so.</p>
               <p>Q. They returned you one shilling out of your five shillings and sixpence? - A. They returned me one shilling, and did not take the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know upon which of them the watch was found? - A. No; I was in the room when it was taken from him, but it was not taken from him by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the parlour the room she was to have? - A. No; she then went away, and returned in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100037"/>about half an hour with a small bundle tied up in a silk handkerchief; she went into the parlour and staid there about two hours, she was alone during that time; she then came out to me in the shop, and said, she was going to the White-house, Fetter-lane, to order her boxes to be brought; she told me she should be back in about half an hour, and ordered me to get the tea-kettle boiling against she came back, that she might go to bed; I told her I would; she said, she was very much fatigued with riding in the coach two nights, and wished to go to bed, she went away and never returned after; when she had been gone about an hour, I began to suspect she was a thief, I went into the parlour and began to search to see what I could miss; I found there was my black cloak missing that hung up in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the cloak was hanging up in the parlour when the prisoner was shown into it? - A. Yes, I had hung it up just before she came; I went to the closet, in the same room, and missed a pair of tea-tongs, I had seen them there that day; we had other plate in the closet, but nothing more was missing; I did not see her again till I saw her at Bow-street, which was about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice enough of the person to be sure to know her again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner that person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find either cloak or sugar-tongs again? - A. Yes, I saw them at Bow-street, and swore to them; the cloak was found in prison, but the lace was taken off, and spoiled.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Robert Harvey: Between four and five o'clock, on the 2d of January, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop with a young man, and asked me for two squares of muslin for cravats, I shewed her them; the prisoner had the same cloak on that she has now, with a white shawl under it, and by the motion of her arms, I had a suspicion of her; she bought two squares of muslin, and the young man gave me 15s.; when the prisoner went away, I went after her, and just as she was going out at the door, about forty feet from the counter, I told Mr. Harvey, in the hearing of the prisoner, that I had a suspicion of her; he desired me to take her up stairs into the drawing-room, and just as she was going upon the first step that separates the shop from the house, I saw her drop two pieces of muslin from under her cloak; as we were going up stairs, I saw another piece, a small quantity, drop from her clothes behind her; and in the drawing-room, she dropped the piece mentioned by Mr. Harvey; she had her hand under her cloak, or somewhere behind her, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you saw four pieces drop? - A. Yes; and then the constable came and found upon her two pieces more, he took them out of her pocket; he has got them, I have got the rest. (Produces them).</p>

               <p>Q. Her husband lodges in the same house with her? - A. Yes. (The property produced).</p>
               <p>Binch. I am sure this is my wife's gown by its being new sleeved; the shirts I can swear to from the mark, one is marked No. 1, and the other No. 3; they are marked by my wife in blue thread.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you safely swear to their being your shirts from those marks? - A. I think I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is the first time I ever knew a man called to prove his wife's gown, or his wife's mark-Upon your oath, where is your wife? - A. At home.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not been very intimate with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear your wife never gave her authority to pawn them? - A. I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg you to give me some reason why your wife is not here? - A. There are only two of us to look after the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore she, who is the best calculated to judge of these things, stays away; and you, who are the best calculated to attend the shop, are here; what business is your's? - A. In the tobacco way.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the more usual way for you to take care of the tobacco business, and your wife of the household business? - A. Yes; I asked the officer if there was any occasion for her coming, and he said, there was none in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made that gown of your wife's, your wife herself? - A. I do not think she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did the officer give you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100043"/>that advice? - A. I asked the question during the business, and he said, he did not see occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask that officer, Treadway, that question? - A. Yes, I did, in the course of the week, whether there was any occasion for Mrs. Birch to attend, and he said, he did not see any in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mark these shirts? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not wear that gown of course? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is it that should send you here, in preference to your wife? - A.Because, when I went to Bow-street, I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you heard it said, that your wife gave her authority to pledge them? - A. Yes, with you.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard that suggested? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked your wife that question? - A. No; I had no reason to ask her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Treadway.) Q. Upon your oath, did this man ever consult you upon the propriety of calling his wife here as a witness? - A No, he never did; his wife was not at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any recollection whether you ever said to him any thing about the necessity of his wife coming? - A. I have not, no such word ever passed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know he has sworn it, now will you swear that what he has said, is false? - A. I will; I know him very well, and I knew his father to be a man of property and character, before he was born.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Birch.) Q. Was it Treadway, or Mumford that said it? - A. It was said in the course of one day since I have been attending the Old Bailey; I was saying, I did not know whether it was necessary my wife should be here, and one of them said, there is no occasion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time meet with Hibbert and Jones, at Fulham? - A. Yes; the day the King set off for the Nore, Wilson came to me, and I went with him, about six in the evening, to the Golden-lion door, there I saw Hibbert, he asked me, if I would buy some coach-glasses, I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100046"/>him the sizes of them, he said, Wilson had got the sizes upon a piece of paper, which he had; I then went with him and Wilson to my own house, which was next door; I looked at the sizes of them, I asked him, what he asked for them; he asked me four guineas for them; I told him, I thought four guineas too much, for I should get nothing by them, if I sold them; I offered him three guineas for them; he said, he could not take it; he and

             both went away together into the Golden-lion; he said, he had taken them in trade, and could not take it, he had allowed more money for them; he and Wilson went to the Golden-lion, and I went over to my mother's, which was opposite; in about a quarter of an hour, Wilson came to me to tell me I should have the glasses for three guineas; I came out at my mother's door with Wilson, and Hibbert was over at the Golden-lion door; he told me I should have them for three guineas, and he desired Wilson to go with him to help him bring them; Jones was then at the Golden-lion; they went for them, and in about a quarter of an hour they returned, or less; they had above a mile to go to fetch them; they brought the glasses, each of them brought four; we all went to the Golden-lion, I had nothing but a pound note in my pocket, and I asked Mr. Poney to lend me two guineas and a half; he went to his wife, and brought me two guineas, was going to tell the silver down, and I told him six shillings would do; I went and called Hibbert, Wilson came with him to the bar-door in the passage; I paid Hibbert two guineas, a pound note, and one shilling; I went in and drank with Hibbert, Jones, and Wilson; the next morning, I had some business in Town, I packed them up, and brought them with me; I took them first to Mr. Knight's, in Compton-street, he was not at home, and I took them to Mr. English's, and sold them to him for 3l. 8s.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Poney). Q.Was there any body else in the tap-room besides these people? - A. Yes; thirteen or fourteen people; I had a great number of lodgers in the house, and most of them were at home.</p>
               <p>South cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Can you give the Gentlemen of the Jury any reason why you called these people out of the tap-room to conclude your bargain? - A. Not to lay it before so many people. Mr. Poney was in the bar, but was called away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you call these people out of the tap-room? - A. I was receiving the money from Mr. Poney, when Hibbert was coming out; I said, here you may as well take your money; he received it at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he did not receive it in the passage? - A. Yes; the bat is in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you give any account of these glasses? - A. As soon as I heard that he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sent for by the officers of Bow-street? - A. No, I was not; I came voluntarily; I sent word to Mr. Cloud, that I had had some coach-glasses through my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had bought them cheap, and had bought them at a sale? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Mr. English so? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know Jones had any thing to do with this business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones was not present during any part of the conversation of what was to be given for the glasses? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any conversation passed about the glasses, while you were with Jones? - A. No; none, till after they were paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in coach-glasses? - A. I deal in looking-glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any coach-glasses before? - A. I have bought a post-chaise glass of a neighbour, which I took with me to Mr. English's, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When was it you had first any knowledge that these glasses were stolen? - A. I heard that Hibbert was taken up for receiving coach-glasses, and Jones for stealing them; and I sent the very same day that I heard of it, to Mr. Cloud, to let him know that some had gone through my hands, this was on the Saturday, and on the Sunday Mr. Cloud came to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Before you sent to Mr. Cloud, had you been sent for to give an account of these glasses? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for brokers to buy various kinds of articles that they can buy and sell again, without confining themselves to any thing particular? - A.Certainly;</p>
               <p>THOMAS ENGLISH sworn. - I am a looking-glass manufacturer: The latter end of October or beginning of November, I bought some coach-glasses of Mr. South, I cannot say the number, but I think it was 3l. 10s. I gave him for the whole; the glasses were put down in the shop; I had some carpenters at work, and they had been moved about from place to place in the shop, till Mr. Cloud called for them; I afterwards delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 3l. 10s. a fair price for them? - A. Yes; I would not have given more for them, because I am a manufacturer myself, and they wanted working over again. (Seven of the glasses were produced).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect the account that South gave you of where he had got them? - A. Yes; he came to my house, and brought them down in a box in a cart; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100047"/>him, how did you come by them; says he, I am a broker, and bought them at a sale.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought that a very reasonable thing, and you purchased them of course? - A. Yes; or I should not have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they with frames, or without frames? - A.Without frames.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wilson.) Q. How were they when they where brought from Hibbert's, had they any frames upon them? - A. No frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they no frames when you first searched them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cloud. I have no doubt but these are my glasses, they every one sit the places that they came from.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But the frames are gone? - A. I have made an allowance for the frames, and they sit within a quarter of an inch, all of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You know that a quarter of an inch may make the difference between almost an hundred different glasses? - A. No; you might try half the coaches in London, and not find them sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could have picked them out from others? - A. When I went into Mr. English's shop, I said, these were the four.</p>
               <p>Q.If they had been mixed with other glasses, should you have known them again? - A. If they had been mixed with five hundred, I do not know that I should.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coach-maker: I have tried these glasses with Mr. Cloud's coaches, I made an allowance for all the frames, as we always do, and then he went and fetched these glasses, and they answered to the measures that I had put down; there was one that was a little bigger, but that might be owing to the difference of the frame.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you ever measure those frames which included these glasses? - A. No; I guessed at the breadth of them.</p>
               <p>Q. A quarter of an inch in a plate makes a difference between, perhaps, an hundred different glasses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But making a frame of the usual proper size, would a frame of the usual size to these glasses, sit the coaches? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday evening, the 8th of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the bar, I observed the prisoner going from a chest at the foot of the stairs in the passage, I lost him instantly, I called my husband directly, I went up stairs, and on the stairs I found a pair of shirt sleeves, that had been in that chest, there were several other persons slept in the same room with him; in a chest in that room, I found a pair of blue pantaloons, and a pillow; I took them in my hand to bring them down, and met the prisoner at the door, I said to him, Gunner, what have you been about, and shewed him the things, and he said,"one man gave it to me;" he was taken before Justice Staples, and committed upon those things; there was another chest up two pair of stairs, that had been stripped entirely, that the articles in the indictment came out of; that chest, I believe to have been locked, I had the key in my desk; the next morning, after he was committed, I went to examine that chest, and there were forty-two articles of wearing-apparel all gone, they all belonged to two persons that are gone to sea, and who left them in my care;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100049"/>among other things, I missed several calico shirts, two or three pair of nankeen breeches, and a cloth coat; I afterwards found, at a pawnbroker's shop, one or two jackets, and one pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was not committed for taking the things in the indictment, but he sent for me that evening, he was in a lock-up room adjoining the office, he began to cry before I said a word to him, he said to me, in Swedish, don't hurt me, and I will tell you of more things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he confessed? - A. No, nothing of the kind; I said, where shall I get them; he said, go to Peggy, in Gravel-lane, and there you will find all the duplicates; I knew who he meant by Peggy, she had been with him three or four times in the tap-room; the next morning, I got an officer, and went to search Peggy's house; her name is Welby; I found nineteen duplicates upon her; I went to the pawnbrokers, and among others, found the things named in the indictment.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 5, Rodney's-row, Ratcliff-highway; I had the pleasure of seeing the prisoner in company, about three or four weeks before he was taken up; the officer came to me with Mr. Winbury, and I gave him a great many duplicates; I had a coat, blue trowsers, nankeen breeches, and a shirt, from the prisoner; he desired me to pawn them; he told me they were his own, that he got them from his own chest on board a ship, and I was to have the money.(Three pawnbrokers produced the property, which was deposed to by Mr. Winbury).</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When you have seen this woman come there with the prisoner, had she any access to the place where these things were taken from? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. (By the Interpreter). There was a Swede who gave me these articles to deposit them in my chest, he having none of his own; when they had been in my possession eight days, he asked me if I would lend him seven shillings; I told him, I had not got so much money; afterwards, I lent him six shillings; and after that, Margaret Welby asked me for some money, and I told her, I had not got any; I went to my lodging, and desired the man that I had lent the money to, to let me have some back; he said, he could not take up money from the floor; he said, I might take his clothes, and give to the girl; I gave her the breeches, the jacket, and the waistcoat, and then she asked me for more money; he then put into my hands some more articles; after some more days, she wanted more money; and I told her, I could get none till I had a ship; and then I spoke to the Swede again, and he told me, I might take the coat and the pantaloons, and a hat; which I gave to the girl.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Winbury. The day that he was taken up, there was a Swede man ran away, and we made search after him, but could not find him; he lodged at my house, and was an acquaintance of the prisoner's; he had been at our house two or three weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your brother's business? - A. Sometimes he works in the brick-fields, and sometimes looks after horses. About seven or eight weeks ago, I think it was on a Friday, John Wheeler, and Thomas Hall, and I, were drinking at the Little King's arms, at Brentford, till about ten o'clock, then we walked about till about half past twelve or one o'clock, and then we went to Kew bridge-house, Mr. Syme's, the Star and Garter, with a rasp and a soldering iron that Hall used in his business; we took down two of the shutters, Hall and I wrenched them out at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your brother do? - A. He stood by; Thomas Hall then broke a square of glass, and took a rump of beef out at the window through the broken square, and very nigh a whole cheese, and a loin of mutton, the beef was raw and the mutton too, and a piece of beef that was ready dressed, two small apple-pies, and a bundle of things that we pulled out through the broken glass; Hall put his hand in, and reached at them; there were two counterpanes and a morning gown, a petticoat, a shift, and a table cloth, that is all that I know of that was in the bundle, except a carving knife, a brass weight, and two or three small neck handkerchiefs; I threw the knife and the weight away, and the rest of the things we took to Mr. Skilsby's, and there was a piece of a sugar-loaf; then we went to Hammersmith, and slept in a coke oven all night; in the morning, we went to the Little King's-arms, we got there a little after seven o'clock, we staid there till about eight o'clock, and then Wheeler and Hall went to Mr. Skilsby's again.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Skilsby? - A. He keeps an old-cloaths shop; when they came back, they said, Mr. Skilsby would not have any thing to do with them; they brought a piece of beef with them that was drest for breakfast, and we had that for breakfast; then we returned to Hammersmith, and went to the World's-end, at Chelsea, and had some beer, then we went again to Hammersmith, to John Groom's, to borrow his horse, we all three went to the door, but Thomas Hall went in to borrow the horse, to get the things away at night; I went home, and both of them told me afterwards, that they went that evening, and got them away; they said, they had left the sugar-loaf, and one of the counterpanes at Mr. Skilsby's, and the rest of the things they brought away; they said, they had left the loin of mutton, and rump of beef, at

The Monday following; they told me they had taken the things to Mr. Baldock's, the World's-end, at Little-Chelsea, they said, they were to go for the money another time, for Mr. Baldock was not at home, and said, his wife offered them 14s. and they would not take it, I do not know whether they ever got any money for the things.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at Walworth: I have known Mr. Reeves, three years and upwards; he was a <rs id="t17980110-41-deflabel237" type="occupation">stock-broker and dealer in coals</rs>

                        targets="t17980110-41-defend422 t17980110-41-deflabel237"/>; he lived next door to me: In June, 1796, he applied to me to advance money upon Scrip receipts; I accordingly advanced nearly 2000l.; he lodged with me Scrip receipts for the loan of 7,500,000l.; in January following, he applied to me to advance more money; he had bought for me, before that, 2000l. Imperial Annuity; I added that to the former, making, in all, near 4000l.; I was not satisfied with the original security, but I requested to have a better security; he told me, if I would sell out of the Imperial Annuity, he would give me heavy Scrip, that is, Scrip paid up in full. On the 19th of January, Mr. Reeves and I went to the Bank together in a coach.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was that the day you sold out of the Imperial Annuity? - A. I believe it was. When we got to the Bank, Mr. Reeves was very ill, and he went into a private place; he told me to go into the Rotunda, and he would go and see his principal.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, where were the receipts he had originally given you? - A. I had returned them to him; he told me to stay in the Rotunda till he returned; in about two hours, he returned to the Rotunda again, where I was waiting impatiently for him; he then brought me six Scrip receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and see if those six are among them? - A. I marked them at the corner, all but the bottom one.</p>
               <p>Q. These six appear to be paid up to the full? - A. They appear to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in that state when he delivered them to you in the Rotunda? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a seventh, how came you by that? - A. In October, there was some more money coming to me, and he said, he would give me another receipt, but only let it remain, for money was very scarce; I never transacted any business with Mr. Reeves as a principal, I always considered him as a broker.</p>
               <p>Q. There is another piece of paper attached to that, whose hand-writing is it? - A. Mr. Reeves's; he wrote it in my presence; I put an unlimited confidence in him as a broker, and as a man I always had the highest opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection whether those six paid up in full were any part of what he returned to you again? - A. I cannot ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him, and what, when he was in the Rotunda? - A. I have already related almost all the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these at any time converted into stock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation respecting their becoming stock? - A. I asked him, why he did not make good the agreements; he talked of his principal as a great man at the Stock-Exchange, who returned 100,000l. a day, three or four times over.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the reason he gave for their not being converted into stock? - A. The reason he gave was, that the more stock that was brought into market, it would depress the market, and they found an advantage in keeping the stock out of the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say found that advantage? - A. The people that he said belonged to these papers.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these in the same state in which you received them from him? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. This matter was not discovered till the October following? - A. Not till the last day of October. (The receipt read).</p>

               <p>Mr. Wood. I submit to your Lordship, that the evidence given in support of this charge, does not prove the indictment. My Lord, The first objection that I shall take the liberty of stating is, that the indictment states that the prisoner at the bar forged a receipt, purporting to be the receipt of Christopher Olier; now, upon looking at the face of the receipt, your Lordship will see, that it does not purport any such thing. It is true it bears the signature of C. Olier, but that may be Charles, or any other name beginning with a C, but does not purport, upon the face of it, to be Christopher Olier. My Lord, I understand there was a case of that sort lately, which my learned Friend, Mr. Knapp, will cite to your Lordship, in which that objection was taken, and prevailed. My Lord, with respect to the other objections, I think it will be better for me to take your Lordship's opinion upon this, before I proceed to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The case Mr. Wood has alluded to, is the case of the King and Gilchrist, which was determined by all your Lordships; it was reported in this place by Mr. Justice Buller, of which I have a very correct note.</p>
               <p>In February Sessions, 1795, the prisoner was indicted for forging a certain paper writing, purporting to be an order for the payment of money, and purporting to be signed by T. Exton, and to be directed to Lord George Kinnard, William Morland, and 
               <persName id="t17980110-41-person434">

                  </persName>
            , bankers and partners, by the name of Ransom, Morland, and Hammersley; and then it is set out in the indictment, in the way in which it purports to be stated. The objection was, that the bill was improperly described, the name of Lord George Kinnard not being upon the face of it, it could not purport to be directed to him. The Jury convicted the prisoner; and, in July, 1795, at the Sessions here, Mr. Justice Buller says, "I give the opinion of ten of the Judges, who were all that assembled, and were unanimous upon the point; I must make an observation upon the manner in which indictments of this nature are drawn. It is the duty of a good pleader not to clog the record unnecessarily, to take care not to throw too much proof upon his client, and not to state repugnant, or absurd matter. The books are full of distinctions as to the words purport and tenor, and the necessity of using the one or the other; but I find no determination that both shall be stated; the purport is the substance of the instrument as it appears upon the face of the instrument itself; the tenor is an exact copy; where the tenor is set out, the purport must be necessarily included; the forms of indictments are now much more complicated than formerly, and, I think, much worse. The indictment stated the prisoner to have forged a certain paper writing, signed T. Exton, purporting to be a bill of Exchange, and then setting out the tenor is quite sufficient; there must be a tenor set out, and then the purport is included. Lord George Kinnard, Morland, and Hammersley, carrying on the banking business under the name of Ransom, Morland, and Hammersley, the pleader thought he must take the name of Lord Kinnard, which is not necessary, which renders it inconsistent with itself, and repugnant to the bill, for it does not appear to be so directed; and as such direction is not upon the face of the bill, the indictment is bad, and the prisoner must be discharged from this indictment."</p>
               <p>Now, it does seem to me, my Lord, that this objection goes, all fours, with the objection that Mr. Wood had taken. The objection there was, that the appearance of the bill contradicted the purport; - what is the objection here? It purports to be signed by a person having a christian name belonging to him, namely, that of Christopher.</p>
               <p>Does Christopher appear to be the person whose name the bill purports to bear? Certainly not; but C. Olier, which may be Charles, or any thing else; and, therefore, that determination seems to me to govern the present objection; and, I trust, your Lordship, upon that authority, will be of opinion that it is fatal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Balmanno. I will only just mention to your Lordship another case, reported in Mr. Leach's book, the case of 
               <persName id="t17980110-41-person435">

            , where it was decided, that an instrument, purporting to be a Bank-note, must appear so upon the face of it; and, that no representation of the prisoner can alter the purport of it.</p>
               <p>Court. This case, a little, varies from the cases that have been cited. As I understand it, the prisoner gave a receipt with C. Olier subscribed to it, thereby purporting to be the receipt of 
               <persName id="t17980110-41-person436">
                  Christopher

            , who is one of the cashiers of the Bank. The case of Gilchrist differs from this, because the name of Kinnard does not at all appear upon the face of the bill; but this seems to me to describe it exactly as it is; a receipt for one hundred pounds ten shillings, with the name C. Olier, thereto subscribed; therefore, I do not feel the weight of the objection; I will mention it to my Brothers who are up stairs, and if they have any doubt upon that point, it shall be saved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood. I am to submit to your Lordship, that there is not sufficient evidence to be left to the Jury, in order to convict the prisoner of the offence charged in this indictment. My Lord, in order to make an offence within this Act of Parliament, it must clearly appear, that the instrument supposed to be forged, was forged subsequent to the passing of this Act of Parliament for raising a Loan of seven million and a half.</p>
               <p>My Lord, this Act of Parliament passed on the 14th of May, 1796, and the clause upon which the indictment was founded, is the twenty-second: "That if any person or persons shall forge, or counterfeit, any receipt, or receipts, for the whole, or any part of the said contributions towards the said seven millions and a half, or shall alter any number, figure, or word therein, or utter, or publish as true, any such forged receipt, shall be adjudged guilty of felony, and suffer death, as a felon, without benefit of clergy.</p>
               <p>Now your Lordship will see, that the Act is merely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100056"/>prospective, and, therefore, unless it has clearly appeared in evidence, that the receipt, which has been uttered, was actually forged, subsequent to the passing of this Act, I conceive the prisoner ought to be acquitted. Now your Lordship will see, that the first receipt is dated the 26th of April, which is before the passing of the Act, and the uttering a receipt which had been forged, prior to the passing of the Act, could not have brought the defendant within that Act. Now, I take it, that there is no evidence in this case to prove, that the receipt was forged, subsequent to the passing of the Act, and your Lordship will recollect what the evidence is; the several receipts were deposited in the month of June, and if they were the same receipts or part of the same receipts that were returned to Mr. Ashforth, at the time they were returned, then, most undoubtedly, the case would have been clear; but, my Lord, it is not so, because your Lordship will recollect, that Mr. Ashforth says, he would not pretend to say, they were the same receipts that he had had in his possession before. Therefore, how does the matter stand upon the evidence? That certain receipts had been delivered subsequent to the passing of the Act, and (which is a material circumstance, that I must beg leave to call your Lordship's attention to) the first of those receipts bears date the 26th of April, and the others have no date to them, therefore, non cunstat, all these might have been forged before the passing of the Act, and if they were, I conceive the prisoner cannot be found guilty. The first payment, your Lordship will observe, was on the 26th of April, and it is possible, that all might have been paid up at that time, for subscribers to the loan have an opportunity of paying in the whole of the subcription, and it does not appear to the contrary. That is my objection, that inasmuch as it does not clearly appear, that the receipt uttered was forged subsequent to the passing of the Act, the defendant ought to be acquitted.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another objection, which I trust your Lordship will think clear and decisive, and that is, that this receipt, which is supposed to be forged, is not a receipt to which this Act of Parliament applies; and here I beg leave to state particularly to your Lordship, the nature of this subscription, and the nature of the clauses contained in the Act. My Lord, it is clear, that to constitute a forgery within this Act of Parliament, the receipt itself must purport to be a receipt for a contribution for the purchase of these annuities, mentioned in the Act. Now, my Lord, let us see whether this receipt does purport to be a receipt for any subscription, or contribution, for the purchase of the annuities mentioned in this Act. My Lord, the Act begins with reciting that the Commons of Great-Britain have resolved that the sum of seven millions and a half be raised by annuities, in manner therein after-mentioned. It then directs that the contributors shall, for every 100l. contributed either in money or Exchequer-bills, he entitled to the principal sum of 100l. in the 3 per Cent. Consols, and an additional principal sum of 20l. in like Annuities; a further principal sum of 25l. in the 3 per Cents. Reduced, and a further annuity of 5s. 6d. for a certain number of years. The interest upon the Consolidated Annuities, is to commence from the 5th of January 1796, upon the Reduced Annuities, from the 5th of April 1796, and I believe the 5s. 6d. Long Annuities are to commence from April likewise.</p>
               <p>Then the 19th Section of the Act says, that all monies to which any person or persons shall become entitled by virtue of this Act, in respect of any sum advanced, or contributed towards the said sum of seven millions and a half, on which the said respective Annuities first mentioned shall be added to the joint Stock of Annuities, transferrable at the Bank of England, which had been consolidated by former Acts of Parliament, so far, with respect to the 3 per Cents. Then, with respect to the 25l. 3 per Cent. Reduced Annuities, they are likewise to be added to the old Stock of 3 per Cent. reduced Annuities, and the 5s. 6d. Long Annuity is to be added to the old Stock of 5s. 6d. Long Annuities. Now, if your Lordship will please to advert to the terms of this receipt, your Lordship will perceive that it is quite a distinct Annuity, for it is a receipt for a subscription of 670l. for the purchase of 1000l. in the old Stock, which had been consolidated by the former Acts of Parliament. In order to have been a receipt within this Act of Parliament, it ought to have been at least for the sum to be created into a Stock by this new Act, and added to the old Stock; whereas it is a receipt for 1000l. in a Stock which has been long consolidated, and which this Act does not authorize the sale of; here the receipt does not appear to be a receipt for the purchase of Stock to be added to the old Stock, but is a receipt for the purchase of the old Stock itself. There is a material difference between a man giving a receipt for 1000l. 3 per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, as long ago as the 25th, 28th, 29th, 32d, or 33d of George II. and one that is to be created in 1796.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another thing - Every person, subscribing under this Act of Parliament, is entitled to three different species of Stock; for every 100l. he is entitled to so much 3 per Cent. so much Reduced Annuities, and so much Long Annuities. Now this is merely a receipt for the purchase of Stock in the 3 per Cent. Annuities. The Governor and Company of the Bank of England may say, we think sit to divide this, and therefore we will give different receipts; but that has not appeared in evidence, and therefore it is not to be presumed that such receipts are given; and supposing such receipts are given, it is not for the Bank of England to bring persons within the penalties of this Act of Parliament, by any particular acts of their own. A receipt, under this Act of Parliament, must be according to the terms of the Act; it therefore ought to have been a receipt for the receipt of so much, for which the person was entitled to such a quantity of 3 per Cent. Annuities, such a quantity of Reduced Annuities, and such a quantity of Long Annuities. - Therefore, My Lord, upon these grounds, I submit to your Lordship, that the prisoner ought to be acquitted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wood was followed by Mr. Knapp and Mr. Balmanno, on the same side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I will trouble your Lordship with a very few observations -</p>
               <p>Court. It is unnecessary to give you any trouble, Mr. Fielding, for I do not see that these objections have any weight. With respect to its being forged prior to the Act, it seems to me to be for the Jury to say, upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100057"/>whole of the evidence, whether it was forged subsequent to the passing of the Act, or not; though I do not know that is necessary that they should do so, for it does not matter, in a case of forgery, if the receipt was forged, and was uttered and published after the passing of the Act, every ingredient of the crime is complete.</p>
               <p>The next objection is, that this is not such a receipt as that to which the Act applies. The argument of the Counsel has gone upon reading only a part of the receipt; if the whole of the receipt was read, it would be impossible to doubt what it was for; for it states the Loan of 1796, for seven millions and a half, 1000l. 3 per Cent. Annuities, to be added to the 3 per Cent. Consolidated Annuities of stock then existing. The indictment goes on, and states the receipt more fully: - Received of

            , Esq. the sum of 67l. for a deposit of 10 per Cent. upon 670l. subscribed by him, in pursuance of the above-said resolution, and upon the due payment of the remaining 90 per Cent. of the said sum of 670l. the said subscriber or his assigns, by his or their indorsement thereon, will, in exchange for this receipt, become entitled to 1000l. joint-stock of Annuities, consolidated at the Bank of England by the several subsequent Acts. - Is not this Act one of the subsequent Acts by which this stock was consolidated?</p>
               <p>The next objection is, that it must be adapted to the very terms of the Act, that the subscribers shall be entitled to a certain proportion of 3 per Cent. Consolidated Annuities of the 3 per Cent. Reduced Annuities, and of the Long Annuity. Now let us see what is the clause in the Act, which makes it a forgery to counterfeit a receipt for the whole, or any part of the said contribubution - Now, does not this appear to be a receipt for a part of this contribution? - As to there being separate receipts, I am to understand, that the Bank, in doing their business, do it correctly; there is a very great inconvenience in having them separate and distinct, because a man has an opportunity to purchase in what stock he pleases; but, in the course of this argument, the second set of Counts is entirely forgot.</p>
               <p>These objections have been argued by the Counsel very ably, and with all that zeal that does them credit, when a man has so much at stake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have known Mr. Ashforth for a considerable time, and transacted a great deal of business for him in my line of Scrip receipts; the loan of seven millions and a half for the year 1796, being considered advantageous to purchase, I purchased many of them for Mr. Ashforth as well as myself; having accounts to settle with Mr. Ashforth, for money advanced by him, with only the first payment made upon them, and having inadvertantly lost the opportunity of making the other payments, by being confined to my room by severe indisposition; on my recovery, I went to the Stock-Exchange, and purchased Scrip receipts with the whole payment, I cannot tell whether they were forged any more than if they had been Bank-notes passing through my hands. My Lord, Scrip receipts are as current as Bank-notes; I cannot recollect of whom I purchased them; there are many gentlemen about the Stock-Exchange, who keep no minutes of their business any more than myself; if I had had any idea of forging, or uttering a receipt knowing it to be forged, I certainly should not have attended the Stock-Exchange as I did; I was attending the Stock-Exchange to the very hour, and in fact, at the very minute that I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL NESBITT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Wood. Q. You have been pretty largely concerned in the negociation of Scrip? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to negociate Scrip without taking any account of whom you purchase them? - A. It is very much the practice upon the Stock-Exchange; it is so in my own case; it is impossible for me to say of whom I have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you have known some instances of it? - A.Particularly so in the month of October or November, I forget which, in the settling of a large sum of Scrip, I missed it; I looked over my accounts, and could not find it; the next morning, I stuck up an advertisement at the Stock-Exchange, but I could not learn any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary to negociate full Scrip? - A. Yes; suppose I want to borrow money, I go to my banker, and deposit that, it is more handily done than transferring stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How long have you been employed as a broker? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, you have heard of Lyon's case formerly? - A. Yes; I know the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that circumstance might have shewn you, that now and then, paper passing about might be dangerous? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever purchase Scrip without looking at it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the purchase of Scrip, what is it material to consider? - A. The party of whom you purchase, and to see that the money is right. Having had very large concerns in Scrip, I have found, when I have attempted to take an account of the letters and numbers, I could not get through my business; I should have known who I bought 5000l. of, and who I had bought Scrip of; but if it had been forged, and had been afterwards brought to me, I could not have said, who I had had it of.</p>

               <p>Q. When all the payments are made upon this Scrip, you are entitled to a dividend upon that stock from that time, are you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you keep it out of that stock, of course you have no dividend? - A. If I keep it after a dividend, I procrastinate the payment of the dividend.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you keep heavy Scrip that is paid up, by you, you lose all the interest of that stock you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100058"/>turn it into? - A. Provided I pay it up, or convert it into stock before the dividend becomes due, then I should lose that interest.</p>
               <p>Q.Understand me, supposing the payments upon the subscription of 2000l. are all made up at that very moment, you may convert it into stock? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if you keep that Scrip by you six months, you lose the advantage of six months dividend upon that stock? - A. No; if I keep it, and do not make it into stock, I only lose the interest upon the interest; as soon as I turn it into stock, I get the arrears of the dividend.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Balmanno. Q. Are you acquainted with the mode of transacting business at the Stock-Exchange? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if it is the constant practice for jobbers to take minutes of every transaction? - A. We always make minutes of whom we have them of, but the Scrips are apt to mix, they are like such a number of Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Though you do mix your Scrip, you take minutes of whom you receive them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to make a deposit of Scrip with a third person for a principal, should you not take an account of whom that principal was? - A. Yes; but Scrip is as negociable as Bank-notes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, I live in High-street, St. Mary-le-bonne; about twenty minutes before eight o'clock, going past the corner of Great Woodstock-street, I saw the prisoner, and another man with him, standing at the corner; I did not take much notice of them at that time, till I returned in about ten minutes for some more porter, when I saw the prisoner and the other standing in the same position as they were before; I went home and got some more porter, I live about 100 yards from the place, I had got a pot and three pints of beer, as I was going back again, Mr. Prince's is the corner house, the other man that was with the prisoner, was then standing by the corner, by himself, I saw the prisoner with this line and hook to it, (the book was made with the prongs of a fork, with the points turned up;) I saw him pulling something up out of the area, I went close to him, I heard him say to his partner, d-n me, Tom, I have got it, supposing me to be his companion, I waited a bit, and saw the petticoat come up to the iron rails, I saw that it was flannel, but did not know it was a petticoat, the iron rails lie flat, he had got it just above the iron rails; I then asked him what he was about, and told him, I was sure he had no business there; he kept winding up the line, and I immediately took him by the collar, he then immediately let go the line, and the petticoat, line and hook went into the area; I secured him, and the other man immediately ran away; I took him into the shop, and Mrs. Prince went down into the area, and brought up the petticoat, we could not find the line upon the prisoner, and we thought he had made away with it, but it was found the next morning in the area, and given to me; I asked him what he was, and he said, he was a silversmith, how could we think of his doing such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to undertake to say, that it was a flannel petticoat? - A. I can swear it was flannel, and I saw him let it fall.</p>
               <p>HENRY BATES sworn. - I belong to St. Mary-le-bonne watch-house; the prisoner was brought into the watch-house by Wilson, and two of our watchmen, on the 4th of this month, with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100059"/>petticoat wet, (produces it); I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Prince.) You did not see the petticoat picked up? - A. No, the landlady of the house picked it up; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q.Were all the things, that had been washed, your clothes? - A. Yes; an under waistcoat of my husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. Your petticoat, of course, would be larger than the waistcoat? - A. Yes; the waistcoat was remaining upon the line when I went to take the rest of the linen in, which was as soon as I had recovered the alarm; the clothes hung within two yards of the top. (The petticoat deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>The prisoner said, in his defence, that as he was going past the house he was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know she had not gone down stairs, and gone out at the door? - A. We asked her if she wanted to go out any more that night; and she said, no; and we locked and bolted the doors; the other prisoner was the person that gave her a character, we did not know then that she was her mother, she frequently came backwards and forwards to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any part of your things again? - A. Yes, some at a pawnbrokers; last Friday week I heard that she was taken up, I went, and found that she had one of my petticoats, a striped dimity, upon her, and a pair of pockets belonging to me, and a handkerchief round her neck belonging to me, but I did not take that, I have the others here; and at Mr. Gaunt's, the pawnbroker's, I found a shift, and other things; I found a round gown at Mr. Townsend's; and a striped muslin petticoat, and two shifts at Mr. Frith's.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time he said this, was Priest within hearing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give him authority to dispose of any hay to any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of two trusses? - A. It cost me four shillings; it was old clover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You took the prisoners before they had come back as far as Bayswater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you told him, that Priest was a d-d rascal, and he would transport him, but if he would tell you who the receiver was, you would let him off, because he had a family? - A. No; I told him, I should be glad to catch the receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, you would not prosecute him, if he told you who the receiver was? - A. No, I did not; I said, I would rather have the receiver than him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not endeavour to make a witness of him before the Magistrate? - A. I asked Mr. Bleamire's advice about it, and he was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, the receiver was taken up? - A. Yes; but the Justice said, there was not sufficient evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any hay given to these men for their journey? - A. Yes; I saw hay laid out for them the night before, more than the horses could eat.</p>

             sworn. - I sat up to watch the premises: About half an hour after two in the morning, I saw Priest unlock the loft-door, I had a view of both the stables and the loft; he called out to Partridge, who was about twenty yards from him, and then he gave Partridge a truss of clover; and then Partridge took it to the stable; then Priest threw another truss down, and Priest and Partridge took that into the stable; then they took the two shaft horses out, and went to fetch the waggon out, they were going to the other side of Brentford; they put three trusses of clover into the waggon; one truss we always allow them over night, which is plenty for the horses during their journey; then they put the other horses to, and drove off; I followed them till they got to Bayswater, and there they made a stop; one was in the waggon, and the other driving; the driver took out one trufs of hay, and threw it into the public-house yard, at Bayswater, and then he came back again, and took another truss, and took it into the same yard; then he took his whip, and went off directly, the other two remained in the waggon; then I went into the yard to see if I could find it, I could see nobody up; I found one of the trusses standing up end-ways in the corner, but the other I could not find; I came back and told my master, and he got two officers, and we went to meet them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any other horses in the stable at the time they took the trusses into the stable? - A. Yes; and I afterwards saw them put them into the waggon.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-Garden; I took Partridge into custody, and my brother officer took the other; when I brought Partridge along with me, before we got to Bayswater, he said, his partner and him had once or twice before stole hay from their master, and he said, it was his partner that persuaded him to do it, they were taken to the office and committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What did you say to Partridge before this? - A. I asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing, to rob his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Dennett present? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him say something about the receiver? - A. I did not hear of that till afterwards.</p>

               <p>Partridge's defence. It is very false about two trusses of hay being taken out of the lost, there was but one.</p>

               <p>Partridge was recommended to mercy by the prosecutor, on account of his having a large family.</p>

               <p>Q. Were those spoons and buckles part of the the things you received from Davis? - A. Yes; two days after that, I think, the 7th of October, I fold as many goods to Fenham, a waterman, as came to 21l. at 5s. per ounce; he came again the next day, the 8th, and had the remainder of the spoons and forks, that brought me 32l. he took them hap-hazard, without weighing or any thing, just as they came; I then had left 2 pair of spoons, and 2 pair of buckles, which I gave to the Police-officer, when he came to me; in about ten days from the time Davis left the goods, he came to me in the afternoon, and asked me if I had done any thing with the goods; I told him, yes, I had sold part of them to Fenham, and part to another man, and if he would stop, I would give him the money; I went up stairs, and brought him 60l. and what he had had before, made 70l. I believe there were 761. and he gave me the rest, and asked me if I was satisfied; I told him I was, if he was, and he said, he was, for he did not expect so much money for them; he was to call again for the remainder of the things, which Riley, the constable, has now got.</p>

               <p>Q.Pretty near the water-side? - A. Yes, in the day-time; because there is a thoroughfare through it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Fenham? - A.Two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the Police-officer that came to your house? - A.Riley and Elby.</p>
               <p>Q. They were old acquaintances of your's, I believe? - A. I have known Riley many years; I knew him when he was an apprentice.</p>

               <p>Q. You never heard of such a thing? - A. I may have heard of many things that I never knew any thing about.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was the 3d or 4th? - A. I am not particular to know whether it was or not.</p>

               <p>Q. You never do make a minute in writing? - A. No; I can hardly write my own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear it was the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th? - A. I will swear it was either the 3d or 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no other reason for knowing it, but your head? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were out of the way from the officers, you were at the house of a Mr. Kenyon, a flax-dresser, I believe, by Rotherhithe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not confined as a lunatic? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Who found you out? - A. I sent to the officer, and resigned myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you fixed it upon this man? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. And let your friend, Fenham, out? - A. My friend, Fenham, was the first that gave evidence against me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you were tried at the bar of this Court, you were acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. My leard Friend did not like to have the reason why you did not surrender yourself, now let us have the reason? - A. I sent to Mr. Baldwin, the secretary of the Duke of Portland, that I was willing to come forward, and he said it was of no use my coming forward, without I could find Davis, and Davis was apprehended in my house, at my instigation, and then I came forward.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he coming in the direction as from that house? - A. Yes, he passed me; I went a little farther, and saw something lying under some pales, and a man laid down by it; I asked him what he had got there; he said, his bundle; I told him, if it was his bundle, to get up, and pick it up; I told him it appeared like lead, he said, it might be lead, or copper, it did not belong to me; I sent my wife for another watchman to come and assist me, she was with me at the time; then this other watchman came, William Cox, he is not here; when he came up, he asked the man if he knew him, he said, no; says he, you may know me, my name is Thomas Bruce; Cox said to me, let him go, I know him; I let him go, and then he went down the lane where the other man was gone, I took the lead up and carried it home, it was very heavy; when morning came, I shewed it to people, and asked them it they knew any thing of it, and afterwards, Mr. Brown, who keeps the sign of the Swan, said, he knew where it came from, he sent two men to fetch it away from my house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there more than one piece of lead? - A. No, one piece.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter; on Saturday night, the 23d of December, a constable came to me, Thomas Ashwell, and charged me to assist him to execute a warrant against the two prisoners; I went with him to the Swan, Phillips was there making a gathering for Bruce amongst the workmen, to take him something to Newgate, this was a week after the lead was lost; the constable and I, and two or three others, went into the taproom, he tapped Phillips on the shoulder, and said, you are my prisoner, he gave me charge of him, and took charge of Humphreys himself; Phillips said, he would not be taken by any body, and Humphreys declared the same; we had a scuffle for near half an hour in the tap-room and passage, one man paid me about the head, and the constable too, with a stick; I did not know who they were, but they seemed to be working people, who knew most of them; Phillips swore, he would do for me, several times in the course of the scuffle, so did most of them, they cried, knock them down, and do them; and soon after breaking the tap-room door, and the bar door, I got Phillips down in the bar, and I held him fast down with my knee, he begged that I would not hurt him; I told him, if he behaved well, I would not, and I let him try to get up; as he was getting up, he pulled this knife out, (producing it;) I began to pay him about the head, and one of my men took the knife from him; we then got him down, and tied his hands and legs, put him in a cart, and took him to the watch-house; the next night after they got there, there was an attempt to rescue them, and we were obliged to send to Enfield for the soldiers; Humphreys was secured at the same time that Philips was, by other people, and they were both taken to the watch-house at the same time; the soldiers were obliged to go with their drawn hangers to handcuff them, and they were obliged to use their hangers to bring them to town, there was such a number of people round them; I came part of the way to town with them, they made several attempts, both of them, to run away, while I was with them, and the people that were round them endeavoured to assist them as much as they could; I was present this day week, when the lead was fitted to Mr. Benning's house, I received it from the officer, Jonathan Trott, that was the lead found upon Bruce, there were 67lbs. 3qrs. of it; I tried it to the portico, at the back part of Mr. Benning's house, it had been nailed up against the wall, the nails had been drawn out with the lead, except one which was a large spike, and the lead exactly fitted; I can safely take my oath, that that lead came from Mr. Benning's premises, the officers, Trott and Holmes, have got the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to apprehend them, was any thing said of what they were apprehended for? - A. No, nothing; I went in with the constable, and he gave me charge of them; while I was scuffling with Phillips in the tap-room, I told him, we wanted him for being concerned in taking the lead that was found upon Bruce, and then they got worse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The violence of their conduct encreased, after they found there was a charge of felony against them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - A.One is a wheelwright, the other a blacksmith, they had both worked in my yard that day, till between five and fix o'clock, not for me, but I gave them leave to work for a neighbour, in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q.This is a house very common for workmen to be paid at? - A. I never pay any men at a public-house, and I can only speak for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish every master would follow your example.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BRUCE sworn. - I am a sawyer: On Saturday night, the 16th of December, I was at the Swan drinking with a young man, about nine o'clock at night, and Humphreys came in, and had a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco; he desired me to go with him to the front door, which I did, and he told me he knew of some lead, and wanted me to help to carry it; I would not go at first, and we went into the parlour again, and stopped about half an hour longer; then Phillips and I had a glass of gin at the bar, and as we were going out, Humphreys came up and had a glass of gin, and then I went with them both to the bottom of an orchard belonging to Mr. Smith the butcher; Phillips told me to stop there, and he would bring the lead to me; I saw them go up the orchard, they were about an hour and a half getting it all; they both came back to me three times with lead; I took it from them over a ditch, and then all three of us took it to a place by the side of a lane; then Phillips put a piece upon Humphreys's shoulder to take down the lane, and another upon mine; I heard the watchman coming, and I threw my piece down; Humphreys went down the lane before me; the watchman came up, I was standing about two yards from it, I was never lying down at all, I told the watchman I did not know what it was; he sent for another watchman, and he knew me, and they let me go about my business, and I saw no more of them; I was taken up on Sunday morning, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Benning's house? - A. Yes; the orchard is about fifty or sixty yards from it; I did not see where they brought the lead from, nor they did not tell me they stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had pretty good reason to suspect it? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you throw it down when the watchman was coming? - A. I did not know rightly how it was, whether I came honestly by it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell him you did not know what you were carrying? - A. I did tell him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Jury to believe that you did not know it was lead that you were carrying? - A. I did not know rightly whether it was lead or copper.</p>
               <p>Q. But Phillips had told you that he knew of some lead? - A. Yes; I told the watchman I believed it was lead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You gave exactly the same account before the Magistrate that you have told now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed the next day to Newgate? - A. No, on the Wednesday; I was in the cage till then.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see Mr. Tuck while you were in the cage? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in Newgate? - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to you in Newgate for? - A. He came to see me; and I thought it would be best to tell him, and I told him the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed for trial for this offence? - A. I don't know whether it was for trial or not, I thought I was to go down to have another hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Which tells the truth, you or the watchman; you say you were standing still, and he says you were lying down? -</p>
               <p>Webb. He was lying down, leaning over the lead; I fell down over his feet, or I should not have seen him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was something between the two.</p>
               <p>Phillips's defence. I know nothing of the lead; when Mr. Tuck apprehended me, he pulled out a pistol, and caught me by my silk handkerchief that I had round my neck, and I thought he would have choaked me, and I pulled out my knife to cut the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Humphreys's defence. What Bruce says against me is all false; I neither saw him nor was I with him all that night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Phillips called two, and Humphreys five witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you use this wash-house yourself? - A. No; I only bought the fixtures and things of the garden, the week before, and Mr. Morrison left the key with me.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this evidence certainly does not go far enough to bring it home to the prisoner, and he must be acquitted.</p>

               <p>JOHN BECKHAM sworn. - I am a patrol; on Tuesday the 26th of December, I was going down Cow-cross, between five and six in the evening, I saw three men running down with firkins of butter upon their shoulders, there were three, I am sure, there might be more than three, they were coming from St. John's-street; I called at a house in Cow-cross, to call my partner Coltman, we both ran down Cow-cross, to the corner of Benjamin-street, they were then out of sight; we turned up Benjamin-street, and went through Falconer's-alley, one end of Falconer's-alley came into Cow-cross; I turned my head round, and looked down Sharp's-alley, and saw a man running along with a tub upon his shoulder, he was about thirty yards from me; he turned down Jacob's-court, and we ran down Jacob's-court after him, and saw a door open, we ran in there, and into the fore room, the door was open, there were four men in the house; I saw two tubs standing in the corner of the room, and one of the men was knocking one of the tubs to pieces, the woman at the bar was in the room, blowing the fire, I asked her whose property those were, and I think she said, they belonged to her, I will not be certain; I was rather afraid of myself; because I had not a cutlass, nor a stick, I believe she said it belonged to her, I cannot be certain; then they all asked us to drink, and she amongst the rest, I told her I would not drink any thing; three of the men then went out, the other man was the prisoner at the bar, he remained in the room; my partner went out after the other men, and left me with the prisoners, I secured them and the butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, that the prisoner was one of the men that you saw running with the firkin upon his shoulder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a court is this? - A.There is only that one house inhabited; I had known the woman before for these six or seven years, she has lived about the parish these six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that she lived in this house? - A. I knew she lived that way, but I did not know she lived in that house; she is a disorderly woman upon the town, I have seen her go into the court several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had that court been deserted? - A. About a week or more; Coltman came back, and we took the two prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is Long-lane in the City of London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this court in the City of London? - A. No; in St. John's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that as a fact? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw but three men? - A.There might be more.</p>
               <p>Q. And the three men, when you went into the room, ran away? - A. Three of the men ran away; I do not know that they were the same men.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a momentary pursuit, and they went in at the first door that was open? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Beckham called me, and I went after him to see for these men; I went with him down Cow-cross, toward's Sharp's-alley, and he had lost sight of them; we went into Falconer's-alley, and then we turned to the right-hand out of Falconer's-alley; I saw a man coming out of Sharp's-alley, and turned to the left-hand, towards Jacob's court, he had a tub upon his shoulder; we went down Jacob's-court, and crossed over the street after him; we turned down Jacob's-court, and there was a door open, and we went in, we lost sight of him, I suppose, for a yard and a half, or two yards, so that I did not see him go in, the passage door was wide open, the parlour door was not shut, but put to; we went into the room, there I saw four men, a woman, and two firkins of butter; I asked the woman whose property that was, there was a man knocking one of them to pieces, he had got two or three of the hoops off, and the head was dropped in upon the butter; she made a reply, that it was her's, and she said, d-n it, let us have some gin; I said, I did not want any, I had got a shilling, and if I wanted gin, I could buy some for myself; I proceeded towards the butter that stood at the corner of the room, and three of the men went out, I went out after them, and was knocked down by a brick-bat, or stone, or something of that kind, I suppose it to be a brick, it came from a man who stood about a yard and a half, or two yards from the door; when I went out, on the right-hand side, there was no lamp in the court, but one at the end of it; I got up again, and called out to my partner, to detain the two prisoners that were in the room, and seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100075"/>no more of them, I came back again, and went into the room; my partner took the man, and one of the firkins of butter to the watch-house, and left the woman and the other firkin in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that was knocking the firkins to pieces? - A. No, it was one of the three that went out; we have got the butter in our possession now. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Savage. These are my firkins, they have my mark upon them, S. A. in a circle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. All your firkins are marked in the same way, I suppose? - A. Yes; but there is a chalk mark upon the back of these, they were going to two different houses, one is marked with a D, and the other with an I, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mark them yourself? - A. No; I saw my man mark them, I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What butter was it? - A.York butter.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Coltman). Q. Did you know the woman prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where she lived? - A. I did not know where she lived at that time, I believe there were no other inhabitants in the court but herself; she was the servant, I believe, of the man who rented these houses before.</p>
               <p>Jones. These are part of what was delivered to me by my master.</p>
               <p>Coltman cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did not you ask whose house it was? - A. No; the first question we put was, whose property that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that poor boy at the bar stand? - A. Just opposite the door; the person that was working at the butter I knew very well; the prisoner, at Hatton-garden, said, that he had heard a noise, that the patrole were gone in, and he went in to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor man might have run from the house if he had pleased? - A. I do not know but he might, if my partner had not come back again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Leigh's defence. Coming home on Tuesday evening, I saw this woman standing at the corner of Jacob's-court, she caught hold of me, and asked me if I would give her any gin; I said, I would; I gave her one shilling to go for some gin; while she was gone for the gin, in came these three people with the firkins of butter; these two patroles followed them in at the same time; they ran out directly, and I never saw them after; the three men stood some time talking to the patroles before they made their escape.</p>
               <p>Brenton's defence. I cannot say how the butter came into my place, I know nothing at all about it.</p>

               <p>LYON BACKROW sworn. Q.What is your business? - A.Getting a shilling as well as I can, by going of errands. On Saturday, the 30th of December, in the evening, between six and seven o'clock -</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100076"/>Q. Was it light or dark? - A.Moonlight. I had a summons to deliver to Mrs. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that any relation to the prisoner? - A. His wife, I am told; I went to the bar, and delivered it to Mrs. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. At what bar? - A.In the Fleet-prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a summons do you mean? - A. For wearing hair-powder without having a licence. When I was coming out again, I heard somebody cry, stop him, stop him; I did not know what they meant; and immediately they seized me by the collar -</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you by the collar? - A. Mr. Richards, that man there; he said I must come back along with him; and I refused, I said, what for; says he, you shall come back, and you shall see what for; and I refused again; and he catched hold of me by the collar; I refused going back; and several more came up to assist him; he dragged me, against my will, along through the passage, till I came to a place where there were some stone steps going into a yard; I said, Mr. Thacker knew me, that was that gentlemen there; and Mr. Thacker said, yes, I know him to be a d-d informer; they took me to the pump, and pumped upon me for three or four minutes, as long as they thought proper, and I resisted.</p>

               <p>Q. When you say they, do you mean the prisoners? - A. Yes, both of them; Mr. Richards never left my collar; after they had done pumping upon me, I do not know who it was, but somebody threw a pail of water over my face; my clothes were all torn; my breeches were almost torn from me, and my waistcoat was tore to pieces; I missed out of my pocket, all the money I had, a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, one shilling, and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. And you charge these prisoners with taking your money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find any of your money upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you have to say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, There is an end of this indictment; it was very improper conduct, but cannot possibly be the subject of an indictment of this sort. From the circumstances of this case, it appears very plain what they were about, by the expression, informer, and their conduct may be punished in another way; there was clearly no intention of taking his money; his money, very probably, might have dropped from his clothes.</p>

            , William Boyden, and myself: In consequence of a suspicion I took stock on Monday the 11th of December, and again on Sunday the 17th of December; I then missed two particular grosses of buttons, one of which I afterwards found upon the prisoner; I only took an account of that part of the stock that was most likely to be purloined; the prisoner was our porter; I concealed myself in a room adjoining to his bed-room, and through an aperture in the wainscoat which divides the two rooms, I observed him to take a parcel, or parcels, I believe there were two, from his box, those he deposited in the window-seat while he dressed himself, it was Sunday morning; when he had dressed himself, he put them in his coat-pocket, and went down stairs to his dinner; he came up about half an hour afterwards into his own room again, I was in the next room concealed all the time; he again opened his box, and took from it sundry articles of plate; he then went down stairs, I followed him, I rung the bell, and he was sent in to me; I asked him what he had to do with plate, indeed, I told him the situation I had been in, and what I had seen; he told me he came honestly by them, or some such answer; I told him my suspicions, and that, if he was an honest man, which I hoped he would prove himself to be, he would not object to let me see what he had about him, and what was in his box; he refused, and I sent for Church, the constable, he searched him, and in his coat-pocket were found the three gross of buttons charged in the indictment; there are only two gross that I can identify, they are the same kind of articles that I missed upon checking the stock; the gross of plated coat-buttons had the number 5391 in the writing of the manufacturer; I had particularly remarked those figures when I took the stock; there was only a gross and a half of that sort of buttons at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100078"/>I took stock on the 11th of December, and when I checked it, there was but half a gross left, and there had been no buttons of that description sold by us; there was a gross of small gilt buttons found upon him, of which the white outside paper was torn off upon which the number was affixed, and it remained in brown paper only; to the best of my belief, that was the gross that I missed, I have no doubt of it; the others are a kind of button that we have a great many of, I cannot identify them; I sent for a constable, and the prisoner said, he could give an account how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was on a Sunday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you spent the morning in posting your books, and taking stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were kind enough to take the plate out of his box? - A. The constable took it with the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost no articles of plate? - A. No; they were afterwards returned to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afterwards kind enough to stop a box of his, down at Wapping? - A. Yes; and that was returned to him.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he could give an account of these articles? - A. Yes; and I told him I was satisfied they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore that stopped all further explanation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you first of all accused him of coming dishonestly by the plate, and then he grew rather crusty, and refused to be searched till you sent for a constable? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever come to your knowledge that the prisoner was a dealer in goods of this sort? - A. No; I never knew that he had kept a shop of any description; I have heard it since, and I had reason to believe it, from invoices being found in his pocket of tea and hats.</p>
               <p>Q. You never happened to hear that he dealt in buttons? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. This manufacturer is, I dare say, entirely engaged in manufacturing for you? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. And this mark is the manufacturer's mark, and not your's? - A. It is not our's, but the manufacturer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you had not sold these articles by any person in your shop in the course of that week? - A. I mean to swear that no such article has ever been accounted for.</p>
               <p>Q. You have two partners? - A. They do not interfere at all in the conducting of the business, I conduct it myself, with Mr. Boyden, who travels for the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And will you, where a man stands in the perilous situation in which the prisoner stands, swear positively to these goods? - A. I only swear to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been with you? - A. A month and two days.</p>

               <p>Q. He went after that too, perhaps? - A. Yes, by order of the Lord-Mayor; but it was not taken away till his wife went to fetch it with a letter from his Lordship; it was never brought before his Lordship, only an account taken of the things in it; I was sent by the Lord-Mayor to search it.</p>
               <p>Q. And after searching it narrowly, you let it all go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a great many articles of trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And bills of parcels? - A. I do not recollect seeing any bills of parcels, every thing was returned to him except the buttons. (The buttons were produced in Court, and deposed to by Mr. Ashness.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever carry on any business in London? - A. Yes; I have sold him buttons, my brother is a button-maker in Birmingham, and he sent me up some buttons, which I sold to the prisoner, he bought at one time, three gross, and three pair of buckles.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sell him such a number, that they must have been more than his own private consumption for cloaths? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he treated you there? - A. He had; it touched my feelings, and with that I told him, I would be glad if he would call upon me at my lodgings, for I was in a great hurry; he said, he had no money, and wished me to treat him and his friends; I went with him into Mr. Cummings's wine-vaults, the corner of <placeName id="t17980110-61-crimeloc336">Little Pulteney-street</placeName>

I am ruined; I went out and looked each way, to see if I could see any thing of them, but could not; and then I went to Bow-street; I saw no more of any of them for five weeks, within one day; and then I saw the prisoner, and took him, at a broker's, in Kent-court, Berwick-street, I had received information that he was there; I took a watchman with me, we went up stairs, and found him lying on the bed, about nine o'clock in the evening, he had his hat on; I looked under his hat, and said to the watchman, this is my prisoner; he said, he would go with us; he was taken to St. James's watch-house, and the next day, we had him up to Marlborough-street; I asked him, going along, how he could do such a thing as to take my pocket-book, and he said, that was no place for examination, and he should not say any thing further about it; I have never found my pocket-book or notes since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Had you any note or bill of exchange due to you, besides the 53l. that you say you have lost? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, you never have said to any body, that you had lost 120l.? - A. I never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never ask 120l. of any body to indemnify you for your loss? - A. I never did, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. It was after you had looked over the notes, that he told you his name was Foreman? - A. Yes; he told me a very great story to say that his mother was housekeeper to Lord Grosvenor.</p>
               <p>Q. Lord Grosvenor has more houses than one, we all know-Don't you know that he gave you his real name? - A. I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate; that when Foreman returned into the room, he observed to you that Wilson and Tarver were gone away, and then he went away? - A. No, I did not say so; he never came in at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected to be the pay-master for this liquor that was called for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore there was no occasion for them to wait to pay the reckoning? - A. No; I was treating them in friendship as I thought, little thinking they meant to rob me.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you never say it was Wilson who robbed you? - A. No; I have said, he was certainly the instigation of my being robbed, but I never said he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you never say, you did not know who had robbed you, and that you only knew you had the money before you got there? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.You called upon Foreman, in the Tower? - A. Yes; he keeps the Golden-chain public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell him, if he would come forward and advance 25l. or guineas, you would take care not to appear? - A. I never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go a second time, and say to Foreman, if he would advance fifteen guineas, you would say no more about it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a constable with you? - A. Yes; his name is Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not shew him a warrant? - A. The constable did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him, if he did not advance money, you would take Foreman up? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not send you away, telling you you were a couple of bites, and he would have nothing to do with you? - A. No; he spoke very short and saucily to us, and we walked off, we had no right to be talked to in that manner, we went there in hopes of finding the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100081"/>Q. Did you never say, that you were determined you would not lose all the money, for you would have 40l. or else you would hang this man? - A. I never did; for I believe there is nothing to be had about it.</p>

I asked him why he informed me before that it was only 53l. he said, because he thought he should get his 53l. back, and a little more to make up his lost time; I have repeatedly heard him say, that if he could not do the prisoner Foreman over, at Marlborough-street, he would be sure to do it at the Old-Bailey, as he should bring forward plenty of witnesses, and if he was hung, he should be sure to have 40l. towards his 53l. he said that repeatedly.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Golden-chain public-house, in the Tower; my brother is the prisoner's father.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Lord? - A. I know a gentleman who answered to the name of Lord, that is the man, (pointing to him); he is in a different dress; he called upon me two Sundays running, about four or five weeks ago, before my nephew was taken up; the first time he came alone, and asked me if my name was not Foreman; I said, yes; then he asked me if I had not a nephew in the Supplementary Militia; I told him I believed I had, I had been informed so, but not knowing the truth of it, I could not say; he told me he had been in his company, and had lost a pocket-book with Bank-bills, and Bank-notes, and Bills of Exchange, to the amount of one hundred and twenty pounds; and, to the best of my recollection, he asked me what was to be done in it; he said, if he could get but twenty-five pounds he would say no more about it; I said I would advance no money upon any such pretences; he said, he had been offered ten pounds more than he had lost, and had refused it, I believe that was all that passed that evening; he came again the Sunday following, with an elderly gentleman who said he was a constable, and they asked me what was to be done in the business, for they meant to take him up; the elderly gentleman shewed me a piece of paper like a warrant, I was apt to think it was an old warrant, or a sham matter, because it was all over dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read it? - A. No, they would not let me; Mr. Lord then offered to take fifteen guineas; I told him I would not advance any thing; Mr. Lord told me then he should persevere; I wanted to know the reason why the other people that were in the room with him were not taken up as well as Foreman; and he said they were absent, not to be found; and that if I, or some of my family, did not come forward, he should take him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Have you known much of this nephew of your's of late? - A. I have not seen him, above once or twice, these six months.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know he was in the supplementary Militia? - A. I had heard so, but I could not believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life was he in? - A. An apprentice to a cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his master's name? - A.Dowling, in Lambeth-marsh; he had been apprenticed about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any person of the name of Disney? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, of course, you never gave any such person authority to settle the matter, and desired him to apply to you? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any one else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was then called up again, and interrogated as to the several expressions sworn to by the witnesses for the prisoner, all which he positively denied.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the wash-house window open the night before? - A. No; I saw it at one o'clock the day before, when I came home to dinner, it is a place that we never have occasion to open in the winter time; the bead that confines the window was taken off, and laid by the sink, inside of the wash-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who uses this wash-house, I suppose, the family and the servants? - A. Yes, but we had no servants at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it situated? - A. Close to my dwelling.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no inward communication? - A. No; only by the flews, there is no door, it is built against the wall close up to the house, and immediately adjoins in the yard, enclosed with a wall.</p>
               <p>Q.Do not the lodgers wash in it? - A.Nobody washes in it, at present, but my wife, for the lady in the first floor does not wash at home.</p>

            ; the evidence has shewn, that about six in the morning, when there was occasion for a candle, the prosecutor discovered the prisoner in the wash-house, and he found the copper door lying upon the ground, but that could not be a stealing of the goods, it must be laid to be assixed to the freehold; and as to the charge of breaking, with intent to steal the goods, it does not appear that there were any moveable goods in the place.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to employ a waterman to see for an anchor for you? - A. Because he knew the place better than I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it not usual to mark anchor with the weight? - A. Yes, but they very often wear out; I did not see it till I came to use it.</p>

               <p>Chandler's defence. I had been down into Field-lane, after some old iron; I was going up Red-lion-street, and heard a cry of stop thief, and this man came up, and laid hold of me; the constable pulled down my breeches, and opened my coat and waistcoat, and searched me; I had no handkerchief of that gentleman's about me; I am a stranger in London.</p>
               <p>M'Grimes's defence. I belong to the Supplementary Militia; I was going up Holborn, upon business for my serjeant, and this gentleman laid hold of me, and said, I had picked his pocket.</p>

            . In consequence of some information that I had received, on Monday, the 18th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, I searched the privy upon my premises, and over the entrance of the door, on the inside, there were a great many pieces of indigo secreted, it was in a dark place, where no light comes; it was concealed upon the loose timbers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in a situation that persons might have seen them if they had not been looking for them? - A. I think not; I marked four of the pieces with my pencil, with the initials of my name, and placed them in the same situation again; I directed one of my men, who saw me mark it, to stay there while I went home, and got my great coat, as I thought it was likely to be a night job to watch; I placed myself in an adjoining privy, where I could see whoever came to the other privy, and they could not see me: In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come out of the privy where the indigo was secreted; I let him pass the privy where I was, and went to feel if the indigo was gone, and I found it was; I followed him immediately, and as he was going past Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, on the wharf, I collared him; he asked me what was the matter; I told him, I had reason to think he was extremely fond of indigo; and as he went along, I observed he had his hands in his pockets; and I told him, if he did not take his hands from his pockets, I would certainly break his arm, I had a short stick in my hand; I took him to our accompting-house, and searched him; I took out of his pocket, two pounds four ounces of indigo, amongst them were two of the pieces that I had marked, (produces them); I went to search his lodgings, and then he said, it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour, or use any threat? - A. Not at all; he said, he had taken it out of No. 20, that is one of the warehouses that was full of indigo; he said, he had about a pound at home, that he took it when he went home to dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are there any other persons among the bull-porters, than those you have just mentioned? - A. There are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100089"/>Q. This privy is upon the open wharf? - A.It is close to the water-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore every person on the wharf has access to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a very tall man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he might have seen this indigo there? - A. It is a dark place, generally used for paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore in feeling for paper, he might have felt the indigo? - A. He might certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Was he a labourer in your warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- Fox sworn. - I am clerk to these gentlemen: I took a candle and lanthorn after the prisoner was brought into the accompting-house, and in the yard, between the privy and the accompting-house, I found several pieces of indigo, among them were two pieces marked

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Does your master usually fell fowls that die a natural death, to be eaten? - A. Yes; whatever comes to market, we always fell it at some price or other, be what it will.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them on Saturday, they were in a basket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them on Monday, they were in a bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this sowl with the spur off, would not any other fowl that had the spur taken out, look just the same? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it is a common thing, in order to make a hard, tough old cock, look like a fine young fowl? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And because this spur was bloody, you will swear to it? - A. I swear to all the fifteen, that was the quantity that was lost, and the quantity that was found.</p>
               <p>Q. But, suppose other fifteen fowls had been found, would you have sworn to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think no other man smothers fowls besides your master? - A. He does not smother them, it is the country people that smother them, and send them up.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it that there are two Counts in the indictment, one laying them to be the property of Mr. and the other of Mrs. Strickland? - A. They are separate traders, he is a salesman in butter, with a partner, and she carries on the sole trade of the poultry for herself.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular about the bag? - A. No; it was a common old sack.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was going from Cow-lane towards Snow-hill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the way from Newgate-market but towards it? - A. Rather towards Fleet-market.</p>
