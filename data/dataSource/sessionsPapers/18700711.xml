I am an inspector of the detective police—I was instructed to watch at the Midland Station, St. Pancras—on Monday, 30th May, I saw the prisoner come on to the platform, about 10.10, and try the mail-room door—he did not open it, it was locked—I had seen Folkard and the prisoner's brother, Richard, on the platform, some short time before that—Folkard had collected the bags in the usual course, taken them to the mail-room, locked them up, and gone away—after the prisoner tried the door he left the station—Folkard afterwards came to the station again, a few minutes before 11 o'clock, with the bags from the Great Northern Railway—he collected the bags from the up mail train at 11 o'clock, gave them to the mail driver, and then went out of the station, along the Euston Road, to the Victoria public-house, at the corner of York Road, where he joined the prisoner, his brother, and another man—that is about five minutes' walk from the Midland Station—I left them there—on the night of 2nd June I took Richard Bowman into custody—Folkard was taken by Sergeant Moon, on the morning of the 3rd, on another charge—on the morning of the 3rd I went to the prisoner's lodging, Julia Cottage, Marlborough Road, Dalston—he was in bed—his sister brought him down to me—I asked if he knew a person named Folkard—he said he did—I asked when he saw him last—he said "Last Monday," that he was at the railway station with him, and also at the Victoria public-house—that was Monday, the 30th, the day to which I have been referring—I asked him to allow me to look in his room—he did so—I found nothing—on Thursday, 9th June, I again went to his lodging—he was in bed—he was called down, and I said "You know me, I am an officer; I am going to ask you some questions; you need not answer them unless you please; were you in a public-house in the Gray's Inn Road on last night fortnight?—he said "What public-house? '—I said "The Pindar of Wakefield"—he said "I don't know such a house"—I said it was a house not far from the coffee-house in which you and your brother very often slept, in the Gray's Inn Road—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I said "A 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was changed in that house, on that evening"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "Were you in any public-house in the Gray's Inn Road on that evening?—he said "No"—I said "Where were you on that evening?"—he said "I can't remember"—I then said "Have you any objection to go with me to the Pindar of Wakefield?"—he said "No, I have not, I will go with you"—we went in a cab to the</p>

'—he said "Yes"—I said "Do you know this young man?"—he said "Yes, that is the man; do you remember my asking you a question about Bird Street?—the prisoner said "No, I don't"—Mr. Fayer said "Why, you endorsed the note"—he said "No, I know nothing about it"—Mr. Fayer then said to his barmaid "Do you know him?"—she said "Yes, that is the man that gave me the note"—I said to the prisoner "You hear what they say now?"—he said "Yes, I do; but it is a mistake"—I then said to Miss Coulson "You are positive this is the man?"—she said "Yes, I knew him the moment he came into the house"—I then told him he would have to go with me to Bow Street, and I took him into custody—on searching him I found two duplicates, one for a gold Albert, pledged on 17th May, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and another for a silver watch, on 18th May, for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>at the Midland Railway Station—there is a room there in which the mail bags are deposited—I kept one key of that room and Folkard another—Folkard was on duty on the night of the 2nd of June—it was the duty of whichever of us was on duty at the time to wait the arrival of the up train from Leicester and Derby at 9.50, and then take the bags into the room, and then go across to the King's Cross Station and receive the bags which came up from the Great Northern and take them also into the same room, and then about 11 o'clock to put them into the ran for the General Post Office—during the time the bags were in the mail-room it should be kept locked, and the van also locked into which the bags are put—we were not allowed to take any persons into the mail-room—I have seen Richard Bowman with Folkard about three or four times, and his "brother, too—about 6.0 one morning I found them in the mail-room—I could not open the door—it was opened to me by Folkard from the inside, and there was Folkard, the two Bowmans, and another person—they were asleep till I aroused them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sized room is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly as large as this Court—there are two large cases in it intended for papers relative to our duties, a large table, and two stools, no screens, only a high desk—I did not take any account of the day on which I found the four persons asleep there, it was some time in May—it was unusual and improper—I did not report it—I asked Folkard for an explanation, and he said they were out late and could not get into their lodging, and came in there; that was satisfactory so far—I should not have thought it perfectly satisfactory if I had heard nothing afterwards about the bags being cut open—I did not approve of it, but I did not notice it to any one—6 o'clock in the morning is our ordinary time for going on duty—we remain there most of the day until 11 o'clock at night—the two of us do that duty—I should be on from 6 o'clock a.m. till 5.30 or 6 o'clock p.m., and part of the day we should be on together—I should be on duty from ten to eleven hours—it depends upon the arrival of the trains; it is not more than eleven hours at the outside, and we are not fully employed even that time—the second duty would commence at middle day from 11 to 12 o'clock, and the one that went on duty then would remain till night—we did not work alternately—I was chiefly on the early duty, from 6 o'clock a.m. till some time in the afternoon, and Folkard was chiefly on at night up to 11 o'clock—I knew Richard Bowman four or five years—he was in the employ of the Post Office as a letter-carrier—I have seen him a few times since—Richard Bowman has been to see him, so he told me, but I have not seen him about as I have Robert—both the Bowmans were respectable as far as I knew—I never left the mail<lb/>room without locking the door—there is a clock immediately opposite, on the other Bide of the platform, which can be seen from the door if there are no car<lb/>riages on the line between.</p>

I was engaged by the Post Office authorities to keep a look out at the Midland Station—I was there on 2nd June, about 9.30, and saw the prisoners come on the platform—they went straight to the mail room—Folkard unlocked the door, and they went in—the gas was lighted—they remained in there till the bell rang for the arrival of the 9.30 up train—Folkard then came out and shut the door—he crossed the metals on to the up platform, collected the bags from the guards of the train, and went back with them to the mail room, and shut the door—shortly afterwards the gas was turned down sufficiently low for</p>

               <p>any person inside to see what they were doing—in about five minutes he came out, locked the door, and went away with the key—in about twenty-five minutes he came back from the direction of King's Cross with other bags, unlocked the door, went into the room, and shut the door after him—the gas was then turned up—he remained in there till 10.45—he then come out on to the platform, looked up and down, went in again, and shut the door—in about two minutes he partially opened the door and put his head out—he then withdrew it, and closed the door—shortly afterwards the bell rang for the arrival of the 11 o'clock train from the north—he then came out, bringing with him the mail-bags, which he placed outside the door, and having collected them together, put them on his shoulder—the gas in the room was then turned out by somebody inside while he was on the platform, and immediately afterwards Bowman came out of the mail room—Folkard with the bags then crossed the metals again on to the up line, having locked the door—he collected the bags from the up train, and took them to the mail guard, Burkinshaw—Bowman came round from the platform, where the mail room is, on to the arrival platform, where he met Folkard—he first seated himself—he afterwards got up and went towards Folkard—I saw Folkard in the act of putting the bag into the van—I then went out of the station, and shortly afterwards saw the two prisoners come out of the private entrance, the passengers' entrance, into the Euston Road—a porter came to the gate, and closed it after them—they remained some minutes talking to the porter—he went back into the station, and they seated themselves on a ledge close to the gate—in about four or five minutes they ware joined by the porter, and they all three went along the Euston Road to the Victoria public-house, and went in—they had some beer, and directly they had finished it, they came out all three together—Folkard went away up the York Road, in the direction of his lodging—Bowman crossed the Gray's Inn Road and proceeded a short distance along it to 301, a coffee-house, which he entered—he passed through the shop, and in about a minute or a minute and a half afterwards I saw him come to the second floor front window, with a candle in his hand, and draw the curtain across—I then left Constable Moon there to keep watch, and took a cab and went to the General Post Office and saw Mr. Dixon—I got there before the bags—I had some conversation with him, and having ascertained the state of the bags, I went back to toe coffee-house—I had some conversa<lb/>tion with the landlady and Moon, and I went up stairs, she going first—she knocked at the door of the second floor front room—I had told her to say that Folkard wanted to speak to him—some one inside answered, "Who's there?—she said, "Mr. Folkard wants to speak to you"—he replied, "Send him up"—I then went to the door and knocked—Home one inside said "Is that you, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—I said, "Yes, open the door"—it was not opened, and he said again, "Is that you, Bill?" and I said, "Yes, open the door"—I heard a shuffling in the room, and I forced the door open, and found the prisoner Bowman Standing in the room in his shirt—Moon brought a light, and I saw the jacket which Bowman is now wearing, lying on a chair—I took it up, and he said "What are you going to do?" and I said "I am a police-officer'—I took out of the pocket of the coat a bundle containing 53 letters, some containing money orders and advices—two of the letters were in a pocket-book—I sent him to the station—I produce all the letters, they all bear the Derby post-mark of 2nd June, and each letter had been opened by cutting the envelope at the top.</p>

Albus he said, "I have got the authority of my brother directors to sign that"—he had signed the name when he said that—I will not be certain whether he said director or directors—immediately I saw him sign both names I had my doubts, and instead of giving him five shillings, I hesitated, and made up my mind not to give him the money; but I said "I will give you that stool and a shilling"—not the stool he was sitting on, but an old stool in the shop—he hesitated, and at last accepted that offer as the premium, and left this policy with me, and one of his brother directors took the old stool with him and went away—I do not know whether that was Mr. Bray, but he urged me to become an agent of the society.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Lawler, and reside at 24, Sidney Street, Clarendon Square—I have two daughters, Clara and Alice—on Easter Thursday last, my daughter Alice left my house—she wore at the time a linsey dress skirt, with a flounce at the bottom, black jacket, enamelled side-spring boots, black and red plaid scarf, and a hat with a red rose in front, or a black velvet hat with a blue feather—she took both hats with her, but I do not know which she had on—she had also a quantity of under-clothing—she left a note upon the table—I went to the Praed Street police-station, Camden Town, and gave a written description of her—on the 15th May I called at the police-station, Bow Street, and accompanied a detective to Foggarty's Buildings in Drury Lane—we met a police officer on the way there—I stopped outside at the top of Foggarty's Buildings until they came back—they brought back my daughter with them—she was then clothed in rags—she had not the linsey skirt, nor the jacket, nor the scarf, nor the hat, nor the boots—I have redeemed some of those articles since from the leaving shops which were pointed out to me—one of them was a sweet-stuff shop—I have got a pair of drawers and the linsey skirt—the chemise is still retained, but I believe it will be given up by the prisoner's mother—I have at home the ticket for the petticoat, which was taken from her the same day she left, and pawned for a shilling in Drury Lane.</p>

I am a grocer, of 106, Oxford Street, Stepney—on Mon<lb/>day, 30th May, about 2.30 or 3 o'clock, I was standing at my door, which is just opposite 80, Sidney Street—I heard the report of fire arms from the other side—I saw the prisoner come out of No. 80, opposite, with a rifle in his hand—he shut the door and went away—that was all I saw of him—I believe he had hold of the barrel of the rifle, because he was carrying it straight along, like this.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Jane Ellis was admitted there on 4th June—she had two or three small lacerations about her face and scalp, and was suffering from slight concussion—there was a wound on the left side of her head, and another on the right of her nose, which was of the most consequence; it went down to the bone—erysipelas set in about a week afterwards—she was ill for two or three weeks, and then died of erysipelas—in all probability erysipelas would not have set in if she had not received those wounds—we find small wounds about the face exceedingly likely to take erysipelitic action, but she might have had erysipelas if she had not had the wounds—it is improbable—the cause of death, in my opinion, was exhaustion attendant on the erysipelas—</p>

               <p>if this cup had been thrown at her when it was whole, it would very likely have caused such wounds—I think it very unlikely that the cup would give her concussion of the brain; a blow might have caused it, but it would re-quire a good blow—I cannot tell the state of the blow, or of her general health, but if she was in a bad state of health erysipelas would set in more readily.</p>

I said she could not see him, as he did not get to bed till 3 o'clock that morning. I asked her to go, very civilly. She wanted to stand in my passage and annoy the people opposite, but I would not let her; I put her out at the street door, and went on with my work. About 1.30 she came again, and got in on to the door mat; I got all the skin off my hand getting her out again, and shut her out. She came a third time, and said she would not go without seeing my husband. I called him up, and she spoke about the petition. She would not go out, and as I went to put her out, she spat a mouthful of filth in my face. I took her by the shoulders, and she fell and struck her head against the door. My teeth were knocked out, and in my passion I took the cup and threw it at her. I was driven to it. The skin is off my leg now.</p>

               <p>waiting for me—he asked me whether I would mind having any beer, and I said "Yes"—we had a pint of beer, and then went down Keppel Street together, across King's Road into Wellington Square—we went to the bottom house on the right hand side, very near the bottom—I have since been told it is No. 24—I do not know that myself—the prisoner opened the door with a key, and I went with him down stairs into the back yard—he told me that he wanted to do away with one drain and to make another drain in the corner—I asked him why he wanted it done—he said he wanted to make the drain into the water-closet drain—I told him I thought it was a curious place for it—he said "Never mind; you can do as I tell you"—I then started to work, and got it out till he told me to leave off—I came out of the hole then—the hole was about 3 ft. deep, and about 7 ft. long—it was under the wall of the closet—I asked him to let me take up the closet stone, the floor, instead of tunnelling under it; that was after I had done a good bit of the work—he said "Perhaps the old gentleman would not like it"—I was there an hour and a half altogether—while I was at work the prisoner was lying on a heap of ballast in the yard—he did not leave at all while I was at work—when I had finished he said "That will do till I see the old gentleman;" perhaps he would be there that night or else the next morning—we then went into the front kitchen—he said I had better leave my tools there against the sink, in the back kitchen, and I was to come again next morning at 6.30 to finish the drain—I said "Very well"—he then took a bill out of the front kitchen window, and said it ought to have been done before, the house was let some time—the bill had on it "House to Let," I believe—we then went up stairs into the back parlour, and into the front parlour, and he took some bills out of the windows there—we then left the house together, and went up the square, and down Markham Street, and it was about 3 o'clock when I left him—next morning I went to the house again at 8.30, instead of 6.30—the prisoner was not there—I could not get in—I went again the next morning, but could not get in then; and again on the Thursday morning; I went two or three times that day—I then made inquiry where the prisoner lived, and I heard there was some one in custody—I did not know it was him—I communicated with the police, and on Friday I went to the house in Wellington Square with a constable—there were five or six constables there, searching about the yard—I pointed out to them the place where I had dug the hole—Constable Watts brought up the flagstone in the water-closet, and they dug out the earth in the place where I bad undermined it, and I there saw a body found—I assisted in taking the mould out—it was the body of a gentleman, dressed all but his coat; the coat was lying underneath the body—I saw the prisoner on the Saturday afterwards—he was then in custody—he had been shaved then—he had shaved his whiskers off, and his whiskers were dyed, what he had got on then, his moustache, a darker colour than what they were before—his beard was dyed too.</p>

Mr. Huelin and his housekeeper well—on Monday even<lb/>ing, 9th May, my attention was called to No. 15 by my children—I went out, and saw Mr. Huelin's dog on the doorstep—I then went to the back of the house—over my garden wall I saw that the windows were open, and every appearance of no one being in the house—I went and spoke to the policeman on the beat, and by his advice I went to the station—I went over the house with two policemen, at 11 o'clock at night—I got over my garden wall—I found the back-doors open—one of the back-doors was really open, and the other was simply fastened, not locked; we had merely to open it—we went over the house—there was no person in the house—there was no appearance of disorder in the house—in a bedroom on the first floor I saw a pail, with a scrubbing-brush, as if some one had been just interrupted in cleaning—the window of that room was wide open—the police and I left together, at 11.15—I saw a large box, painted green, standing in the back kitchen; there was nothing about it to attract notice, and of course we did not open anything—on the following morning, the first thing, I went to Mr. Carter, one of Mr. Huelin's intimate friends—I judged that no one had been in the house after I left, by seeing the dog there still on the step in the morning, a little before 8 o'clock—Mr. Carter afterwards came and went into the house—I did not go in with him—on the Tuesday night, about 10.30, I saw the prisoner get out of a Hansom's cab at the door of No. 15—I went to my window, thinking, perhaps, it was Mr. Huelin returned—that was bow it was I saw him—he asked some questions of the person who opened the door, which I did not hear; he then turned to the cabman, and as he got into the cab he said "Park Walk, No. 45 or 49," I think he said "49;" I could not be certain which—the cab drove away with him in it—in from ten to fifteen minutes I heard the cab return, and I heard the prisoner ask the person who opened the door if she had any wine, and tell her to bring a bottle of wine, and he turned to the cabman and said "<hi rend="italic">Cabby,</hi> come and have a glass of wine"—I noticed no peculiarity about his voice, there was no peculiar accent about it that evening—the cabman went into the house, and I went and took the number of the cab—in a few minutes the cabman came out, accompanied by the prisoner, and I heard him say "9 o'clock to-morrow"—the cabman drove away, and the prisoner returned into the house—on the following night, just as it was striking 9 o'clock, the cabman returned, but without the prisoner—the cab was empty—I heard the person who opened the door say something to the cabman, and he said he would go away and have a drain and return—I afterwards went out, and on returning, about 9.50, I saw a van standing at the door of No. 15, and the same cab</p>

I am a cab-driver—the No. of my cab is 4,746—on Tuesday night, 10th May, I was with my cab, near Cremorne Gardeni—I was hailed by a gentleman, who asked the way to 9, Park Walk—I directed him the way—he asked if I could take him there—I said I would take him there for a shilling—he got into the cab, and on the way to Park Walk be ordered me to 15, Paulton's Square—I drove there, and he got out of the cab—he did not go into the house—he got into the cab again, and ordered me to No. 9, Park Walk—he got out there, and made some inquiries, but the people at the house did not seem to understand him—they asked me where I brought him from—I told them from 15, Paulton's Square—he then came to me, and said it was either No. 9, 7, or 5—he went to No. 7, knocked at the door, and was answered from an up stairs window—they could not understand him there—by his language you could not make him out—the gentleman at No. 7 could speak French and Italian, and spoke to him in both, but he could not understand it, and the gentleman persuaded me to take him home, and said he might come to-morrow, and probably be might find some of his friends that he was inquiring for—the man then tried No. 5, with the same result—they could not make head or tail of him there—he then got into the cab, and at his request I drove him to 15, Paulton's Square—he knocked at the door—it was answered by the charwoman—he did not go inside—a little conversation took place between them outside, and he got back into the cab again—I did not hear what the conversation was—this was something about 10 o'clock—the woman told me to drive either to 44 or 45, Park Walk, and said the people had newly moved in—the prisoner appeared to be quite intoxicated at times, at other times be appeared to be quite sober—I then drove him to 45 first—he got out there, and knocked at the door, but there was no result there—he then crossed over to 44, and knocked and rang, and was answered from the window above by a gentleman, who told him if he did not go away he would</p>

I live at 2, Stanley Road, Sandi End, Fulham, and am a gas stoker in the service of the Imperial Gas Company—on Tuesday afternoon, 10th May, about 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner outside a beer-house at Sands End—I had not known him before; he was a little tipsy—he asked me if I could fetch him a girl—I said I could not, he might get one by-and-bye if he would wait—he asked whether I should be glad to earn a shilling or so; I said "Yes," as I had not done much lately—he asked me if there were any private rooms about—I said "No, there was a private parlour round there, behind the Plough"—we went to the Hand and Flower public-house—he asked if I would have anything to drink; I said "A drop of ale"—he said he had got a box to be removed, and asked if I would move it—I said "Yes"—he asked if I could fetch a cart, and not be half an hour about it—I said I would—I asked what time he was going to have this box removed, and he said "About 8 o'clock"—I went to him it 8 o'clock, and he told me to follow him—I had no cart with me then—he went down Gunter's Grove, I followed him to Stanley Bridge, along the Fulham Road, into Camera Square—I went into the Roebuck with him, and had a glass of ale—we then went across to Paulton's Square, and stopped about two doors down, and he told me not to disappoint him in fetching a cart in half an hour's time—he did not point out any house till we got to the bottom of Danby Street, Paulton's Square, and Danby Street leads into one—he pointed to a house, a plumber and glazier's, where he said he lived, but he did not go in there, he went into a house in Paulton's Square, but I could not see what house it was—when I saw him go into that house I did not fetch the cart, because I thought he was making a fool of me—when I was in the parlour with him he pointed towards North End as the place where I was to go to with the cart—I saw nothing more of him till he was in custody at Rochester Row Police Station—I picked him out from twenty<lb/>five or thirty people—he spoke to me in a French accent.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187007110070"/>
               <p>before going into the kitchen he put his hand into the front kitchen which was facing the foot of the kitchen stairs, and got a bundle of rope that must have been lying on the dresser; be got it in the dark, as if he knew where to put his hand upon it—the box stood in the back kitchen, under the wall, on the left-hand side—he said "I want that box corded"—I said "It don't require cording, it will stand in the bottom of the van"—he said he would have the box corded, and he would cord it himself—he went to cord it round the middle—I told him that was the wrong way—I took the cord out of his hand, and made a loop at the end, and put it under the box—after I had got the rope round over the lock, and under the box, I picked the other end of the box up with my left hand on its end, to make a half hitch with the rope underneath, and I felt something was on my hand—I looked at it by the candle-light, and saw it was blood—the prisoner stood on my right, and Mrs. Middleton on my left—I said to the prisoner "What does that mean?"—I had then got the box out about 2 ft from the wall, and looking on the floor, I saw that there was a pool of blood when I had lifted the box from—I asked the prisoner a second time what it meant—he never answered me—I asked Mrs. Middleton if she knew what was in the box, as there was something not quite right, I thought—the prisoner could hear everything I said—he was wearing a light coat at the time, but-toned by the top button—he did not stop to unbutton it, but wrenched it off over his head, and threw it down into the blood, and then stamped upon it—all this time I had got the box up on its end, resting on my hip—the woman Green stood at the foot of the stairs—I told the prisoner I should not remove the box until he showed me what was inside it—Green, at this stage ran up stairs, the prisoner followed her, and I followed him—he stopped on the middle of the stairs, and said "Go back and cord that box"—I said "Not me"—he stamped his foot on the stairs, and said "Go back, you carman, and cord the box, and do your work"—I said "I shall not, I don't mean losing you, I don't mean to lose sight of you"—when he said "Go back and cord that box "be lost his accent—that was the first time I noticed him not talk like a Frenchman; he talked like an Englishman, as I am talking now; he appeared to lose his temper—he then walked out into Paulton's Square, and turned to the left, towards the King's Road—as he was going up the Square he put on the coat which he had picked out of the blood—he had picked it up as he passed between the box and the wall, as he followed the woman to go up stains, and he put it on going up the Square—he walked on my right up the Square to the King's Road—I saw a constable standing under the lamp-post—it was then raining very hard—I went up to the con<lb/>stable, and told him my name, and where I lived—the prisoner was with me, by my side—I told the constable the way in which the prisoner had employed me that night to remove some luggage, and all that I had seen in the kitchen, and the way the prisoner had behaved in cording the box, and I told him to take charge of him, and not to lose him—the constable would not lay hold of him—we walked down to the house, No. 15, again, a distance of fifteen houses—the constable was about to go into the house, and I touched him on the shoulder, and told him if he went into the house we should lose the man—I then said to a man I had with me "Run, George, up to the station, and tell them to send some more men down to 15, Paulton's Square; tell them who sent you"—we were all standing still then, outside the house, at the foot of the steps—after I had sent for more police the prisoner got very fidgetty, and walked backwards and forwards for the</p>

I have been two years in the force—on Wednesday night, 11th May, I was on duty in Paulton's Square, about 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and Piper at the top of Paulton's Square, against the King's Road—Piper said that he had been employed by the prisoner to remove a box from 15, Paulton's Square, and when he was moving it he got his hand all over blood, and be believed there was something wrong, he wished me to go down and see what was the matter—as soon as Piper said there was something wrong, the prisoner repeated "Something wrong, something wrong," about three times—when I got to 15, Paulton's Square with the prisoner, I wanted him to go inside the house, all three of us to go in together, to see what was the matter—he would not go in—he did not say a word, but he turned round from the door as though be would rather go back—he did not go in—I said to Piper "We had better get someone else, and see what is the matter," and Piper sent off his roan to the police-station for another constable—after the man had been gone about three minutes, the prisoner became restless, and began to walk back-wards and forwards past the door, and when in the direction of Danvan Street, leading to the water-side, he suddenly made a bolt, and ran about 400 yards, I should say—he went to step off the kerb, and tripped up—he threw off his coat and hat as soon as he started to run; his hat was off and on the ground in an instant almost—he took it off, and threw it on the ground with all his force, and then took his coat off—he was wearing two coats—I believe the overcoat was underneath—he had a light one over the black coat—it was the light coat he took off, and threw down—the one he had underneath was a kind of waterproof, dark colour—I did not pick it up—I ran after him—Piper got up to him first, a few yards before me, about twenty yards, I might say—I then said to Piper "We will take him now; I don't want anything else. I know he has done something wrong, or ha would not run away," and I took him to the police-station—I searched him there, and found on him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a cork-screw, two knives, a pipe, pencil case, spectacles in case (only one pair), three gloves, a common ring, and an abstract of the title-deeds of 24, Wel-lington Square, Chelsea—I produce the things—the abstract of the title was in the breast pocket of the under coat that he had on when he threw the light coat off, it was all over blood—I also found a rent-book and a silk handkerchief, and two envelopes addressed to "Miss Boss, 15, Paulton's Square"—some pieces of glass were smashed up in his trowsers pocket—it appeared that a bottle had been broken in his pocket—I found this card on the prisoner, which was produced yesterday, and shown to Bartlett, but I can't say positively which pocket I took it out of—I saw a bunch of keys at the station—I found those on the prisoner, I gave all the property up to Inspector Tarlton.</p>

               <p>thought he meant bolting—this paper I have in the list of the property I took from the prisoner—Inspector Tarlton made it out after I had taken the property from him—I don't think the keys were included in that list, but I remember taking the keys from him perfectly well—I have added the bottle in pencil—I found that in his left-hand trowsers pocket, smashed—I did not drop it and break it—I took it out of his pocket, all in small pieces—it seemed a small bottle—I could not say the size of it, because it was all smashed up.</p>

The coat which the prisoner took off and threw on the blood was a light coat, a little lighter than the trowsers he was wearing—I can't say positively what became of that coat—he picked it up again, I think, when I told him I would not move the box, and followed the woman Green up stairs—he put it on going up the square—when I put the box down, and said I would not more it, the woman Green started first before he picked the coat up, and then he picked it up out of the blood and followed her up stairs—I did not stay down a minute—I followed him im<lb/>mediately—he was only three stairs above me, and the woman was in front of him—she went out—he stopped on the stain, and had a little conversa-tion with me—he did not go out into the street without me at all—I was not a quarter of a yard from him from the time he came out of the kitchen until he took the spring away from me, and then he was not more than tan yards from me—I kept him in sight all the time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I was on duty at the police-station on Wednesday night, 11th May, when the prisoner was brought in—I saw him searched, and the constable gave the things into my possession—I have heard the evidence he has given to-day as to the things he found—this is the correct list of them, but the keys are not mentioned in this list—I directed the sergeant to make out two lists, and the keys were omitted in each—I put the keys down in my own list—the keys were found and banded to me—the following morning I entered the property found, in the charge sheet, and afterwards the sergeant made a list from the charge-sheet—I am certain the keys were found at that time—I gave this one key to the witness Large—when the prisoner was being searched there was a portion of a glass bottle taken out of his right-hand trowsers pocket—the neck of the bottle was complete, and the cork in it—the doctor has it—I said "Why, this is a poison bottle"—the prisoner immediately dropped down, and bent over the dock in that manner, with his hands down—he did not say anything—I asked the constable if he was drunk—he said "No," he was not drunk, because he ran too fast—I immediately sent for Dr. Godrich, and had the prisoner removed into the reserve room and laid down on the floor—Dr. Godrich examined him, and said he believed he was shamming, there was nothing the matter with him—the next day he was removed to St. George's Hospital, where he remained until Friday—he was then taken to the Westminster Police Court—I entered the charge on a charge-sheet and read it over to him—he made no reply—I afterwards asked if he under-stood what I said—he said "You said something about murder"—I again read the charge to him, and he said "I will say nothing now"—the charge was for the wilful murder of Ann Boss, at 15, Paulton's Square, King's Road, Chelsea—also, when that charge was entered, information was received of the body of the old gentleman being found, and I then charged him with the murder of the Rev. Elias Huelin, at 24, Wellington Square, Chelsea.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on the Wednesday night I was sent for to the Chelsea Police Station—I saw the prisoner there, lying on the floor—I spoke to him in English, and in French, as the police said they were informed he was a Frenchman—he did not answer at all—I examined him—he was in a very depressed state, weak, and pale, and either could not, or would not, move his limbs—the police showed me a broken bottle, and some small pieces wrapped up in a piece of paper; there was a until torn label on it "Laudanum," and I fancied it smelt of laudanum—thinking he might have taken laudanum I gave him an emetic, with coffee and brandy, which he drank freely without difficulty; the emetic acted—I examined the result, there were no traces of poison whatever; if laudanam had been recently taken it must have been found—I thought he was shim-ming insensibility, for his pupils acted naturally, and his pulse was regular though weak—I stayed with him a considerable time, and saw him twice next morning, and then by my recommendation he was removed to the hospital, and I did not see him again—I analyzed the bottle and found distinct traces of opium or laudanum.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, 12th May, about 2.30, I went to 24, Wellington Square, with Watts and other officers; we were let in by Superintendent Fisher, and proceeded to examine the house—in the back kitchen I found this pick and shovel, and under the boards by the sink I found this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) all battered in as it is now, it lay like this between the rafters, crushed; no doubt it had been pressed in there—the lining was wet with blood—we found nothing else on the Thursday; we began digging in the back yard, and knocked off at 8.30 the same afternoon—there was a quantity of clotted blood and paper lying in the yard, but we did not find the body—the paper looked as if it he been torn off the walls—that and the blood was all mixed up together—I noticed that there had been a new flooring board laid down in the back</p>

Mr. Huelin—Watts found the upper part of the body, and I found the legs lying near the wall—he had on his shirt, gloves, and mittens, trowsers, boots, and cravat, but no coat or hat—I found the coat after we had removed the body, and placed it in the back room—it was underneath where the body lay, below the head, about half a foot below the surface of the gravel; one sleeve of the coat was turned inside out—I afterwards noticed the neck of the deceased, there was a piece of rope tied tightly round the neck—I saw Watts cut it off, and he has it—I sent for Mr. Turner, the surgeon, to examine the body—I afterwards examined the floor in the front kitchen, and saw marks of apparently a red substance, I can't say whether it was blood or not, the marks appeared to have been scrubbed.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 182, King's Road, Chelsea—on Friday afternoon, 13th May, I was sent for to 24, Wellington Square—when I got there I found the body of the deceased gentleman in the back kitchen—I had known him when alive—this rope was tied tightly round the neck, the knot coming under the right ear, quite tight enough to cause strangulation—there was blood on the right side of the head—I made no further examination at that time—on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—I examined the head very minutely, and after a time found two small holes behind the right ear, from which the brain matter protruded—I removed the skin, and found the bone of the skull underneath fractured—I then opened the head, and found the inner plate of the bone of the skull fractured also—the holes were rather less than an inch apart—they must have been caused by a sharp, pointed instrument, also a heavy instrument—the holes were not so large as a pea in size—they would be caused by a sharp-pointed instrument, with a heavy weight at the end of it, and also a handle—it would be done by a sudden blow—there must have been two blows, I think—on the opposite side of the head, exactly opposite the blow, I found two distinct clots, or rather, merging into one—the left eye was very much contused, and the right eye slightly—I examined the chest, lungs, and heart, which I expected to have found very much congested, from the rope being round the neck, but they did not present the symptoms which one generally finds after strangulation, which led me to suppose that the death was caused by the blows—I had known the deceased some time,</p>

I am a nephew of the deceased; his name was Elias Huelin—he was a clergyman—he would have been eighty-four years of age on 19th June last—in May last I was living in Lincolnshire—my uncle had a farm there—he went down there generally about once a year—I was expecting him every day, about this time—I used to live with him at 15, Paulton's Square, until the 24th March last—he lived there alone, with only Ann Boss as his housekeeper, no other servant—he had property in the neighbourhood, Nos. 15, 24, and 32, Paulton's Square belonged to him—I came up to London upon hearing of the murder, on Thursday, 12th May—the police came down to make inquiries of me, and I came up on the following day—I saw the body of my uncle—his usual time for dining was about 1 o'clock—I have seen the different things that have been produced—I know this rent-book—it is all in my handwriting, except the first page, that is in my uncle's writing—it was written some time at the beginning of last year—I know this abstract of title with the blood on it—"No. 24, Wellington Square "is my uncle's writing—I don't know the other—I don't know the writing of these envelopes, addressed "Ann Boss" these spectacles belonged to my uncle, and this pencil case was his—I have been shown a green box by the police; it was the box of Ann Boss—she used to keep clothes in it—I don't know this bunch of keys—the writing on this envelope produced by Inspector Pay is my uncle's handwriting—it is "Mrs. Emmerson, one half-year's rent, due Lady-day, 1869, 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; received balance. I enclose a receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you paid me while staying' with you, and am much displeased at your not paying me the whole rent due last Lady-day, and to avoid any unpleasant proceedings, I requests a satisfactory answer before the middle of next month, which will oblige your well-wisher, E.

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Lime Street, City—I am out of employ-ment at present—in 1866, I was in the employ of Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson, woollen drapers, in St. Martin's Lane—they employed a gentleman of the name of Sparrow, and Musgrove was a carman in his employment—I knew Musgrove in 1851, but I lost sight of him till I went to Bull &amp; Wilson's—I was there three years and a half, and he came there frequently during that time—I only knew Isaacs by sight—I only saw him twice before I saw him at the Court, about six months before I left Bull &amp; Wilson's—some time in 1866 we had a meeting at the Pavilion Music Hall—Musgrove asked me on several occasions to meet a friend of his who had plenty of money—I should think he asked me two or three times—I went to the Pavilion Music Hall, where I met Musgrove, and he introduced me to Samson Isaacs as a friend of his who had got plenty of money—we sat down together at a table—Musgrove did not join in the conversation—he could hear what was said—we were drinking and smoking—Samson began speaking about trade and business—he then asked me whether we were sufficiently paid, and whether we could do with some more money—I said "Of course we could do with more"—he was speaking about the young men in the trade—the conversa-tion after led to this, that I should give some goods to Musgrove—he said "If you give goods to Musgrove they will be given to me, and we will dispose of them and divide the profits"—that is what was said as near as I can recollect—I said I would see about it—he said it would be better that Musgrove should come about dinner time, because half the young men would be out of the way at dinner—I left him shortly after that—I was assistant at Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's—I should have had access to the goods in their establishment—Musgrove had seen me in the warehouse nearly every day—I mentioned this conversation next morning to Mr. Grubb, a young man in the employ—I saw Musgrove that day, and I asked him what he meant by introducing me to such a vagabond as that—I mentioned what Samson had said to me, and Musgrove said he did not hear what was said—I said if I heard anything more of it I should speak to my employers—I spoke to two or three others about it—I did not make it a secret—we all left the Pavilion together, and parted a little distance off—I forget where—I bade Musgrove "Good night"—I left Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's on 1st January, 1867—I had a conversation with Musgrove in October, 1867, in the presence of Mr. Sparrow, his master—I was then a Mr. Garnier's, in Golden Square—Mr. Sparrow came with Musgrove to inquire about the conversation—he said "What have you got to say about my man Tom?"—I said I knew nothing against him more than he intro-duced me to a bad man at the London Pavilion—Musgrove said that it was not Samson he meant to introduce me to, and afterwards he said it was—I complained of losing my situation for it, and we parted—I was dismissed from Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's—I forget who paid for the beer at the London Pavilion—Isaacs paid for some, that is all I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, White Hart Street, Drury Lane, and am a cloth worker and presser—Messrs.

Bull &amp; Wil<lb/>son, and bring them to my premises—I did not know Isaacs at all—I did not know that he knew Musgrove—in the month of September, 1867, a Mr. Coleman sent for me, and I went with Musgrove to have a conversation with Sherborn—I got them to confront one another, and I could not make head or tail of it—but I can see it better now—I said "Musgrove, you have been seriously accused, what have you to say"—he said he did not know what I meant—I said that Mr. Coleman had made a serious accusation, for assisting a man, named Samson, to incite a young man, named Sherborn, in his employ, to rob Messrs. Garnier—Sherborn said that Musgrove bad got an order for the Pavilion, and he went there and sat at a table with a d—vagabond named Samson, Musgrove introduced him to Samson, and said he had got lots of <hi rend="italic">sugar,</hi> that he could take any amount of <hi rend="italic">stuff,</hi> and had lots of <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi>—Musgrove said he did not know the man, but he might have seen him—I pressed Sherborn very much to give me some more information on so serious a charge—he did not tell me any more—it was not corroborated by further inquiry at Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's, and I kept Musgrove in my employment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi>). On 6th June, about 1 o'clock, I was standing with Franklyn and Whatmore, two constables, at the corner of Cannon Street Road and Cable Street—we were in uniform—I saw a man emerge from a wall on the other side of the street, 25 or 30 yards I from where I was standing down Cable Street—I saw him step from I the wall and turn towards where we were standing, and then I saw a flash straight from his shoulder towards where we stood, neither up or down—I beard an explosion of fire arms, and a whiz in the air—I cannot tell what distance it was from me—I immediately ran and seized his throat with my left hand, and his left wrist, from behind, with my right, and at the same time two other witnesses seized his right hand, in which he held this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by the stock, and was putting it into his pocket—I held him tightly till they took it from his hand—his right hand was then re<lb/>leased, and he put it towards his left side—I immediately let go of his throat, seized his arm, and said "Look out, he has got something more about him"—I then brought him down on his back, and at the same time Whatmore took this dagger from his inside breast-pocket, naked at it is now; there was no sheath—this sheath was put on at the station to prevent accident, it did not come from the prisoner—they searched him carefully, but found nothing more, and we let him get up—he said "Don't hurt me, will go quietly"—we took him to the station, where the charge was read over to him, and his statement was taken down by the acting inspector—he said "I have been rather roughly used," but up to that time he said nothing about the pistol—he gave his address 42, Watney Street, Com<lb/>mercial Road—I went there and found it was his lodging—I searched, but found nothing—he was sober—I could not find any traces of a bullet mark on the wall where we were standing—there was a gas lamp 10 or 11 yards from where we stood, and another lamp about 50 yards further off.</p>

On 6th June I was at the corner of Cannon Street, in uniform, and Franklyn and McDonald came up to me—I noticed the prisoner on the opposite side of the way, against the Crown and Dolphin public-house—he was walking up Cable Street East, going more east, away from us—he walked a couple of doors past the public-house, and I heard the report of a revolver—I turned round, and saw the smoke from the prisoner, facing me—I saw him drop his right hand, and imme<lb/>diately walk across the road—we all three ran after him—I went in front of him, and caught hold of his right band, and in his outside right coat pocket he had the stock of a revolver in his hand; I slid my hand down, and caught hold of the muzzle of it outside while it was in his pocket—he drew his hand from the revolver and put it to his left breast—Me Donald said "Look out, he has something there," and threw him down on his back—I put my hand in his breast pocket and took out this dagger, without any sheath—he said "I will go," that is all I heard him say, or "Don't hurt me, I will go"—I carried the revolver and dagger to the station, where I searched him, and found these papers, this book, and these twelve caps for the nipples of the pistol—one chamber had been discharged, and there was an exploded cap on the nipple—the other four chambers were loaded. <hi rend="italic">One of the paper related to a ball for a patriotic Irishman, and the pocket-book contained a cypher and key, and some addresses in America.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel McKeon, a boot maker, at 39, York Street, Westminster—in 1867, I was in possession of eighteen Rus<lb/>sian bonds, worth 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I kept in an iron box—I was then living at Stibbington Street, Oakley Street, St. Pancras—I have known the prisoner 36 years—in August, 1868, I was taken ill and she induced me to go and stay with her—she was then living at 2, Barrett's Court, Wigmore Street—I went there, and took my bonds with me—she put them under my bed, in the framework of the bedstead I slept in—I never saw them after that—I never gave her permission to take them or use them—I went with her to Rothschild's to get the interest of the money, in Mr. Bray's cab, from the Caledonian Road—she went into Rothschild's and left me outside in the cab—she had taken a public-house at 12, Back Hill, Clerkenwell, and we went back there afterwards—when I came back, I said "Where is my box?" the prisoner said "What box do you mean?" I said "The iron box that my papers are in," she said "I put it in the usual place"—I asked for my box because I began to have a suspicion—I have asked her continually since then to see the bonds, and I have never seen a sight of them—when I demanded them from her, she said she had put them in the hands of a clergyman—I left her in January, this year, and returned home to my husband—I did not take my bonds back with me—I believe they were sold at that time—before I went to live at Barrett's Court I used to look at my bonds every day—the prisoner took my keys from my pocket when I was ill—I left my husband ten years ago to mind my mother—she is an eccentric character—I never gave the prisoner the bonds, or made her a present of them—do you suppose I should give them to her—they were in the name of my mother, Honora Austin.</p>

Russian bond to pledge for me—I never received part of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got the money to pay my rent from Rothschild's and paid her every halfpenny—the prisoner got the money from Rothschild's, I went with her but did not get out of the cab—the prisoner got me to pay her rent under pretence that her daughter was dying—I got that money from Mr. Smith, he owed it to me—the prisoner did not negociate any of these bonds for me—I did not hand her the box when she took the public-house; I was not in London—she always knew I had the bonds—I gave her them to take care of, but not to go and spend them—I did not tell her, when I gave her the bonds to take care of, that she could negociate them and make a comfortable place for me; that never entered my head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective sergeant, at Birmingham—I know a cottage in Caroline Street, Birmingham—I don't know the name of it, it is at the end of a lane—I had occasion to watch that cottage on 26th March last—it was occupied by a man named Rafferty, a dipper and silverer in the jewellery trade—it is a private house, having a very small shop, with a lean-to at the back of it—I have known the prisoner, Wilson, eight or nine years—he is a gunmaker at this time—he was in business for himself, with two others, named Meeninham and Gill, in Harper's Buildings, Weaman Street—Meeninham and Gill are Irish—Wilson, I believe, is an Englishman—there was no name up—it is a small shop, or rather shops, one above the other—there are a great number of gunmakers' shops in the same buildings—they had two shops, one leading out of the other, up stairs, on different floors—it is about a mile from Rafferty's cottage—about 4.30, on the afternoon of 26th March, I saw a brother of Meeninham, a youth about nineteen or twenty, coming up Caroline Street, with a hand-cart, apparently with something in it; I could not tell what—he went up the passage, towards Raffertt's cottage, followed by Wilson—Bodley, one of the Irish con<lb/>stabulary, was with me—I lost sight of the man with the hand-cart for about an hour—in consequence of what Bodley said to me, I went down Caroline Street, into George Street—I then 'saw young Meeninham with the same hand-cart, and a large box in it—he went to the Midland Railway goods receiving office, in George Street Sandpits, Wilson following—I can't say whether Wilson went into the office or not—young Meeninham came out without the box, and went away with the hand-cart—I went into the office, and saw a large box there—I believe it was the same box I had seen in the hand-cart—there was no other box there like it—there was a direction on the box—I read it, and took a copy of it; it was "Mr. John Wilson, Mid<lb/>land goods station, Leeds, from J. Wilson"—some little time after, by the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187007110105"/>
               <p>permission of the railway officials, I opened the box—it contained nineteen muzzle-loader rifles, nineteen bayonets, and one Snider rifle, a breech-loader—there was no invoice or bill inside—the rifles were in a rough state, finished so that they could be used; but not burnished, either the stocks or barrels—the stocks were not cut—the box was fastened up again in my presence—on the evening of 29th March I was watching the entrance to Rafferty's cottage, with Black, a brother officer, and saw young Meeninham bring a hand-cart, similar to the one I saw before up Caroline Street, with a cask in it—he turned up the passage in the direction of Rafferty's cottage, fol<lb/>lowed by Wilson—I could not say they went into the cottage; I remained; in about half an hour, young Meeninham came out of the passage again with the hand-cart and a similar cask in it; Wilson followed him down the passage, close to him—Black followed them—I afterwards went to the same railway receiving office I had been to before, and found there a small cask addressed "Edward Ward, 68, Rutherglen-loon, Glasgow, from J. Johnson"—I did not meddle with the cask that day, but I saw it opened on the 30th, it contained thirty large six-chamber revolvers, all alike, and fourteen boxes of cartridges, marked fifty "each; I should say they would fit the revolvers, they were marked No. 12, and the revolvers are what they call No. 12—there was no bill or invoice in that cask—it was fastened down again—I went to Glasgow and on 1st April I saw it delivered at 68, Rutherglen-loon; I should call it a marine-store dealer's shop; I did not go inside, I don't think there was any name up, I did not notice one—next day, 2nd April, I was again near Ward's shop, and about 12 o'clock two men came, they went into the shop and remained a minute or two, and then one of them brought out a cask, on his back, similar to the one I had seen, it was taken to a place called Gildey's Court, to McNamara's as I was told—I followed it there, it was taken into a room, I did not go in, I watched whilst the Glasgow police came, and they took it in hand—I saw it open, it contained fourteen revolvers and thirteen cases of ammunition—it was left with the Glasgow police and I returned to Birmingham—on 4th April I went to the arrival platform of the Midland Railway, Birmingham, and saw the 5 o'clock train from Leeds come in, and the prisoner Davit came out of it; I had known him before—I know nothing more about him at that time—on the evening of 14th April I was again watching Rafferty's cottage, with Black, and saw young Meen<lb/>inham come up Caroline Street, with a hand-cart and three boxes, apparently empty—Wilson was following him close by; they went up the passage lead-ing to Rufferty's—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes young Meeninham came out of the passage with the hand-cart and three boxes, they appeared to be a great deal heavier than they were before; Wilson fol-lowed him down the passage; Black followed him—I afterwards went to the Globe Parcels Office; Black was there; I found there three boxes similar to those I had seen in the hand-cart—I copied the addresses on them, two were addressed "J. H. Kershaw, Glassmaker's Arms, Bailiff Gate, Newcastle-on-Tyne," and the third to "C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle—on Tyne,"—I did not open those boxes, I marked them—I then went on to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and communicated with the police there, I went to the railway station and saw the boxes arrive, about 6 o'clock on Saturday morning the 16th, and pointed them out to Hickson and Thorburn two of the Newcastle police, after this I returned to Birmingham on 18th April I was at the Midland Railway goods station with Bodley, and saw two boxes there, one was addressed "C. H. Williams, Globe Express</p>

               <p>Office, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne," I saw it opened, it contained twenty-five revolvers precisely similar to those I had seen before; there was an address on the other box, I did not put down the name but the address was "Globe Parcels Office, Market Street Manchester," that was also opened in my presence, it contained about 1 1/2 cwt. of ball cartridges, part of it would fit the revolvers, and the other was for rifles—there was no invoice in either of the boxes—on the 14th May I was at the Great Western railway station, Snow Hill, Birmingham, and saw young Meeninham and a little boy with three parcelsin black oil-cloth, two of them seemed to have a strapor something round them—shortly after I saw the prisoner Wilson and a stranger—they went to young Meeninham—I could not say whether they spoke—they ultimately carried the three parcels into a third-class carriage, into which Wilson and the stranger got; the parcels were handed to them—that train was going to Paddington—I communicated with the chief of the police and a telegram was sent to Scotland Yard—I have since been shown some oil-cloth bags—I know Davitt, I had seen him several times in Birmingham prior to the 26th March, but not since 4th April—this manufactory had been carried on by Wilson and the other two for eighteen months or two years previous to my watching it, or perhaps more—Wilson formerly worked for a man named Wilson, a gunmaker, and afterwards for a Mr. Williamson; I believe he was the last person he worked for before he commenced this manufactory.</p>

I am a detective officer in the Leeds force—on 28th March last I went to the goods station of the Midland Railway, in company with Bodley and Inspector Hunt—Bodley pointed out a box to me—that afternoon two persons came with a hand-cart for that box; Wilson was one of them, the other was a man who acted as warehouseman for Davitt—the box was given to them and put in the hand-cart—Davitt's warehouseman took it away, and Wilson walked beside him until they got to the Horse and Jockey, about 100 yards away from the station—Wilson then went into the Horse and Jockey, and Davitt's warehouseman took the box along Swinegate into Milne's yard to the warehouse that, I have since ascertained, had been taken by Davitt—it appeared very heavy, and some persons living in the yard assisted the warehouseman up the yard with the hand-cart; it was taken into the warehouse, and the door was locked by the warehouseman, and they then went away—that was, I believe, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I and Knapp watched the warehouse through the night—about 9 o'clock next morning the warehouseman came and opened the door; in a short time Davitt came, and went into the warehouse; a short time afterwards the warehouseman came out and went somewhere, and in a short time returned with a hand-cart and four or five empty casks, which he put into the warehouse—about 12 o'clock they left for dinner, and returned about 1 o'clock—they were in the warehouse till about 3 o'clock; the ware-houseman then came out and got a hand-cart, and took it to the warehouse door, and they brought out two casks, which appeared to be very heavy, and Davitt assisted the warehouseman in putting them into the cart; he then handed the warehouseman a piece of paper, and the warehouseman went to the London and North-Western Railway goods station in Wellington Street, Leeds; he put the casks on to a landing-stage there—I copied the addresses on the casks, and handed them to Hunt—I then followed the warehouseman back to the warehouse; two more barrels were brought out by Davitt and the warehouseman, and put into the hand-cart—I did not see any paper handed at that time—the warehouseman took them to the same goods station, and placed them on the same landing-stage—I afterwards saw one of those casks opened on 29th April, the same night they were taken to the station; it contained rifles, sword bayonets, revolvers, ammunition, and ball cartridges—on 4th April I saw Davitt leave the warehouse with a green carpet bag; he went to the station, and left by the 1 o'clock train for Bir-mingham—the name of Jackson was painted on the inner door of this warehouse—I saw Davitt in Leeds several times after this; he lived at 22, Oak Road, Leeds, and the warehouseman lived in the same house, and passed by the name of Henderson and Wilson—I know the prisoner Wilson; I only saw him once in Leeds, that was at the time I saw him at the Midland goods station.</p>

I am inspector of the London and North-Western Railway, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire, at the joint station at Leeds—on 29th March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw two barrels brought to the station by a tall man; I don't know who he was—they were addressed "John James White, Esq., of London, Burgon's Hotel, Athlone, Ireland," and "Miss Margaret Delmere, Castlereagh, Co. Roscommon, Ireland," and "from L. and W. Rawlinson, general dealer, Leeds," was printed at the bottom of both the cards—that same afternoon the same man brought two more in a hand-cart, one was addressed "Mr. John Flannery, general merchant, Ballyhaddareen, Co. Mayo, Ireland," marked "X 76," and the other "Messrs. McDonnell, general merchants, Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland," and those two had printed at the bottom of the card "From J. Henderson, commission agent, etc., Leeds"—the man who brought those casks brought on each occasion a delivery note—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the notes; they are what we call consignment notes, all the checks in red and black pencil are our writing; they were instructions to us how to send them—later in the afternoon the cask addressed to Flannery was opened in my presence; it contained rifles, sword bayonets, revolvers, and ammunition—it was fastened up again, and all four casks were forwarded by rail, according to the ad-dresses—I have lived in Leeds thirty-five years—I do not know a person named Henderson, a commission agent, there—I have inquired whether there is such a person, and cannot find that there is, or any such persons as L. and W. Rawlinson, general dealers.</p>

Henderson, commission agent, Leeds," and on the top "<hi rend="italic">Via</hi> Dublin"—over that was "Returned to J, Henderson, commission agent, Leeds"—I had that cask opened—it con<lb/>tained arms—I did not take an account of them—it was sent on to London, and is here—another cask with the same address was opened under my direction, and contained arms—there was also a third cask, but only the first contained any ammunition—I have lived eleven years at Leeds—I have made diligent inquiry to find out Mr. J. Henderson, commission agent, Leeds—I can find no such person—I inquired at the post-office about letters, but could learn nothing about him—I made every inquiry which my experience suggested—there is a directory of Leeds—I find no such person there—I made similar inquiries with regard to L. &amp; N.

I am superintendent of detective police at Newcastle-upon-Tyne—on 15th and 16th April I got communications from Mr. Seal of the Birmingham police, and on the 16th went with Thorburn to the Central Railway Station—I saw a train arrive from Birmingham at 6.30, and saw three boxes taken out of the train and put on the landing-stage—they were taken into the parcels office—two were addressed "J. M. Kershaw, Glass-maker's Arms Inn, Bailiff Gate, Newcastle-upon-Tyne," over which another card was nailed, with "Inclewood" on it—"Inclewood" covered "Kershaw"—the other case was addressed "C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pil<lb/>grim Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne"—Thorburn and I watched those two cases the whole day—I watched most, up to 6 o'clock in the evening—no one came to claim them—I then opened the one addressed to Kershaw—it contained twenty-five revolvers—the other was subsequently opened; that also contained twenty-five revolvers—they are six-chambered breech-loaders—they have not been inquired for, to my knowledge—I have fre<lb/>quently communicated with Inclewood's Parcels Delivery Office in Pilgrim Street since the arms were seized, but no one claims them—no such name as "C. H. Williams" is known there—I have made every inquiry—I have not endeavoured to find Mr. J. M. Kershaw at the Glassmaker's Arms—on 19th April I was again at the station, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and in a goods van from Birmingham I found a box, addressed "C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Newcastle-upon-Tyne," with one of Inclewood's cards over it as before—Thorburn took it to the station—I opened it; it con-tained twenty-four breech-loading revolvers, of the needle pattern—I have made every endeavour to find Mr. C.

               <p>the Tower of London—I have examined four casks of arms which came from Ireland, two from Leeds, one from Glasgow, and one from Nowcastle-upon-Tyne, and fifty pistols said to be taken from one of the prisoners—they are in a state in which they could be used—in the first cask, said to come from Ireland, I found ten short Enfields, muzzle-loaders, they are in what the trade would call the screwed-together state, that is, they are in a complete state, but not finished off or polished, they are very common indeed—I never knew them sent out for commercial purposes in that state—the cost of the arms would be so small that it would make very little difference in the value—these muzzle-loaders would not, perhaps, be worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each; taking everything, and the present state of the trade, we could have any amount made—they are birch stocks, and they do not appear as if a good workman had done them—I should think they would not fetch 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these stocks are cut in two—this is what we call in the service an unserviceable stock—no person who had the least pretension to be a workman would issue stocks in this condition—the stocks are marked with blacklead pencil, and the barrels are privately marked—I do not swear that they all have nipples on them, but if they have you could fire with them when they are put together and the end was screwed on, and this band slipped down into its place—therevolvers are finished and ready for use—I have also examined some Snider rifles, they are finished, not in the screwed-together state the brass-work is polished, and they are in a far better condition than these, but they have sword bayo<lb/>nets to them, and each of them are private marked to fit a barrel, so that anybody can understand the use of them, each sword fits a barrel that is contained in the same cask; they would be perfectly serviceable when put together; I also found a box of cartridges with them, in some of the cases—this is a six-chamber revolver, requiring a pin cartridge; it is a breech-loader, and the cartridges fit it—I had a specimen of the cartridges, there were hundreds of them—if this cartridge was introduced into one of these chambers, it would be ready for use instantly.</p>

                  </hi>. I have, for a long time, devoted my attention to the study of handwriting, for the purpose of ascertaining the genuineness or otherwise of documents—I have had several documents laid before me pur-porting to be signed by Davitt, the complaint marked A, and four receipts for sums of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., received from Inspector Clark and Mr. Campbell—here are four cards, Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8, one addressed "Mr. C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne," two to "J. M. Korshaw, Glassmaker's Arms, Bailiff Gate, New-on-T," and one to "Mr. C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pilgrim St., New-on-T"—I have compared those addresses with the undoubted writing of Davitt, and I believe them, without a doubt, to be in his handwriting—there is the word "mail" on three of the cards, in a different handwriting—here are six other cards, No. 9 to 14 inclusive, No. 9 is addressed to "Mr. Richard Cunningham, Mayne St., Boyle, Co. Roscommon, Ireland;" No. 10, to "Mr. John Flannery, general merchant, Ballyhaddareen, Mayo, Ireland;" No. 11 "J. Jas. White, Esq., of London, Burgon's Hotel, Ath-lone" No. 12 to "Miss Margaret Delmere, Castlereagh;" No. 13 to "Messrs. McDonnell, general merchants, Tuam, Gal way;" and 14 to "Mrs. Cecilia Higgins, Newport, Mayo, Ireland, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Dublin"—I believe all those to be in Davitt's handwriting—I also believe these two delivery orders, dated 16th March, to be in Davitt's handwriting, except the receipts; this card, No. 4, and the paper, No. 2, I also believe to be in Davitt's hand-writing; the whole of it, including the signature "Benjamin Richards"—I believe the whole of these documents are in the same handwriting—I should perhaps have had a difficulty in taking any one singly, but taking them collectively I have no doubt whatever in tracing the handwriting—the endorsement "Wm. Roberts," on the bank post-bill I also believe to be in Davitt's handwriting—here is a letter, No. 1, said to be found upon a person named Forrester, I believe that also to be in Davitt's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">The Witness pointed out to the Jury some of the peculiarities in the forma<lb/>tion of the letters upon which he founded his opinion.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was at one time an officer in the Federal Army, in America—I left it in 1865—I became a member of the Fenian Confederation in 1862, and remained so till 1866—an organization of the Fenian conspiracy existed in New York and in several parts of America, and meetings were held at which I was present—the object of the con<lb/>spiracy was to overthrow Her Majesty's Government in Ireland, and esta<lb/>blish an Irish republic—an oath was administered to the members, at first—I swore it—it was to be faithful to the Fenian organization, and to take up arms, when required, for the establishment of this republic in Ireland—the organization was very extensive in America—the head quarters were in New York, and there were branches at different cities throughout the United States, with state centres as the heads of them—I was sent to Ireland in 1865, by John Mahoney, who was then the head of the Fenian organization in America—the Fenian organization existed at that time in Ireland, and the head centre of all, Stephens, was in Dublin, and the organi<lb/>zation was ready to fight at any time if he gave the word—the organization extended to England—at the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, in the early part of 1866, all the prominent leaders were sent to England, to Manchester and Liverpool, and likewise to Scotland—we had frequent meetings in Liverpool, at different public-houses, at which I was</p>

               <p>present—money was collected at those meetings to carry on the organization, is well as to buy arms—arms were procured from Leeds, Birmingham, and ill the manufacturing towns in England, bought with the money collected by the Fenians—I knew Colonel Burke; it was his function to buy arms—a great quantity were bought—arms were sent to Ireland, and seized—some were sent by the Fenian organization in England to Ireland—this went on in 1866, and up to March, 1867—in February, 1867, an attempt was made to seize the arms in Chester Castle; the mail train from London to Holyhead was to be seized as it was passing Chester, the telegraph wires were to be torn, and the rails taken up—the arms taken at Chester Castle were to be put in the train and taken to Holyhead, where the mail-boat was to be seized, and the arms put in it, and taken to some port in Ireland, not Dublin—I gave information, and that enterprize was disconcerted—many Fenian meetings were held at Liverpool in February, 1867—a man named Flood was one of the leaders in the attempt on Chester Castle—he has since been convicted at Dublin—he was acting at that time in getting men from Birkenhead and other places, in company with Captain McCafferty—Flood got fifteen years, and McCafferty was sentenced to be hanged, but his sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life—it was supposed that as many as 1,200 Fenians were to surprise Chester Castle, but I did not go to Chester; I only went to Birkenhead—I saw as many as 600 going from the Liverpool district—the night before they started, it was expected that there would be as many as 1200 or 1400—I think the attempt was on 11th February, it was on a Monday—Fenian meetings were held at this time in Liverpool, at Mullins's beer-house, in Birehfield Street—I know Davitt—I gave his description before he was arrested—he has lost one hand—I was asked about him by Mr. Williamson, and I gave his description, and said that he had only one arm—I saw him at public-houses in Liverpool at the time of the Chester rising, and at different Fenian meetings—I cannot say whether I saw him the day after the attack on Chester Castle, but it was immediately after—meetings were held every day until we went to Ireland—Mullins's house was full at those meetings, up stairs and down—these meetings consisted entirely of Fenians—McCafferty and Flood were there; Captain Deasy, who was arrested at Manchester, and several others, about thirty altogether, all American officers—Captain Dohany, of the American army, was also there—he has not been tried—he has gone to America—Colonel Burke was there—he is now undergoing his sentence—the subject of discussion at those meetings was the loss of not having taken Chester Castle, and making arrangements for the rising of the night of 5th March, in Ireland—that meeting lasted, very likely, three or four hours—Davitt was there the whole time—I saw him there about three times altogether—I have seen him twice since—the meetings were all one as prominent as the other—there were three meetings at the same place—some of the people there were the same, and some were not—the subject of discussion was just the same as the first, a rising which was contemplated in different parts of Ireland, on the night of 5th March, that was arranged at that meeting—I did not know what Davitt was at that time—I did not inquire—I know he was well known by the members, he would not be allowed in company if he was not a prominent man—these meetings were only of leaders from the different centres, from Runcorn, and different places round Liverpool—a good many towns in England had their organisations—the</p>

               <p>privates would not be admitted to those meetings—a number of Fenians went to Ireland—I know I had sixty captured in one morning, on their arrival, and several smaller batches—there was a general movement of Fenians to Ireland—I was not in Ireland when the outbreak took place—I went to Ireland, and saw General Massey, who was to command them arrested on the night of 4th March—I gave information to the Government that the rising would actually take place, and left that night—I knew Forrester well in Liverpool—he was present at these meetings—he was a Fenian lecturer and a printer, I think—he was not present when Davitt was, but I saw him oftener than I did Davitt.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say you were, that you sold drapery in the country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, sometimes other matters, brushes, looking-glasses, or anything that way—I am a hawker, and go about the country—I live at Haslingden when I am at home—I came there in 1847—I am an Irishman—I go about the country in the day, but come home every night—Davitt left Haslingden sixteen or eighteen months ago, or perhaps nearly two years, I can't tell exactly—he com-menced hawking after he left Mr. Cockcroft, hawking drapery—he has hawked about Haslingden for five or six weeks, or perhaps longer—I don't know what he has been doing since he left Haslingden—I have not been in communication with him since—I have had letters from him, to know about his parents since they have been in America—I don't know where I had letters from him, I have had two or three from him, I think one was from Leeds—I don't bear in mind where the others came from—he signed his name "Davitt"—I never knew him by the name of Jackson, or Roberts, or Matthews—I never knew of his being in Birmingham, or Liverpool, or London—I knew it, by reading, after he was taken in London; except from that, I did not know from him. that he had been in London—I don't know where he has been residing since he left Haslingden, or what his occupation has been—I did not know of his taking a warehouse, at Leeds, in the soda and soap trade—in Feb-ruary, 1867, he was working at Mr. Cockcroft's as a compositor—he lived in Wilkinson Street—I understand that young Mr. Cockcroft was there, and I have a boy apprenticed to Mr. Cockcroft—I was out hawking all day—I sometimes saw him in the day-time—I did not go out every day to hawk; I lived close by to his house, and in the morning, very often, I saw him at breakfast time—I was about my business as usual about the time of the raid on Chester Castle—I generally go out about 10 o'clock in the morning, and get back by 5, 6, or 7 o'clock—I did not see him when I was</p>

               <p>out in the country—I generally went out five days in the week, and some weeks perhaps six days, and some weeks perhaps four days—I was first asked about this after the prisoner's arrest, by Mr. Paine; he asked if I recollected February, 1867; that was a few weeks ago—I recollect the time of the raid on Chester, from reading about it the day after, and by the excitement it created—I don't recollect what day of the week it was I think it was the beginning—I believe I had seen Davitt every day the week before—I saw him every night, and sometimes every day—I saw him at his own house every night—I never missed, I went there every night—we used to discuss matters there, we used to talk about politics and that; sometimes we played at dominoes—we discussed general politics, not Irish politics exclusively, but very much so—we did not disagree—there were sometimes three or four, or five or six of us—there was Matthew Shearin, he is an Irishman; he is a young man who travels, goes out hawking—he is not regularly at Haslingden—he was there in February, I met him every night, and two or three more—there was John Tinley, an Irishman, he used to work in a factory; he is now in America, he went some time ago, perhaps twelve months, I can't say; and there was Thomas Barrett and Thomas Lyons—Barrett was a tailor by trade, an Irishman; he is in America—Lyons is an Irishman, he is living at Haslingden now, he is an out-worker; he is not here to-day—I have heard from Barrett and Tinley since they have been to America—they have sent letters—I am not aware that any of these men went to Liverpool from time to time—I have been there twice, connected with a foctory that I collect for, the United Assurance—those are the only two occasions upon which I have been there—Burke was not one of those we used to meet every night; I knew him by being an Irishman, and, living in a country place, we used to get acquainted—I knew him well—I think he was a Fenian—he is dead—he died some time the latter end of last year, I understand—Tinley and Barrett were not Fenians, that I know of—we did not talk Irish politics exclusively, every sort of politics, American, French, and Russian—we dis-cussed the Fenians—all these persons did not meet every night, but I went every night—I mean to swear that I met Davitt every night during the week of the Chester raid, every night the week before, and every night the week after; I never missed a night; I positively swear that—I won't say I met him every night during the whole year, but I do swear that I have been in Davitt's house every night, and talked to him every night in February and March, and before and after—I bear this time particularly in mind, because of the excitement that was caused in Lancashire by that raid on Chester; we used to read about it and discuss it, and Davitt with me condemned it as a foolish idea, a foolish undertaking; we could not see the object of it, a foolish undertaking altogether—I did not know the object of it—of course I suspected the object was to take possession of the Castle, but I thought it foolish—I don't know that it failed; it did fail by the reports—I will swear that I saw Davitt, every night during February and March, at his house, and sometimes in the street after we came out of the house, and went back again to the house perhaps—I saw him every night in April, and I think I did every night in May I will swear I saw him every night in May and every night in June—I don't know about July—I won't swear that I saw him every night in July or August, there might be nights that I did not, but I used to go to Davitt's—I don't know the date of his leaving Haslingden, I think it is nearly two years since, fifteen, sixteen, or eighteen, or</p>

               <p>twenty months; I can't say whether it was in 1867—he did not leave Mr. Cockcroft in 1867 or 1868—I don't know particularly what time he left—I have seen him since; he has been at Haslingden at the time big parents went to America three, four, or five months ago—it was the left arm that Burke had lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling draper, and live at Haslingden—I was living there in 1867—I know Davitt, he was there at that time; I knew him very intimately, we were schoolboys together; I think he is about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age, the same age as me—in 1867 he would have been about twenty-one—he had only a moustache at that time—I was wearing one myself then—I was beardless—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the photograph</hi>)—this was his appearance in 1867—he was then in the employ<lb/>ment of Mr. Cockcroft, the postmaster; after that he became a hawker, and he travelled for about six weeks along with mo—I recollect the raid on Chester Castle, in February, 1867—I saw Davitt at Haslingden at that time—I saw him every night for that week, and the week following, because I made it a practice to go into his house every night; I was slightly indis-posed at that time—I was troubled with a bronchitis—not so as to compel me to keep my bed, but it prevented me from following my employment—I recollect the raid on Chester Castle, because it happened at the time I was badly—I saw Davitt in his own house, and in the streets occasionally—I lived perhaps 200 yards from him—I discontinued hawking while I was ill, but I went to Davitt's every evening during that fortnight—the Chester raid was always discussed every evening, and condemned by Davitt and others—I knew Burke, who lived in the neighbourhood of Haslingden; he had lost an arm—I don't recollect which arm—he bore a very striking resemblance to Davitt—he was about the same height, about the same complexion, and about the same age—I have been in Burke's company when he has talked about Fenianism, and he always sympathised with them very strongly—I saw him several times.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see Burke and Davitt together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have seen them together; in 1866 I saw them together, sometimes in Bacup and in Haslingden; not frequently, occasionally—sometimes they met accidentally—I have seen Davitt in Burke's house occasionally; I have not seen Burke in Davitt's house, to my recollection—Burke lived four or five miles off—I and Davitt were very intimate friends—we went into Burke's house, as we would go into any other neighbour's house; in a country place like that, where the population is not so numerous, of course everybody knows everybody else—we hap<lb/>pened</p>

I am clerk at the Wimbledon Station—on the 27th May I received two tons of hay from Batley Station in the name of Todd—application was made for it before it arrived—the same person came again the next morning and paid for the carriage, and the hay was delivered to him—I believe the prisoner to be that person, but I cannot positively swear—on the 31st May I received another consignment of four tons to the same person—the same person came to fetch it, but I had received a telegram to stop it—he asked the reason why it was stopped—I said I did not know and he left the office—this is the order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that he gave to me, and this is the telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—to all appearance the prisoner is the same person.</p>
