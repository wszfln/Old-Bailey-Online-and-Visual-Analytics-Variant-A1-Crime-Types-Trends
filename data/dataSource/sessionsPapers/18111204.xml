             first, she came and asked me if I had seen Rogers; I told her I had not; she asked me to go with her, for she was in great fear of his being detected in having taken things from Mr. Bird's house; I went with her up to the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him - A. Yes; he was then standing in an oyster-shop; Charlotte went across to him, leaving me on the opposite side; after speaking to him she told me that all was right; then I went across with her to him, and I said to him that his wife had been fearful of his being detected, and he blamed her for being foolish; he had then a tortoise shell snuff box, with a miniature picture within. That is the box. He had some small silver medals in his hands. I walked with her, she went to Mr. Miller's in Westminster-road; she sold the medals to him. I did not go in with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040004"/>Q. Did Rogers tell you where he got these things - A. Yes, at Mr. Bird's; she was bye and heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how that could be done while the servant was in the house - A. Yes, I did ask her; she said that she went to see the maid-servant, and that he got in the back way; he knew the way of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hear this - A. Yes, he was bye and heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. You all went together to your house - A. Yes; but before that she pledged the small lip-salve box for two shillings. Rogers had left a bundle at my house while his wife and I were out. When I went home I saw the bundle, I opened it for curiosity; there was a muslin handkerchief, and two or three shirts; he had the snuff box in his pocket at that time, and went away with it. He produced a large silver medal; this is it, my husband weighed it, and it weighed six ounces. I saw no more medals than that, and that one snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any watch - A. Yes; not that night. I saw the watch I believe on the Thursday after, the 26th of September; Mr. Rogers pulled, it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that look like the watch - A. It was a deeply engraved case. I can almost be positive to that being the watch, and tied with a purple ribbon, as this is; he said he had taken that from Mr. Bird's. Rogers, on Friday the 27th, called again at my house, he said, that he meaned to put the property back. On Sunday the 29th of September I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day that he quarrelled with you - A. Yes; he came in the morning and fetched away the snuff-box, the medal, and the watch that he had left with me. On the Sunday evening he came drunk and quarrelled with a person in the house; he did not quarrel with us; Mrs. Baines, a neighbour came in; she picked up the case of a watch, Mrs. Rogers took it away from Mrs. Baines and gave it to her husband; he took the watch out of his pocket, clapped it on the watch, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same watch that you have been speaking of - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. I believe you live in St. George's Fields - A. Yes; close to where Mr. Willmore lives.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of Sunday the 29th of September did you hear any disturbance in Mr. Willmore's house - A. Yes, in consequence of that I went in, I found the prisoner Rogers there, and his wife; I found in the parlour the case of a watch on the floor. He had been quarrelling before I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a gold case - A. I cannot say whether it was gold or metal, it shined very much. It was engraved, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that it - A. I believe it was something similar to that. I said, I have found the case of a watch on the floor, Mrs. Rogers said it was her husband's; I gave it her; she said it was nothing but metal; she gave it to her husband; he took his watch out; he put the case on the watch, and put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLER. I am a silversmith and salesman, No. 1, Coates-row near Westminster bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you purchase any silver medals in September last - A. Yes, I did. I suppose it was about a week before this robbery came out, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sold them you - A. Mrs. Rogers, the woman at the bar, sold them me. It was in the evening, about seven o'clock. I cannot say exactly the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of them were they - A. Thirty three coins.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost such coins as these, and more in number similar to them. I cannot speak particularly to them.</p>

             - A. Yes, and the little girl, Rebecca; they were at my house on Monday the 18th of November, in the morning about half past ten; Mrs. Dillone had bad eyes, she went to the doctor's, and left the children at my house under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were under your care did any person come into your shop - A. Yes; a lady came into my shop about half past ten, to buy two penny worth of apples.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the lady at the bar, is that the lady - A. I cannot tell whether it is or not. When she came in I had the little boy in my lap, and my sister had the little girl, and when the lady asked for the apples, I put the little boy down, and then the sister, the little girl got down, and then both went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was the little girl - A. About five years old, and the boy had just turned three. I served the lady with two pennyworth of apples, and then she asked for two pennyworth more; she gave me six-pence and I gave her two-pence; she then said good morning to me, and I said good morning to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to the children - A. She never spoke to them in my shop. When she went out somebody came to my shop for six pound of potatoes; I served the six pound of potatoes, and somebody came in for three pound more before I missed the children. When I had served them, I said, Beckey, do not go from the door; I ran to the door, and the children was not there. I ran half way up St. Martin's-lane; I called Beckey, Beckey, they did not answer; I returned down to No. 11, to the yard, and called, Beckey. I did not find them there. I did not think of their being stolen away; I ran down to the wharf, and as I was crossing of Swan-lane, I saw the little girl returning with a penny plumb cake in her hand, and an apple; she was coming up Thames-street; I ran across to her; I said Beckey, where have you been.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the children dressed - A. The <rs id="t18111204-3-viclabel14" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>Q. What sort of hair had the little boy - A. Light hair, and the hair turned up on the right side; his hair rather wanted cutting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the lady was dressed - A. She was genteely dressed; I did not take notice any thing she had on, I little thought of what would happen, or else I should have took notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen the little boy since - A. No. I never saw him since he went out of my lap.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose it was between the time of your serving the lady the apples, and the time of your last serving the last customer with the potatoes - A. Not more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time that you missed the little girl, and when you saw her come up Thames-street - A. About ten minutes after. This is the little girl.</p>

I cannot swear that she is the person; she had a straw bonnet on with a blue flower in it, and a blue cloth cloak, her cloak was trimmed with fur. She had a little boy with her in her arms in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how the little boy was dressed - A. I cannot say positively how he was dressed; he had on a blue pinafore, and a light coloured frock, he had no hat on; he had light hair and very thick. She had the little boy in her arms, and placed him on the counter; she asked me for a hat at half a guinea, upon which I arose and placed a hat on the child's head; she then asked me for a feather; I got a feather and she approved of it: I asked her if I should sew it in; she said, no, she was in a great hurry; she put the feather in the child's hat, and put it on its head; she paid me eleven shillings and went out. That is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of your sisters loss did you enquire after the little boy - A. I was distributing hand bills for three days before I could hear any thing. From information I went to Trafalgar-place, No. 7; I went to the house where the prisoner lodges, I took Goff and Clark (another officer) with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you get there for whom did you enquire - A. For Mrs. Russell. I was informed that she was not at home; the landlady desired me to walk up two pair of stairs, she desired me to wait, and the prisoner came into the room to me; I asked her if her name was Mrs. Russell, and informed her that I had a great deal of trouble to find her out, but did not inform her the real business I was on. I entered into a light conversation with her; I asked her if she had another room; I was anxious to see her other apartment, to see if I could discover any thing before I hurt or troubled her mind; she asked me if I wanted to go to it already; I said, yes; she then shewed me the other room; I then held her in conversation a minute, the same as I did in the other room, and walked about the room to see if I could see any thing that led to a discovery. I then told her it was too early to sit down to spend the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. This was on the Tuesday, eight days after the loss. I asked her then if she would put on her cloak and take a walk with me, as it was a fine evening, which she refused; she said she would light a fire and make me a comfortable dish of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your object in asking her to take a walk with you - A. I wished to see the colour of her cloak.</p>
               <p>COURT. All this time you had not given her any hint what you came about - A. No; she pressed me very hard to let her light a fire, but I still refused it. She then asked me who that was standing at the door; I informed her it was my servant; she said I had better go and send him away, as she supposed I was going to stop with her all night; I gave her no positive answer; I told her I would go down and speak to him; I then went down to Goff, who passed as my servant; I asked him what we had best to do in it, whether we had not best candidly tell her our business; I went back with Goff and desired she would not distress herself; I told her I had deceived her, my business was in search of a child who was my nephew; she was very much hurt, and asked me from whence I could get any information of her; I told her that I had heard a gentleman say that there was a person once took away his girl, but it was restored to him again, and that this person who took away his girl had before left a cloak there to be dyed blue, and that she was in the habit of wearing feathers in her hat or bonnet; Mrs. Russell then denied having any such clothes; she said she would shew me her clothes if I would look at them; I refused to do it. I told her if she was an innocent woman I hoped she would have no objection of seeing that servant who served a lady with two children with bunns; she answered, she was willing to see any one; I then sent for the servant,

On our way to Fish-street Hill there was a deal of conversation; Mrs. Russell questioned me closer which way I got my information; I asked her to confess to me if she knew any thing of the child; I told her that I heard that she once before attempted to take a child away; she confessed to me that she was accused of the same, but that the mother of the child gave her permission to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who that mother was - A. No, not to my recollection. I then asked her why, if she had permission, why she beat the child, the mother informed me that she did; she said she did slap it a little, but not hurt it. I asked her if ever she had a child herself; she answered, that she had, and that it was a girl.

            . I was a soldier in the Guards. I work in Thames-street in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you any time in November last, and what day, see any lady with two children - A. On the 18th I saw the lady who is arraignod at the bar now bring two children out of Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at her, are you certain of her - A. Yes, I am, or else I would not say it; I saw her come out of St. Martin's lane, having two children before her; then she took the youngest up; she walked along a few paces; the young one began to wimper; she said to the oldest that she was going to buy them cakes. I walked along with them to the end of Thames-street. The prisoner went up Thames-street, which is Mrs. Russell, I suppose, and then she went up Fish-street Hill. I did not see her any more that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how she was dressed - A. I will not swear whether her cloak was blue or brown, it was furred all round. She had a straw bonnet on, the children had both white frocks on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the dress of the children correspond with the dress of the lady herself - A. The children were dressed as a working man's children might be dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she dressed as a working man's wife - A. No, she was too tawdry for that. I was at the front of Swan-lane; I walked after up Thames-street; my attention was directed to her because she rather snubbed the children.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mills. Have you looked at that little girl - A. Yes, that was one of the children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did not you say before the Lord Mayor that you were not sure - A. Yes; I was not sure then by her dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are more sure now - A. No, I am not. I saw the child return with a cake, and it is in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to be sure before the Lord Mayor - A. I did say I was not sure, I believed it was the child, because I had not seen the child since I saw it first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Since you have had an opportunity of seeing it, are you sure now - A. Yes, because I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040008"/>particular notice of the child when it returned with the cake afterwards. I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why were not you sure then. This child was produced before the Lord Mayor, how can you now swear that this is the child, when you recently said after the transaction that you only believed it - A. I did say so, because I had not the opportunity of seeing it again; it was a long way off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It was not further off you than that gentleman - A. Yes, it was twenty yards further than that.</p>

            . I keep the White Hart, the corner of Leather Lane, and Portpool Lane. On Sunday the 3d of November, about six o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me to give Mrs. Jones, that keeps a coal-shed, change of a one pound note, she said she would take ten shillings in halfpence, if I would give change, I had plenty of copper, I gave her ten shillings in copper, and ten shillings in silver, I took this note of the girl, when the girl went out I saw another woman, the other woman said, is it all right. I then thought all was not right, I took hold of the girl, and took her into Mrs. Jones's the other woman on off, I asked Mrs. Jones if she had given this child a pound note to get changed, Mrs. Jones said, nothing of the sort, I had the pound note, I took the copper and the silver from the girl, I asked her where she lived, she first said at Hatton Wall, and then in Tothill Court, every thing she told me was quite false.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the note that was taken from me, I know it by a mark at the back; it is a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The day I took the note it was in a little bag, it laid in the pantry, I picked it up, and in the afternoon I went out.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether any body was in the parlour with her. - A. Yes, she was engaged with a gentleman; he sent Rebecca up to tell her mother he wanted his dinner, Rebecca came down and said he was to have it presently, he seemed to be in a passion, and in about a quarter of an hour he sent the child up again, he sent word that he knew Mr. Brant was in the parlour, Rebecca said, no father it is Mr. Coggan, he said he knew it was Brant, he went up stairs in a violent passion, and looked out of the one pair of stairs window, to see who went away; when Mr. Brant went away he mobbed him out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Brant quit the house. - A. No, I heard him mob him, I did not see him; then Mr. Brown came down stairs into the parlour, Mrs. Brown and he had some words, I heard them at words, I did not hear what passed; Mrs. Brown said, I believe, she would not have any of her friends insulted, while he, the husband, lived upon the prostitution of her body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said upon that. - A. I do not know that he said any more. I and Mrs. Brown and the child went to dinner, and Mr. Brown went out before we went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it you dined. - A. I think it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dine with you. - A. She was in the room, she did not eat with us. After dinner Mrs. Brown wanted me to pledge a large looking glass, I refused to do it, she fetched Ann at Mrs. Turner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a person that lived with her formerly before. - A. Yes, she occasionally used to be at Mrs. Brown's, she sometimes jobbed at one house, and sometimes at another, she fetched her to go out with it, she took the glass to the pawnbroker's, and just as she came back, Mrs. Brown got a trunk to pack up her clothes, Mr. Brown came in again.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say at about what time that was. - A. No, I could not tell, there was no clock in the house, he went out about two o'clock and had been absent the best part of an hour. I believe it was about three o'clock Mrs. Brown said to him I am about to leave you to night as soon as he came in, I will take Louisa with me, as for Rebecca you shall keep. Mr. Brown said he did not care he would be d - d if Brant should come there, he was a bad man, I do not know what answer Mrs. Brown made. I believe the answer she made was rather angry. He went up stairs to the bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the room over the parlour. - A. Yes, he was gone a good while, Mrs. Brown was sorting and packing up her things, we were both in the parlour together, I went down into the kitchen to go into the yard, but did not stay longer than ten minutes. I came back and found Mrs. Brown in the parlour sitting at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things packed up. - A. Yes, some of them and some not.</p>

Now when you went down into the kitchen to go into the yard could you tell from what you saw in the parlour when you returned whether she had been employed in packing up more things or whether the things were in the same state on your return. - A. I cannot tell that. Mrs. Brown went out of the door to Mrs. Orpwood's door, but on what account I do not know. Mrs. Orpwood lives at No. 4, Mrs. Brown's house is No. 2. I heard the noise of something like the motion or lumbring of a chair, I ran out to Mrs. Brown and met her just at Mrs. Orpwood's door. I said Mrs. Brown go up stairs something is the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You knew that Mr. Brown was up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the mere motion of a chair to raise an alarm in your mind. - A. I do not know, he was very quiet, I thought he might have fell off the bed, and as they had some words I thought there was something the matter, the noise was like the feet of a chair rubbing or scraping on the ground, I asked her to go up stairs and she would not go up stairs, she sent me, she said go up and fetch that little box of tickets out of the corner drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What box was it. - A. The box that some duplicates were in. I went up stairs and saw Mr. Brown hanging up at the bed-post.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a four-post bed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the bed was it that the cord was fastened upon, which he was hanging upon. - A. Up at the round nob by which the rings run.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040011"/>Q. Describe how the cord was fastened round the knob. - A. That I cannot, I had a small knife in my hand. I had been ripping Mrs. Brown's stays, I had that knife in my hand, I ran up stairs with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that post that Brown was hanging higher than your head. - A. Yes, it was about as high as that knob. I did not get up upon any thing to cut it. I cut it and he slipped upon the bed. His body was hanging, his feet was rather dragging on the ground, and his toes were turned underneath as much as I could recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. And his toes turning inward under the bed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you recollect the position of his knees, whether they were strait or bent. - A. No. I ran down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed or undressed. - A. Dressed.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the thickness of the cord. - A. It was but a small cord, I cannot tell, I took it down in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell from the appearance of the bed whether he had been lying on the bed. - A. I could not tell, nor could I tell whether the bed was made or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you cut the rope how high did you cut the rope. - A. As high as the knob, I reached it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that it was as high as that knob. - A. Yes, I cut it in the middle, and then it all fell down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you mean that when you cut the rope in the middle at that place at the knob, there must be some remaining. - A. That came down all at once.</p>
               <p>Q. When you cut the cord, did you cut the cord or a loop. - A. I cut the loop I believe, I do not know, I was in such a fright I cut it so that it all came down together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you cut the loop and it all came down so together, was the rope in two pieces or one piece. - A. In two pieces. I do not know whether it was put on double or single.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know whether the rope was tied double or single. - A. No my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you cut the rope which way did the body fall. - A. It fell upon the bed, he hung withinside, he hung in that position that when the cord was cut part of his body was on the bed and part of his legs on the floor. As soon as I cut him down I ran down stairs and said oh, Mrs. Brown, he has hung himself, and here is the rope, and I throwed the cord behind the fire not knowing what I was doing of.</p>
               <p>Court. You ran down stairs with the cord, how did you get the cord off the man's neck, I took the cord off his neck. I thought he was not dead, I undid his shirt collar and his handkerchief, not then I believe, but when I went up again. When I said to her oh Mrs. Brown he has hung himself, she said oh, Mrs. Andrews no; send for Rebecca.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you bring the cord down in your hand. - A. I do not know, for I took and smacked it behind the fire, I thought I should find him alive when I went up again. I put it immediately behind the fire before I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Rebecca at this time. - A. At Mrs. Woollaston's, after she said send for Rebecca, Mrs. Brown went to the door and Mrs. Woollaston was passing by, she said send Rebecca home. When Rebecca came, she went and fetched Mr. Bennett, when Rebecca came in Mrs. Brown said go up stairs your father is in a fit. Rebecca went up stairs and I went with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she said any thing to you about a fit before that. - A. No. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you came down stairs first of all did she at that time express to you what she thought was the occasion of his death. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time that you heard the word fit was when Rebecca came in. - A. Yes. I think she said he was in a fit, when Rebecca came Mrs. Brown said oh fetch Mr. Bennet, he is a surgeon, Mr. Bennet came and said he was no more. Mrs. Brown went up stairs with him and was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Bennet examine the deceased's person. - A. No. I dont think he did at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he told what was the occasion of his decease - A. I did not, I said I found him at the bottom of the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Bennet when he went there first, that you found him hanging at the foot of the bed. - A. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you. - A. I had no reason for not telling him except my fright.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any thing said to Mr. Bennet about his dying in a fit. - A. Yes, I told him that Mr. Brown died in a fit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Why did you tell him that Mr. Brown died in a fit. - A. That I can give no account, I must have been quite lost.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him that Mr. Brown died in a fit was Mrs. Brown present. - A. Yes. Mrs. Brown said nothing to my knowledge, Mr. Bennet told us to lay him on the bed, then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you unbuttoned his shirt collar. - A. The second time of my going up stairs, I think Rebecca was with me, I saw the black mark of the string about his neck, I did not say any thing about it. I was not there when Mr. Bennet came the second time, I was fetched to Aliffe Street, where I was nursing, I staid about an hour after Mr. Bennet was gone and had some tea.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were down stairs with Mrs. Brown had you any conversation with her concerning the death of Mr. Brown. - A. No. I do not think we had any, we talked about laying him out, a neighbour came in, I said he died in a fit and Mrs. Brown said so, when Mrs. Orpwood came in and 
               <persName id="t18111204-6-person118">Ann</persName>
             the servant I was going to lay him out, and then I was fetched away, and I was fetched to the jury on the Thursday or the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you mentioned that you found him hanging. - A. Not till the officer took me to Lambeth Street office, I believe on the following Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were you examined by the coroner. The day that this man came by his death was on Tuesday. - A. Yes, I think I was examined by the coroner on the Friday, and I think it was the Tuesday following, that was the first time that ever I mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040012"/>about seeing him hanging by the neck.</p>

               <p>Q. You were examined two or three days after by the coroner, your fright was quite subsided. - A. I told him the same that I did before, and I don't know when I did it, I had been up night and day with a lady, my head was very bad at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged man did he appear to you to be. - A. I thought he was near forty, I do not know what age he was, he was pretty hearty all but his knee, he had been in the hospital a month, he could eat and drink hearty, there was something the matter with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs and found him hanging, did you see near him any chair. - A. There was a chair standing sideways to the bed, it was standing in the place it usually stood, I had before seen it there, the chair was close by the body, the arm-chair stood almost at the bottom of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a cord as that. - A. Yes, it was a smallish cord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs. Andrews, I understood you to say that you went into the yard for about ten minutes. - A. Yes, leaving the prisoner packing up the trunk, putting her clothes together, I left her in the parlour, and I found her in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came back she was engaged in packing up the things. - A. Yes, and looking in her drawers, and putting her clothes together what she was going to take away.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the object she had in view when you went out in the yard she was carrying on when you returned. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did return you heard the noise like the scraping of a chair. - A. Yes, a few minutes after I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the time that you returned and you heard the scraping. - A. She had gone out to Mrs. Orpwood's door, she stood at Mrs. Orpwood's door, I ran to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when you went up stairs into the room, the chair was in the situation of having been removed from the place in which it had been, and it was at the foot of the bed. - A. The chair was very near to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a person had been disposed to hang himself, could you conceive a chair to be put more convenient for such a purpose. - A. I do not know, it always stood there.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be used for that purpose. - A. I do not know but it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he was a hearty man, and that he had a weakness in his knee. - A. He appeared to be a hearty man, he had very good use of his hands, and too much of his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that from the weak state of his body, that any body could have hang'd him. - A. He was very strong and very spitefull, I do not think that any body could have hang'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that a man would suffer himself to be hanged up by a woman, or any body else without using his hands. - A. You will know that by the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no marks of violence found upon her. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the means of doing it, he was strong and hearty enough, if he was so disposed, to have done it. - A. Yes, he had used violence upon her, but I believe not that day.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of November was the prisoner at your house. - A. In the afternoon she came into my shop a little before four I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain with you. - A. Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe after that you saw the child Rebecca. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing between you and Rebecca, did you go to the house of Mrs. Brown - A. I went to enquire, and Mrs. Andrews answered me, Mrs. Brown was sitting in the parlour with the parlour door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she hear what passed between you and Andrews. - A. Yes, I think she could, I asked what was the matter, Mrs. Andrews said Mr. Brown had died in a fit, Mr. Bennet had been sent for, and he said he was no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of Mrs. Brown while she was sitting in the parlour. - A. She was full of grief, she asked me if I would assist Mrs. Andrews, and lay him out, I said I would come bye and bye.</p>

            . I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of November last, I think you went twice to the house of the deceased. - A. I was. The first time I went it was five o'clock in the afternoon, Rebecca, the daughter of the deceased, came to me crying, I went to the house, I was shewn the deceased by Mrs. Andrews; Mrs. Brown followed me up stairs; Mrs. Andrews told me that he had been in a fit, this was in the hearing of the prisoner, he was lying on the bed on the right side, I immediately unbuttoned his waistcoat and felt his body, which was rather warm, but his extremities were cold, I said he was quite dead, Mrs. Brown immediately was struck with surprise and grief, and very much alarmed; Mrs. Brown said at first that she hoped he was not dead, I told her that he was quite dead, she said to Mrs. Andrews, you know what there is, let the furniture go, do the best you can for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Andrews said he died in a fit, did Mrs. Brown say any thing. - A. No, she neither confirmed it, or contradicted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time examine his person. - A. I only put my hand in at his body, and opened his mouth, his position on the bed was so that I could not see his neck, I went away, and said I was sorry for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040013"/>Q. From your examination of him, and from what you observed, and from what Mrs. Andrews said had you formed any other opinion than that he died in a fit - A. I had not then, knowing Mrs. Andrews before. I was sent for again, and when I went there the second time I saw Mrs. Orpwood, and the body was removed on the floor; Mrs. Brown was in the room, and I think Mrs. Andrews, but I am not sure; I examined the body then all over, I discovered the mark round his neck, that was pointed out by Mrs. Orpwood; I then said there was no doubt he had died of strangulation, by the effect of a cord round his neck. I said I would call upon Mr. Robinson the high constable; Mrs. Brown said she would leave it to me to do what I thought proper, she did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it your opinion now that Brown died of strangulation - A. It is my clear opinion; I believe hanging and strangulation are synonomous. It was by hanging as near as I could judge, and such a cord of this dimension would make such a mark as that; it was a small mark; the indent was all round, under the left side it was deeper; it came up to a point the two cords just under his ear. It appeared to me as if the whole body had been suspended by the cord.</p>

Yes, at half past three; I was in my kitchen ironing, my plates and dishes rattled on the shelf as I was ironing; I put my ear to my dresser, hearing a great noise; I heard Mrs. Brown say blast your eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her voice - A. I do, so well as to be certain what I heard was her voice, and I heard another voice answer the same language to her; it was a man's voice, but who it was I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you think you heard a man's voice say what - A. D - n your eyes. I went up into my parlour, and opened my window, and looked out of the window.

When he came out of the hospital I asked him how he did, he said, quite charmingly, except his knees failed him; he looked well.</p>

I then went down to Mrs. Brown, I said, step up stairs, there is something for you to see.

About five minutes before the articles were missing out of the window I was in the shop, no person was with me, my wife was gone out. I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, the maid was below in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the shop just before you missed the things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say you went into the parlour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night might that be - A. That was, I should think, about a quarter before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040014"/>Q. Perfectly dark, of course, was it not - A. Yes, out of doors. The shop was lit up.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went out of the shop you missed nothing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had not cast your eye to the articles - A. I had seen them, and had handled them; the pipe in particular; the pane of glass in the window that they took the things from had been cracked across the night previous; I particularly noticed that pane before I went into the parlour, it was in the same situation as it was the night before, and the same as it had been all day. After I went in the parlour my wife came in from the grocers, she said, you have had a great sale of things. I went to the window and observed that there was a hole in the pane of glass in the window that they had starred before. I found the articles missing, a silver mounted German pipe, a silver segar tube, and a silver mounted leather snuff box.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were these articles to the window that was broken open - A. They were close against the pane that was cut, and the pipe was hung immediately over the pane, and the segar tube and the snuff box were on the shelf under the broken pane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hole in the window large enough for a man or a boy's hand to be admitted - A. Yes; any person putting their hand in through that hole might have taken these articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise of breaking the window - A. No, I heard nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of your shop open or shut - A. Open, I believe, it might be shut; it was shut and open occasionally. If any body had come into the shop by the door I must have seen them; while I was in the parlour can take upon me to say that no person came into the shop by the door but my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the crack in the pane of glass that you observed in the night before and in the day had you any reason to think it might have fell out - A. No, there was no danger of the piece of glass falling out; I had cleaned it in the day, it did not shake at all. I searched about afterwards, there was no glass left outside, nor had it fell in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of the prisoner, do you - A. When I saw him in custody I recollected having seen him about the neighbourhood; I cannot say that night. He was taken up on Sunday, (the next day) for another robbery. On Wednesday Cooper the officer brought the snuff box and shewed it me, it was the very snuff box I had lost. On Thursday I saw the prisoner at Queen-square office, and I swore to the snuff box before the magistrate. I have not found the other articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear that you lost that snuffbox, or had you sold it - A. I am positive I never sold it; I lost it that very evening.</p>

            , I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday the 27th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I searched him, I found a broken pointed knife and this snuffbox; I asked the prisoner where he got that box; he said I had no business with it, he bought it, but he did not say where he bought it. I told him I should keep it in my custody; I left him in Bridewell. I made enquiry and found Mr. Hill had been robbed on the Saturday night previous to my apprehending him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that box, can you undertake to swear positively that is your box - A. This is the same box that I lost, there is my hand-writing on it.</p>

I found myself incumbered by a man running against me, and feeling round my pockets; I clapped my hand down to my fob, missed my watch, and seized the man by the neck, and immediately exclaimed, you rascal you have got my watch; I took my umbrella, which I had in my left hand, and plunged the same into his mouth, and kept repeating it untill I secured him, and at the same time calling out for watch, and for assistance. The people in the houses heard me, and immediately came out with their candles, and a man of the name of Davis, who is a watchman of the place, also came out, and the constable of the parish came from the noise, and the man was taken away from me in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your watch - A. The watch was gone; the people brought out candles and found the outside case which the constable has got. The watch I have lately heard an account that it is pawned in Blackfriars-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other man near you - A. None at all; he was quite by himself. At the moment I found a flutter I seized him, and never gave him up untill I delivered him to the constable. There was no blow struck by the prisoner, all he did was, he came plump against me, and feeling the flutter in my pocket I seized hold of him by the neck, and put my umbrella in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no harm produced - A. No harm at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How could I take the watch from you, and what could I do with it - A. There is no doubt he had an accomplice with him; there was a man seen to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040015"/>run from him to Hatton Garden.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of November an alarm came to the watchhouse that a gentleman was robbed; I immediately went up Thavies Inn, I saw the prisoner collared by the prosecutor, he told me that he had been robbed of his watch. I immediately took charge of the prisoner. In the course of two or three minutes the watch case was brought to me. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, I searched him. I found upon him nothing but a bad dollar, a three shilling piece, and one good shilling.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When this gentleman accused me of the robbery I was going home, he turned round and took hold of me by the collar; he said you scoundrel, you have robbed me of my watch; I said, no, I have not; he struck me; I was all over a gore of blood; he left me and went about to look for the watch; I staid there, knowing myself an innocent man. I am as innocent of stealing the watch as God is true.</p>
               <p>Roberts. This is the outside case.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my outside case.</p>

I immediately went after Joe, and when I came up to Black Horse yard; I met Joe coming out with two nose bags full of corn; I asked Joe if he had any corn at my house that morning; he said, no; I told him I understood he had some for Moore that morning; he said it could not be him, for he had but just come down from his lodging, and was assisting the man to get his horses out with the coach. I then came back to my man, I was determined to bring them together; I said, are you sure it was Joe that had this corn; he said, yes; I had seen my man deliver it to Joe; I told Joe so. I asked my man if he was sure Joe had it for Moore; he said he supposed so, but Joe had not said; I then went to Joe again and I brought them together, and my man asked him if he had not some corn that morning; Joe then asked my pardon, said he thought I meant yesterday morning, I know I had some corn this morning.

            . I was in Clerkenwell Green coming out of the Crown Tavern about five minutes after twelve. On my coming out I heard a faint voice from Aylesbury-street crying stop thief, it being very dark, and the place very wide I got into the centre of the green as fast as I could; I saw a person running towards me on the flag way opposite me, this person had neither hat or coat that I perceived running I ran across to stop him; I missed him. I had this cane in my hand, I threw my cane after him and lost the head; a thought came into my mind that the person who was running away without his coat and hat was running away in consequence of a fight; that was my conjecture. I got my cane, and was proceeding home; on going into Aylesbury-street I saw Mr. Abrahams without his hat; I asked him if he was robbed; he told me he was by the person that ran down the green. I immediately called to the watch for a light. When the light came I found two hats, also a coat, it lay close to my feet; the first hat I picked up; I announced it. Mr. Abrahams said, there is a particular name in my hat; that was his hat; I picked up the other hat. I accompanied the watchman who carried the coat and hat to the watchhouse, the prisoner said he was fighting in Aylesbury-street, and that was his coat, and hat, and hoped to get it; it being a cold night the constable gave it him. The prisoner was afterwards searched, there were four or five handkerchiefs found stuffed in his breeches.</p>

On the 12th of November, about three in the afternoon the prisoner and another woman came into the shop and enquired for some Scotch cambric; I was waiting upon two ladies, some Irish linens laid upon the counter, the ladies then that I was waiting on told me to cut some callico off for them. I turned my back to reach a yard that lay on the ground, and when I got up I saw a piece of something white under the prisoners mantle, the other woman and she talked together, I had suspicion of them. The shop being much crowded with customers they were making out. I jumped over the counter and laid hold of the prisoner and secured her, she resisted very much, the other woman made her escape. I took her into the parlour, locked the door, and went to Marlborough Street and brought an officer, she was then searched, before I went for the officer I took the Irish linen from her, it was the same that I saw under her cloak. I locked it up in the parlour with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any other shopmen in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040018"/>about seeing him hanging by the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined two or three days after by the coroner, your fright was quite subsided. - A. I told him the same that I did before, and I don't know when I did it, I had been up night and day with a lady, my head was very bad at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged man did be appear to you to be. - A. I thought he was near forty, I do not know what age he was, he was pretty hearty all but his knee, he had been in the hospital a month, he could eat and drink hearty, there was something the matter with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs and found him hanging, did you see near him any chair - A. There was a chair standing sideways to the bed, it was standing in the place it usually stood, I had before seen it there, the chair was close by the body, the arm-chair stood almost at the bottom of the bed,</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a cord as that. - A. Yes, it was a smallish cord.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. Mrs. Andrews, I understood you to say that you went into the yard for about ten minutes. - A. Yes, leaving the prisoner packing up the trunk, putting her clothes together, I left her in the parlour, and I found her in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. And when you came back she was engaged in packing up the things. - A. Yes, and looking in her drawers, and putting her clothes together what she was going to take away.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the object she had in view when you went out in the yard she was carrying on when you returned. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did return you heard the noise like the scraping of a chair. - A. Yes, a few minutes after I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the time that you returned and you heard the scraping. - A. She had gone out to Mrs. Orpwood's door, she stood at Mrs. Orpwood's door, I ran to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when you went up stairs into the room, the chair was in the situation of having been removed from the place in which it had been, and it was at the foot of the bed. - A. The chair was very near to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a person had been disposed to hang himself, could you conceive a chair to be put more convenient for such a purpose. - A. I do not know, it always stood there.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be used for that purpose. - A. I do not know but it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he was a hearty man, and that he had a weakness in his knee. - A. He appeared to be a hearty man, he had very good use of his hands, and too much of his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that from the weak state of his body, that any body could have hang'd him. - A. He was very strong and very spitefull, I do not think that any body could have hang'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that a man would suffer himself to be hanged up by a woman, or any body else without using his hands. - A. You will know that by the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no marks of violence found upon her. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the means of doing it, he was strong and hearty enough, if he was so disposed, to have done it. - A. Yes, he had used violence upon her, but I believe not that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Could she hear what passed between you and Andrews. - A. Yes, I think she could, I asked what was the matter, Mrs. Andrews said Mr. Brown had died in a fit, Mr. Bennet had been sent for, and he said he was no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of Mrs. Brown while she was sitting in the parlour. - A. She was full of grief, she asked me if I would assist Mrs. Andrews, and lay him out, I said I would come bye and bye.</p>

               <p>Q. You went again in the course of the afternoon to lay him out. - A.

The first time I went it was five o'clock in the afternoon, Rebecca, the daughter of the deceased, came to me crying, I went to the house, I was shewn the deceased by Mrs. Andrews; Mrs. Brown followed me up stairs; Mrs. Andrews told me that he had been in a fit, this was in the hearing of the prisoner, he was lying on the bed on the right side, I immediately unbuttoned his waistcoat and felt his body, which was rather warm, but his extremities were cold, I said he was quite dead, Mrs. Brown immediately was struck with surprise and grief, and very much alarmed; Mrs. Brown said at first that she hoped he was not dead, I told her that he was quite dead, she said to Mrs. Andrews, you know what there is, let the furniture go, do the best you can for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Andrews said he died in a fit, did Mrs. Brown say any thing. - A. No, she neither confirmed it, or contradicted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time examine his person. - A. I only put my hand in at his body, and opened his mouth, his position on the bed was so that I could not see his neck, I went away, and said I was sorry for her.</p>

               <p>"I think I shall," he said he had iron to carry to town, it would fetch five or six shillings, it would serve us to drink. I had just got the iron off his shoulder when I was taken.</p>

On the 9th of November last, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw two men coming up New Gravel Lane, Shadwell, with a bag or parcel upon each of their shoulders, it was a dark morning I stepped up to the prisoner, I asked him what he had got in the bag, he said, what was that to me, I told him I insisted upon knowing, he said I should not, and have the bag off his shoulder, I held him fast and called the watch to my assistance, and another officer came to my assistance. There was another man with him that had a bag as well as him, he made his escape. I examined the prisoner's bag, it contained three quarters and ten pound of copper bolts.</p>

             as an executrix with me of her deceased husband, he received the rent in his life time, it is a leasehold house. I had suspicion of the house being robbed on the 17th of November, between eight and nine at night. I, Mr. Salmon, and other officers went to this house, we went up stairs, at the second pair of stairs Mr. Salmon called to the people to come along, they came up stairs, and immediately after I presume the prisoners came down stairs, they are differently dressed now to what they were then.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to either of the prisoners. - A. No. They were immediately handcuffed. Mr. Salmon asked them what they had been doing there, one of them said they have been throwing my hat into the room, and I was obliged to come in after it; they were handcuffed and left with the people below. I went up to the third pair of stairs, the back gutter of the house was entirely taken out, it laid in the room at full length, it was not cut at all. The front gutter had been carried away the night before.</p>
               <p>- SALMON. I am an officer of Bow Street, on Sunday the 17th of November I went on this search, I took Mentz and Godfrey in the house and three other Patrols of Bow Street. I went up stairs with Mr. Steward, Mentz and Godfrey, it was about a quarter past eight, it was quite dark, we took a candle, the street door was locked, and opened by the prosecutor to let us in. I entered the lower part of the house, I found the cellar flap tore up in the back yard, it appeared that they got into the house that way, we went up two pair of stairs before we discovered any body, while I was standing upon the second floor landing, I thought I heard a footstep above me. I said to Mentz here is somebody in the house, look out, go up stairs, I was going up with the candle in my hand, I met Rees coming down, I immediately laid hold of him and gave him into the custody of Mentz. I was going up stairs, I met Turner coming down, I laid hold of him and gave him into the custody of Mentz and Godfrey, they were handcuffed immediately, I found no other persons there. In the back garret I found a large piece of gutter lead, it appeared whole, that lead was stripped from one end of the gutter to the other, it was completely taken up, and by the damp and wet on the gutter it appeared to me that the lead been recently taken up. This chissell I found upon the parapet wall opposite the window.</p>

I found two holdfasts that night, which had held the lead to the wall, and four the next morning on the parapet wall. I searched the prisoners, on

               <p>WILLIAM SCUDDER. I am a bricklayer employed under the London Dock company, I was employed with the prisoner in repairing a house belonging to them in <placeName id="t18111204-18-crimeloc98">Old Gravel Lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you on the day laid in the indictment see the prisoner. - A. Yes, about half after six in the evening, it was dark, then he was in Old Gravel Lane with a piece of timber I have now here in his arms, I knew the piece of timber by seeing him take it up from the house that we were repairing for the London Dock company, it laid outside of the house in the street. After he had taken the timber he walked away in the middle of the road, I walked after him, and when he came to the top of Charles Court I asked him what he intended to do with the piece of wood, he said he had seen it lay about the building, it was useless, he said he was going to sell it for beer, I told him to carry it back, it was useful, he did, and laid it down at the place where he had taken it from, and then he was apprehended. The man was in liquor, he did not seem to know what he was doing of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the Minories, it began to rain very hard, which compelled me to take shelter in the prosecutor's house, and when I was about thirty yards from the house, a young man passed me going towards the house calling stop thief, he then came and seized me. I know nothing of the charge. I am a taylor by trade, he cannot say that I was seen to steal, nor was any property found on me.</p>

On the 18th of November, about eight in the evening, I observed the prisoner coming out of the warehouse with a bundle of mats on his shoulder, I let him pass me conceiving it to be one of our men. Immediately afterwards our warehouseman came and locked the warehouse, I asked him if he had delivered any mats to any person, he said he had not. I immediately followed the prisoner and charged him with taking the mats out of our warehouse. The prisoner said he was going to take them to the Bell and Crown, Holborn. I told him he had taken them out of our warehouse, he must take them from whence he had them, he returned with them down Lombard Street towards the warehouse, and then he told me that he had got them out of Thames Street. I told him I would go with him to the place from whence he had them. We were opposite of the Anchor public house in Water Lane. He threw the mats down and ran off, he ran up a dark passage, I followed him, he dared me to approach him, I immediately called for help and jumped upon him, and brought him down to the Anchor public house, he then said if I would not hurt him or those implicated with him, he would tell me the whole particulars how he came by them. I immediately sent home and they brought a constable, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. Did not you understand him to say that he had them from the warehouse-keeper. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he with you. - A. No, he is gone. I have not seen him since the day after the affair happened. These are the mats, I believe they are our property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never in his warehouse in my life, nor scarce know where it is, he has stated many things that are not true. I had these mats from his servant to carry to the Bell and Crown.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at that house on the 13th of November last. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at that time living at Mrs. Butler's house as a visitor. - A. I was, I had been to the Theatre, I returned about twelve o'clock, Mrs. Butler was gone up to bed and the two maid servants. I took a little refreshment, I said to my daughter, Betsy, get the the boot jack, she said father there is one in the kitchen. She went with the candle to get the jack, as she was passing the yard door which leads to the kitchen head, she saw the door latch move which leads into the back yard; she seeing the latch of the door move returned and says, father, there is somebody at our back door, I says you only imagine so, come, come, take a light and follow me, when I was at the landing of the stair head I saw the latch of the door move myself, I said there is somebody there, I'll soon see who it is. I took the alarm bells off and put them on the mat, two bells. I undid and took off the wooden bar, after that I unbolted the top and bottom bolt, and then immediately the door was forced open from the outside, a man presented himself at the door of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man. - A. The prisoner I suppose. I have no doubt of it. I shoved the bar against him to prevent him coming in, but he forced himself in. He came in and I went of the right hand side of him, I gave him a shove over down the kitchen stairs, down he went neck and crop, I fell down after him, I do not know who was down first, he or me, we had a scuffle at the bottom of the stairs, and I hove him over and kept him down. I then said d - n you let go me, he said you b - r what are you going to do with me, I said to beat his bloody jemmy or head, I don't know which, one of the two. I punched him with my right hand in the dark, a light came at the stair head, and he and I were at the bottom, as such I beat him prettily on both sides, by that time the watchman came, and then I discovered it was the prisoner. The watchman said let him alone, we will take care of him. No said I, I will know him again to-marrow, so I kept hammering at him until they took him away, they dragged him up stairs and said they would take him to the watch-house, I followed them. A woman met him in the street and said Jemmy my dear where is your hat. I said d - n you, if you come here, I will give you a topper.</p>

            . Q. Were you at this house of Mrs. Butler's. - A. I was on a visit there for the first time. An alarm was given that somebody was there. I made the best of my way to him, to assist him instantly, and as the prisoner came in I saw two more men apparently down the yard. I shoved the door to and put my back to it, and put my foot against the bannisters of the stairs, and bolted it before they could rush in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them press against the door. - A. Yes. When I got the upper bolt and the bottom bolt in, I heard the rattle spring. Then all was quiet at the door, I heard no more. The watchmen came in with their lanthorns and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is the yard at the back of the house inclosed. - A. Yes, all round, they must have got over a gate and through a cow layer to get to the yard, and then to get over a brick wall to get into the yard.</p>
               <p>- HINCHCLIFFE. I was going one o'clock, we heard a rattle spring, the young woman said make haste my father will be killed, we were not a minute before we went into the house and secured the prisoner. There was a woman at she door when we came out, she said Jemmy where is your hat. The prisoner was without his hat, a watchman picked it up in Park Street.</p>

On the Saturday night I asked the prisoner if he would go, he said no, he should not be able to go, he had appointed to dine with his mother and sister; on the Monday he came again to the shop as usual and on the Tuesday, on the Wednesday he did not come. I understood by our boy that Mr. Potter was coming by our door, I addressed Mr. Potter, he said he had paid for the coat. I never received the money for the coat. Then on the Thursday when he came to the shop I had him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the coat to cost. - A. Two pound five shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is what you call a felony and embezzlement in the indictment. - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. This man being a likely man you employed him to invite the customers in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him a tester in nine. - A. Yes, in nine shillings one sixpence, that is usual in the trade, he had lived with me a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. This man at Walthamstow was a stranger to you and a friend of the prisoner's - A I knew he was a stranger to me. I found afterwards that he was a friend of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040024"/>Q. I ask you upon your oath when your barker produces a customer to you, do not you allow that he shall enter it as a matter of credit to his own account. - A. By no means, our shop is in the ready money way. He took the coat from me to bring home the money on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he after your enquiry for the two pound five shillings, tell you that he had unfortunately lost the money, but that you should be paid. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was going to quit your service. - A. Not as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not he given you warning that he was going to set up in business, and after that you had him apprehended. - A. Not before I sent for an officer to take him</p>
               <p>MR. POTTER. I live in Walthamstow in Essex, I am a mealman and corn-dealer. On my coming down Houndsditch from the corn market, I saw the prisoner at the front of the shop, upon my seeing him, he being an old acquaintance of my brothers and my friend. I thought I wanted a coat, I asked him if he could suit me for one, he answered me, walk in Sir, I will suit you with one of the best. I tried on several coats, but I did not approve of them, he persuaded me to look at a piece of cloth a remnant, which he could recommend me. I looked at it, and he as a friend persuaded me to have a coat made of the same piece, he took measure of me, and we agreed for the piece five and forty shillings, that is all that passed then. On the Sunday morning the prisoner brought the coat to my house, I gave him two one pound notes and a dollar. When I went to the next Wednesday's market I did not see the prisoner, on the Wednesday week's market. I accosted him Old Friend you owe me sixpence, he replied Oh yes Sir, I know I do, we will drink it out, we went over the way and had a glass of rum and water and a biscuit. On the next Wednesday's market I was accosted by Mr. Benson, how do you do Sir, how does your coat fit, I told him I hardly knew, I only put it on when my Old Friend brought it, he followed me to the end of the shop like a bailiff, I was afraid of a touch on the shoulder, I said I have paid for the coat, he said have you Sir, I said yes I have, he said he had heard nothing of it. I went home, on the Thursday night he came down to my house with an officer, to apprehend me, I suppose I was not at home, he left orders for me to appear before the Lord Mayor on Friday morning following, I was prevented by business, I could not attend. On the Friday night I was coming home, Mr. Benson's brother and an officer accosted me and said they had a summons for me. In the discourse between Benson's brother and the officer, I heard Benson's brother say he is a going to live with Mr. Smith that has opened a shop down our street, and we must banish that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. You would not have gone into Benson's shop for a coat except for your old friend Britten. - A. I should not have gone into the shop except for him. I thought he was one of the firm.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

The prisoner Nash was with us, he pointed out the place. We then went to Field; he told us that he had sold the bristles that he had received from Nash to Mr. Brown in Ratcliffe Highway; and had given Nash the money.

               <p>Q. In November last, and some time before November had you any acquaintance with the prisoner Field - A. When I was with my late master I became acquainted with Field about a twelvemonth ago; he did some business for my late master; When he was failing he had the turning of me over to Mr. Pigg of Wapping Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you any conversation with Field about any hairs - A. When I was at Mr. Hills I did the business for him when he was out of the way, and Field was put in the house to let it; he did let it, and he was to take some of the things to sell. After I was turned over to Mr. Pigg I had a small parcel of hairs to sell, about seven ounces; I applied to Field, he sold them for Mr. Hill. After I had been with Mr. Pigg about a week he applied to me for more bristles to sell; he bought them of me, and paid me; the first sum that I received was four shillings, they came to five shillings and sixpence, eighteen pence he kept for himself. The next I received was nine shillings and two brooms, he said he kept the rest for commission, I do not know what he received. The next parcel he received was one pound five shillings and eleven pence, he said he only got twenty two shillings for them; he gave me a pound, and said he kept the rest for commission.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept all this money yourself - A. Yes; I did not bring it to account to my master.</p>
               <p>Field's Defence. I never applied to him for any hairs in my life; Nash applied to me to sell the hairs to Mr. Brown, and I believed them to be taken from his late master, Thomas Hill, for board wages.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the pocket book - A. Twenty doubloons and my passport; a doubloon in Spain is worth sixteen Spanish dollars. In the morning I got up at six o'clock, I could not find the waistcoat, the doubloons were gone, and the passport. I found the pocket-book, there is nothing in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Gotty the prosecutor coming to your house - A. Colman the prisoner brought him to my house to lodge; they both slept together in one bed. When Colman first brought Gotty was on the Friday evening; he then asked me whether I had room; I said, yes; he then said he had plenty of money, that is the prosecutor had, and on the next morning they both came to my house, they breakfasted and dined at my house; they went to bed at ten o'clock. In the morning Gotty told me in the presence of

             that Colman attempted to get out of the window, and he opened it for that purpose, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040026"/>that he had lost all his money. Upon that I sent for an officer, but the officer was not up. They both went out together at six o'clock in the morning. The prisoner took the prosecutor to a bad house. This was before we had the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that - A. The prosecutor told me so. About twenty minutes after eight, after they had been out, I saw the officer search the prisoner, there was found on his person two three shilling pieces, two sixpences, and a few halfpence in his pocket. Inside of his stocking was found one doubloon, towards the heel under his foot. Previous to the prisoner being searched the prisoner said he had no money.</p>

               <p>Q. In the summer time you and your family sleep in the country - A. Yes, and left the prisoner in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 7th of September you discovered your house had been robbed - A. Yes. I lost a great number of things, and amongst others a printed cotton curtain. I asked the prisoner where it was the thieves had broken into the house; she said she supposed that they must have staid in the house all night, as there was no appearance of violence about the premises. I had two clerks that slept in the house, I enquired of them if they secured the door, they informed me that they had every thing safe before they went to bed. The prisoner then informed me that she found the door shut, but the fastenings taken down; that when she came down in the morning she found a bundle of clothes tied up and left in the parlour, which she supposed the thieves had left, being disturbed. I then examined the drawers in the parlour, the clothes and wearing apparel; nothing was gone, they apparently were not open. This bundle I saw, it was in the parlour, it consisted of no great value, the drapery of the beds: and these drawers contained valuable things. I then went up stairs with the prisoner into the dining-room and examined the side-board where plate was kept; she informed me that she had lost two table-spoons and two tea-spoons and they had left the same quantity. I found a number of things gone; the curtains had been taken down, she was to unpick them and wash them, and that part in question was taken away; I asked her how many curtains were taken away; she said she did not know, they were all taken away in the night. The curtain in question and two others. On the night of the 6th, about a month before the robbery, she kept the key of the bed-room in her pocket, it was a new thing for her to do. I sent for an officer, and she was taken in custody; he searched the prisoner, nothing was found upon. The officer took her down stairs. He then went up for his hat, and as he came down stairs she made her escape. I offered a reward of five guineas for apprehending her, she was not apprehended until the 15th of November in our street; she was in a state of intoxication.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday coming up Wood-street, between five and six in the evening, I saw the prisoner turn out of Wood-street into Clements-court, about four yards down the court he stooped down and wrapped something up; I stepped up to him and said, my friend, what have you got here; he said, nothing but my own; he seemed to be going off in a great hurry; I said, stop, I have not done with you yet, what have you got; he said, stockings. I put my hand upon the bundle and felt buttons; I said, come along with me, or tell me where you got these things; he said, I will shew you the man; we went on a few yards; I said, where does this man live; he said he could not find him. I then said you have stole these things; he then said he had them of them little boys. I asked one of the boys, he said he did not know any thing of him. I took him into a public-house and opened the bundle; I then took him to the Compter. I went afterwards to Mr. Romanis, he claimed the property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man credited me the pint and half of beer. I told him I lived with Mr. Caton. I had lived there. I told him I should pay him for the beer the next day. When he laid hold of me I told him I was going to have some supper with a friend at Hooper's-court, Litchfield-street. I never said 18.</p>

            . On the evening of the 19th of November I was going with Mr. Blackwell from Warwick-court, Holborn, to Skinners-street, Somerstown. I set out of Warwick-court rather before five, it was just dusk; Mr. Blackwell took hold of my arm.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you - A. A <rs id="t18111204-35-viclabel192" type="occupation">master bricklayer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

                  <interp inst="t18111204-35-crimeloc193" type="placeName"

I felt my watch go immediately he struck me; I said to Mr. Blackwell, one of these fellows has snatched my watch out of my pocket; Mr. Blackwell said, there they go; the other one ran away, the prisoner walked on. I went after the prisoner and catched him by the collar, he put himself in the attitude of fighting I said you have stolen my watch; he said, no, I have not got your watch; I said I do not suppose you have got it. A person came out of a door and said, is that you Mr. Smith; I said, yes. The prisoner then said I know you Mr. Smith, and you know me very well; I said, I do not know you from Adam; he told me his name was Dobbins, he lived in Chapel-path. He said he was willing to be searched; I said, I believe there is no need of searching you now, you have given your partner the watch. I let go of him. Some people said he lived in Chapel-path, I said I should find him the next day. The next morning I went to enquire if such a person did live there, I found he did reside there. I went to Hatton Garden and got two officers, and on the 21st he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again - A. No, nor the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Were you sober - A. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner seems to be a strong active young man, what sort of a man was the man that ran away - A. A shorter man than him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were sure as you have sworn to-day that the prisoner was the man who struck you on the breast and took your watch why did you let him go - A. People came forward and said he was the man that he represented himself to be, and my friend was a little terrified; he said, let him go, we shall be murdered presently, they have given up his name. That is why I gave him up. After I was struck I never lost sight of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day did not the man at the bar go to your house and ask you why you should propagate such a report - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go to your house on the 21st in the morning to make some demand of you - A. He did; I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then ask him what time of the day you might find him at home, he replied you might find him at home all day - A. The prisoner came to my house again, I told him I would wait upon him at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040028"/>his house as I knew where he lived, because the officers were not come at that time; the officers in a few minutes after came to my house; I said the young man has just been here; we went down to his house and found him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that there is a reward of forty pounds - A. I have heard so. I do not know the fact.</p>
               <p>MR. BLACKWELL. I am a master taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 19th of November going with Mr. Smith from your house towards Somers-town - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. You got to Judd-place near Somerstown, did not you - A. Yes, it was rather dark: as we began to cross the road in the sweeping path I saw these two men coming to meet us about the middle of the road, Mr. Smith rather gave way for them to pass; at the mean time that he gave way one of them struck him on the breast and snatched his watch from him. There were two of them, the tallest man was next to Mr. Smith, and it was the tallest man that gave the blow to Mr. Smith in the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and say whether you know him - A. It was the tallest man; I do think it was the prisoner. We never lost sight of him after he gave the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in the road except you two, and these two young men - A. Nobody else at all. Mr. Smith ran after the prisoner when he had only got about four yards off. I do not know which way the other man went.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Smith ran after the man that he supposed had struck him were there any other people in the road - A. I saw no one crossing, nor in the path, untill after we took him, there were some immediately then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Smith lay hold of the prisoner - A. Yes, I did, and the prisoner said he had not got the watch; he gave an account where he lived, and his name, and then Mr. Smith let him go. I thought we were somewhat in danger; he gave an account where he lived; some girl or woman came up and said he lived there; we then let him go. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that Mr. Smith laid hold of and there were two men met us; I am quite sure the prisoner is one of them; I never lost sight of him.</p>

I missed a dozen of soldier's caps; I was ill at the time, I had the prisoner in my house, I told the prisoner that I had lost the caps, she confessed that she had taken them. About a week or a fortnight after I had lost them, I missed them on a Saturday, the latter end of May, she said she and another woman had cut them in pieces, they were cloth caps, and she sent a girl to Tothill-street; she sold them for three pence a-piece, and brought the money to her. I had a warrant for her, and took her up before the justice; the magistrate knowing her mother he wished to make it up; Justice Fielding asked me how much it would be; I told him I was charged twenty-four shillings; he then said she must produce two pounds, he allowed her till the Wednesday following; I went at the time appointed, and then he said, as she was not there I might take out a bill against her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews. What account did Mrs. Sutty give of this - A. That they were goods taken from her apartment ready made up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Sutty employed me to make these caps, I had a misfortune of up-setting a lamp over these caps, and spoiled them. When Mrs. Sutty told me I had the caps I told her I was willing to pay the money, I did not take them out of the house.</p>
               <p>MRS. KENT. Q. Did you ever hear any conversation with the prosecutrix about this supposed felony - A. I had. I am a neighbour of the prisoner's mother.

            's mother sent for me, I went to Mrs. Sutty, I told her that I was come from Mrs. Steel in Gardner's place, concerning the caps; this was in October. She said she was charged twenty-four shillings; I said Mrs. Steel is a poor woman, do not charge too much. I am positive that she told me that she gave them to her to make up, that she had spoiled them and sold them.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Mrs. Sutty. You say you missed your caps on a Saturday, the latter end or May - A. Yes, and the caps were completely made up at my house. I had seen them in my house a fortnight, they had no oil on them. When I first mentioned it to the prisoner, I said, you stole them out of my cupboard, she said, for God's sake Mrs. Sutty do not let my mother know it, she will go out of her mind. I shewed Mrs.

               <p>"aye my little boy it is a forgery," I told him my father knew where he got that from, and the other too; then he asked me whether I had been to any other banking house, I told him, yes, I had been to Ladbrooke's, he asked me what I had received there, I told him I had received ten one pound bank notes for a country note, he said,</p>
               <p>"aye my little boy they are both forgeries, your father is a dealer in forged notes, go with me to Masterman's." He laid hold of my hand and took me past the Excise, then he said he would turn back with me and go to my father's, he took me up Broad Street and up Old Bethlem, he then said,</p>
               <p>"it is in vain me spending my time, deliver me up the money or I must take you into custody," and he told me to run to my father, and tell him to be at Masterman's in the course of an hour. Then I gave him the notes up</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the notes. - A. They were in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take out the notes. - A. He told me he would take me in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afraid he would take you in custody, were you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have given them up if he had not said that. - A. No. Then I went home to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner. - A. He went away, I saw no more of him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man. - A. Yes, I am certain of it. Then on the 16th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, my father sent me to Messrs. Barber and Co. to receive a balance due to him, in which they gave me a two hundred pound note. I came directly from Messrs Barber and Company to Messrs. Gibson and Company, where I had to pay about eighty pound within one shilling, I gave the two hundred pound note to them, but they could not give me change, but told me to go to the Bank of England and get four fifty's. I came directly from the Bank of England to Messrs. Gibson and Company. On entering the door the prisoner accosted me, saying,</p>
               <p>"you have been to the Bank of England." I said,</p>
               <p>"yes, I have," he said,</p>
               <p>"after you have been in here, you meet me up by Change Alley, and go with me to the Bank, there is a mistake in the business," he said; I, knowing it to be the same man who stopped me in Bishopgate Church Yard, I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall not go in here now at present, you are the very man who robbed me of eleven pound," I caught hold of the sleeve of his coat, he plucked himself from me and ran off, I ran after him and hollowed out,</p>
               <p>"stop thief, that man stole eleven pound from me." He ran off, and at the entrance of the post office, there were a few coachmen standing at the end, they stopped him. I told them to take him into custody, for he had robbed me of eleven pound a little while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he is the same man. - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he was taken in custody, was he. - A. Yes, and taken before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Now tell me exactly what he said to you, what did he do. - A. He told me to deliver up the notes, or else he would take me in custody, I delivered up the notes then.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he take the notes from you. - A. No. in a snatching way, I gave them to him, he had hold of my hand all the while, I was afraid he would put me in prison, and my father would not know where I was gone to.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not hurt you or do you any harm. - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040030"/>Q. He did not say that he would do any harm to your person. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suppose he would charge you with when he took you in custody, - with these forged notes - A. Yes, untill my father came.</p>

               <p>ROBERT COLE. On the 11th of May last, about half past ten or eleven in the morning. I was proceeding to the <placeName id="t18111204-40-crimeloc224">Custom-house</placeName>

               <p>Q. To what amount. - A. I could not tell, they then went away and left me, and I proceeded on my business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. This was on the 11th of May last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the tower wharf. - A. At the further end of the new buildings of the left hand side from the entrance at the iron gate.</p>

               <p>Court. Near the iron gate side. - A. Beyond the first draw-bridge, near the gun wharf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. That is a considerable thoroughfare. - A. It is a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great many workmen there in the foundery, and there is a centinel between the drawbridge and gun wharf. - A. There is a centinel box on the left hand side of the wharf, but none between the bridge and this place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there upon your oath between the gate of the tower next Wapping and the draw bridge two centinal boxes. - A. There is one between the gate and the draw bridge, and one between the draw bridge and gun wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing more past between these boys than what you have stated. - A. No. I went to the Custom-house about my business.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar at all. - A. I saw him once before at Marlborough Street, I never saw him before it happened. On the 22d of November, I went to bed between ten and eleven, the housekeeper was in the house, General Bradshaw, the maid, and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the General go to bed. - A. He in general goes to bed about eleven, he was gone to bed when I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed did you take any notice of the windows and doors of the house. - A. I did not take any particular notice of them. - The maid is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she gone to bed at the time. - A. No. I got up in the morning and came down between seven and eight o'clock, when I came down I found the kitchen door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that door open into the area. - A. No, it is an inner door, I found it open and on my proceeding in the kitchen I saw two of the squares broke.</p>
               <p>Q. When these two squares of glass were broke was it possible for any person to put their hand in. - A. Yes, it was possible to be done. Any person putting their hand in at these panes might unpin the window and throw the sash up and get in, there were shutters to the window, the maid is not certain whether she fastened it when she went to bed. They were open on the inside. I then thought that somebody had been in the house. I went up to the maid and told her that the house had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the first up were you. - A. I was the first up. She said is it possible. I opened the area door. I found a man's shoe and a hat. And the things that are missing, when I see them, I can swear to them. There was missing a tea-pot, washed or plated, I am not certain which, five silver tea spoons, one pair of breeches, two pair of gaiters, one hat, and a clothes brush.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the hat and shoe. - A. I took them into the kitchen, I shewed them to the general, and he desired me to take care of them until the officer came. Craig the officer came a night or two afterwards to my master's house, the maid delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the hat and shoe. - A. I did. I can swear that the same hat and shoe that I saw the maid gave to Craig, were the hat and shoe that I found in the area.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is in Piccadilly, Albemarle Street, and Dover Street. On the 22d of November, I was going to call half past twelve along Piccadilly. I met the prisoner with a blanket rolled up under his arm, just by the New White Horse cellar, between Albemarle Street and Dover Street, he was coming as if from Hyde Park Corner, he had only one shoe on. I stopped him and asked him what he had got in the blanket, he had a hat on, he said they were a parcel of old things, he lived with Captain Warpole. I touched the blanket and a silver spoon tumbled out, and as he was stooping for the silver spoon the tea pot fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a tea-pot. - A. It is plated or washed, I cannot tell which; at the time I thought it silver. I saw there was a gaiter or two hanging out, by that I took him by the collar and sprang my rattle, and then he chucked the blanket and the whole of the things down. I held him by the collar till I had a partner come up, then we picked up the things and the blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of your partners came up. - A. Yes, one man came, his name is

            . Q. You are one of the police officers. - A. Yes. In consequence of the general's applying at the office, I was directed by the magistrate to go with Craig and look at the place. On the next morning the 23d we found the window broken as the servant has described it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that after breaking the squares of glass a person might put their hand in and unpin the window and throw the sash up - A. Yes, they might very easy, and afterwards shut it down again. I have no doubt they got in at that window. The servant informed us there was a shoe and a hat found in the area of that house, we desired to look at it, one of the female servants there, said she was sure the hat belonged to one of the servants that did live with the general.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked at the hat and the shoe did you compare the shoe with the prisoner's shoe. - A. I did afterwards. The man servant said that he had taken his hat and left his own. On Friday night the robbery was committed, on Saturday he was committed, on the Monday morning we went to the prisoner and examined the shoe that he had on. He had sold the hat when in prison to a fellow prisoner, he delivered up the hat, and the prisoner did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you that hat. - A. Yes, the prisoner told me who he had sold it so, and I called the man he gave me the hat in the prisoner's presence. The hat has been in my possession and Craig's ever since. I marked the hat before ever I gave it out of my possession. I can safely swear that this is the hat the prisoner said he had sold, which the servant said was his. This is the shoe I took off the prisoner's foot, the other shoe was given me by the other young woman in the kitchen and she put her mark on it. I have compared the shoes, they are fellows.</p>
               <p>- BENNING. This is my hat. I know it by a crack on the outside, and it has been slightly cleaned once. I know the hat by having it in constant wear. It is the hat I left in the kitchen the night before.</p>
               <p>- CRAIG. Q. You have heard Foy's account. - A. Yes, it is true, I kept this hat a little time. It is the same hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived along with different gentlemen in that neighbourhood for seven years. I went to General Bradshaw and left him at my own option. I went over to Ireland and came back, I was very bad and I went into the Lock Hospital. I came out one evening and got rather in drink, stopped out late, as I turned back I went into different houses to get a lodging, I was disappointed. I went down into this area, I saw the window shutter open, I shoved the sash up. I thought to lay there for the night, down the sash came, the glass broke, I will own it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Benning.) Look at these things. - A. That is the general's tea-pot, the cloths brush is my own.</p>
               <p>FELL. That cloaths brush I took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>BENNING. That book is my own. I can swear to the spoon, we missed five, we have only one; and I can swear to the gaiter, both pair of gaiters are mine; and the breeches are mine.</p>

On last Saturday, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon the prisoner came into my shop, she asked to look at some blue printed cotton, there was a piece of that description laying upon the counter, I asked her if that was the sort that she wanted, she said no, she wished for a larger pattern, there were a number of other customers in the shop at the time, I turned from her to speak to the other customers, and then turned to her again and found her coming from the other side of the shop, coming towards me again, I asked her if that pattern would do again, she said no, it would not; she then walked towards the door, I observed her hand up to her cloak as she was going out, as if to conceal something that she had got there, I followed her immediately into the Street, she then attempted to cross the way, I took hold of her by the arm, I said,</p>
               <p>"let me see what you have got there," I pulled her cloak a little of one side and saw a piece of muslin, which I took from her and requested her to go back with me, which she did. Before I had been in the shop a minute with the prisoner a man, a stranger to me, brought in three pieces of muslin, and said, the woman has dropped these three pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the woman. - A. I cannot say, it was very close to her. These are the four pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Sir, tell me whether you know these pieces are yours. - A. Yes, they are my own marking.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the shop. - A. I had seen them in the morning, they were laying on the opposite counter, the counter from which she came.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the one piece that you took from her. - A. About six shillings, the others are about two pound four shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Mrs. Newell's house - A. About a quarter of a mile. I asked the prisoner what money he had got in his pocket, he shewed me three dollars, an eighteen-penny piece, and three sixpences. I took the dollars and the eighteen-penny piece from him, and put him in the cage. I then went up to Widow Newell and asked her what property she had lost; she told me three dollars, an eighteen-penny bank token, two sixpences, and one shilling; I went to the cage, I told the prisoner I thought that he had some more money that I wanted; he produced three sixpences and some halfpence, and told me that was all the money he had got. I searched him, in his side pocket I found a shilling, I told him that was what I wanted. It is a shilling that has been but worn a little. This is all the money.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Can you speak to the money - A. This shilling I can say is the same; I can take my oath to this shilling; and this is all the money I lost.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 25th of October had you a pocket-book - A. I had, it is a bankers book, it contained a check for an hundred pounds upon Marsh, Sibils, and company. I was going with it to their house in Berner-street, Oxford-street. a little after eleven in the middle of the day. When I got into <placeName id="t18111204-46-crimeloc257">Oxford-street</placeName>

                        targets="t18111204-46-off253 t18111204-46-crimeloc257"/> there was a fire on the opposite side of the street, and the crowd were at the side where I was looking at the fire. As it was necessary for me to pass through the crowd I was very particular of securing my book and buttoning my coat pocket; when I entered the crowd I held my hand for the purpose of securing the book, I had not been in the crowd two minutes before I found myself very much hustled, then I found it necessary that I should use both my hands to get forward, and when I pressed with my hands I perceived I had lost my book, and I am very sure it was not more than a minute before I put my hands down again, I found my pocket lighter and missed the book; I turned round to see who it was pressing behind, I then saw the prisoner with his back turned towards me making from me, and at this instant at my turning round a man that was arm in arm with another man, he pushed me before for the prisoner to escape behind, because I stood they said, d - n you, what do you stand here for, and pushed me violently before them; he then caught hold of another man directly before me, and the prisoner was behind them, the third man was arm in arm between me and the prisoner. At the instant one of these fellows laid hold of the man of the left side I turned round and laid hold of Wood by his shoulder, be then let his left hand man go, and was more violent in cursing me, endeavouring to make me let Wood go. As he was so upon my seizing Wood I was more positive of Wood being the man that had my property; I then called out,</p>
               <p>"hold him, a pick pocket, to the crowd around; I succeeded in getting through them. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040034"/>followed Wood through the crowd at the distance of half a dozen people; the crowd pressed very hard in consequence of my calling out, and Wood could not escape very fast. I then catched hold of him by the collar the second time over two persons heads. It was their breaking my hold the first time that strengthened me that he was the man. I dragged myself up to him, and he pressed forward dragging me after him. I then held him with both my hands, and came before him and accused him of the robbery, he very strongly denied it, and used abusive language, presented the end of his finger and said, I am a <rs id="t18111204-46-deflabel258" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

I told him I did not care what he was, I was very certain he had robbed me, I would not let him go. While he was amusing me with his left hand I saw the pocket book fall as if from him; I did not see it in his hand; his right hand was by the side of him; when the pocket book fell as if from him at the same time he began to struggle, and as I saw the book down I let him go in order to secure the book; he was ultimately secured. I only lost sight of him while I picked up the book, he was working away from those that held him through the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man that you followed through the crowd, and from whom you saw the pocket-book fall - A. Most certain; he was damning the people and saying d - n any man that touches me; I went forward and seized him. This is the book and the warrant. I had not received the money, I was going to receive it. The pocket book and warrant belonged to Mr. Phildes. (The warrant read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner was quite a stranger to you before - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for you to be so accurate to his person - A. I never let him go out of my sight. I never saw his face untill the second time I seized him, and I saw the book come from his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be dropped by somebody else - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>- PRESTON. I am a patrol of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Wood - A. Yes, I assisted in apprehending of him, he was trying to rescue himself from every body. I knew him in the crowd; I have been in the habit of seeing him with other characters about town. I have no doubt of his person.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. No, not that I saw. I went in the shop and saw a great coat lay upon a mat near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you at the shop door - A. Yes, at the time I was scraping my shoes at the door the prisoner came out; seeing the coat on the mat, and the prisoner coming out I had suspicion. I then went backwards into the workshop.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the door close - A. With a hasp. I shut the door and went into the back workshop: going along I looked back several times expecting him to come back. I saw him come back and take the coat; I immediately told the porter, he pursued him, and I followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. Yes, but I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I told him the mare belonged to Mr. Daplyn, 25, Saffell-place. He turned her round to take her home towards Mr. Daplyn's, I went on about my business, not thinking I should see her any more. When I returned back from Church-lane I saw him riding the mare with a new halter about a quarter before eleven, he had just entered on the stones in Whitechapel. I ran over and catched hold of the mare, I asked him where he was going to with her; he told me was going to take her home; I said, did not I tell you that it belonged to Mr. Daplyn, 25, Saffell-place, I challenged him with stealing the mare; he jumped off, ran away, and left the mare with me.

On the 8th of May, in the evening, I went to the sign of the Three Compasses in Shadwell market, the lease of which was to be disposed of, I wanted the house for a brother and sister of mine who lived at Ipswich. The time I went to the house was about a quarter after seven in the evening, I stopped there about an hour and a quarter, in the course of that time I drank four glasses of cold brandy and water. After that I left the house and was returning to my own house. After I got out in the air I found I was intoxicated, I proceeded up Ratcliffe Highway and got into the entrance of <placeName id="t18111204-49-crimeloc276">Parsons-street</placeName>

I asked him what he did that for, and called him a d - d dirty fellow for so doing. I asked him who he was, said he, if your sister was here I would give her a swishing; I asked him how old he was to talk about such things; he answered, between fifteen and sixteen, and said he was just returned from the West Indies, where he had seen plenty of that. I asked him the way to Well-street, conceiving that when I got there I should know the way home; the prisoner said he would shew me the way He took me up a street which I have since found to be Neptune-street, when I got to the top of Neptune-street I had some faint recollection that I was in Wellclose square. He walked me part of the round of the square, and we came into North-East passage, when I said to the prisoner this cannot be my way; he said, come along, we shall soon be there. We then came to Pell-street, he there gave a whistle which greatly alarmed me, I set off running, I turned my head round and heard the feet of two or three persons, and a voice calling out stop him; I proceeded on when I was taken hold of by a man who held me until the prisoner and Norton came up, they informed the man that I wanted to commit an unnatural crime on the prisoner; I asserted my innocence to the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you a married man - A. I am, I have a wife and four children. I asserted my innocence; the man said he was an officer of the night and he was going to the watchhouse. He took me to the watchhouse. Before we got to the watch-house I requested him to send for a near neighbour there, but they took no notice of that. When we got into the watchhouse the beadle was in the watchhouse with two women, when the man who had taken me in custody told the beadle he had got a serious charge the women were ordered to withdraw. The prisoner then stated to the beadle the charge that he had against me. I asserted my innocence. The beadle said it was a most shocking thing, but he must take the charge. By this time there were four or five men collected in the watchhouse, besides the beadle, the names of the prisoner and Norton were written down by somebody, I gave them my address and name, and begged them not to take the charge of me, as I was innocent; the beadle said he must take the charge. The beadle put his two hands into my waistcoat pockets, and said he must search me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Give us the beadle's name - A. Lancaster.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is very fit it should be known.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told him not to search my pockets,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040036"/>I would shew him all that I had got; when I took out of my small clothes pocket a five pound note and three one's, I gave them into the beadles hands and told him he might do what he pleased with it; I told them they were welcome to that little money; Lancaster the beadle said, I see you are well lined; I said I was a man of some little property; he then made some little arrangement among the officers in the watchhouse, as well as with the prisoner and Norton, they were called out of the watchhouse at different times. Lancaster came into the watchhouse and told me that he had settled it with the prisoner and Norton, and they were gone. I saw no more of them in the watchhouse. Lancaster returned to me three pounds, the other five pound was kept back. I was suffered to go at last. I had not proceeded from the watchhouse above ten or a dozen yards when I was again accosted by the prisoner and Norton, who said, that as they only received one pound each out of the five pounds that I had given to Lancaster, they demanded the three pounds that I had received back from Lancaster, or that they would come down to my house and expose my character, and see further into the business, when I, through fear of such an accusation, gave them the three pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What age boy was Norton - A. He might be about nineteen. They left me, and I proceeded home.</p>
               <p>Q. They demanded three pounds of you, and you gave it them - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath what was the occasion of that -</p>
               <p>COURT. He has said that, he has explained himself in the most distinct way; - when I, through fear of this accusation, gave them the three pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Do you mean to tell the jury that you did not know the way home - A. I did know my way, but being intoxicated, and being in the dark street, I asked my way.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not that you did not know the way, but you were overcome with liquor, that was the reason you enquired the way - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given my learned friend some account of the boy's indecency you have a perfect recollection of what he said to you and you to him the very words you recollect - A. I cannot recollect every word.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to trust yourself with such an indecent character you had chided him for his indecency - A. I said, pray which is my way to Well-street; I do not know that. I asked him individually. I did not ask him to guide me, only the way to Well-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Lancaster was the person who proposed to make it up - A. It was among themselves, not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the boys in the watchhouse say that they was dissatisfied and that they would not have the money - A. Never in my hearing, nothing passed of settling the business in the watchhouse; they were called out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Jones say that he would not make it up but that he would prosecute - A. Never in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. When they they came up to you at this distance of ten or twelve yards you were within the reach of the watchhouse why did not you go back - A. Because I was under such dread and confusion at the time I wanted to get home, and to hear no more of the business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you parted with the money you did not part with it under any personal fear upon you - A. When they came up to me I parted with the money to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you under any personal fear at the time - A. I apprehended no personal danger; I was in great dread; I was afraid of injury to my character.</p>

               <p>Q. When the charge was made by the boy what said Mr. Cole to him - A. Mr. Cole seemed very much frightened and agitated, he begged for God's sake that we would settle matters; he said, for God's sake do not give charge of me, I am a man having a family.</p>
               <p>COURT. He said that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his saying any thing about mercy - A. I do; he said have mercy on me, I am a man having a family, and do not wish to be exposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, at any time while you were in the watch-house say there was no truth in the charge that the boy made against him - A. I never heard such a word. He said he would give any money so that it might not come to be known, or something like that. Them are the words as near as possible. Figgens can give better evidence than I can, he knows more about it.</p>

            , Q. Were you present when the prosecutor was brought to the watch-house in last May. - A. Yes, I am a watchman. The beadle asked the boy what charge he had against the prosecutor, the boy said, he was coming down White Lion Street, the prosecutor seemed very familiar with him, and that as he came along he used very indecent touches.</p>
               <p>Court. And used very indecent actions. - A. So far that he pulled out his own nakedness and put it in the boy's hand untill they came to the corner of Pell Street. Mr. Cole begged for mercy and asked the beadle whether he would not mitigate the matter to settle it between him and the boy, he did not wish it to be spoken of, be went down on his knees and implored them as he had a wife and four children.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you speaking correct. - A. Those are the very words to the best of my knowledge. Mr. Lancaster asked the boy if he wished to persevere in it, he said not, but he wished to have an acknowledgment of Mr. Cole, whether he was guilty or not. He asked the prosecutor if he would make the boy a recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked. - A. I cannot say whether it was Lancaster the beadle, or one Tindall a carman that was there, he said it was the least that he could give the boy five pound, Mr. Cole pulled out a handfull of notes and gave one, and said he was very much obliged to Mr. Lancaster, he gave a note, what the contents of it was I cannot say. The boy Jones insisted upon his making an acknowledgement whether he was guilty or no, he said that he had done amiss, he was very sorry for it, he hoped it would be a warning to him for ever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Attend to me first, let me know who you are. - A. I am a watchman in St. George's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an Irishman, are not you. - A. Yes, I live in Pell Street, and I work in the London Docks, I have a wife and four children.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the watch-house when the charge was given. - A. It was opposite of our door, I accompanied them down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Lancaster you say was there, who else - A. One Tindall a carman.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the man fell down on his knees, Lancaster is not blind, is he, I suppose he must have seen it. - A. I suppose he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he deaf. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him. - A. A twelvemonth, I never knew him deaf.</p>
               <p>Q. He can hear as well as you. - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said the prosecutor said he had done wrong, he was sorry for it, must not Lancaster have heard that as well as you, if he was standing by. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the prosecutor fell down on his knees, said, Lord have mercy, he had a wife and four children begged for mercy, and acknowledged himself guilty. - A. No, he did not acknowledge himself guilty until after the boy had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had paid the money, when there was no occasion, he said he was guilty. Did not the boy go out of doors, to negotiate with Lancaster. - A. Upon my oath I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What share had the boys. - A. A pound each, I cannot say whether it was Tindall or Lancaster that gave it them.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath did not you partake of the five-pound note. - A. No. I will give this information, I did not think it prudent to stop in the watch-house, I stopped long enough to hear the cause, I understood after a day or two my wife went up to Mr. Mills, he gave her ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact you had ten shillings of the plunder. - A. No otherwise than my wife got ten shillings of Mr. Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner receive a one-pound note. - A. Yes, I saw the one-pound note paid in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you in the watchhouse see him paid a one-pound note. - A. I know that Tindall or Lancaster said we must give the boys a one-pound note each.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it given in the watchhouse. - A. Positively I cannot say that. I know that I saw the boys had a one-pound note each, I know that I saw it with the boys at the watchhouse; whether it was given outside of the door, I cannot recollect well to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I ask you upon the oath you have taken, did the prosecutor fall upon his knees in the watch-house and confess himself guilty. - A. Upon my oath he fell upon his knees, and confessed that he had done wrong, and said he was sorry for it, and he know'd that he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Lancaster put his hands into the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket. - A. No, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor.) Is the account that that man has given true or false. - A. False.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you confess that you were guilty. - A. I did not, nor did I implore for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not true that Lancaster put his two hands into your waistcoat pockets. - A. It is true.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Winder. On the 9th of November I was sitting in the parlour at the back of the shop, about one o'clock at noon my mistress told me to run, there was a man going out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your mistress here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body running out of the shop. - A. No. I ran out of the shop, I saw the prisoner running along the court with something under his coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040038"/>I could see a projection from his coat towards his arm; I followed him through another court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he constantly in your sight. - A. Yes, when he came to the corner I lost sight of him. On looking round I perceived him in a passage of a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same man. - A. I am certain it was. I went to him and laid hold of his coat and told him that he had some of our goods, he said that he had no such a thing, he opened his coat for me to search him, I felt about his person, I could find nothing, but on looking round I perceived the shag lying behind the outer door in the inside of the passage, there are two doors, one which is kept back, and one which opens into the tap-room, the shag laid behind the outward door, it laid between the door and the wall, a young man coming out of the tap-room, in my presence, took it up. The landlord of the house came and laid hold of the prisoner, and the young man gave me the shag. I left the shag with the landlord.</p>
               <p>- WADE. I am a clock and watch maker. About three minutes before one o'clock I was in the Black Prince, Chandois Street, in the tap-room. I stood at the front of the window looking into the street, I saw the prisoner run by the window about a yard before I saw the young man, as fast as he could run, he turned himself round, catched hold of the door, and threw himself into the passage of the house where I was. There is a front door, which is generally kept hook'd back, and about two yards there is another door that pulls to and opens with a pulley; and before the prisoner could open the door with the pulley the young man had hold of him and told him he had his master's property, I was about half a yard off, I stooped down and picked it up with my right hand, I asked the young man if that was his stuff, he said yes, it was, the young man took it out of my hand, I directly catched hold of the prisoner by the collar and staid with him twenty minutes in the tap-room, and then he was delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the young man gave the bundle to. - A. To Mr. Sowden, the landlord, he is not here.</p>
               <p>- NETTLETON. I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner, the landlady gave me this property out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Shedel. I saw it picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told me before that it was given into the hands of the landlord, how came it into the hands of the landlady. - A. Because she was in the bar. I am sure it is the same bundle that Wade picked up, I looked at it directly, it had my writing on the ticket, and it is my master's property, I had seen it in the shop about a quarter of an hour before I ran after the prisoner, it was placed in the window as I had put it in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the window as you came along the shop. - A. I did, and there was a vacancy to hold that parcel.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the number and the private mark on that shag, it is part of the goods of my shop, there is three yards of it, it is of the value of twenty-four shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

             was in our service, he came to live with us in the month of May 1805. Cornford continued to live with me till July last, 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was the prisoner entrusted by you and your partner. - A. It was his duty to take care of the cash, make payment of bills drawn upon the house, he had every power that a confidential clerk could have except the endorsement of bills and drawing bills for sale, he could accept a draft drawn upon the house, or draw a bill upon the banker, but he could not draw a bill upon the Bank of England. Messrs. Prescott and Co. were the bankers of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a power over those funds. - A. He had, he had the power to act generally in my absence, according to circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he power to borrow money. - A. Certainly if it was necessary, and he has occasionally done so in my absence, - he kept the cash-ledger, he was entrusted to receive money on the accompt of the house, and he was in possession of the bills of the house and securities, he had the fullest confidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he entrusted to receive all monies, goods, monies, bills, notes, banker's drafts, cash, and every money security. - A. Goods did not come under his notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. What salary did you give him. - A. Three hundred guineas, and it increased to three hundred and fifty guineas before he gave me notice to quit my service. He had permission to join in partnership with his brother in the coal trade, but it was not to take any part of his time under the firm of Thomas and

               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you assist Cornford in carrying on that coal trade by loans of money. - A. I did, I lent him money to join his brother in the coal trade, some few hundred pounds. Afterwards he stated, that Mr. Everett the banker had offered an account in his favour, but he did not know how to keep a balance there, that if I would assist him in a balance of two or three thousand pounds, Mr. Everett would discount bills that I had on hand, provided I kept up such a balance as made it worth their while, I acceded to his proposal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an account of him and his brother in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040039"/>your books. - A. The account was

               <p>Mr. Bolland. At what period was Cornford in the habit of balancing that account. - A. On the 1st of April, he ought to have struck it monthly, that was my order. The book was balanced on the first of April, 1810, at that period the balance was in favour of Thomas and

               <p>Court. With respect to this draft of fifteen hundred pounds, was there any prohibition to his entering it into Mr. Everett's accompt. - A. I was two hundred miles off at the time, there was no prohibition of his increasing his debit, he might have debitted himself ten thousand pounds, but he had not done that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the accompts debitted exceed three thousand pounds. - A. They did not. As soon as I found that he had exceeded the credit that I had allowed him, he left his own house, afraid of the eye of his master, I returned from Lancashire, on the 20th of July, I found that his business had been greatly neglected, and that the cash had not been balanced. On my ordering it to be done, and persevering in it, he retired to his own house on the 24th. At this period this book was looked up, I could not ascertain the extent of the account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discover the charge that you made against Cornford this day. - A. In October, by Cornford's successor examining this book.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the book where this complaint arises, is this Cornford's hand writing. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>(The accompt read).</p>
               <p>Q. You knew nothing of the money except what you heard when you came home. - A. I knew nothing of it except from what I saw in the books, there is fifteen hundred pound as paid to Lion and Earle, they deny ever having received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received this fifteen hundred pounds of Cornford since. - A. I have not, Mr. Hall that succeeded Cornford made the discovery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. When was your banking-house opened for Cornford and Co. - A. I believe in 1808.</p>

               <p>Q. He had a power of taking bills that you held for the purpose of discounting at Everett's house, keeping a proper balance up. - A. He had the power of taking bills and securities for the purpose of discounting at Newman's and Everett's.</p>
               <p>Q. It was convenient to you that this should be done. - A. I conceived it would be some convenience, or else I should not have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have very extensive connections. - A. Certainly, mine are inland bills.</p>
               <p>Q. This transaction happened in July 1810. - A. What transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the draft in question. - A. In July 1810, during the time I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You placed great confidence in him, you left him twenty-seven thousand pounds, with power to borrow upon your correspondents. - A. Yes, he had a general power to that effect, I cannot say what balance I left, I left sufficient for the demands in the house, and so much money in the house, to the amount of twenty-seven thousand pounds, to answer all the demands upon the house during my absence, and I say as a proof of it, I found the debt of Thomas and George Cornford, increased to twenty-seven thousand pounds in my books.</p>

               <p>Court. You say that you had no reason to think that the balance was increased to beyond two, or three, or four thousand pounds. - A. Certainly, I had no reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he permission to use your money, so that you could not say to three or four thousand pounds, where was this license to stop, and which he was never to exceed. - A. There was a sum understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell me what you understood, I must have a positive answer. - A. Three thousand pounds was the outside limit that ever I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that ever mentioned in terms, Mr. Cornford you may apply three thousand pounds and no farther. - A. It was never mentioned.</p>

            . Q. Were you applied to at any time to examine these accompts, and when. - A. In last September.</p>
               <p>Q. Look over that accompt of Lion and Earle in 1810. - A. There is an accompt where they debit in five different sums, they are credited with two, five different sums making six thousand, one hundred and thirty-two pounds, two shillings, and nine pence, as it stands here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that book that you now produce. - A. The cash ledger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The debtor side of Lion and Earle, they are represented in five different sums, debtor to the amount of six thousand one hundred and thirty-two pounds two shillings, and nine pence. - A. It appears so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Sir I ask you in that casting up is there a concealment of fifteen hundred pounds, casting it up fairly, and according to the figures, would it make fifteen hundred pounds more. - A. It would, and on the credit side there are two items that appears six thousand one hundred and thirty two pounds, two shillings and nine pence, the same as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body looking at the face of that balance, it would appear to one who looks no further, that there was no difference between the parties. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But looking minutely, and examining carefully, you find there is a difference of fifteen hundred pounds from the 9th of July to the 21st of July, and the last credit of the 24th of July. - A. On the 10th of July there is fifteen hundred pounds; on the 9th of July two thousand pounds; 13th fourteen hundred and ten pounds, fourteen shillings; 14th, seven hundred and nine pounds, seven shillings and nine-pence; 21st of July, two thousand and twelve pounds, one shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. That is in July 1810. - A. Yes, these are the sums paid. Upon the other side July 7, 1810, six thousand pounds; July 24, one hundred and thirty-two pounds, two shillings and nine pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you sober. - A. I cannot say I was quite sober, but I knew what I was about. When I first saw the prisoner, she was with a man, just turning out of <placeName id="t18111204-52-crimeloc294">Fore Street, into Grub Street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property in his coat or waistcoat. - A. No, I have never been able to recover my property again. When I had hold of the man in the alley, the prisoner had hold of me, and said you bloody thief let him go, or else I'll do you, she followed me into the public-house, and then the constable came in, and she was secured, she was searched, and nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you had been attacked in this way did you perceive your watch in your pocket. - A. Just before I got to Grub Street, I fastened my seal tighter, it was loose, I am quite sure that I had it, because I looked at it. It was a silver watch, it was worth two pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said you were not quite sober, how had you been spending the evening. - A. I was with a groom, we had a drop of rum and water, and half and half, between four or five of us, that was at the watering house in Oxford Road, near Bond Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you go next to drink. - A. I might go into four or five public-houses in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not go into the Old Bailey. - A. I went there after I put my horses up, I went to the Old Bailey before I was robbed, I came through the Old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040041"/>Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to have it understood that you did not stop at any house in the Old Bailey. - A. I stopped with the waterman, and drank nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know a person of the name of Touchey, and you did not drink with any person in the Old Bailey. - A. I drank with a coachman, not with the waterman.</p>
               <p>Court. You positively denied that you drank with any body. Did you drink any liquor in the Old Bailey. - A. We went into the wine vaults just at the corner of the Old Bailey, and had a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. Had you any quarrel with any body at the Old Bailey. - A. Yes, I had a few words with a coachman that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you square with somebody. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, Sir, did not you say two or three days afterwards that you were sorry that you struck the man, but you were so drunk you did not know what you did. - A. No, I said I was sorry I struck him, I was not so much in liquor; he began with me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to Touchey you were sorry that you had struck him, you were so drunk that you did not know that you had struck him. - A. I said I was sorry, I did not know that I had struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not occurred to you that there is a forty pound reward. - A. I have heard that there was for a highway robbery, but not in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you indicted this woman for. - A. For throtling of me, and ill-using me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you have indicted her for a highway robbery. - A. Of course, it was in the street, it was in the highway.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know it is a highway robbery; do not you expect a forty pound reward. - A. I expect nothing at all.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to my father, at the corner of White Street, Little Moorfields. On the evening of the 6th of December I was in my father's shop, I heard the cry of stop thief. I went out and saw the prosecutor had hold of a man, he said he had robbed him of his watch, and I saw the shape of a watch in the man's fob, with whom the prosecutor was wrestling; the prisoner tried to get the man away from the prosecutor, she said let him go, or I'll serve you out, she tried to rescue the man away, the prosecutor conveyed the man into a public-house, I went with him, the prisoner followed, there was a scuffle in the public-house, the people were urging them on to fight, the man said he had not got the watch, the prosecutor said the man had knocked him down by Honey-suckle court, and robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the man not to be secured. - A. There was a set of people in the public-house that seemed to take his part, they made a sort of a lane for him to pass by, he pulled off his coat and waistcoat, to make a shew of being searched, there was a cry of bolt, the man ran away, leaving his coat, waistcoat, and hat behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman in the tap-room all the time. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an hackney coachman. This day three weeks I drank with Dukeson the prosecutor in the Old Bailey, we had a glass of gin each, there were four of us, he was very much intoxicated, indeed he was very riotous there, he hit one man on the mouth, and made his mouth bleed; a bill sticker came by, he began sparring with him, this was about two o'clock in the afternoon, and between four or five I saw him at the coach rank in Aldersgate Street, he was so drunk that he reeled from one side of the pavement to the other, he was by himself. About three days after I met him at the watering-house at Aldersgate Street, I said to him, you are a pretty sort of a fellow any how, you was beastly drunk in the Old Bailey, when you beat the man; he said, I wish to see him, to give him something to drink, to make it up with me, I told him he used him very ill indeed, I said, if it was me I should not have put up with it as he did.</p>

            . I am a constable, I was standing at my door, the prisoner was leaning against the railing, I asked him what he wanted there, he said he was in great distress, he said he came from Hereford, or was going there, I cannot say which; it was about seven o'clock in the evening, I thought him to be a suspicious character, I was determined to follow him, I saw him go into Mr. Draper's house, I beckoned to a person that I supposed to be the landlady, and by the time I spoke he came out with the box coat on his arm, I asked him whose coat it was, he said it was his own, the sheets were wrapped up in the coat, they were quite warm then. I took him to the watchouse, I found half a twopenny loaf in his pocket, and four pennyworth of halfpence, in his waistcoat pocket I found three shillings and six-pence in silver. When he got to Marlborough Street office, he was known by the name of Johnson.</p>

            . I am an hair-dresser, I live with Mrs. Chapple, she disposed of a lead cistern to Mr. Robinson, I saw the lead weighed at Mr. Robinson's, the weight was three quarters and nine pound, I went back and told Mrs. Chapman the weight, she told me to see it weighed again, it was weighed again, and it was the same weight, I told the man that weighed it, here is not all, here is a part cut away, I told Mr. Robinson that there was not the weight that it ought to be, Mr. Robinson had it measured, and there appeared a great deficiency, Mr. Robinson told me to come at two o'clock, and then the men would be come from dinner; I went at two o'clock, Rhodes and Croft were present, Mr. Robinson then asked them if three quarters and nine pound was the weight of the lead, they said that was all, Mr. Robinson said he doubted that was not all, they had taken part away, the said no they had not, Mr. Robinson said he thought they had taken it to Ferritt's a house, that buys and sells lead, they said no, Mr. Robinson said I am certain it is not all, what is become of it, they said if it was not all, they must have left the remaining part in Mrs. Chapple's cellar, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040043"/>Robinson said go and fetch it, Rhodes accordingly went I went after him, I believe he did not see me, and instead of going to our house he went up Orchard street, down Somerset-street, along Duke-street, into Oxford-street, then down James street, to where he lodged, at Mr. Ferritt's house; I then went back and informed Mr. Robinson where he was gone to, Mr. Robinson requested I would go back and see if he came out of Ferritt's house, I then went back and met him crossing North Audley Street, with the lead under his arm, I followed him in, I heard Mr. Robinson say something to him, he answered, that he had fetched it from a public-house, where he had left it for liquor. The weight of the lead that he brought back was thirty pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. My house is three doors from Orchard Street, five doors from Mrs. Chapple's house. Rhodes brought back thirty-pound of lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who were the two persons that fetched the lead from Mrs. Chapple's. - A. The prisoners told me they had, and that three quarters and nine pound was the whole of the weight, they were the only men doing that work, I examined the lead that Rhodes brought back, it made out the entire cistern, the value of the lead is five shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence, called one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

On the 3d of this month, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came into my house, she called for a pint of beer, she sat drinking it a considerable time, I was busy in the bar, a soldier who is quartered on me saw her go into the kitchen, when she came out he asked her what business she had there, she said that she had dropped an eighteen-penny piece, and the servant had given it her, she went and sat down in the tap-room, the soldier told me that she had got something, I asked the prisoner what she had got, she said nothing, I went and looked in the kitchen, I missed a large china disk, I found the dish in a child's frock, pinned under her petticoats. This is the dish, I put the dish on the tap-room table, I asked her whose it was, she said it was hers. I swear it is my own.</p>

            . I am a watchman, Mr. Wootton's yard is in my beat. On the 12th of November, about half past five I was crying the hour; I tried the wicket of Mr. Wootton's gate, it was fast then; I went on to the further end of Cock-lane; I returned; before I came to Mr. Wootton's yard the prisoner passed me with the harness; it was not light then; I had suspicion that it was stolen; I did not stop him then, I went to Mr. Wootton's gate, I found the wicket open, that made my suspicion stronger; I went after the prisoner, I overtook him by the Saracen's Head in Skinner-street, I asked him where he was going with the harness, he told me to his master's house; I asked him where he had brought the harness from; he said, from the other side of Smithfield. I told him I must detain him and take him to the watchhouse; he said he would give me the harness if I would let him go. I took him to the watch-house and went to Mr. Wootton, he came and claimed the harness.</p>

               <p>- WORRALL. I was constable of the night. I searched the prisoner, I found the long rein and the kicking strap in his pockets. I produce the harness.</p>

On my going home four or five men rushed upon me and knocked me down; they struck me and tripped me up and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this happened had you any watch about you - A. Yes, I am certain I had my watch, and I felt them draw my watch out of my pocket. They took it away from me when I was upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in any of the shops when you were knocked down - A. No, the shops were shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it, dark or light - A. It was not very dark nor yet very light, there was the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the face of any of the persons - A. Yes, I did notice the faces when I was laying upon my back. When they took the watch from me I noticed some of them so that I thought I should know them again. They ran off immediately they had got my watch.

               <p>Q. When they had got your watch and was running away did you give any alarm - A. I called out watch, but no watch came. By the fall I was very much hurt; my head was very much cut behind.</p>

I went and gave information the next morning at Hatton Garden, that was the Sunday. Then on the Monday evening there were three taken up. I saw the three persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the three persons that are now in custody - A. No, not that night. One of them was set at liberty; two of the prisoners were part of those three that were taken up, their names are

When I saw him in Brooks Market, without any hint from Cook I said he was one of the party. I am quite sure as to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You now upon your oath declare that he was one of the party that robbed you this evening - A. I do. I cannot say who took the watch away from me, I speak with positive certainty that he was one of the party.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On Sunday the 27th of October, in the morning part, I received information from the prosecutor that he had been robbed; he described the persons to the best of his recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to describe their dress at all - A. The jacket of one; he said one had a jacket on; he did not describe the colour of the jacket; he said there were two or three short ones, but one was much taller than any of the rest. In consequence of that I went up Holborn, on the Monday night, on my going up Holborn, I saw Parker and Brooks, and a chap of the name of Hindes, all in company together about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the persons of Parker and Brooks before - A. Yes. I took all three to the office, I informed them afterwards what I took them for; they said they knew nothing of it. The third man was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prosecutor say when he first saw these two men - A. He said he thought they were two of the party which were concerned in the robbery; those are his exact words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search them - A. I did; I found nothing upon Brooks, upon Parker a little knife, but no money upon either of them. I apprehended Williams the tall man about twelve o'clock at night on the Wednesday following, I was in company with the prosecutor; we were going through Brook's Market into Holborn, we met the prisoner Williams and the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner Williams's person - A. When I got him in the public-house I did, not before; the prosecutor knew his person, and when I got him to the light I knew his person.</p>
               <p>Q. On meeting him did you say anything to the prosecutor - A. No, I did not. The prosecutor said that is the man that knocked me down and took my watch away, upon which I took hold of him immediately, and the girl too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear the prosecutor say this is the man that knocked me down - A. There is no doubt but he might have heard it; the prisoner said he was wrong, for he was not in Holborn at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor mention then what time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the night of the Saturday preceding the Wednesday - A. Yes; it was not very light. I took the prisoner Williams to the watch-house and searched him, I found two old silk handkerchiefs upon him. I have never been able to trace the watch. When I got him to the watchhouse I let the woman go upon her own word to appear again. In the morning I went to the watchhouse to take out the prisoner, and when I came there he had broken out of the watchhouse and made his escape; he broke open both the watchhouse doors. I found that by the watchhouse-keeper, and I saw the marks of violence upon the doors.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. About twelve o'clock on the Thursday night in Brook's-street; I first had taken the girl that did not come according to her word; I saw him in Brook's-street with three or four girls, one of the girls said, here is that bloody trap; I went round the corner and took him immediately; I said you shall not run away again. Read, my brother officer was just by me then; I took him to the new watchhouse, and he was afterwards committed.</p>
               <p>Williams. There was an Irishman in the watch-house, he broke out.</p>
               <p>Cook. The Irishman was taken up for being tipsey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040047"/>to be there till the morning till he could sober himself, he was very much intoxicated. I did not see him, they told me he was very much intoxicated, he was put backwards in the hold.</p>
               <p>Brooks I will ask the prosecutor whether he did not say at Hatton Garden that he could not swear to either of us two, Parker and me - COURT. He said now he is not certain.</p>
               <p>Brooks. He said the first day he did not think we were the men, but on the Monday he said he thought we were.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said I believed they were two of the party; I said, I could not swear positively to them, but I believed them to be two of the party. I never went so far as to say they were not of the party.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. I was with Cook on the Thursday night when he apprehended Williams the second time; I asked Williams how he came to break out of the watchhouse; he told me there was a man there, he persuaded him to break open the place and make his escape out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the state of the watchhouse - A. No, I did not. I questioned Williams a little further, he said he could bring people forward to prove he was elsewhere at the time the robbery was committed, that he was at a public-house; I told him he had better do it. He never did at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fox. What was the value of this watch - A. It cost me five pounds; it was a very good one; I would not have taken seven pound for it.</p>
               <p>Williams' Defence. I was not out in Holborn at that time I was in Brook's Market at the Compasses drinking with my shopmates until one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Fox. What time was it when you got home - A. I think it was a little before twelve o'clock when I got home.</p>
               <p>Parker's Defence. I can take my oath I never saw the prosecutor nor yet Williams that night.</p>
               <p>Brook's Defence. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>COURT. What do you mean by nothing more - A. No more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said nothing, do you mean to say you have nothing more to say than you are innocent of the charge - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Williams called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

In consequence of that I had suspicion of him; he ran and looked in to Mr. Treasure's shop, he went into the passage, the street door was open, the shop door was in the passage; I saw him go into the shop and take the quartern loaves from the window; I looked through the window, I saw him take one first; he shook his head and laughed, as if he had done it snug without their seeing him, and then he took the other and came into the passage; I met him in the passage and collared him with the loaves in his hand, and then I called out to Mr. Treasure; I asked the prisoner if he did it for want I would let him go; he made no answer. I said, it does not appear that you did it for want, and then I halloaed out.</p>

On the 4th of December the prisoner came in the shop in company with another woman, I served her; she asked to look at some mazacine sarcenet; I shewed two pieces of sarcenet, she bought an eighth of a yard, it came to eight-pence, she paid me for it; there was no person in the shop but me and the woman and a carpenter that worked at the bottom of the shop, he was at work, he had no concern with the business of the shop; there was no one serving in the shop but myself that night. After she had bought the eighth of a yard the two pieces of sarcenet were left on the counter, the prisoner and her companion both asked me to let them look at some white sarcenet; I had to fetch the sarcenet four yards from them, and had to turn my back on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they converse together all the while they were in the shop - A. Yes. I got the white sarcenet for the other lady, she took a quarter of a yard and paid me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other customer in the shop while these two women were there - A. No, there was not. After she had paid for the white sarcenet the prisoner passed the other woman and they went out together, only the prisoner went out first. I did not perceive that any thing was taken by the prisoner or that any thing was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. A quarter before five, after the candles were lit. In about ten minutes afterwards Lee the officer brought the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have no doubt of the person of the prisoner - A. No doubt at all. She pulled off her bonnet in the shop; I am confident to her person. When Lee came in the shop he asked me if I had lost any thing. I told him not that I knew of; he produced a piece of silk that he took from under his coat; I knew the piece of silk, it stood near half a yard from where I was serving the prisoner within her reach; it was twilled sarcenet, I had not shewn that to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the constable say that he had found that piece of silk - A. He said he had taken it from the prisoner's clothes; I believe she said, for God's sake let me go and take the piece of silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity of the silk - A. Fifty-four yards, worth fifteen pounds, it cost us that; I am sure that piece was on the counter, within half a yard of her when she was served by me this small quantity of silk. The other woman I have not seen since.</p>

            . I am constable and street keeper of Holborn. On the 4th of December, about a quarter before five I saw the prisoner and another woman go into Mr. Compigne's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her person - A. I did, and the persons of them both. In consequence of their going into the shop I placed myself behind a coach to observe their conduct; I observed them both come out of the shop, the prisoner came out first.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lamplew. The other shopman was not in the shop nor the master were they - A. No, the other shopman was in the accompting-house with his back to the shop; it is in a back-room adjoining the shop, he was writing at the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came in, at that part of the accompting-house could he observe the prisoner at all - A. It was not in his view at all.</p>

               <p>Q. to Lee. You said both of them came out of the shop, and the prisoner came out first - A. Yes. As soon as they had shut the door they turned on the left up Holborn, and I observed the prisoner had got something by the aukwardness of her walk. I followed them nine doors, they turned about four yards up King's Head-court, both together. I then observed the prisoner endeavouring to take something from under her clothes; she had got a brown great coat on over her clothes; she was stooping and taking it from under her clothes; her back was towards me; I saw her pulling it out of the lower part of her dress, under her coat. As soon as she had got it under her coat she turned to the right, and I believe she then saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that she knew you, and what you were - A. Yes, I am certain of that. She passed me quick, and ran across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to occasion her to run - A. No. I thought of laying hold of them both; I pursued her, and as soon as she got her foot on the curb on the opposite side of the street, I caught hold of her coat, and felt the roll inside; I then said, holloa, what have you got here; she said, take it, Lee, for God's sake, and let me go; I said, you shall go back to where you had it from. I took the roll of silk from under her coat, and put it under my coat. I took her and the silk to Mr. Compigne's. The other woman ran up King's Head-court, it is a passage into Fetter-lane; I have not seen the other woman since. When I took the prisoner into Mr. Compigne's shop the last witness was at the left hand counter, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040049"/>other gentleman at the right-hand counter; I asked the last witness if he had lost any thing; he answered, not that he knew; I asked the next witness, neither of them knew anything was gone. I then took her into the accompting-house at the back of the shop and produced the silk; the silk was claimed as Mr. Compigne's. I then searched the prisoner, in her left hand pocket I found these two pieces of sarcenet rolled in that paper; I have kept the roll of sarcenet ever since, and likewise the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lamplew. Look at that roll of sarcenet, are you quite sure that it is Mr. Compigne's - A. I am certain of it, and it was on the counter when I was serving of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper which Lee said he took out of her pocket - A. These are the two pieces that they bought of me when they were in the shop, I put them in that paper and the prisoner took them away. This roll of sarcenet is worth fifteen pounds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the gentleman's shop to purchase a bit of silk, the young woman was in the shop before I went in, and came out before me, and when I came out she said, young woman lay hold of this while I tie my stocking; she crossed the way and I crossed after her, when I was immediately taken into custody.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Flemming. No. 90, Newgate-street. On the 21st of November the prisoner offered this watch to pawn, he put it on the counter and desired to have fifteen shillings. In consequence of a bill I thought it had not been honestly come by; I opened the watch and perceived it had the name and number described in the bill; I questioned him as to where he got the watch; he told me that he bought it at a silversmiths in Middle-row, Holborn; I asked him if he had got the bill of what he gave for it; he told me he had not, his name was Mr. Peters, that he lived at Hampstead. I informed Mr. Flemming my suspicion, he came into the shop and spoke to him, an officer was sent for and he was secured. The watch was afterwards owned by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that the watch that you missed - A. Yes, it is the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen of the jury, I am in duty bound to state my case to you; my case is of that peculiar nature that I think myself justifiable in stating the facts to you. On the 21st of November, being a little necessiated, I went to Mr. Fleming to pawn the watch; on Thursday I was taken to Guildhall, where I was remanded till the 29th of November, and was then committed for trial. After I was committed to trial and my own father bound over to prosecute, I asked Mr. Teague, the keeper of the counter, whether I was not at liberty to see any one that I thought proper; he answered that it was even ordered that my wife should not see me; I asked him if I might write to any attorney; the question was answered by Mr. Teague, no, he had given orders that neither pen, ink, and paper should be allowed me, nor even my own wife to come to see me. I was brought to Newgate and close confined, not having the opportunity of sending to those friends who might have afforded me assistance in the present misfortune.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will excuse the impression it makes on my mind, and as men of feeling I hope you will consider my case. Gentlemen, provided I had the opportunity of seeing my wife I might have had counsel to plead in my behalf, that might have got me out of this snare, which may deprive me of living in my native country. Gentlemen, so far from stealing the watch I swear by heaven I never stole the watch. I bought the watch in question. If I had known the watch to have been stolen was it likely that I should have gone to the pawnbrokers to have offered it to pawn? When Mr. Flemming accused me of stealing the watch I never offered to run away, nor did even guilt or suspicion come in my face. But, to cut it short, provided I am found guilty though it cannot touch my life, it will send me out of the country; it will gratify the wishes of them that wish me out of the country. I actually did buy the watch, but you may naturally say, why do not you produce the man that you bought it of. When a man is denied of seeing his own wife how is he to get people to come forward. Gentlemen, look at the question exactly as it is. If I am found guilty I must be sent out of the country. If I had time I could bring the parties that I bought the watch of, but during the time I have been in Newgate I have been deprived of seeing any one, and have had no more than the allowance of bread and water. Gentlemen, look in my case and say, whether you think I stole the watch. There is no proof that I stole the watch; the only question is, whether I bought the watch knowing it to be stolen. I bought the watch, I did not know it was stolen. The way that I came to pawn the watch I had a watch in my pocket, I gave that watch to my wife. Gentlemen, if I had known the watch to have been stolen should not I have given my wife this, and not myself have gone to pledge it. I do not wish to speak to you in this way on purpose to bias your minds, but if you do not think me guilty there is no proof of my stealing the watch; the only proof is finding the watch in my possession. Gentlemen, I know no more of stealing the watch than a child unborn. If you think I did steal the watch you will find me guilty, but as men of feeling, if you feel this as I do, you will give me that verdict upon which you can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040050"/>test your minds hereafter.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 19th of November, about seven o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Benjamin with this basket of soap on his shoulder, he was in Harrow-alley, from Petticoat lane it leads into Cutler-street; I asked what he had got there, he said it was soap, he had brought it from home from the bottom of Primrose-street, Bishopsgate-street, he told me he got the soap from a man to sell for him, he would shew me where the man was. I secured the soap and Benjamin took me into an alley at the bottom of Primrose-street, up one pair of stairs; Diffner was sitting there, and a woman and child in Benjamin's house; Benjamin pointed to him. Diffner jumped off the chair and said, good God, I thought you would not do so, or betray me. I asked Diffner in Benjamin's hearing how or in what manner he came by the soap; Benjamin said he had it of him. Diffner was in such a flurry he made no reply. Diffner said he worked at a sugar bakers. I took him down stairs. Going along he told me that he was a <rs id="t18111204-71-deflabel408" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Montague. After the prisoner was apprehended I went to him, I said it was a shocking thing; he said nobody else was concerned in it, he took it himself; that the man who locks up the soap-bin had left the key on a bench in the soap-house, near to the copper, and was going to wash himself. Diffner said, I want that key to get the saw to saw some wood for the house, and that he had take about a dozen pieces of mottled soap; the soap has no mark upon it; it is not perfectly boiled mottled soap, it answers to what we were possessed of. The basket that the soap was in is mine.</p>
               <p>Diffner's Defence. I told Mr. Eames that I found it as I went through Smithfield, I took it up, and in Long-lane John Benjamin came up to me, he had a knot; I said I found a parcel, he said come along with me and we found it was soap.</p>
               <p>Benjamin said nothing in his defence.</p>

            . Forrester and I were going on the 26th of November, we stopped the prisoner in Cutler-street; I said, you have got a log of wood; he said, yes. I took him under is lamp, it turned out to be a ream of paper; I asked him who he was; he said he should not satisfy me; he said a person had given him the paper in the street. I then lodged him in the Poultry Compter, and left the paper with the ward beadle. I have the paper here. I got information that the paper belonged to the prosecutor, and the prisoner was his porter. I searched the prisoners lodgings. The prisoner confessed that he had robbed his master of several reams of paper off his master's pile, but another man had led him into it.</p>

               <p>The learned Judge in pronouncing Smith's case to be a gross libel, and then said relief might be had if I could shew you, upon your oath, a deviation from truth. That I shall be able to do so, is unquestionable; you can best explain your motive. I assure you the mode pointed out is one way of shewing. It will be painful to me as affecting you. I have my character at stake, which must prompt me to this step, perhaps at the immediate juncture of making the statement that Smith was drunk you will avail yourself of an opportunity of correcting that, if so, you will find me at Westminster this day Your oath was in direct contradiction to what you have declared to persons of great respectability. All this intimation is given you that you may take an early opportunity to retract, by correcting yourself: or in the other instance, manfully avowing that which you have sworn is correct.</p>
