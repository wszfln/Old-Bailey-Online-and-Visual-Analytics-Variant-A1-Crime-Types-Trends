[the Prosecutor in the former Trial] As to the Knowledge of the Person, I cannot say any Thing ; I was coming by Mr Demee's Door, and saw a Fellow trailing a Piece of Check Linnen; says I, to the Person at the Door, Look after that Piece of Check Linnen, it is trailing along the Ground; he could not draw it in so fast, but some of it trailed after him, I believe about two Yards; - I think I remember it again; for I saw the Piece of Linnen afterwards in the Middle of Duke's-Place, upon the Ground; said I to a Man, take up the Piece of Linnen and the Hat, and I will shew you the Shop where the Linnen was taken from; I went to the Shop and delivered the Piece and the Hat into the Shop, - I believe it to be the Piece, and the Hat is like that which was delivered into the Shop.</p>

I met the Prisoner with a Piece of Linnen, dragging along the Ground, just by Mr Salter's Shop, within two Doors of Mr Demee's. - I am sure that is the Man, and that is the Linnen: One End was under his Arm, and the other dragging upon the Ground, when they cry'd out stop Thief: I had like to have run over a Girl, or I had taken it from under his Arm: He threw the Check down; I said to a Gentleman, Take Care of the Check; and I ran after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mind what you are upon, young Man: I am as innocent as the Child unborn.</p>
               <p>Paget. I am sure he flung the Check from him: then I ran after him, and in about two or three Minutes I took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One hit me, and another hit me. I am an innocent Man. Ask him if he saw me with it under my Arm?</p>
               <p>Paget . I am sure he is the Person that had the Check under his Arm.</p>

            . Mrs Gilbert , about the Time she speaks of, went down into the Necessary-Place, and came up very much frightened, and said she saw a Bundle of Linnen in the Vault (which is a Common-Sewer) endeavoured to be push'd into a Hole. She acquainted me with it: I let it lie that Night. Next Day I called to a Neighbour, and got a Pair of Tongs and took it out of the Vault. I pulled off one Linnen and then another, and discovered a Child's Hand and Arm. I was very much frightened, and went to a Justice of the Peace, to know what to do (for I did not know the Nature of the Affair) he ordered me to go to the Coroner. - It was discovered on Sunday Night between seven and eight o'Clock, but I did not take it out till Monday the 11th of October. It was a Male Child. When it was wash'd I laid it on a Table, in a convenient Place for the Jury to examine it. - There were no Marks of Violence upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon viewing the Child, how do you think it came by its Death?</p>
               <p>Tullock . I cannot say indeed.</p>

               <p>Tullock. There were some Things provided for the Child.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know she was the Mother of the Child?</p>
               <p>Tullock. No. - It is my Opinion the Child came to its full Time, but the poor Creature was ignorant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there was any Miscarriage?</p>
               <p>Tullock. I cannot be sure whether the Mother of the Child went her full Time. - I believe she might come pretty near to the Time. - She owned herself to be the Mother of the Child.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say with Respect to the Death of the Child?</p>
               <p>Tullock. She said she was delivered of a dead Child, and that she did not think herself in Labour. - I believe the Child was born at a Relation's of her's in Piccadilly, at her Brother's; she was Serant there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you whether there was any Midwife attended on the Occasion.</p>
               <p>Tullock . She did not tell me that; but she told me the Child was carried and put into a Vault, to avoid her Shame. I asked her, if she had any Thing prepared for the Infant, and she said Yes; - It was after she was in Custody that she told me this; she said she had provided Things for the Child, and that they were in a Closet in the Room where she lay at her Brother's; and I went and found all the Things there as she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Closet locked?</p>

As she is a young Body, and an ignorant Person, I hope the Court will take it into Consideration. She always behav'd well; I never saw her concerned in Liquor all the while she liv'd with me. I knew no more of this Affair than the Child unborn.</p>

             . I was at a Neighbour's House, and heard Mrs Hodges cry out Stop Thief! Stop Thief! and running down the Gateway, I saw her have hold of a Man; she asked me to lay hold of him too, which I did, and we brought him back to her House. I saw these two Knives and this Chissel taken out of his Pocket. - I saw a Dark-Lanthorn there.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with a Dark-Lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not know any thing of a Dark-Lanthorn. As I was going along, a Person shov'd me down; I could not recover my self: Said that Gentlewoman, What, have I caught you? Why, what have I done? said I. I know what you have done, said she; so she charged another Man or two with me. I went with them very quietly: She said I broke into her House; but I am sure I never was in her House, as God is my Judge.</p>

I am the Father of the Prisoner; he has liv'd and work'd with me from his Infancy, till within these Twelve Months, when he married, and then he went to work at his own Home, which he did till this unhappy Affair; he was to come and work with me, and came to borrow a Hammer and Chissel to take down his Loom: He is an honest Creature, and never was stained with any ill Character before. When he was before the Alderman I was with him, and the Prosecutrix made an Affidavit, that this Dark-Lanthorn was found upon him, and afterwards she said it was found in the House. Said the Alderman, I thought you said the Dark-Lanthorn was found upon him. No, said she then, it was found in the House. When a Person is upon Oath, they ought to be very careful.</p>

This young Man is my Kinsman: He said to me one Day, as I was going Home from the India House, that he had something to tell me. Says he, I have lost my Watch. I hope not, said I: Where did you lose it? Said he, I met a Woman in Bishopsgate-street, and went through Devonshire-Square, and went into a House with her, where there was another Woman; we all three lay down upon the Bed together, and I lay between the two Women when I was robb'd. We went into several Houses in order to find them, but could not: We happened to meet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080012"/> with the Husband that it was pretended she was married to with the Money she made of the Watch, and he went with us for the Sake of a Crown to betray her: We found her, and promis'd her, if she would tell us where the Watch was, we would show her Mercy, as far as it was in our Power.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that promis'd her Mercy?</p>
               <p>Jones. Both my Kinsman and I did: We went with her to the Three Kings in the Minories: She denied it for a long Time, but at last own'd that she took it from under the Bolster, and had sold or pawn'd it for 22 s. 6 d. I took two Men and a Constable, and went to the House where she said it was sold, and staid till ten o'Clock at Night, and could not find the People. We carried her before Alderman Bernard, and she confessed before him, that she sold it for 22 s. 6 d. and he committed her to Newgate. We went to a House where there sat an old Woman, which by the Description we had of her, was the Person she had sold it to. Do you sell a Dram? said I. She said, Yes. So we had a Quartern of Gin. Said I, I come to enquire after a Watch that is pawn'd here, and I am credibly informed, by one that is in Prison, that you have it; and if you do not return it, there is a Constable just by, and you shall go too. Said my Cousin, before I was aware, if you will let me have the Watch, I will give you the 22 s. 6 d. that you gave for it. Said she, I believe I can help you to it, but I have it not in the House. I went to an Alehouse at next Door, to enquire after this Woman's Character, and told the Woman the Story. Said she, if she promis'd to get it for you again, you will be sure of having it; and the Woman of the Alehouse lent me 22 s. 6 d. to pay for the Watch; there was a little Girl came to me, and gave me a Tap on the Back, and bid me come along with her. She led me into a narrow Passage in Rag-Fair, and bid me a good Night, and in that narrow Passage, I had the Watch put into my Hand; but who gave it me, I cannot tell, whether it was a Man or a Woman; the Person put a

Last Saturday was se'nnight , the Prisoner went up Stairs into my Room, and took a Sheet off the Bed; a Woman in the next House saw her come down; and before she went out of the House, I took them out of her Lap. She could not deny the Fact, and said, she would give me a Quartern of Gin if I would take my Things again; but I would not. - The Sheet is not mine, it is my Landlord's. <rs id="t17421208-22-verdict124" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Eckley.

I told her I had a Velvet Mantelet, but I had it not about me then; she bid me fetch it; I said, I had several other Things; so she bid me come the next Morning, and she would Bargain with us: I went the next Morning and she bought them. - I sold the Shoes and the Mantelet over Night.</p>

She said no , she took in no Pawns, but if he would sell them , she would buy them. - There seemed to be some odd Pieces of black Silk, some Gloves, and a Pair of yellow Damask Shoes.</p>

               <p>Rhodes .

I seized him, - he fell into my Hands with a great deal of Easiness; he made no Opposition. but said, he would submit to me; and as there was no Watchman came immediately to me, I desired some Gentlemen to help me to hold him, and I held him, by their Assistance, till Mrs Squire came up; she said, she had been robbed, and that she was very positive that the Prisoner was the Man ; I bid her look in his Face, and see if he was the Man; she said, she was positive he was the Man that robbed her; Mr Huggins the Constable, searched him; but the Prisoner did not give any Account how he came by the Pocket that was found upon him: - He said he would submit, these were his very Words . Mrs Squire was very faint when she came up, and was very confident that he was the Man; there was one Mrs Langley's Pocket found in the Place where he robbed Mrs Squire</p>

            . On the 15th of October, between Nine and Ten in the Evening, I heard a Cry of Stop Thief; I perceived a Man running, and was waiting for him; I stood looking on both Sides of the Way, for I could hear the Tread as he came along; when he came pretty near me, I caught hold of his Coat; the Cry was Stop Thief, Stop Soldier, there was no Body pursued him, and no Body but he and I in the Street, as I could see: He slipped out of my Hand, and the Watchman coming along, got hold of him; when the Watchman had hold of him, I went to the Prosecutrix, and brought her to the Prison . - I was the first Person that laid hold of him. - it was neither Dark nor Light; it was a Starlight Night. - I found out the Woman that owned this Pocket, which was found upon him, by advertising it; but she is since absconded.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence, said, On Friday Night I was in Liquor, and quarrelled with a Man, and in that Quarrel I lost my Hat; coming along the Street, I heard a Cry of Stop Thief, and I said, where, where? and in running along, I met that Man, and he took me hold by the Collar, and let me go again; and presently this Watchman took hold of me; then I said to him, keep me if you will , for I have done nothing, for I knew myself innocent; then they searched me, and said, here is a Pocket. Ask them, whether I did not bid you shew it to the Woman, and said, if she had a Right to it, I would suffer Death; and the Woman still insisting upon it, that it was a Soldier who robbed her , and because there was ne'er another Soldier in the Street, it must be me.</p>

            . [Call'd by the Prisoner.] I believe I can contradict what has been said in Court, for I was the Person that took him. - I serve one Mr Swinney , belonging to the Custom-House: I was going to my Master's Duty about ten Minutes after Nine, in the Evening on the 15th of October, I heard some People cry out stop Thief, and I cry'd out stop Thief: There was a Woman before me, and she jump'd up upon a Door-way, and the Prisoner came running along, and ran against me; and as the Gentleman, the Prisoner at the Bar, came running against me, he hit his Foot against a Stone, and fell down about five Yards from me: Then I cry'd out, who calls stop Thief? but no body answered. I called out again, who calls stop Thief? still no body answered. This Person, the Prisoner at the Bar, lay still, and did not offer to stir: I said, if he offered to stir a Foot further I would knock him down; for as there was a Cry of stop Thief, I believed he was the Thief. He put his Hands in this Manner in his Bosom, and did not offer to move. I called out again, who calls stop Thief? and no Answer was made; presently there came up three People: I asked what's the Matter; they cry'd out stop Thief , and so did I; then the Prisoner came running against me; I took hold of him, believing he might be the Thief. Damn you says he, let me go: He was gone about four or five Yards from me, then they cry'd out stop Thief, Soldier: Then said I, do not let him go: Then some body took hold of him before I did the second Time; then I called out for a Watchman, and desired him to come and take Charge of him; he refus'd it: There came a Man running up, and asked where he was? Said I, do not hurry your self, for here he is safe: Then there came a Man with a Napkin Cap tied about his Head, and said, I believe that is the Man. I said again to the Watchman, now will you take Charge of him; which he refused, then said I, damn him. let him go; but when Mrs Squire came up, she said, that is the Man that knock'd me down, and took my Pocket from me. Now said I to the Watchman, will you take Charge of him, and then he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any Reason why he should's the Person?</p>
               <p>Massey . No: but when she said he was the Person , I said, if he went any further I would knock him down.</p>

            . The Prisoner is my Apprentice; the Witness goes of Errands; he is, what some call, a Slave. On Tuesday the 30th of November, I was out; the Prisoner at the Bar, said to his Mistress, I will stay up for my Master: No Tom, said she, I will stay up, you may go to Bed; she sat up for me: I came Home about eleven o'Clock, and sat down by the Fire talking with my Wife; said she, Mr Greener, do you hear how the Bed cracks? I said, It is an old Bedstead, and they are subject to crack. In about a Quarter of an Hour, the Bed made the same Noise again. Now, said she, Do not you hear it. Yes, said I, I do. Then, said she, Go and enquire what is the Reason of it. I did not go directly; then, said she, If you will not go , I will. Accordingly she went. - I know no more of the Affair, but what she told me; but I heard no more Noise of the Bed after.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you bring your Wife?</p>
               <p>Greener. I might have brought her, but she is not very well, and out of Modesty, she did not care to come.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it this Witness told you of the Fact?</p>
               <p>Greener. Not at all; he told no Body of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this Man to be taken up? You can tell that without telling what your Wife said.</p>
               <p>Greener. I knew nothing of it 'till the 30th of November. Prior has been turned over to me about eleven Months; he behaved very well till about Michaelmas last, and then I found he was got acquainted with a Gang of young Wenches; he did not neglect my Business till the Princess's Birth-Day . <rs id="t17421208-25-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

            . I came Home in the Queen Caroline from the East-Indies , the 1st of October, and my Mother died the 5th. I had been informed that the Prisoner had wronged my Mother very much, and was advised to look into it. I said to her, Mrs Murphey, you have wronged my Mother of a great many Things, as I have been informed: After some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080020"/> Conversation, she owned, she had pawned some trifling Things, particularly one Pair of Sheets, and a Couple of Aprons; said I, Mrs Murphy deal ingenuously with me, and I will not trouble you: She said, she would deal no otherwise with me: but every Time I saw her, she always told me of more and more, so that I thought she only deceived me: I was advised by my Mother's Friends to prosecute her, and they told me, if I did not, they would never regard me, while they lived. I delayed prosecuting her, thinking she would tell me where the Things were; but I found she would not, so I commenced this Prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you promise her over and over again, that you would not prosecute her, if she would be ingenuous?</p>
               <p>Spicer. I promised her so; but she never would be ingenuous. I went to Mr Kates a Pawnbroker, and enquired for such and such Things; and the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, were brought down to me; they were pawned in her Name; as to the Tooth-pick-Case, I can swear to that: I know the Mark of her Linnen, it was always marked with an (S) in White. There is no Mark upon this Case, but I know it by a little Bruise there is in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your's?</p>
               <p>Spicer. It was mine originally, but I left it with my Mother when I went to Sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give it your Mother?</p>
               <p>Spicer. I gave it to my Mother before I went to India. <rs id="t17421208-30-verdict163" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live at the Horns, in St John-Street ; The latter End of October, or the Beginning of November, the Prisoner at the Bar came to my House one Evening, with a large Pottage-pot, (I thought to leave it there, as there is most commonly a great many Goods left at my House) very much fuddled; Landlord, said she, my Mother is lately dead at Highgate, and I have a Mind to change this Pot for a smaller one. No, said I, I do not Care to do it; She said, I must have Money to Night. I said, Be persuaded by me, and leave it till To-morrow and consider of it. And with great Persuasion, I prevail'd on her so to do; she desired to have some Money upon it, which I let her have, I think it was six or seven Shillings: One Day, this Mrs Tipler came in; said she, Do you know any Thing of a Pottage-pot being left here for me? I told her it was in the Kitchen: Mrs Tipler went into the Kitchen, said she, This is my Pot, it was stole from me. Said I, If it is your Pot, take it; but I hope you will be so good as to let me have the Money that I lent the Creature upon it. She said, she was very much obliged to me, and would drink with me; but she went to Justice Wroth , and got a Search Warrant. - I cannot say whether that is the Woman that brought it; she was then dressed neat, and in a clean Linnen Gown.</p>

I sent for a Constable, and ordered my Servant and the Constable to search him. The Prisoner put his Hand in his Pocket, and took out six Moidores and one Guinea; and in a little Time he owned the Fact, and that he had taken out of the Desk forty Moidores and thirty-five Guineas; that he went to a Gaming-House, and had lost it all but this. Upon searching his Pockets there was this Letter found, which was then sealed up, and the Wafer hardly dry; it is directed to Mr Fuller, a worthy Gentleman whom he had lived with.

My Fellow-Servant told me he had been out all Night. My! Master came down half an Hour after, and enquired where he was; and he being absent for two or three Hours, my Master enquired again, and then examined his Cash, and finding it deficient, he asked me where he us'd to go; I told him it was likely that he was at his Barber's. on St Mary-hill. My Master Slater and I found him there: We brought him back to my Master's House, and the Constable searched him in my Presence.

We agreed to toss up Heads or Tails, who should treat: He tossed up the Moidore, and I took it up, and said, there was neither Head nor Tail upon it; so he carried me before a Justice: I went on my own Accord, without any Constable.

               <p>Lot Cavenagh. Have not you and I been as intimate as two own Brothers?</p>
               <p>Wm Taylor . I have seen him two or three Times with one Wm Wilson; I was no father intimate with him than being acquainted by drinking together, and saying, how do you do, if I happen'd to meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to let you go away after they had robbed you?</p>

               <p>Cor. Taylor. The first Lodging he ever took me to, was at this Gascoign's , the Thief-taker, and he allowed me nine Shillings a Week.</p>

Mr Taylor said, he must be up early in the Morning; said Cavenagh. You may get up soon enough in the Morning if you stay here: Then he concluded to stay, and desired I would call him. I told him, I would if I could. Cavenagh had a Room for himself, and the other Prisoner, which he paid Half a Crown a Week for: Cavenagh, and that Woman

            . It it very hard that we should suffer upon the Account of this Coat that Taylor gave to Cavenagh ; we have Witnesses that will give a different Account of the Matter; it is very improbable we should go to rob a Man that we were so intimate with, and who knew where to find us every Hour of the Day, and not murder him; it is plain they only do this to take away our Lives for the Sake of the Reward. This Sunday, about Eleven o'Clock, Lot comes into the Room with this Frock, says I, Lord! what has be paid you the old Score? Yes, said he; I might as well take this, as take nothing. Says I, I believe it will be a very dear Coat to you. We went out directly, and shut the Door; this was at Gascoign's . Then I went into Parker's-Lane , to one Mr Waper's , who keeps a Chandler's-Shop, and asked them for a Lodging, but they had none; we went over to the Golden-Hart Alehouse, and they had no Bed; we staid there drinking till past Three, and went over to the Chandler's-Shop, and staid till near Five, and left the Coat there, which Cavenagh had given into my Hand, and went to another Place, and said to the Woman, will you let this Man and I lie down upon the Bed? Accordingly we did lie down, and the Woman went out to work, and between Nine and Ten she came back, and we went to the Chandler's-Shop again, and then I gave the Coat to Lot Cavenagh . When Lot and you have come Home together, I have said, Billy, you bite your Lips upon the Account of Lot Cavenagh's locking so hard at me. Do not you know Lot has came up when I have been in Bed, and I have asked him who should treat, he or I? And sometimes one has treated, and sometimes the other has treated. You have oftentimes called me Bitch, as I have called you Names; and you have told me I have done so and so with Lot; you were as likely as ever Lot Cavenagh was, and I thought you as agreeable. Did not you give this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080028"/> Coat to Lot Cavenagh? and now you say he took it from you against your will. You have said that Lot Cavenagh was a Fellow of so bad a Character, that if he was taken up for any Thing he would certainly be hanged. Did not you lay a Plot against him? Gascoign was to be Thief-taker, and you were to be Prosecutor, and I was to swear a Robbery against Lot Cavenagh; you know this to be true; you have sworn several Robberies and Assaults against me: It the Man did but look at me you were jealous ; if I was absent but a Minute, you would say, what has Lot been bussing you? What has Lot been kissing you? You Bitch, where have you been? &amp;c. You have charged a Woman with robbing you of your Silver Buckles, when you have thrown them down the House of Office. Consider the Nights you and I have lain at

            . I am Niece to Mr Sadler , and live with him. - When the House was broke open, I lost a Cambrick Apron, and a Cambrick Cap; the Cap was left in a Pan upon the Dresser the Night before, and the next Morning, when I came down, was missing: I never had either the Apron or the Cap again. About six o'Clock in the Morning the Maid came up to me, and desired I would come down, for the House had been broke open. When I came down, I found the Staple of the Window forced out, the Casement was taken off, and put on the outside of the Window, the inside Shutters were open, and the Dresser-Drawers were open. - There were more Things lost than are laid in the Indictment.</p>

             . I live in the Square, just by Mr Sadler's, and had lain in the House about a Fortnight, because Mr Sadler had been sick, and if he had died, he had given me some Charge concerning it. On the 30th of September, or the 1st of October, when I came down in the Morning, I met this young Woman, Mrs Burton, and she said, We are robb'd! Said I, How so? She said, Go into the Kitchen, and you will see - I usually<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080030"/> took Care of the Fastenings my self, but I am not certain I did that Night: They had forced out a large Staple, and they had opened a flap Shutter, where there was a strong Chain; when they came down the Flap, they came to a Glass Window, and there were two Panes of Glass taken out, by which they might open the Window; the Case ment was taken off the Hooks, and sat down by the Side of the Window. - I my self have gone in there, as any Man almost may. These Gentlemen, who are the King's Officers, saw the Prisoner with some of the Goods upon his Shoulder. Cordosa and Robinson were taken up about a Month afterwards by one Unwin ; it was on a Lord's Day, between Eleven and Twelve, that I was charged with both of them by this Unwin the Thief-taker. I went to Justice Ricards , but he was not at Home then; at six at Night I carried them before him. - The Thief-taker took this out of Cordosa's Pocket before my Face. [It was an Instrument crooked at the End like a Pick-Lock.]</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Unwin?</p>
               <p>Jell. He is ill of the Gout, and almost killed by some Rogues who beat him the other Day. Cordosa, on my first asking him, denied having any Knowledge of the Fact, but at last confessed ingenuously that he was guilty of stealing the Things out of this House: He produced none of them; nor would he own how he took them. - He did not confess the breaking open the House.</p>

               <p>Tryphena Eden . On the 15th of October last, my House was broke open. - I lost two Casks, containing eight Gallons of Rum, the Value is two Pounds, the one Cask of Brandy, Value three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080031"/> Pounds, one Stone Bottle with two Gallons of English Brandy, Value five Shillings, one Pewter Gallon Pot, Value five Shillings, and three Brass Cocks, Value three Shillings. They broke into the Vault in the Cellar; I missed these Things on Saturday, about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon. - One of the Shutters was broke off, and one of the Bars bent in. - I believe they were shut fast on Friday Night; but I saw them fast the Thursday before: There is an Iron Bar cross the Window, they took that off, and pulled the Pin out, and then there was room enough for a Man to go into the Cellar. I have not got any Thing again but the Gallon Pot, which I had of Mr Unwin ; he brought it to my House, and shewed it to me, and said, he took it out of Robinson's House: I cannot swear this is my Pot: I believe it is mine, because it was without a Lid. - Robinson said he had sold the Brandy and Rum to a Jew; but I cannot remember his Name.</p>

I desired he would let me alone, and go Home to his Wife; that I thought it much more proper for him and every Man to be at Home. - I knew him by his coming frequently to my Master's and Mistress's House. - Still he continued to use me very ill; and at last laid me down on the Floor, and used me in a very violent Manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he use you?</p>
               <p>Simmonds . He forced it into me, and if I had not cried out Murder, he would have drove it into the Soul of me.</p>
               <p>The Necessity of the Case requiring the Prisoner to be very explicit, she gave sufficient Evidence to maintain the Indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080032"/>Q. How did you find yourself afterwards?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. I found myself hurt in such a violent Manner, that I could hardly get to Bed: I was hardly able to wag. - I found myself very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this done by Force, or did you give your Consent?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. It was all Force, I gave no Consent at all .</p>
               <p>Q. When did you acquaint your Mistress with it?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. I acquainted her with it about an Hour after she came Home the next Day. - The Prisoner went away between Twelve and One .</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were very bad, how long did you continue so?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. About a Fortnight .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain to any Body?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. To none but my Mistress. - Dr Mead, the Man Midwife, ordered me Medicines upon the Account of this Disorder. After the Prisoner had committed the Fact, he would have had me have promised to have gone with him, or to have met him at the Water-side, either the next Day in the Afternoon (which was Saturday) or Sunday in the Afternoon , or Monday in the Afternoon. - At Millbank ; but I did not go: I said to him, Mr Remue, What! now you have got your Ends of me, you want to murder me. - I do really believe he had a Design to murder me.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any Questions to ask her?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have Council, and I beg that Gentleman may ask the Questions for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Mr Debat?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. Yes; he used me very rudely the Thursday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain of what Mr Debat did to you?</p>
               <p>Simmonds . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain of a Strain?</p>
               <p>Simmonds . Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, if you were not brought to Bed of a dead Child a little before?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. No. - I am very positive of it. - I never had one.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say Mr Debat used you ill?</p>
               <p>Simmonds. Because he used me very rudely .</p>

            . I went to Mr Bodicoat's on Saturday Night, the Day she came Home, for I heard that Mrs Boddicoat wanted to speak with me: When I came, she told me, the Girl was ill, and said, she had been ill used; and desired me to go up Stairs; that it was her Opinion, the Girl was ravished. I told her, it was my Opinion that the Girl had miscarried; I nursed her; the Medicines she had , were ordered by Dr Mead, a Man Midwife ; and Medicines I believe proper for such a Case.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she bad?</p>
               <p>Rocbank . I do not think she was very bad after the first Night. - I have been in private with the Prisoner and never saw any Harm by him. - I had Reasons to think it was a Miscarriage. - I am not a Maid, I have had five Children. I hope you will not ask me any Questions that immodest . I have nursed People before in there Cases, and I have been so myself; and for that Reasons I believe it to be a Miscarriage. - I do not know what the Medicines were.</p>
               <p>Mrs Bodicoat . (The Girl's Mistress.) I came Home on the Saturday in the Forenoon, and found the Girl in a very great Disorder. I asked her what was the Matter; she told me, she believed she had over-reached herself; but after some Time, she said, she had undergone a great deal of Fa since I had been gone. Then I asked her, if anybody had been there that had abused her? I taxed her home whether she had not miscarried; for I never saw any body in such a Condition, unless it was a Miscarriage. She said it was no such Thing I threatned to turn her out of Doors if she would not tell me; then she said, Mr Debat had used her very ill the Thursday before; it was a good while before she would tell that the Prisoner had lain with her; but after I had pressed her very hard to tell me, she said, If I must tell you the Truth, it was Mr Remue. - I did not examine her so close as to know whether any Damage had been done to her Body. - She had been with me about two Months, but I have known her four Years, and never knew any Ill of her. - She is a giggling Girl; I never saw any Immodesty by her in my Life - I never had a Miscarriage my self so I cannot be so good a Judge as those that have.</p>
               <p>Isabella Walker . I never knew any thing of Dishonesty by her, and have known her from a Child down to this Time, and she always behaved me destly .</p>

I am a married Woman, and have had three Children, so I know what Condition she was in: I found her in a very bad Way; there was a Flooding by her Bed-side, and great Clods of Blood, which no body, but Women that have been married, can know any thing of. It is my Opinion, she had been ill used by some Man. - I never saw any Thing ill by the Girl in my Life. She has lived by me but a little while. - Her Mistress came Home about Eleven o'Clock on Saturday Morning, and asked me how she did; I told her as I have related it.</p>

               <p>Mr Remue's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, about the 18th or 19th of September last, the Prosecutrix was in a great Disorder, by the great Effusion of Blood. Here are two Persons who were sent for by the Prosecutrix, and they were the first Persons that examined her, and asked her the Occasion of the Disorder; she said, she had over-strained herself by lifting an Ox's Head. They told her they thought it incredible, that such a great Flow of Blood should come from a Strain; and believed that she had miscarried, and very much pressed her to tell the Truth. She said she had not miscarried, and that no Man had ever lain with her. Mrs Handford and Mrs Sampson know this, and they said her Case was so bad, as to require the Opinion of a Man-Midwife: Accordingly they sent for Dr Mead, and he gave his Opinion, that she had miscarried. When she found they could not be persuaded to believe that it was a Strain, she acknowledged, that a Day or two before,

            , a Butcher, came into the House, tied down the Latch of the Door, pushed her into a Chair, and had to do with her, and broke the Chair in committing the Violence; and Women, who are experienced in Child-bearing, say, that if there had been Violence committed, it is impossible that could be the Cause of such an Effusion of Blood. They told her they believed she had had a Child, and that she had secreted the Child, and believed the Child might be at seven or eight Months Growth. This Mrs Boddicoat and others have consulted how to fix it upon me, because I had been pretty much backward and forward in the House, and in order, as I believe, to extort some Money from me. They sent for Dr Mead; when they told him of it, he said it proceeded from a Miscarriage: When they talked to him of the Prosecution , he said it would be a most enormous Case and a Sin, and the Indictment must of Consequence fall to the Ground. They said, we shall never be able to make our selves Satisfaction, without commencing a Suit against him; and so these People swore against me, and indictment me here. I beg Leave to observe another Thing; they have made Overtures from Time to Time, that if I would give them any Thing for Satisfaction, as they pretended, for their Charge and Trouble, the Prosecution should be stifled ; and

             said, they would take five Guineas, of which Mrs Boddicoat was to have one Guinea, and the Girl four; and on Sunday Night they sent Mr Barnes to Mrs handford, and told her Mrs Boddicoat was miserable poor, and that they wanted something to support themselves, and if I would give four or five Guineas, there should be no Prosecution.</p>
               <p>Lody Handford. I was desired to go to Mrs Boddicoat's, and I went there; I was the first Person that took this Creature's Information with Relation to the Affair; said I, Mary, what is the Matter with you? She said, I have lifted an Ox's Head, and have done my self a great deal of Damage; but I believe it was a Miscarriage; I have had a Miscarriage my self: This Flowing was in such a Quantity, that no body, unless it was a Woman that miscarried, or was delivered of a Child, could have so much. I was a Maid once, and was married pretty soon, about Fourteen Years of Age, and I never knew the like, but in these Cases. Molly, said I, How can this be? I am sure you have known a Man for it is a Thing quite contrary to Nature, without you have known Man; and I am afraid there is a Murder at the Bottom. - This was the next Day, between Nine and Ten o'Clock, on Saturday Morning; she said, as God should judge her, she never knew any Man in her Life:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080034"/> Said I, Hussey , you are a Liar; and I told her, my Lord, it could not be so with her without a Child or a Miscarriage, and I believe a very large Miscarriage: She would not own any Thing with respect to the Prisoner at the Bar for a good while: She said one Debat , a Butcher, had to do with her one Afternoon; that he pushed her into the Parlour, tied down the Latch of the Door, and broke a Chair in the doing it: I still persisted in it that it was a Miscarriage. Well , said she, if you must have the Truth , I will tell you; it was Debat; and to tell you the Truth, he has been great with me ever since I came into the House. Her Mistress said, I always told you, Debat was an impudent Fellow. I will speak the Truth for I think it is a Pity an innocent Man should suffer; when Dr Mead came into the Room, he said, there was either a Child, or a very large Miscarriage, and after she had abided by this a long Time, that it was Debat, she said, If you must know the Truth, it was Mr Remue. Mr Remue is a very modest Man: I have a Child here in Court, that I have trusted with him all Parts of the Day, and he never offered any Thing amiss to her in his Life.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any Offers made of taking Money?</p>
               <p>Handford . Yes. - By Mrs Boddicoat and the Prosecutrix; the Prosecutrix said, if he would give her some Money, she would not appear against him; and I said, The Man will not give you a Shilling: I believe Mrs Boddicoat would have been willing to have taken what she was out of Pocket; I have heard her say, she would take ten Guineas, and not trouble herself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as you have had a Miscarriage, do you take this to be the Effect of a Miscarriage?</p>
               <p>Handford. I really do believe it to be so.</p>

            . I went to see Mrs Boddicoat's Maid; she was in Bed, and I found her a great deal worse than I thought she was; she had concealed a great deal of Blood, her Camblet Gown and Petticoat were spread over the Floor to conceal it; said I, Mary, what is the Matter with your Arm it is so bloody: Says she, I am all over so, I have hurt myself in lifting an Ox's Head. Said I, If you had lifted a whole Bullock, you could not be worse. I turned down the Bed, and that was in a bad Condition; I thought she had been delivered of a Child. I looked all over the Room, into the Cradle and Trunk, and every where, to see if there was a Child concealed. I charged her with making away with the Child, and she protested with a great many Vows, she did not know what a Man was, before the Midwife examined her; then she said, one Debat had forced her into a Room, and fastened the Latch down, &amp;c. They charged her with having a Child, which she denied; but she said, if she must tell the Truth, Mr Debat had to co with her ever since she came to Mrs Boddicoat's ; she said so for a great many Hours, and then she said it was Mr Remue; and Mrs Boddicoat said, if he would give the Girl fifty Pounds, and give her ten Pounds for spoiling the Bed, she would say no more of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who proposed to take the Money?</p>
               <p>Sampson. I had it from the Mouth of her Mistress; she said the Girl would not make it up under fifty Pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take this to be the Effect of?</p>
               <p>Sampson. I take it to be the Effect of a Miscarriage; but I never was in the Time of Child-Birth, in so bad a Condition as she was in.</p>
               <p>Dr Mead. On the Saturday, about eleven o'Clock, I went to Mrs Boddicoat's to see the Maid; when I came into the Room, I declared my Opinion, that there had been a Child, or a large Miscarriage; there was a great flooding, and all the Symptoms that could be of it; the Girl protested she had never known Man. I told her, that her Word would signify nothing, there were such Symptoms to the contrary; at length she said one Debat had to do with her; the Bed was so wet with Blood and Water that flows at these Times; there are very few Names for Smells, but there is a very indifferent Smell attending these Cases; there were Cloaths bloody, and Blood in a great Quantity about the Room; it is my positive Opinion, that there was a Child, and that it must be at least seven Months Growth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any external Appearance besides Blood and Water?</p>
               <p>Dr Mead. No, there was not: I passed my Hand into her Body, and there was nothing unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the Forcing a Woman such an Effect?</p>
               <p>Dr Mead. Not to the fiftieth Part of what was in this Case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a Talk of the Prosecution being stopped, if they could have got a Sum of Money.</p>
               <p>Dr Mead . Yes, there was a Talk of fifty Pound . - And something intimated, that if they could get it, it would be the Way for me to be paid, but I never had a Fathing. - I have followed this Business about thirteen Years.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you searched her Body?</p>
               <p>Dr Mead. I did so. - She had Clods of Blood in her Shift , she was bloody from the Fingers End to the Elbow, and over the Mons Veneris. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080035"/> They wanted me to give a Memorandum, or Note under my Hand, that the Girl was in Danger of her Life: Said I, I will not do any such Thing for an hundred Guineas; they said, Do you think the Girl is able to go abroad? No, said I, And I will give you any Thing under my Hand, that she is not able to go abroad. - But they took her abroad in a Day or two for all they desired that: I really believe it to be an iniquitous Affair.</p>
               <p>Mrs Hoare . I have been acquainted with Mr Remue , about a Year and a half, his Wife is a particular Acquaintance of mine; he has waited for her several Hours, and I never saw any Thing but what was very modest by him, nor ever heard any thing of this Nature before.</p>

            . I have known him about three Months; he sometimes spent an Evening at our House, and I never knew him behave amiss.</p>
               <p>Mrs Boddicoat called again.</p>
               <p>Court. Here have been some Witnesses that mention'd Sums of Money being demanded by you; I ask you, whether you ever demanded any Money or not?</p>
               <p>Boddicoat. That Saturday Morning, Mr Remue wanted to speak with that Gentlewoman, and asked how the Maid did? Says she, had enough, Mr Remue; there is but a Span between her and Death: He desired proper Care might be taken of her, and it should be paid for: and that is a very reasonable Thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of the Witnesses spoke as to the requiring of Money relating to the Prosecution, was there any Thing said about that?</p>
               <p>Boddicoat . I did say, I had not Money to go on with the Prosecution, and the Girl had none, and I was willing to right her if it lay in my Power.</p>

            . I did not lose any Thing; the Feather-Bed and Bolster were taken off the Bedstead and tied up in the Curtain. They were moved, as I apprehend, with a Design to be taken away, the third of November, between five and six in the Evening : The Room was locked when I went out in the Morning; and when I came Home, the Padlock of the outward Door was picked. I was drinking a Pot of Beer below, and was informed of it by the Maid. It is a Publick House, and this Apartment is let to me; I went up Stairs, and found the Prisoner in my Room; he enquired for one Williams a Watchmaker, but no such Person lived there. I took him by the Collar, and left him in Custody of some of the People in the Yard till I got a Constable.</p>

               <p>Taylor . It is not so large, but any Body might carry it. He looked pale but not sick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a common Sort of a Passage, and an Alehouse; so I went in to inquire if one Mr Williams lived there; Mr Taylor was below Stairs , and asked who was there. I said , I am glad you are come, I wanted to ask you a Question, but he immediately secured me.</p>

             said, the Boy had enticed him to do so. - I take the Sugar to be the Property of divers Persons, because it is the Scrapings of the Ship.</p>
               <p>Richard French. The first Day our Ship went into Dock, I met Brown , and another; they asked me if the Sweepings of the Sugar were gone, I said no; they asked me if I would sell it, I told them it was not mine; they said you foolish Rogue, as the Ship is in Dock, you may venture to do it , so I said they might have it if they would come for it: This was about the Middle of November, about 12 at Night. Friday, November 20, I met Campbell, he asked me if he should come for the Sweepings, I told him yes, and on Sunday Night, Brown and Campbell, got a Lighter Man's Skiff , and came into the Ship<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080038"/> Peggy and Jenny : I opened the Gratings on the Quarter Deck, and went down between Decks into the Steerage, opened the Hatch, and went down in the Hold where the Cask of Sugar was; Campbell held a Bag and Brown put the Sugar into it with a Shovel, there was about 5 or 6 Hundred Weight; Campbell handed the Bags, then they carried them into the Hatch-Way, laid them on the Gratings, and afterwards carried them to the House of one Wright , at the Black Swan, in Ratcliff; Brown carried up the Elephants Teeth, and the Rum. I drew a Staple out of the Chest with a Marling-Spike which Brown gave me: I took out one Bottle, says Brown , What signifies one, take 5 or 6 they will serve us to drink, so we took out 5 more, with Wine and Rum; the Skiff lay at the Dock Gate: Brown went on Shore and Campell handed them to him; these were all put into the Boat, and landed at Wright's House, as soon as they came up the Sugar was delivered to Wright himself, and put by under his Care - he carried it into a little Room - Wright carried the Candle and Brown carried in the Sugar, Wright told Brown and Campbell, that the Bags were wet, and made the Sugar run, and Wright got a couple of dry Bags and put the Sugar into them; the Bottles and the Elephants Teeth were all delivered to Mrs Wright, and she carried them up Stairs. - The Goods were to be sold, and each of us was to have an equal Share of the Money. - I was took up the next Morning, that was the Reason they were not sold. I have known the Prisoners about three Weeks, they worked out the Ship. - I never had any Promises from any Body.</p>
