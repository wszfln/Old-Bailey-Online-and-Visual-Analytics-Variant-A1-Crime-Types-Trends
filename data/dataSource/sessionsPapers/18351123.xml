                  </hi>. I am a police inspector, and live at No.17, York street, in the parish of Stepney, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Stebonheath, and rent the house. On Friday evening the 6th of November, I went home about half past eight o'clcok—I unlocked the door and let myself in—my wife and family were in the country at the time—I locked the door when I got in, and took the key out, and had scarcely been in doors half a minute before somebody came to the door, and gaven one knock—I did not answer the door—I heard the steps of a person go away dierctly from the door—I had not got out of the passage into the parlour before two persons came to the street door, and one of the two put a key into the lock—I had no light in the house at the time—I had not time to get one—when the key was put into the lock, one of the persons said to the other "Does it fit?" the other said, "Yes it is all right," and at that moment the door unlocked-the key was taken out after the door was unlocked—they pushed the door open two or three did not fasten it—they went away then and I had scarcely time to get from the pasage into the back parlour and change my coat, before two persons entered the front door—I had a fine frock coat on at the time, and I changed it for a strong one, expecting a struggle with them, when they did come in—they both came into passage, and one of the put a key into the door, insdie, and locked themselves in, leaving the key in the lock, so that nobody could come in from the outside—I was standing behind the back parlour door, and the prisoner passed me along the pasage into the Kitchen—the other stoped by the door in the passage—I was went out from the parlour and seized the prisoner in the kitchen he—appeared about to open the back door, and then the other unlocked the front door and made off—I found this key inside the lock—It is not my key, but it will unlock the door better ten my own key—It has ben filed apparently to fit the lock—soon after I seized the prisoner, he begged for mercy—I afterwards de<lb/>livered him to Charles Barown—he made a little resistance at first—I found</p>

I am a clerk, I know Rice—I am not connected with the police now—I was once—I was going to call on Rice—I arrived at his house about half past eight o'clock—when I got near his house I observed him bringing the prisoner along, as if from his house—Rice gave him into custody while he went into my the house and while I hold him by the door something seemed to fall from him—I do not know what it was—I did not take it up.</p>

I have heard the evidence of the officer I had engaged a carriaage from keppel-mews that day to go to guildhall, and the prisoner accompanied it-another drove, and the prisoner assisted as footman-being in distress for a servant, as my footman had gone to see the show, the prisoner offered his services, and having a livery coat, I engaged him to act as footman—I was attended by my lady to guildhall—at the time I left my own house, she observed that she had dropped her bracelet—I think the prisoner must have heard it—he was near enough—I said, "It must be between here and the huse"—Mrs. Adams said, "I have no doubt left it in the room, we are rather late. and we will drive on" I was sent for to the justice-room, at Guildhall, and it was produced to me (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know this to be hers—I did not return in the same carriage, for while it was gone to fish street hill, Mr. Ward took compas<lb/>sion on us, and drove us home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I accompanied Sooley, on the 14th of November, to Southampton-buildings, and saw him in the act of tendering some money to the prisoner—I said perhaps he would refer me to the party he took it of—he said he knew nothing about it, it was a mistake—I asked Sooley, in his presence, whether the prisoner was the man who gave him the cheque—he said he was—the prisoner said nothing to that—I told him I was an officer, and he must consider himself my pri<lb/>soner—he then said if I would go with him, he would take me to the party he received the cheque of—I refused to go, and said he must pro<lb/>ceed with me, and not I go with him—I took him to Cox and Green-wood's in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on the road, he asked me if I had not seen him, whether I should have detained the man who presented the cheque—I told him most likely we should, till we had ascertained the respectability of his character—he said, "O thought so, I should not like to see the poor fellow," or "man, get into trouble"—he also stated, that the cheque was found upon him, he supposed he must suffer, but he would not open his mouth to get any one else into trouble—I went in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with him to Cox and Company, but neither of us went in—Sooley went in to inform Mr. Pyle that I had apprehended the prisoner, and I took him to the station-house—when the Inspector was taking the charge, he asked him his address, which he refused to give—he was asked from whom he received the cheque, and answered, "From my friend Wood"—when asked Wood's address, he refused to give that likewise—he said, "I wish to give little trouble about it, I don't disown being the presenter of it"—I asked him if he had a pocket-book, or any papers—he said no, he had taken good (or great) care of them—I searched him, but found nothing on him but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife.</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of November, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar of my house—she asked for half-a-pint of porter—I served her—she offered me a shilling in payment—I put it into the till, and gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in charge—there were other shillings in the till—she went across the road, and was gone about five minutes, and then came again, and asked for half-a-pint of porter—It was rather more than five minutes—I had not taken any more silver in that time, but had taken a quantity of halfpence—there was other silver in the till—she gave me a shilling for the second half-pint of porter—I served her, and noticed that the shilling was a very bad one—I then opened the till, and looked for the other one, and found a bad shilling on the top of the other silver—the second shilling had not been out of my hand at all—I took the first shilling round the counter with the one she gave me on the second occasion—they were together, and I cannot distinguish which was the first or second, but they are the two—I saw her put her hand into her bosom several times, and asked what she was doing—she began to cry, and I said, "You have got some money about you, I am quite sure, by your appearance and ways"—I called in a policeman, who took her into the yard of my house—she was searched there, and I saw him take 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her—I gave the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the policeman—I marked them first.</p>

I was called to Mr. Garner's shop, and took the prisoner into the back yard—I felt breast, and felt a sub<lb/>stance inside—I found thirteen counterfeit shillings, and a penny-piece in her bosom, and sixpence in a purse—I received two counterfeit shillings from Mr. Garner—the prisoner said she was persuaded to go and pass bad money; as she would get a better living by that than being on the streets, but she had taken a solemn oath never to state who she had them from—I have kept them spates ever since.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that a respectable man met her, and gave her some liquor—took her to a house of ill-fame—after which, he gave her the money in question, and that she had only tendered one shilling to Garner.)</p>

I said, "Yes"—she said, "That is my uncle, do not let him see you"—she gave me a halfpenny, and took my bundle, and said she would go into that place for the horse and cart, and she was coming to see my mother—she pointed to a place then, and asked me if I bad any thing to put the horse and cart in—I said, "No"—she said she would put it and my bundle in a basket, and carry it home to my mother—this was about four o'clock—I met her again that night in Fore-street, about eight o'clock—my aunt told me to take a good look at her, to see if that was the woman—she was dressed as before—I am sure she is the person who took the bundle.</p>

"You brought some wax to my shop just now"—he said to cole, "Where have you got this wax form?"—he said it was his own—I said that would not do—I looked about for a policeman, but could see none—I then said the best way would be for them to walk on the pavement, and I would wheel the barrow to the station-house, with the wax in it—they did so; and I wheeled the barrow till they came to William-street, Tottenham-court-road, and there they ran away—here is the wax which was brought to my shop—I weighed</p>

               <p>and gave them to the porter to take up to his room, went up with the porter to his room, No. 9—he came down shortly after, and ordered dinner in a great hurry—the dinner was got ready for him, and he dined—after dinner he ordered his bill, and went up stairs to his bed-room, which was directly opposite Captain Pratt's—he came down in about five or ten minutes, and asked for his bill again—I had it ready for him—I asked him why he asked for his bill as was going to sleep there that night—he said some unexpect<lb/>ed business had occurred, and he was compelled to go to Birmingham that night by the mail—he paid his bill, and went up stairs immediately—I saw no more of him till saw him, at Bow-street—I did not see him go out—he did not sleep there.</p>

"Skerret, "—I said we had come to speak to him respecting the rob<lb/>bery at the Bath Hotel, Piceadilly, and said, "Do you know any thing about it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you mean to say you did not go there, and engage a bed without taking it?"—he said, he had not been there—I first searched the pocket of his trowsers, and then began to search the room—I turned round to the prisoner, and said, "Where is the watch?"—he said, "My watch is in the drawer"—I pulled open the top drawer, and it was not there—I said, "which drawer do you mean?"—he said, "That one," pointing to the second one—I opened the second drawer, and found this watch, with the chain and key attached to it—I took it up, looked at it, and said, "Oh, this is the watch, here are the initials, "—he said, "No, that it mine"—It had "J.B.P." on it—I then went and looked at the maker's name in the Hue and Cry, and said, "This must be the watch for here is the maker's name, and all the same"—the prisoner said, "Will you awear to that?"

I am master of the workhouse of St. Luke, Middlesex—I was passing near the workhouse, in Bath-street, on the 13th of November, and met the two prisoners—Coleman was first with a basket, tied round with a sash line, and Farrar behind him with the four weights—they had no business from the workhouse—I said, "Coleman who is to take this to the station-house, you or I?"—he put it down, and said, "I am done with it"—I can swear to the property—I returned to the workhouse, and missed the bars, and sash-weights, and on the bench of the carpenter's who are repairing the workhouse, I found some line which corresponded with what the prisoner's basket was tied with—they worked as carpenters in the workhouse, and had been paupers there some years.</p>

I rent the house—In October last I had a young man named Stewart in my employ, as errand-boy—he had been only a week in my service, and is fourteen or fifteen years old—he dd not sleep in my house—I have a shop which is closed by outside shutters—on Thursday, the 5th of November, I wanted to use my writing-desk, which used to stand in the parlour window, behind the shop, and it was miss<lb/>ing—this was about ten o'clock, or half-past ten—I told Stewart what I wanted—I went to the station-house, and brought an officer—my desk con<lb/>tained the property stated in the indictment—the prisoner was never in my employ.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, on the 5th of November, I went with Stewart to No. 7, Kelso-place, Paddington, where the prisoner lodged—Stewart pointed it out to me—the prisoner was not at home—I went to Peter-street, Saffron-hill, and saw the prisoner—Stewart pointed him out to me, and he immediately ran into the Bull's Head public-house—I followed him, and found him seated there behind the bar-door—I told him I wanted him for robbing Mr. Bailey—he said he knew nothing at all about the robbery—I searched him, and found sixteen sovereigns in his watch-fob, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in his waistcoat pocket—I asked him if he knew the boy who was with me—he said he knew nothing at all about him—I then asked him how he became possessed of the property which I found on him—he said he had picked it up in the street that morning—I took him to the station-house, and as we went, he said it would be all <hi rend="italic">goose</hi> with him this time—I have heard that phrase many a time, and understood him to mean he should be transported, and shortly after he told me he did not think Stewart knew so much of him as he did—he had said before, that he had never seen him—he had got on a new pair of shoes and stockings at the time, and a silk handkerchief—I asked him when he bought the shoes—he said about a week before—I ap<lb/>prehended two girls on suspicion of the same robbery, and when he was in the lock-up place he heard their voices, and hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Eggy,</hi> is it you?"—she answered, "Yes, me and <hi rend="italic">Flash Bet, nailed</hi> for your concern"—he then told them to keep it all <hi rend="italic">dark,</hi> and not to <hi rend="italic">come it,</hi> and he would get them <hi rend="italic">turned up.</hi>

On Wednesday morning, the 11th of November, I went with him to Welsh's field at Hillingdon, about a quarter after three o'clock, where the sheep had been put—I went up to the hay-rick, and saw this ewe cut in half, and the hind half throw away—we drove the drove out, and left the tired ewe, and the remaining half behind—I went a mile away from the field, towards Southall, and then Durley and Dancer sent me back to the field, and when I got near the gate I saw one man standing at the gate, and Wil<lb/>liam Barnett in the field—I cannot swear to the man at the gate—I knew William Barnett before, and I ran after him—the man at the gate ran an<lb/>other way—I fell in running down the lane, and lost sight of William Barnett—I am positive he is the man I ran after—I have seen him often when I have been to turn a drove into his father's field—I went into the field and took the fore half of the sheep down to the Standard public-house.</p>

The prisoner was our clerk on the 4th of September, and had been so since January or February, 1834—he had never been authorized to discharge bills due from our house, but it was his practice to do so, and we always expected the bills to be brought in by him—Messrs. Vachu, the law-stationers, do business for us—they live in Parliament-street—on the 4th of September, or on the day preceding, (as far as I can recollect,) the prisoner came to me, and stated that Messrs. Vachu were anxious to have a little money from us—he presented a bill for business done by them for us in the Yarmouth election case—I have no doubt that, in consequence of that, I wrote a cheque, as I find here one drawn on that day, and signed by myself and partner, Mr. Joseph Sherwood—I did not write a banker's name across it, for Mr. Sherwood keeps an account of the bankers' names, and I do not know them—I merely write "and Co." upon it—the other part was to be filled up by Messrs.

On the 24th of November, I was on duty near the Cock Tavern, in Thread<lb/>needle-street, about two o'clock, and saw the two prisoners standing against the tavern, with this roll of sacking between them—I called a policeman—Collins then took up the sacking, and put it on his shoulder—he went up Threadneedle-street, towards Bishopsgate; and Griffin followed him—Collins then put it down—Griffin took it up, and went on—Collins turned, and saw me and the policeman close behind Griffin, and then ran away—the policeman took Griffin, and I went and took Collins—this is the sacking.</p>

On the 15th of November, the prisoner came and asked for a bed—he had a pint of beer, and about eleven o'clock he went to bed—at a little before seven o'clock next morning, I heard him come down—I met him, and kept him in conservation, while I sent up-stairs—he got our sooner than I wanted, and I looked after him, and saw him running—I called "Halloo"—he ran the faster, but I caught him, and said, "My friend, come back"—he said, "what do you want I paid your demand, it is all right'he said, "I do not think it is all right," and just as I got him back, the girl said the sheets were gone—he had a bundle under his arm, and these sheets were in it—they are mine—he said, "I humbly beg your pardon, Sir; let me go"—I said, "I do not do business in that way.

And in a short time she said, "Scruby, you must be a very bad man; you have led a bad life all your time, and you must be rotten"-Scruby said, "Don't call me rotten; not so rotten as you"—he was at that time sitting a chair, by the side of a table—the prisoner said, "D—you do you call me rotten? I will let you know whether I am rotten"—she ran to the chair where he sat; came on his right sie; and began to punch him, with both hands, round his necl, at the back of his neck; it was done with her open hands—she kept hittig him, to that degree, that he slipped out of the chair, and fell on the floor—she directly ran round his feet, as he laid on the floor; and she was down by the side of him, on her knees, hitting him—she kept hitting him, but in what part I could not see; but she was hitting him, while he was on the ground; and after that, she came round, towards me, by the fire-place—I put my arms round her, persuading her to be quiet, and let the man alone—I held her for a short time, and then let her loose; and she began to kick at him—he was on the ground still—I saw her kick him once on the legs, and on the foot—he being a tallish man, he kicked out, as he laid on his back, to prevent her coming near—after she had been kicking him, she went up to the sink, at the further end of the room. and did not remain there long—In the mean time, Scruby was put into the chair; but who put him in, I cannot say; and the came from the sink—Scruby was sitting on her right hand; and as she came from the sink—Scruby was sitting on her right hand; and as she passed him, she struck him with her right hand, on the top of his head, with her open hand—his head being bald, the blow seemed to make a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I know both the prisoners—on the 29th of October I left London in the <hi rend="italic">Royal Adelaide</hi> steam-ves<lb/>sel—the captain, Mr. Allen, had the charge of the vessel—Clarke was on board, acting as pilot—we started from London that morning, between three and four o'clock, I think—from St. Catherine-dock—I had only to go to Grevesend—the vessel was going to Leith.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had been below, getting refreshment? Yes—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi> since at a distance—I cannot say her length, she is an oyster vessel—a deck boat—she was more than thirty fact long—I dare say she was forty—I had heard no hailing from the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi>—I do not know whose voice it was I heard—I saw the prisoners on the bridge—they were plain to be seen by any body—she was stopped when this halloing took place—she was going, as near as I can judge, at about half-speed—not going further than Gravesend I do not know whether she ever put out her full speed—she was going about five knots an hour—I cannot tell how fast the tide runs—the tide was about half-flood—the wind was about west-south-west—the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi> was coming up with a side wind—It was a fine breeze—she had the wind free the same as another vessel—the wind was about across—she had the wind fair, and the tide in her favour—the steam-vessel was more to the southward than northward—but nearly in mid-channel—the river is about three-quarters of a mile wide there—I should say, the steamer draws between twelve and thirteen feet of water—there is a shelf in the river where she was—we were between two shelves, which are a quarter of a mile apart—we could not go on the shelves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live at Whitstaple. I belong to a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi>—I remember leaving Whitstaple, for London, on Wednesday, the 28th of October, the day before the accident—my father was on board, also a passenger named Clarkson, myself, and a boy named Holt—we were coming up the river Thames, on Thursday morning, in the upper part of the Galleons, which is a reach on the Thames—the tide was running up—It was flood tide—I do not know how long it had been flood—I do not know at what rate the tide was running—the wind was about south-south-west—we were tacking, to muke our way—It was necessary from the state of the wind—I saw the light of the steam-boat—when I first saw that, our head was to the northward—I could not tell in what position the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> was coming—I could not say how far off she was when I saw the lights—I afterwards percieved the bull of the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi>—I cannot say how far off she was then—we did nothing when we saw her hull—the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> steered, as if she would come to the northward of us—we then put about, and our head was to the southward—we were in stay in the mean time—we then proceeded to the southward—we hallooed to the</p>

               <p>steamer to starboard her helm—we all three hallooed—were all three on deck—Clarkson was below, asleep—we hallooed because they were coming right away for us—they had not changed their course—we had—they were coming to the northward of us at first, and afterwards came against us—when I first saw the steamer, it appeared as if going to the northward of us, and we were going tot he northward, and we put about—I did not observe anything done by them, on our hallooing—I cannot tell how far she was off when we put about—we had gone a good way on out tack towards the southward shore—I thin we had passed the mid-stream, but I do not know—we hallooed out more than once the same word—we were well over at the convict ship off Woolwich, when we were struck—I could see the convict ship—the steam-about changed her course when we hallooed out, "Starboard"—she appeared as if she had ported her helm—we hailed them to starboard her helm, her porting it brought her nearer to us—she ran aboard us, and struck us just between the tackle plate on our starboard side—the tackle plate is about three feet and a half at the midhsip—I jumped, and got hold of a cross piece of the steam-boat's figure-head—here bows came over us—I got hold of the cross piece, and got on board her—my father did not get on board, he got up into the figure-head—when I got into the vessel, I found nobody forward—I went tot he foremast, and saw the men sitting in a place on the starboard bow on deck—I did not see what they were doing—that placeis forty-three feet from the figure-head—I saw the pilor (the prisoner Clarke) on the larboard paddle-box—I saw nobody else on the bridge, nor any body on the starboard paddle-box—If there had been, I should have seen them—I knocked at the door of the place—the men there were seamen—three came out, and asked what was the matter—I had seen no man except the one on the larboard paddle-bos, till I came to where I saw these men—there were no other persons on the deck—I did not cry or halloo before I went to the place where the men were sitting—they saw the vessel athwart the bows, and chucked a rope over—Holt was on the deck of the Fawn when the rope was thrown over—eh could not reac it—my father got down off the figure-head on board the Fawn, and put Holt to the rope, and then the steam-boat went astern, and the vessel went down—Holt was pulled up by three men into the steamboat, and my father met his death by going up by three men into the boat—the steamers; bowsprit was entangled with the riggin of the Fawns—that kept her up till the steam-boat went astern—I did not hear my fathe cry out—he made a noise in the water—I saw no more of him afterwards—the pilot's boat went to assist—when I was on board, I asked a man for the captain—he was a passenger, and said he did not know the captain in the dark—I made no inquiry of the seamen—I did not find him till after some considerabole time—when one of the boys showed him to me—that was after the Fawn had gone down—he was then leaning against the paddl-box—I asked him how I should get to London—he told me the pilot's man should row me up—I saw nothing of Clarkson after the Fawn was struck—I did not see any vessel near when we were struck—I do not think there was room for the steamer to pass between usand the bulk—there was plenty of room to the northward—we had done all we could to get to the southward.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 9th of November, I was master of the June a collier—she was lying in Bugsby's-hole, which is below Blackwall—about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening I was returning to the vessel—the vessel was at anchor—George Guthrie and William Willans were in the boat with me—they were rowing, and I was steering with the rudder—the boat was between fifteen and sixteen feel long—It was a very fine night—neither light nor dark—when we were near Blackwall-reach, I saw a large steamer nearly abreast of the reach—she was coming down behind us, about three times our length from us—our boat was nearly in the mid-stream—It was a Scotch boat I am speaking of—after getting clear of the Scotch boat, I pulled my boat directly into the north shore—we were ten or twelve yards from the north shore, not more—I saw the Monarch at the upper part of Blackwall-rach—she was coming up, and about three times her own length from us when I first saw her—she was near the north shore—she approached towards our ves sek—she then went nearer into the north shore—when she was about twice her length from us, or a little more,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230151"/>
               <p>she was coming direct on us—I stood up and shouted as well as I could, "Ahoy, starboard your helm"—she would have gone to the south if she had done so, and have been clear of us—I could see on to the deck of the vessel, when I stood up, but could not make any body out—I did not see any persons—Guthrie laid his oar in and stood up, and we both shouted—he kept shouting out in the same way as me—she struck our boat, and nearly cut her in two, and the boy Williams went down underneath the steamer, on the starboard side, and I went down under her bottom on the larboard side—I came up just under the steam-boat's larboard quarter—a waterman's boat was towing astern of the steamer, and the waterman reached a hook, and hooked me by the nose—I got hold of the hook with my hands, and was got out of the water—I was immediately taken on board the steamer—I saw the prisoner there, who I believe to be the captain—he was aft assisting me on board, when I got up out of the waterman's boat—when I went on board—he said he was sorry for the accident, and that he heard and saw nothing till he heard the crash of the boat—he gave me his card, and put a piece of sticking plaister on my face, which was bleeding—our boat came up bottom upwards, close by the steamer—I believe every endeavour was made to save Williams, but I was in such a state myself I could hardly see—his body was found next morning—I saw it.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long time passed between your seeing the Scotch ship and the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think about ten minutes—the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> is a towing steamer; what is called tub, of twenty-five tons—they take very large ships up the rive, at times—It was after six o'clock, when I saw the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>—there was a light at her mast-head—I do not know a place called Saunders-ness, in the Isle of Dogs—I know Bugshy's-hole—I have been accustomed to the river nearly thirty years—I know the point you mean, but do not know Saunders-ness by name—the tide was on the ebb, from Greenwich Hospital towards Saunders-ness—I should think it was to hours after ebb—the current was running very strong at the time—I was on the northern shore, and I thought to keep out of the way of damage from the craft—we were going down with the tide, and the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> coming up—vessels endeavour to keep out of the current going against them—the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> was above the point; perhaps, twice its length, when the accident happened—It had rounded the point, and that made her come into us—I should think the tide would be very little <hi rend="italic">slack</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His coming on towards you was in consequence of his having rounded the point, and there was a string current at the point? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he would come to the smoothest water—(looking at a sketch) these arrows, denoting the course of the tide, are correct—I calculate that was nearly the set of the tide—It was very shallow water off the Ness-point—It became necessary for her to keep a certain way off the point, to avoid the shallow—I do not think she was ashore after the accident, but she was near it—that made me keep so close in—I considered I was safer near shore than in the current—the Scotch steamer was in the stream, and the set me in towards shore—there was plenty of time to go into the current again, but I had charge of my own boat, and calculated, that I could go where I liked with her, and went close in shore—It was a particular night, for the time of year; not what they call light, nor was it very dark—our vessel is fifteen or sis teen feet long—It was not above two feet and a half out of the water—the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> was about one or two feet above the top of my head, when I stood up in my boat—we had no sailing tackle on board—we had a boat-hook—It</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230152"/>
               <p>is not usual to hook a lantern on a split head in small boats—I never saw any thing of the kind—I could see the light at the steamer's mast-head before she rounded the point—I could see it over the point—she was on the western shore then—she had not rounded the point—she was on the same side of the shore—In knew that she would be coming up on that side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What difficulty could there have been for your putting your boat's head to the stream, and drifting down the stream? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were vessels, at anchor on the other side—If I had gone athwart of them they might have hurt me—I considered I was safer in my small boat, by going along shore—I could have gone any where I chose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having seen the vessel coming round the point, and knowing it must come on the same side as you were, on turning the point, could you not easily have got into the stream, to get out of the way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I first saw her three lengths from us—she was rounding the point—there was no land between us when I first saw her—I did not see her over the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say you saw her light at the mast-head, before she came round the point? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but it was the sand on he shore—I cannot say how many persons were examined before the Coroner on this subject—Guthrie did not go into the water at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been in the middle of the stream when the Scotch vessel came near you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the made me go nearer shore—I do not think I was above ten yards off the shore when the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> struck me—It was not shallow water—we were above the point then—I was between the point and London—the accident happened after she had rounded the point—I should think there was eight or ten feet of water where she struck us—this was a steamer of twenty-five tons—a small vessel—I cannot say what water show draws—I should think it was my safest way to keep close to the shore—It was a very bright star-light night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The set of the tide is just round the point? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It sets off the point to the eastward—the river run east and west to the point, and then turns round, and goes north and south—the moment the steamer came round the shore she would meet the tide coming towards her.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230153"/>
               <p>rather—I took the person on the paddle-case to be the engineer—he was on the check by the paddle-case—he was near about his proper place—when I went aft in the boat, I took it to be the captain of the boat I spoke to—I cannot say it was the prisoner—I found a gentleman aft, I took to be the captain, and a waterman—the waterman was standing by the tiller—he had not got hold of the tiller—the other person was standing close by the tiller—I saw Mr. Watt brought on board soon after—he spoke to the gentleman, I took to be the captain.</p>

On the 23rd of September, I carried some soap and candles to a house in St. George's-terrace—and saw the defendant—she came out of the parlour into a passage, called me in, and told me to take the goods out of the bas<lb/>ket, and put them on the sideboard—she asked me for the bill—she said she had forgotten some starch and blue, and said she would pay me on my return—I went back and got it, and took it—then she was not at home—I called two or three times, but could not find her—on the evening following I saw her, and she said she would call and pay my-master on the Satur<lb/>day—I went again on the Monday, and she was gone away.</p>
