He submitted that the learned Alderman could not be said to have refused to commit on the charges for obtaining by false pretences; that in his (counsel's) own view the proper description of what the prisoner had done was to obtain money by false pretences and that if he had not done that he had not done anything. Mr. Hutton submitted that as nothing was said about the false pretences before the Magistrate those counts ought to be quashed, and that if the prosecutors had wished to proceed with those charges they could have asked to be bound over to prosecute under the Vexatious Indictment Act. The Recorder stated that he did not think he would be justified in putting the defendant in peril on the counts charging false pretences, and he would there<lb/>fore quash those counts, viz.</hi>, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18.</p>

I am a hairdresser, of 1, Little St. Andrew's Street, St. Giles-in-the-Fields—the prisoner is my wife—on January 24th we were out all the afternoon and evening; we got home about 12 p.m.—we had some supper in the kitchen under the shop—my mother was present—there is a staircase leading from the kitchen to the back of the shop, and a door with a glass panel between the staircase and the back of the shop—I had no quarrel with my wife during supper—I found the cruet empty and I felt rather annoyed; I pushed it aside and finished my supper—I never said a word about it—I took the evening paper and went and sat down in the shop—I was there for about ten minutes—my wife came into the shop, took the key and locked the door on the inside—she came over to me and said, "What do you mean by looking so black at me at</p>

               <p>the supper table before mother?" I said, "What do you meant"—she dashed at mo with this small white handled table knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I believe it was the knife she was having her supper with—it was in the kitchen—there was no table knife in the shop—there were razors and scissors there—I did 'not really know I was cut, but I felt my neck was wet—I caught her by her wrist, threw her down and held her for about ten minutes—I called out, but could get no assistance, so I broke two glass panels in the door, which brought a lodger and my mother down—the lodger burnt the door open; he got a cab and took me to the hospital—there was no quarrel between my wife and myself in the shop beyond the words I have mentioned—she has threatened me on many occasion—about a fortnight before this I spoke of something which I thought was wrong in the kitchen—she said, "You will work me up into such a passion I shall put this knife into you"—on January 24th we were both perfectly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have been married going on for four years—my mother has lived with us all that time—all the family unpleasantness which there has been is what my wife has made herself—my mother got on very well with her—most of the wrong wan on my wife's side—there may have been a little on both—there has been very little quarrelling—I have not got a bad temper; I have rather a hasty one—my wife has a very hasty temper—on this night we had been to the World's Fair together—it was arranged that my mother should have supper ready for us when we got home—up to the time of our going home there had been no un<lb/>pleasantness between us—I do not know if all this trouble arose out of bring no salt in the salt cellar—nothing was said when I pushed the salt cellar away—I did not say, "Why is not there any salt in the cellar?"—I did not get up and put some salt in it—no doubt I looked rather cross then—I finished my supper before I went upstairs—I may have left a little—I sit in the shop every night—my mother came up after me—I went up feeling rather annoyed and looking rather black—my mother went up to bed, and my wife sat in the kitchen—when she came into the shop I did not give her a kiss—I took what she said as a joke—she did not say, "What is the good of blaming me about the salt cellar? your mother laid the table"—she was in such a passionate temper she could not stop to say that—I did not say, "Don't you mention my mother; mind your own business"—I did not then go for her—I did not strike her—she did not pick up the knife to defend herself; she brought it into the shop from the kitchen—she did not go into the parlour—I never have knives like that in the shop to cut up soap; I have a different knife for that—I generally use my pocket knife—the soap may stick to the knife when it if cut; there is no soap on this one—I do not make a lather with a knife, I do it with a brush my wife took the key from the door and put it inside and locked the door on the inside—it is an upside down lock—I always leave the key outside the door—I know the door was locked, because when I threw her down we struggled near the door and I tried to open it after I had broken the window, and Webb could not open the door because it was locked and the key inside—after the struggle I felt very bad from the loss of</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and lire at 17, Clarendon Street, Pim<lb/>lico—I occupy the lower part of the house and my aunt the upper part—I have known the prisoner for about a year—he is the husband of the charwoman whom I employed two or three times—he lives near me—on January 18th I received this letter; I do not know the writing (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "To: ten ham Court Road. January 17th. Madam,—It having come to my know<lb/>ledge that your house, No. 17, has been under observation and likely to be. I with to let you know that if you care to send me £5, that will engage my services and I can promise you without fail to put matters right with the man that is engaged watching. Of course I cannot tell you how much he will want, but I know that he can be squared with money as we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> so before in a similar case. I see him every day, and, by what I hear, you will be perhaps brought up for keeping a disorderly house. He told me he had the case well in hand, and that one of your friends who visited you was a Mr.—in the War Office, and you had a child by him. Of course that would be very bad for a gentleman to be brought into a things like this. Perhaps he will help you out of it if he values his good name: of course I am only mentioning this to let you know that I have heard all about it, and that you should take my advice; employ me and I can assure you everything will turn out all right. You won't have to delay if you send me the amount, that is at once. I will get to business and also I can give you valuable advice and tell you what to do. You will also, whatever you do, let no one know about this matter, as it means this man's position Inst if it came to his superiors, earn. Of course I am taking thus entirely of my own accord and have not made any agreement with him yet. I do not think he will require much, and I am a private inquiry agent, and, therefore, come in to hear a lot of cases of this kind, and have done a lot of good. I shall call on Thursday morning at address given, and if you do not send money by then I know you do not require me; it might then be too late, but I will let you know to-day, Wednesday, if anything is likely to occur. I am informed you have neighbours; they are the ones to be careful of, as it is true that this man was put to watch. I do not think he will be there till Saturday again, but could not say for sure. They may raid the house when you have some gentlemen there, or perhaps will only bring you up for keeping a disorderly house, but what-ever you do, don't delay one hour if possible. I must not come near or would have seen you personally, and I am engaged in similar business so can only correspond through the post. This is a private address I give you, where, at any time, if you require the services of a private detective, hoping to serve you, Yours truly, R. Atkinson, care of Newsagent, 137, Charing Croat Road, London, W.C. P.S. Be sure to register letter. One important matter: did you ever have a woman, dark, little, engaged in your house, charwoman, I think? If so, give me her address if possible;</p>

We want some money"—Goldstein was then close to him—some people passed, and I could not catch the next conversation—next I heard one of the girls scream, "We have got no money"—Woolf put up his left hand and shouted, "Hi! Nell, come here!"—I did not see anybody answer, but I caught hold of him and I think the other one started running—I said to Woolf, "I am going to arrest you, and you must come with me to Leman Street police station"—he said, "All right, governor, we have got nothing. She is only a <hi rend="italic">pros.</hi>; you know her"—I took him to the station, where the girls told the Inspector their story—he was charged with demanding 2s. of the girls with menaces—in reply he said, "It has got to be proved"—the other man said, "They do not know me"—he was brought in sharp behind me—I know Zisman by sight—I did not see him that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Diesch, who keeps a lodging-house in Hugh Street, Pimlico—last December I met the prisoner at my sister's house in Vernon Street. Clapham—I knew him fourteen years ago, when my husband bought a looking glass and sideboard from him—during the course of conversation I said that I was going to Mayney's in Clapham, to buy two articles for £20—he said I was stupid to do that, as he could do it of half-price in the trade—I said. "Well, I want to exchange a bedroom suite," and he said he would come down the next morning and see it—he came and said he would allow me £4 15s. for it—I told him I was satisfied with that it was sold at auction by him and fetched £5 10s.—he said he would take me to the warehouse, the following Monday, and show me the suite in the rough that he proposed I should buy—he said the warehouse</p>

               <p>was Hollington's, in Curtain Road—he told me he got £900 a year, and a 1s. in the £ commission, being employed by Hollington's—he did not say how long he had been there—on December 31st he came and told me the furniture was ready, and it looked beautiful—I paid him on December 19th, when he brought the bill in—he said on that day that he had called for the balance of the money, which was £7—I said, "I would rather see my furniture, Mr. Elliott, as you promised to bring it in"—he laid, "You cannot have it, because the governor will not let it come out of the firm without the bill in paid"—I asked him for Hollington's bill, and, after seeing it was for £11 15s., I handed him £7—the £4 15s. he got for my suite he kept on account—on Saturday, December 24th, some furniture was brought to my house, but the carman would not leave it as it was not paid for—I have got had the furniture and I have lost my £7 cash and the value of my suite, £4 15s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw one of the articles brought by the carman and it was not such as I ordered—the order I had given was from a book of designs—the article brought was not the article the prisoner promised to give me—the furniture was brought on the Saturday, and on the Monday I went to see Mr. Dutton, solicitor—I do not know whether, if the furniture had been left, I should have accepted it or not—on the Saturday night I went to see the prisoner, but he was not at home—I left word that if he did not come and see me, I should put it in the solicitor's hands—on the Monday morning at 10 o'clock I went to the solicitor, and by my instruc<lb/>tions he wrote a letter to the prisoner—he replied to that letter—he is a distant cousin of my sister's husband—I was prepared to spend £20 at Mayney's for things that the prisoner said he could get for £11 15s.—I thought I was doing him a good turn; he said I was—I paid him the price he asked me, and he showed me the things on paper—one of the reasons for giving him the order was that I should save £8—he told me he could buy them wholesale—my sister was present when he represented what position he held—she is not here to-day—she was not called before the Magistrate—I have no corroboration of my statement—the prisoner told me that if my suite, when put up for auction, did not fetch £4 15s., he would make up the difference—I saw one of these circulars issued by the prisoner [<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could supply furniture at</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">per cent. lest than ordinary retail salesman</hi>]—the prisoner called on me on the Monday afternoon, soon after I went to Mr. Button, and told me he would deal with Mr. Dutton—he did not at that interview offer me back my money—a detective was then in my house—I never received a letter from the prisoner offering the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> What I have said about the prisoner being at Hollington at a salary of £200 and 1s. in the £ commission is not an invention—I know nothing about the prisoner being an intimate friend of my family—I parted with my £7 to the prisoner in this way: I told him I wanted the furniture in before Christmas and he said he could not supply it till the governor had been paid—I said, "Have you got the bill?"—he said "No, I have left it on the desk at the warehouse. I am going back to fetch it"—he came again at 7 p.m. with the bill, and when I saw it, it had Hollington's name on it—I gave him the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the firm of T. &amp; R.

I am the wife of Samuel Lusternick, of 19, Bell Lane, E.C.—I know the prisoner—on Thursday evening, January 5th, I gave him 10s. deposit to buy two fore-quarters of beef for me on the Friday morning—I saw him in the market the next morning and he gave me a receipt for £5 15s. 1d.—I gave him £4 5s. 1d., leaving £1 balance, the price of two fore-quarters of beef being £5 15s. 1d.—I said I would give him the £1 when I had sold some of the fore-quarter—I sent for one fore-quarter, and my man brought it—the prisoner came later in the morning, and I paid him the £1—he said he would bring me the remaining fore-quarter—I waited till 12 a.m. for him, but he did not bring it, so I sent my man to the market to look for him—he did not find him, so I went to the prisoner's house and found him there—I said, "Where is my meat?" and he said, "Leave my house immediately. I will never buy meat for you. I will show you what I can do"—he said that the second fore-quarter was in the hands of a butcher, and he was going to sell it"—I laid, "I am a poor woman; give me my meat," whereupon he said, "You go away," and he drove me out of the house—I called a policeman, who took his address.</p>

I said, "Yes"—the constable then arrested him—I went to the police station with them, and had my nose dressed—after that I went to the hospital in City Road, where I remained a fortnight—I cannot see so well with my left eye now as I could before the blow.</p>

I was on duty at Spitalfields on the night of January 15th, when the prosecutor came up and complained to me that he had been assaulted and robbed in Flower and Dean street, which is about 100 yards from where I was—I told him to go to one end of Flower and Dean Street whilst I went to the other—he then pointed out the prisoner, who was standing in a doorway with another man, and said, "That is the man who stole my watch, while the other man assaulted me"—the prisoner said, "This man has made a mistake.

I am working for the man who makes the notes so I have to make a bit out of it for myself when I can I said. I will take three now at 15s. each; that is my price"—he said, "I must see the boss, and hear what he says about the price"—I said, "Perhaps you can introduce me to the boss"—he said, "No, I cannot do that, as I do not know enough about you, but if you wait here I will bring one for you to inspect"—that was all that was said—we then went to the Unicorn—we left the Red Lion because two men came in who knew me and, thinking they might recognise me, I thought it advisable to leave—from the Unicorn we went to the George and Dragon in Hackney Road, where Robinson left me, saying he was going to see the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi>—the George and Dragon is not far from 20, Victoria Street—he returned in a short</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190502060035"/>
               <p>time, and said he could not get one, as the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi> and the old woman had gone to the music hall—after a time I went into the fish shop, which is next door to the George and Dragon—I parted with Robinson just before I went in—he went down Hackney Road—I waited in the fish shop—Robinson returned and said, "They are not back yet"—we then went to the Horns at Shoreditch, which is close to the George and Dragon—Robinson left me there—he was absent a short time, and on his return he called me on one side of the bar saying, "It is all right," and produced a piece of paper, from behind which he showed me what purported to be a £5 note (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) numbered 34350, and dated June 11th, 1904—Robinson said, "There it is; what do you think of it?"—during the conversation he looked up and said, "There is the boss; I will introduce you to him," and he introduced Holloway to me—we were in the private bar—Holloway asked me what I was—I replied, a seaman about to sail for the Mediterranean, where I could get rid of a few notes for him—he replied, "All right"—I was dressed like a merchant sailor—I asked Holloway if he made the notes himself and he said, "Yes, they are very good; what do you think of it?"—I said, "Very good"—he and Robin<lb/>son then had some conversation, which I did not hear—Robinson came to me and said, "You can have this one for 15s."—I said, "All right" and gave him the money—he asked for 1s. for himself, which I gave him—Harman came into the bar while the conversation was going on, she stayed by Holloway's side—after I had bought the note Robinson went across to them, and eventually beckoned me over to them—Holloway said to me, "That is the only one I can let you have at present, but could let you have two more by Saturday afternoon, as it takes forty-eight hours for them to dry"—I said, "All right"—the 22nd was Thursday—Robinson said in the other prisoners' hearing, "For God's sake do not try to split them in the United Kingdom, or you will get done in"—shortly afterwards Holloway and Harman left the house together—I left with Robin<lb/>son, and left him at the corner of Commercial Street—the same evening I give the counterfeit note to Inspector Ottaway, who initialled it in my presence—after each meeting I made a report to Ottaway, who had charge of the case—on Saturday, December 24th, I met Robinson at the Royal Standard—we went to the Horns—he left me for a short time—when he returned he said, "I have seen the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi>" at the same time producing from an envelope two Bank of Engraving notes—I said, "They are no good to me"—he said, "No; they are <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> ones, but they are all the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi> has got by him"—I did not take one of them—on December 27th, at 5 o'clock, I met Robinson at the King Lud, on Ludgate Hill—from there we went to a coffee house in Bishopsgate Street, and then to the Horns—we got there shortly before 7—I then said to him, "What about the busi<lb/>ness?" meaning the note—he replied, "All right, I will go and see the boss directly; it is no good me going in before 7"—he left the Horns and returned in a few minutes, saying, "There is someone following me, so I will wait a few minutes"—after a short time he went out again to see the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi>—he returned shortly and said, "You cannot have any more notes unless you let the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi> have the one you bought the other night, as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190502060036"/>
               <p>that was his copyright, and he cannot make any more without it"—I said, "I cannot do business like that, but if you like, tell the <hi rend="italic">boss</hi> to come and see me—we can talk the matter over"—he said, "All right, I will see what I can do"—he left the bar and returned in a short time with Holloway, who said, "I remember you from Thursday night"—he and I went into another bar, and I said, "What about the business?"—he said, 'I cannot make any more for you unless you let me have the one you had the other night, as it was my copyright; I have no machine, but do it all by hand; I will give you my address, but it must be in strict confidence between us"—he asked the barman for a pencil and paper to put his name and address on—the barman gave him a piece of paper, and he wrote his name and address upon it: "J. Harman, printer, 20, Victoria Street, Cooper's Gardens, Hackney Road"—he made an appointment for me to meet him on the 28th, and said I could bring the one he sold me or a good one the latter would suit him better—I replied, "All right"—he said, "How many do you want?"—I said, "Five"—he replied, "All right"—he then said, "When you knock at the door, if my wife comes, say,' An invitation from Joe '; if my daughter comes, say the same, and you will he admitted. You can then see me make them, and you can have what you want at 10s. each. If you require any more while you are away you must let me know and I will send them to you. Don't have any<lb/>thing to do with Robinson, as he is robbing us both. He only gave me 5s. out of the 15s. which you paid for the note on Thursday. My wife know what is going on, but my daughter does not. My wife is much older than me; in fact, she is <hi rend="italic">boss</hi>, so you will have to talk with her, but we must be careful, as there are some policemen who live close by"—I entered into the ordinary conversation—on December 28th, about 8 p.m., I went to 20, Victoria Street, Hackney—I knocked at the door—a young woman opened the door—a voice asked who was there—I said, "An invitation from Joe"—I got into the house—I found Holloway there with some friends—no business was done that night—I went out into Victoria Street with Holloway, and had some conversation with him—he said to me, "Have you got a good one with you?" meaning a note—I replied, "Yes"—he said, "Let me look at it"—I gave him a note—this is the one, number 73334—he examined it with a lighted match and said, "It is poor paper, but I can see it was good one"—he asked me to leave it with him and he would get the others ready by the next evening—I said, "No, I cannot do that, as I do not know much about you"—he said, "Well, you know where I live if you think there is anything wrong"—I said, "Can't you do them to-night?"—he replied, "No, I cannot leave my friends and go upstairs, as that is where I do the work; so if you can't leave the note with me to-night you must come to-morrow night at 7 o'clock and bring the note with you, and I will have everything ready except the transfer, as me and my wife will be alone"—I replied, "All right—next night I went to his house about 7.30 p.m.—Holloway opened the door—I went into the front room, and Holloway said, "I am a bit of a carpenter"—he was making this frame (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is a kind of easel—he said, "I Suppose you know what this is for?"—I said, "Yes "after he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190502060037"/>
               <p>finished he stood the easel on the table in this manner—then he took from the table a frame with a piece of glass in it, covered with a piece of white paper—he then asked me for my note, which I gave him—I cannot place this paper as it was then, because it was pasted over the note, or had some sticky substances to keep the paper in its place—this lamp (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) was placed on the table behind the easel—I watched him—he then took a piece of pencil and sat down on the stool and took a copy from my note on to the piece of white paper; this is the result—Harman was present, and part of the time her daughter—the operation took two and a half to three hours—when it was finished Holloway put it into this little black box with the frame, and the easel he put on the floor under the piano—I asked him if he would make the other notes from that copy, and he said. "Yes, but it must be inked over first"—Harman was prevent when that was said, but not the daughter—Holloway said the daughter knew that he made Rank of Engraving notes, but not the other ones—I said, "We cannot do business"—he said, "If you like to write I can send them to you. Don't be afraid to send the money; you will be sure to get the notes. You have got my address, so I cannot afford to lose my place for a couple of pounds"—I said, "No, it would be rather too danger<lb/>ous"—he said he would send them to any part of the world if I liked—he handed me back the genuine note—Harman was then present, but not the daughter—after the daughter had left the room Harman said, "She knows we make the Bank of Engraving notes, but not the others; we could not trust her. We might have a few words and she might open her mouth "—that is all that happened in the house then—I left about 10 o'clock—nothing was said on that evening about inking the tracings over—that was mother time—Holloway showed me some Bank of Engraving notes that evening—I was present on the 30th at the arrest of Harman.</p>

I could let you have two more by Saturday afternoon. It takes forty-eight hours for them to dry"—I said, "All right"—Robinson said in the hearing of Holloway," For God's sake don't try to split that in the United Kingdom or you will be done in"—Harman was sitting within hearing distance—I cannot say if she is deaf—I did not see or speak to her between December 22nd and 28th—no business was done on the 28th—her daughter is about twenty-two years old—she is married—she was back<lb/>wards and forwards during the whole time that Holloway was tracing the note—she could not see the front face of the note he was tracing—he con<lb/>cealed nothing when the girl came into the room.</p>

My wife's uncle used to make them; he has been dead about four years and left about 1,000 behind"—I said, "What are <hi rend="italic">lils?</hi>"—he said, "They are Bank of En<lb/>graving notes which people have to make them appear <hi rend="italic">flash.</hi> I know nothing about Bank of England notes.

I have seen that man before "(pointing to Collyer), "having a drink with Hollo<lb/>way. I did not see what they were doing. You say we have been chang<lb/>ing Bank notes; I have never seen one"—the house was then searched—that was directed by Inspector Holmes—amongst the articles found, I found this pencil tracing of this £5 Bank of England note—I showed it to Harman—she said she had never seen it—there were some letters found—one upon the kitchen mantelpiece (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "19th December, 1904.

Send those with the blackest ink"—other letters were also found, principally addressed to Mrs. Harman—they come from Manchester, Newcastle, Salford, and Birmingham—they have relation to forged or flash notes—later that same day I arrested Robinson at the White Hart, Holborn—I said, "I want to speak to you outside; we are police officers. I am going to arrest you on a charge of being concerned with a man named Holloway and a woman named Harman for being concerned on the 22nd inst. in having forged and uttered a £6 Bank of England note"—he said, "I know absolutely nothing about it"—I took him to Old Jewry—on the way he said, "Who do you say I am charged with?"—I said, "A man named Holloway and a woman named Harman, of 20, Victoria Street"—he said, "I do not know them or where they live"—he was searched at the police office, and on him was found a Bank of Engraving note—when that was found he said, "Now it it coming to me"—a visiting card was found on him with the name, "F. C Pearce"—a letter was also found from a correspondent at Cambridge, signing himself, "Yours sincerely, Eddie"—the three prisoners were charged at the station—I then produced the forged note and the tracing—I said to the prisoners, "This is the document you are charged with forging, and this I found at your house, Holloway"—he said, "It is false; I have never seen a forged note.

When he comes to-morrow morning tell him to do it himself'"—pointing to the tracing he said, "I knew all about that being in the box; that's what I did last night as he promised me money"—pointing to the forged note, he said "I have never seen it before "Harman said, "I knew nothing about it; it has never been in our house"—I said, "Evidence will be called to prove Robinson got the note from Holloway and sold it to Collyer for 15s., and that Robinson afterwards gave Harman the money"—Holloway said, "It is false; we do not know this man," pointing to Robinson—Harman said, "I have never seen this man (Robin<lb/>son) in my life"—Robinson made no reply—Holloway described himself as single, and Harman said she was a widow—I and Holmes found this printing type at 20, Victoria Street—they were left as they were found—I also found type letters consisting of "land "and "k "in the same size type as "Bank of Engraving "; also some copper plates with "5 "and" "10" cut out from them, and this plate with "ten "engraved on it—it is from that plate this impression is taken.</p>

I come across a good many people with Bank of Engraving notes—they are used by men getting their living by fraud—confidential trick men generally carry them; they also use them for appearing to be flush with money—there are a large number in circulation and have been for years—I should say these plates have been cut out recently, within the last month or two; it may be within the last week or two—there was a complete copper plate and a Bank of En<lb/>graving note and three stones—I found nothing on the stones except what related to the Bank of Engraving—all the Bank of Engraving notes have ap<lb/>parently been printed from lithographic stones—the Bank of England note has been drawn by hand; the letters "L, a, n, d," were loose, but all in the same box—since they were found they were put together and printed by the police—the "ten "could be used on a Bank of Engraving note or a Bank of England note—I found nothing from which a Bank of England note could be printed, or a Bank of England note set up in any form.</p>

The King v. Linsberg and Leies</hi> a very important question arises, and that is whether the mere act of false imprisonment without any assault or battery is not only a wrong for which a civil action could be brought, but is also an indictable offence. I am satisfied, after some doubt, by the authorities quoted by Mr. Gill, that the mere false imprisonment without an assault can be, and in this case is, an indictable offence. The authorities show that the actual imprisonment of a man, depriving him of his liberty (it happens in this case it was by locking a doctor up so that he should not go about his business, obliging him to stay in the house or room of the particular patient)—the authorities show that such an act may be indictable; but there is a real distinction between a civil case which is merely the subject of a civil action, and one which may be made the subject of a criminal prosecution (of course every false imprisonment and assault which may be the subject of imprisonment may also be treated at a cause for civil action for damages) and the difference I am satisfied is this: where a defendant imprisons another without having any belief in a legal right, not by mistake, but without any belief in a legal right, he knowing that he is merely exercising a strong hand and using his own power to imprison a man—where a defendant commits such an act, he is first guilty of what the law calls an assault that is of rather a technical nature , and in the second place of a criminal assault. The case of <hi rend="italic">Hunter v. Johnson</hi> (Law Reports, 13 Queen's Bench) would seem to be an authority that even where a man believes that he has a right to imprison another, his act may be treated as an indictable offence. I, however, doubt that, but where a man takes upon himself to imprison another, depriving him of his liberty, merely exercising the force and power to serve his own object, without any belief in a legal right to do to, then he is guilty of a criminal assault. As a fact, it is clear on the depositions that this is what the defendants did in this case, but after the plea of guilty there is no need to go further into that—it is conceded by the counsel who appears for the defendants, and, the matter having been argued, I have only to decide that this is a criminal act, that a
mere false imprisonment</p>

               <p>without any lawful authority, without any belief in a lawful authority is a criminal act, and, there being a conviction on this one count, it is unnecessary to state a case for a higher Court to determine the point. As to the prisoners themselves, the case is one in which it is not necessary to inflict any punishment unless the offence is repeated. It in important that they and people of their class, against whom it is useless and hope<lb/>less to take any civil remedy, because they never can pay any damages, should know that they may be criminally dealt with if they take the law into their own hands in this way." <rs id="t19050206-196-punishment-33" type="punishmentDescription">

I do not think it differs from the normal accent of an Englishman"—it was rather a deep voice, but not unusually deep—I did not say anything about his voice when giving a description to Inspector Filler—my description, which was a verbal one, was, "A big man dressed in black frock coat with silk facings, and a tall silk hat; showing what seemed to be a white waistcoat, or shirt front; big build; tall and stout"—the prisoner is tall, and decidedly broad, and I should tall him a man of big build, and rather stout—he is not very stout now; I think he was a little stouter; he looked stout at the counter—I am not positive that I said anything about his height in feet and inches; I said he was tall—it is possible that I may have said at tat Police Court, "I do not remember the colour of the waistcoat"; the prisoner having his coat buttoned up it was difficult to tell; there was very little waistcoat to be seen at all—January 6th was a fine day; I think it was a little muddy under foot—when identifying the prisoner I noticed the men's faces and general build; I did not look at their boots—it struck me that there was a resemblance between the two men I picked but, but or closer examination it did not seem to me that the second man was the right one; he was of rather coarser countenance—I think the prisoner was the most respectable looking man of all of them—the man who passed the cheque was a respectable looking man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Beyond the fact of it being so late, and being kept waiting, there wax nothing unusual about the transaction with the prisoner—there wan another customer there at the time, but I paid attention to the prisoner standing by the counter on account of the large amount of the cheque which was being paid close upon 4 p.m.—there have been cheques of large amounts cashed for Mr. Fox, but there is generally more notice taken of a cheque of that amount being presented so late in the day—we do pay large amounts over the counter, but not so often as we do through bankers—it was not my duty to be at the counter except at that time of the day—I remember the prisoner's face more especially—I noticed he was wearing a tall hat, and a frock coat, the lower button of which was buttoned up—I am not prepared to way he had a white waistcoat on, but whatever kind of waistcoat he was wearing, it was a very open one and exposed an amount of shirt front—I said at the Police Court, "All of the prisoner's dress that I can remember is his frock coat and tall hat"—I do not think I mentioned a white waistcoat—the men were side by side in a long row—the prisoner was not direct I opposite me when he was cashing the cheque, but I bad a good full face view of him—it does not necessarily follow that because I am behind the counter I am directly opposite to him—as near as possible the description I gave of him to the police was "Dressed in a tall hat and frock coat; of fairly gentlemanly appearance; inclined to be dark, with a fairly broad face, and rather inclined to be sallow complexioned"—I think January 6th was a fairly bright day; as far as I recollect, I do not think it was particularly muddy underfoot—I did not look at the men's boots; I had no reason to do so—there were a number of them dressed in a gentlemanly sort of style, and of gentlemanly appearance—I should not care to say that the prisoner was the most gentlemanly looking of them all—I believe I walked once or twice up and down the line before I identified the prisoner; he was not quite in the centre but towards the right end of the line—the principal cause of my identifying him was his features—he had a dark moustache, somewhat of the same colour as the prisoner's, but not in the same shape as he has it at the present moment; it was slightly straighter—he was more of a French appearance than the prisoner—the prisoner is inclined to be of a sallow complexion—I daresay three months makes an alteration in a complexion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Cook &amp; Sons, at Ludgate Hill—I remember these two £50 notes being cashed—about 4.30 p.m. on September 22nd, a gentleman came in and I heard him ask for £100 worth of French money—as I was some two desks away I did not pay much attention to him—my colleague asked me what rate he should give, and I heard some discussion as to whether he should take gold or notes—just at that moment I left my desk to go down to either ask a question of or do something to my colleague, and when I got to him I saw the prisoner going out, leaving half the money on the counter; I would not be sure whether it was the notes or gold—I called out, "Here, you are leaving half your money behind you," and he turned round, took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190502060063"/>
               <p>the money, and rushed out of the office—that is all I saw of him—what attracted my attention was his leaving half the money behind—customers usually take the trouble to count and see if the amount is correct—the following morning the police left a note saying that certain notes had been stolen and giving their numbers—I then saw the numbers on the two £50 notes corresponded with two of the numbers on the list—the police did not know that anybody had been to us with the notes before sending us the letter—they did so as a matter of course—in the course of business it bank with the London and Westminster Bank, Temple Bar branch, and notes taken after 4 p.m. would be paid into the bank the next morn<lb/>ing about 10 a.m.—the next time I saw the man was on January 13th, at the Westminster Police Court—I was asked to pick out from nine or ten men in a line the individual who, as far as my recollection served me, re<lb/>sembled the one who presented the notes—after some hesitation I picked out the prisoner—of course, the transaction took place very hurriedly, and with the exception of getting sight of his dress, I did not see very much of his face—I could not pick him out by his dress, as he was dressed is a different attire; I picked him out by his general bearing as I had a idea of that—I can only say to the best of my belief he was the man who presented the notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is nothing unusual in a man changing £100 into French money—a man hurrying to catch a Continental train might leave half a sovereign behind, but it is unusual to leave £60—I cannot recollect very much about the police coming and seeing me in December—when describing him to the police in January I said that he had a frock coat, a silk hat, and what we call a wide waistcoat on, showing a good hit of his tie—it was not a white waistcoat—when I identified him at was wearing a grey overcoat with a tall hat—there were four or five others wearing silk hats, and one or two with frock coats—before identifying the man I had the idea that he was a man of fairly moderate height—I only caught a glimpse of his face—I cannot say whether ho had a black moustache—I said at the police station that there was some resemblance between the prisoner and an acquain<lb/>tance of mine—that was the thing that made me look—that resemblance certainly gave me the impression that the prisoner was the man who changed the notes when I identified him.</p>

               <p>you for forging and uttering a cheque for £819 about 4 p.m. on the after<lb/>noon of September 22nd last, at a bank in Victoria Street"—he made no reply at the moment, and I said, "Do you understand what I have just said?" he said, "Yes, I understand, but I know nothing about it"—he made no sign of surprise whatever—on the, way to the station, he said, "You know I shall deny this"—he gave me his address, but, of course, I knew it already; we had been waiting for him to come out—I went to that house in the evening and found in a small ante-room hanging behind the door, the frock coat with silk facings, which has been produced to Mr. Yallop.</p>

               <p>I believe, of last year—he attended at 10 or 10.30 a.m.—I was not par<lb/>ticular to half an hour, and he was allowed one hour for dinner—he gave me minor assistance at my operations—on September 22nd I had a chronic tonsilitis case—I have my book here (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and I find recorded in it an operation on the tonsils, the name of my patient being Oswald—we do not call removing the tonsils a severe operation, it is a matter of a septic afterwards to arrest hemorrhage, and the prisoner prepared that for me on this occasion—there was very little hemorrhage; the solution of iron prevented that—my patient arrived at a few minutes to 4 and the operation took something like half an hour—the prisoner was in attendance at the time; he had been there from 3 p.m., which is his usual time to return from dinner—he must have been there from that time, as he was never out after that time—he works in the dispen<lb/>sary, the door of which opens into the consulting room—it was originally one room with the consulting room, but I had it partitioned off for con<lb/>venience—it would certainly not be possible for anyone to leave the dis<lb/>pensary without anyone in the consulting room knowing about it—during the time the operation was taking place the prisoner was in and out of the dispensary—he prepared the septic and brought it in to me—he certainly did not go out immediately after the operation—he remained till he left in the evening about 9.30 or 9 p.m.—he left me, I think, the first week in October—I gave him £4 in cash—I am relying on my memory for that, as I have no record—I had no banking account—I understood that after that ho was at the Brewers' Exhibition exhibiting there at a stall—he informed me that he had done so for some years—I believe, besides helping me to dispense, he travelled in brewers' accessories—this is a leaflet I have published with reference to my practice in Aus<lb/>tralia and the Colonies—I have letters from many well-known persons with whom I am intimate.</p>

"I am glad you are here; you will be called presently," and then he went upstairs to quite another part—my patient is still living</p>

               <p>it London—I have certainly not tried to find him—I have nothing to do with instructing Mr. Simmonds for the defence; I am only here to prove the innocence of an innocent man—it is a pure coincidence that Mr. Simmonds has acted for me on other occasions—on June 12th, 1901, at the Bow Street Police Court, when I believe two men in my employ were fined for distributing indecent literature, Mr. Binham acted for me—as a medical specialist I advertise—it is a matter of comment whether there is anything indecent in the bills I distribute by way of advertisement, I have had so many little persecutions of this nature it would be impossible to remember them all—sometimes I have no representative in Court what-so ever—my men are sometimes taken up at 11 a.m., taken before the Magistrate, and in quarter or half an hour sometimes fined and sometimes dismissed—very probably a man named Foster was fined on November 18th, 1902—all the tines were paid by me—some of the men preferred to go to prison for seven days and have the fine from me when they came out—I would not allow a man to suffer in my employ—I know Dr. Eliza Foster Macdonach, M.D.—I saw her a few weeks back in Town—she has nothing to do with my business, and I do not know where she is now—she is one of the first qualified women in England—the might be the same woman as Dr. Foster Macdonach or Mrs. E. Foster—she qualified in England under the name of Eliza Foster Macdonach, but when she married in Switzerland she had to take her husband's name, Frick<lb/>art—there is no Mrs. Bridgwater, and there is certainly not anyone passing under that name to my knowledge—I do not live with any woman—I cannot account for the prisoner saying that he knew Mrs. Bridgwater—it must be a pure hallucination on his part—I was in partnership with a lady once, some years back, but it does not follow that she is my wife—I first knew of this forgery when I saw the case in the newspaper some time last month—until that time my mind had not been called back it all to September 22nd—I have never heard of Edwin Marshall Fox except through this case, nor that he had an office at 28, Victoria Street—I have had the honour of knowing Miss Toovey three or four years as a patient—my relations with her were purely those of medical man and patient—beyond seeing her at my consulting rooms, and at the Court here I have not seen her anywhere—I have not the remotest idea what she is—" Mrs. Toovey "is the name she gave, and with her address it is entered in my book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in 1903—I believe that she changed her address from Battersea to Streatham Hill—I suppose she attended something like twenty times altogether—I cannot tell you the last time she attended—I have no record of it, as it was a private case—I have never been to her house—if Miss Toovey said, "I had a sweetheart who was a doctor, I say now that the doctor referred to is Dr. Talbot Bridgwater, of Oxford Street," it is purely imaginary on her part—as to her saying, "I have known him for two years, and always understood him to be a bachelor, that is from the time that I said she first consulted me—it is quite correct if she said, "I first made his acquaintance through con<lb/>sulting him professionally. I saw him several times professionally"—if she said "I believe we got fond of each other some time after we became</p>

               <p>acquainted," that was a belief expressed by her—I cannot, account for it, except on hysterical grounds—as to her saying, "First I used see him professionally about once a week, but since then less than once a month." it was very much less than once a month—at first it was neces<lb/>sary for me to see her once and twice a week, but as she got better there was no cause for her to call so frequently—I do not think I have seen her at the last twice in twelve months—if she said, "Somewhere about twelve months ago Dr. Bridgwater mentioned to me that he had a passing thought that he would like to leave England and go back to Australia," it is true—probably I have said it to hundreds of people—as to her saving that I had been in England ten years, it is true that I have been in Eng<lb/>land eleven years—if she said, "In the course of conversation about this, there was a suggestion as to whether I would cure to go with him," It certainly is not true—" I asked in what capacity, and he replied that perhaps we could work together in a medical way"; it is ridiculous to ask me to remember a conversation twelve months ago, but to the best of my belief that certainly is not true—it is impossible for me to remember whether she said, "I should like to learn dispensing work"—I am aware that for the last twelve months she has been taking lessons, but she was certainly not doing so for the purpose of qualifying herself to act with me—I understood she was learning painting and dressmaking—lady patients will tell you of their troubles and their little affaire—it is very possible that eighteen months ago Mr. Marshall Fox saw me with her in Odone's Restaurant in Victoria Street—I remember I said that I had not seen her outside my consulting room—that is the one exception—I remember her calling upon me some time after September 22nd—I am quite sure she did not tell me anything of the forgery within a week of its occurrence—she may have mentioned it to me some time after—she told me she had a lodger, an American, who had gone away, and she was rather in doubt whether he had anything to do with the affair, and she said she would dearly like to have it found out—she said there had been some trouble "in the office," by which I thought she meant the typewriting office—she said there had been a robbery of a lot of money, £800, and the man who had robbed the bank was over six feet high, and spoke with an American accent—she said her lodger had gone a day or two after the robbery—I have told you all she said—she did not tell me anything of the description of her lodger—she said it was a cheque stolen from her employer's cheque book—I can almost swear that she did not tell me the name of the bank, nor did she tell me the name of her employer, or where his office was—it was no business of mine—I said, "I am very sorry to hear it. I hope you will soon have everything discovered and everything all right," and I expressed my sympathy with her—as to her saying, "Somewhere about a week after the forgery, on September 22nd, I went up to see Dr. Bridgwater, and I told him all about the forgery. He was greatly surprised, and sympathised with me," I did not express any surprise—now you have refreshed my memory I remember that it was on that occasion that I first heard of the forgery, and not from reading it in the newspaper, as I mud before—a man named Shackell entered my</p>

               <p>employ in July or August of last year as an outside man—he came and liked for work, without any introduction or recommendation, as I never want any—this was ho fore the prisoner entered my employ—he may have told me that he had known Shackell seven or eight year, but he certainly did not introduce him to me—he was a superior bill man, looking after the other bill men—I had known him five to nine years—I knew he was a clerk with a man named Keen, a house and estate agent, in New Oxford Street, and he drew up the agreement for my premises in New Oxford Street about nine years ago—I knew nothing of him since then, and before he came into my employment I knew that he had made a <hi rend="italic">faux pas</hi>, but I did not think that that should bar every channel of honest labour to him—I did not know that he had been convicted at this Court for forgery—it was reported in the newspapers that he was on ticket-of-leave—I had a man in my employ named Albert Boxall on September 22nd—he left some three or four months after he came to me—Shackell left my employ, I should say, some time in January—I paid him every night—I could dismiss him at any moment—he could only work when the rather was fine—I gave him a reference to get some furniture at the time, but only for a few pounds' worth—Mr. R. Simmonds, of 231a, Euston Road, furniture dealer, came to see me on October 16th, and asked me if I knew a man named Shackell—I believe he asked me whether he was a straightforward man, but I cannot tell you what transpired now—I simply told him that he was in my employ—very likely I told him that he was employed by the day,' and might be dismissed at any moment—I knew that he had been trying to go straight, and I gave him the best reference I could under the circumstances—I have never been to the Punch Tavern in Fleet Street in my life—I was certainly not in Cook's office in Ludgate Street in September, nor did I change any French money there on September 26th—I did not have any French money in that month—I have never given one of these Napoleon pieces (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) to the prisoner, to my knowledge, nor have I ever seen one in his possession—I have certainly not any bank thieves among my ac<lb/>quaintances, nor have I any reason to think that any of my patients have been such—I knew Billy Wigram some years ago at a patient—it is very probable that I have been seen in his company—I like to make my patients my friends—as a professional man I know all sorts and conditions of people—I have known James Duncan Robertson for some twenty-five years—I knew him on Australia, and I should be very proud to be seen in his company—his father was one of the wealthiest man in Australia—I do not know a man named Henry F. Cook, nor do I know him by the name of Burns—I see Robertson's and Billy Wigram's photographs are here (<hi rend="italic">"Police Gazette "of August</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1903, <hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), to<lb/>gether with that of Burnt—it is very possible that these three men were convicted of stealing £1,500 from a stockbroker's clerk in a bank in Glas<lb/>gow—it was all in the newspapers at the time and everybody knew of it—I knew there was another man implicated in the charge, besides Robertson and Wigram, but I did not know Burns—I will certainly swear that I did not help them with money for their defence—a man named Joseph</p>

               <p>Haynes is at the present moment my dispenser—I believe that some money was subscribed for their defence by some racing men, and Haynes went to Glasgow with the money—I was not in the position, neither had I the inclination, to subscribe anything—if there were any forgers amongst my acquaintances they would not tell me so, I suppose—I have never heard of a man who went by the name of Dr. Ross, otherwise Captain Gill, otherwise Douglas Coleman, in my life, nor do I know a man named Kimpton—I am certainly not acquainted with any abortionists, and I do not know a man named Leone Tomaso—I knew a man named James Adie who was sent to prison for seven years for abortion—I knew him as a doctor—I did not know that the man with whom he was con<lb/>victed was Tomaso—Adie certainly did not live near me when I lived at 1, Park Mansions, Vauxhall, in 1898—I think 1898 was the year of Adie's <hi rend="italic">faux pas</hi>—I was in New Oxford Street—I had no residential premises in 1896 or 1897—I did not go from Vauxhall to where I am at present—it may have been that I left my address at Vauxhall at the time Adie made his <hi rend="italic">faux pas</hi>, but I cannot tell you now—he lived in Blackfriars Road at that time.</p>

I saw the man who was behind, namely, the prisoner, draw up to the first man and strike him with his hand. I do not know if he had anything in his hand. When the prisoner got up to the first man the latter turned round, and it was then the prisoner struck him about the face or cheat. The man gave two or three screams, and fell down backwards. The prisoner then walked away. The man who had fallen, then got up and followed the prisoner. I saw the prisoner afterwards retrace his steps towards the other man and go up to him and speak to him, and then turn away and walk away again. They went up to the corner of Hart Street in the High Street, the injured man calling out.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's clerk, and live at 12, Belgrave Street, King's Cross—late on January 9th I was near Arthur Street, the High Street end, just by St. Giles' Church—I heard a shout and looked up Arthur Street in the direction of Oxford Street—I saw the prosecutor fall between fifty or sixty yards from me—I stayed where I was—I kept my eyes on the man who fell—he picked himself up and commenced to walk down the street towards me—I saw the prisoner there; he came first—I waited at the end of the street until they came up to me—the prisoner seemed to be walking at an ordinary pace; the prosecutor was following him—when the prisoner passed me he seemed somewhat dejected, so I waited till the prosecutor came; he also seemed dejected, and screamed out that he had been stabbed—he pulled his clothes open all in a bunch, and I saw blood—a constable ran across from St. Giles' Church—I took the prosecutor to Bow Street; the policeman took the prisoner—I took the prosecutor to Long Acre without assistance, when he became faint and I had a job to get him to Bow Street—I did not hear anything said by the men before the prosecutor came to me—I did not see any blow struck.</p>

Lately I was a wine merchant—I live at 38, Cassidy Road, Fulham—I have been in England for twenty one month—I knew the prisoner almost at once after I came—I was on tolerably friendly terms with him—we were not particularly interested in each other—I had some trouble with him about two months before January 9th—we had a fight; we saw each other once after that—on January 9th I went to Maurino's restaurant at 21, Arthur Street—I saw the prisoner there—I spoke to the owner of the shop, not to the prisoner—I left the prisoner in the shop when I went away to go to New Oxford Street—that was 11.15 or 11.30 p.m.—about a minute afterwards I saw the prisoner in Arthur Street—he beckoned to me and said he wished to speak to me—I turned round to speak to him and he seized me by the collar—I fell to the ground and remained there for about a minute without knowing what I was doing—when I got up I asked him why he was doing this to me as I had not harmed him in any way—he said nothing, and went away—I unbuttoned my coat because I felt I was bathed in blood—I had had one blow in my chest before I fell—I then went towards the church—I was taken to the police station—I saw something, but I do not know what I was struck with—I did not strike the prisoner at all that night.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 57, Russell square, and am divisional surgeon at How Street—on January 9th, about 11.30 p.m., I was called to see the prosecutor—he was sitting in the surgeon's room looking very pale—his coat was partly open, showing that his shirt was covered with blood—I proceeded to move his shirt, and I saw a vertical wound on his left breast about two inches long—it was deep—I intro<lb/>duced my finger and found it went as low as the ribs—it was deeper in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> direction under the skin, as though the blow had been struck from above downwards—it was not bleeding much—his clothes were cut over the situation of the wound—there were corresponding marks—the wound would be caused by some sharp cutting instrument—the cuts in the clothes were perfectly clean—I did not see a knife at all—it would have to be a very sharp knife with a long narrow blade—I should say, roughly, it must have been five inches or six inches long—I got the whole length of my little finger into the wound—I have seen this cork (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); there is a slit in it as though something had been struck into it—sharp pointed knives are often carried in that way—it seems to have been stuck in twice—the cut is of a V shape—it gives one an idea of the width of the blade—I can make no comparison with the slits in the cork and the wound in the prosecutor—I did what I had to do as rapidly as possible, and then sent him to King's College Hospital—he needed immediate attention—he was in danger at that time—no intimation had been given to me that any other wound had been given—it would have been wrong for me to strip him in that condition—I saw him again at the Police Court, I think, on the 17th—he has got well very rapidly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is an ordinary wine cork, I should say—I cannot say if the knife which has been inserted in it was the knife which caused the wounds.</p>

I live at 8, Cambridge Road, Hanwell—I have some stables at Southfield Cottages, Oakland Road, for fourteen horses—there are some other stables there also—the prisoner was employed by me until July, 1904. when I prosecuted him for assaulting me—he was convicted and fined—he never came back to my service—I saw him about the stables on two or three occasions after that—on one occasion it was in the very early morning, when it was dark—in August a fire took place at ray stables—I counted it in three or four places—it was put out, without much damage, by the Fire Brigade and the police—that was in the early morning—on December 9th it was found that three of my horses were tied together in such a way that if one of them had fallen, the others would have been strangled—the rope was so tight that a man could not get a finger in someone had broken into the stable, but the door still remained locked—on the early morning of January 9th I was called to my stables—they had been on fire, but had been put out—one horse lay dead—the amount of the damage to myself was over £1000—the staples of the door had been pulled away—it is generally fastened with a padlock attached to the upper part of the door—when the staples are removed the upper part can be opened and a man could lean over and unbolt the lower part—that is apparently what had been done—I examined the fowl house in the yard—some of the fowls were dead—on that night the stable yard was not dry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My loss was covered by insurance, but it is not paid yet—the insurance company does not deny the liability in regard to the amount of the actual loss—I have been in business nearly three years; sometimes I employ twenty men, sometimes forty—I have frequent changes—where you have a number of men there is bound to be some point raised—I do not think I have seen the prisoner in Hanwell except near my stables—he spoke to me on one occasion, not knowing who I was; he shouted out, u Is that you, Bill?"—that is a horse keeper—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "I want a job"—I said, "We do not want anybody, thank you"—nothing more was said—I have never spoken to him since—on all the occasions I met him it was in the morning, and he turned his head away—on each occasion he was close to the stables in Oakland Road—I do not know where he was working—when I saw him he was not walking along as if he was going to work—it was 6.15 or 6.30 a.m. in December—I did not know he was working at the gravel pit in the vicinity—on January 9th my stable yard was muddy—it has been very muddy since November—January 9th was a very dry day; there had been no rain for three or four days—the yard was wet owing to its being made of ashes or clinkers, which were ground up by the traffic, and there were no drains in the yard—it comes over your shoe-tops as a rule—the road outside is of different metal and would not be in the same condition—I know the canal—there is a considerable amount of traffic there—the towing path would not be in the same condition as my yard if there had been rain recently, because it is different material—a man walking along the towing-path on January 9th would not get his boots muddy—my yard is drier now than it has been during the winter.</p>

                  </hi> (263 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>) At 1.10 on January 9th I was on duty in Boston Road, Hanwell, near the Victoria public-house, in the shadow of a gateway—I saw the prisoner coming along Boston Road towards me from the other side of Rosebank Road—he was very excited, out of breath, brushing his clothes down, and rubbing his boots, which were very muddy, one on top of the other—a man named Jolly was also in Boston Road—the prisoner spoke to him—I joined them, and told the prisoner it was time he was home—he said, "I have just come across the fields. I must be off to the top of Ealing"—I said, "What, do you live up there now?"—he said. "Oh, they are always after me"—I said, "They won't be after you at long as you don't get up to <hi rend="italic">none</hi> your tricks"—he said, "Good-night," and I went away towards Orange Road—he did not go away—about three minutes afterwards I saw flames and smoke coming from the stables—I went there—I was the first person there—I found that the staples of the stable door had already been removed and the upper part of the door was open—I blew my whistle—somebody else gave the alarm, and the firemen came—when I got there the fire was in the middle stable, in the part separating the stall where the dead horse was from the loose box—I saw another fire which had burnt itself out in the right-hand stall in the corner—there were three fires altogether—we saved the rest of the horses, and the fire was put out—later that morning I went with Sergeant Hedley to the prisoner's lodgings at 17, Glenfield Terrace—the prisoner let in—he was dressed—Hedley arrested him—he said, "I do not know anything about the fire at Wilson's stables."—that night was very dry—the stable yard was very wet and muddy.</p>

I then came to Hanwell across the locks, along St. Margaret's Road and up Rosebank Road, where I met Harry Jolly. I spoke to him; he was standing in the centre of the road when I came up.

Colebrook, now in custody, and charged with arson, which I am innocent of, this day of our Lord, January 17th, 1905. Your Worships, I left home as usual on Sunday night at 6 o'clock, January 8th, 1905, and proceeds to the main road, along of a man, a fellow-lodger, Mr. Rouse, and went into the Green Man Hotel, and we had a drink together. Then we came out together, and he went to Acton and I bid him good-night and went to Hanwell to go to my young woman's house, as I had been accustomed to do for the past eighteen months or one year and six months, which, your Worships, I failed to do this night. I went into the Victoria public-house, and there I stopped drinking with one man and then another, and of course I got the worse for drink, which I had kept away from since I was summoned for an assault on Mr. Wilson last summer. Your Worships, while I was in the Victoria public-house, one man that lives next door to my young woman said to me, 'Now, Charlie, why don't you go down below?' I said, 'No, I shall not go down now, it is too late,' and then I stopped till turning-out time, which was 10 o'clock, your Worships, And then, instead of going home to my lodgings in 17, Glenfield Terrace, Westfield Road, Ealing, I went down towards St. Margaret's Road down St. Dunstan's Road, where my young woman lives at the bottom, and instead of going there then I proceeded towards the Fox public-house, which is at the bottom of Green Lane, and then I wandered up the tow-path to the locks, which takes you across the fields to the Hare and Hounds beer-house. I went across the fields and out into the road. Then I went up the road towards Mr. Macklin's gravel-pit, which we called Norwood, where I worked several times, and then I must have fell asleep against the gate of the pit, where the carts go in and come out. When I came to myself a little and woke up cold I stood there for a little while and wondered what I was doing there that time of night, then I walked on past the Hare and Hounds, and there was no light. After going some distance up Zion Lane, I turned back to go home again. When I turned back 1 heard it strike 12 o'clock by Spring Grove Church. then I pulled myself together and came out and came on across the fields again, and over the locks and along the tow-path, where I got my shoes covered in mud and horse dung, then 1 came along St. Margaret's Road again by the girl's house, but I did not stop. I went on and up Rosebank Road, by Mr. H. Jolly's house, and then to the top of the road, where I saw the said Mr. H. Jolly, and he said to me, 'Hullo, Charlie, where have you come from?' I said, 'Across the fields by the Hare and Hounds.' He said, then, 'I am up a bit late because the mother is not very well,' or words to that effect. While we were talking together a policeman came from the direction of the Victoria public-house, and both me and Mr. Jolly spoke to him, and then the constable said to me, 'Ain't you going home, Charlie?' I said to him, 'There you are again; you want to know my business again.' He said to me, 'We do not so long as you do not get up to no tricks.' With that he went away and left me and Mr. Jolly together. I then said to H. Jolly, 'Good-night,' and went straight home. When I was going up the Cambridge Rood I heard the fire-call, and when</p>

After his conviction he was handed over to the prison authorities, and I had no more to do with him—I did not examine his person for his marks—this is his photograph—in 1902 he had only a moustache—this photograph was sent up here from Hull; I have had nothing to do with it—I produce a document purporting to be signed by Mr. Weston of Borstal Prison, dated November 16th, 1904, giving the prisoner's marks—I received it from the convict supervision office, Scotland Yard—the prisoner was identified by the finger print system.</p>

               <p>house on the Wednesday morning—I saw him there—my wife was present when he came—there was a burst pipe in the street and the waterman came and took me away—when I came back there was a crowd—the prisoner stood there and threatened to do for me and my wife—he gave no reason—in consequence of that I took proceedings against him—I sent my wife for a constable—the prisoner was bound over—he came to my house on sub-sequent occasions to find out where his wife was—we said we did not know—I did not notice anything about him when I said that—I did know where his wife was—he came on Sunday, December 18th, and asked how we were getting on and how was the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>—we said we did not know—he said, "It is a story. I do not believe you." My wife said to him," "I am going to get the dinner up, you can stay and have some if you like, father, but I know you have got some where you go"—before he left he went down on his knees on the mat, and put his hands up and said, "If I don't know soon where she is, as the Lord above, there will be murder here," and he looked at me and my wife—he was perfectly sober then—I have never seen this knife at my house or in my wife's possession—we never had such a thing in our house—my wife was a small woman, 7 stone 4 lbs. when she was weighed at Clacton-on-Sea last year—when the prisoner threatened us, my wife smoothed him over and calmed him down as well as she could—she gave him cups of tea when he has been there, and fed him.</p>

I am a labourer, of 92, Ennersdale Road, Lewisham—these three silver medals (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) I got for military service—if I were going to buy three medals I should expect to give £2, if not more—there was a man, named Wilkinson (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 618) lodging in the same house with me—on January 17th when I left for work in the morning my medals were safe, hanging on my bedroom door—on returning to dinner a little after 1 p.m. I found that they were not there, and that Wilkinson had gone—I saw them again at Greenwich Police Court on January 19th—I gave no one authority to take them away or dispose of them.</p>

I said, "They are stolen property"—he then took a saucer containing a number of medals from the window, picked out the three, and showed them to me—I said, "How much did you give for them?"—he replied, "6s. He told me they belonged to his stepfather, who is dead, and that he had no further use for them, as he was leaving the country"—I said, "The man, I should say, is about thirty years old, and, taking his mother's age as a comparison, his stepfather would be a man bordering on fifty. It would be idle to suppose that a man of that age would be serving in the ranks in the late South African campaign"—he said, "I also bought a Masonic emblem from him; it is 9 carat and weighs a pennyweight. I gave him 2s. 6d. for it"—I said, "I will communicate with the loser of the medals, and no doubt he will call here with an officer"—the next day I received the medals from the prisoner at the Greenwich Police Court; I did not take them away at the time.</p>
