               <p>John Lucas. On the 14th of September, in the Night, I lost two heavy black Mares, out of my Grounds at <placeName id="t17381011-1-crimeloc3">Thollowson, in the Parish of Dunchurch, in Warwickshire</placeName>

            . Mr. Lucas and Mr. Cooper, (a Neighbour of his) came to me at the Rose and Crown, and desired me to enquire for two Fellows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110003"/> with a Couple of large black Mares. Accordingly, while Lucas went for the other Side of the Water, we enquired at the Golden Lyon, where we heard that the Mares had been there, but were carried to the Pewter-Platter, higher up the Street. We went thither, and found a Neighbour of mine, (one Mr. Twist) bargaining with the Prisoner Machell, for one of the Mares. I asked him whether the Mare was his own? he said, yes; and, says Mr. Twist, he asks Eight Guineas for her, and I will give but 5 l. Well, says I, let's go in and drink don't let's have a dry Bargain; so we went into the House, and I ask'd him (Machell) if he had not another Mare, and if another Man was not concerned in the Property of the Mares? he said, yes, - but his Partner was above Stairs, - a-bed. Then I went up to the other Prisoner (Wilkinson) and told him his Partner wanted him, and could not sell the Mares unless you come down. Are they yours, says I, yes, reply'd Wilkinson, we bought them at Woburn Fair last Thursday, and gave Twenty Guineas for them. When Wilkinson came down to Machell, I asked them again about the Price they had paid for them, and they said Twenty Pounds or Guineas, I can't tell which. The two Prisoners answering the Description that Lucas had given of them, as exactly as if he had drawn their Pictures, we got a Constable who took them into Custody. We were confirmed in our Proceedings by the Keeper of New-Prison, who happening to be there, knew Machell, and told us he had been tried for such an Offence, but the very last Sessions. Machell told us before the other (Wilkinson) came down, that he bought them at Woburn Fair for 20 Guineas or 20 l.</p>
               <p>Lucas. The Prisoners were carried to the Justice, - before I got back to the Inn, where the Mares were found.</p>

            . The Morning we found the Mares at the Pewter-Platter, Machell was talking to a Man about one of the Mares; the other ( Wilkinson ) was a-bed, but was fetch'd down Stairs. I thought it might be proper to part them, so I took Wilkinson into the Kitchen, and asked him some Questions, in answer to which, he said, he knew nothing of the Matter, nor from whence the Mares came; then he said he bought them at Woburn Fair for Twenty Pounds, and they were his own; and then Machell said he bought them himself.</p>

            . On the 15th of September about 7 at Night, the two Prisoners brought the Mares into our Yard; one rode one of them, and the other Man led in the other. On the one were two Saddles, the other had no Saddle but four Bridles. They bid me take Care of them, litter them and make them clean; which of them in particular gave me this Charge, I cannot take upon me to say, - they both came together, and gave me charge of them; then they went into the House, and sent for me to drink with them, and Machell again bid me take Care of his Mares. My Master Jones coming in, I told him those two Men had two good Coach Mares; - and I'll be hang'd then, says he, if they have not stole them. When the Prisoners were gone to Bed, he and I went to look at them, one was about four Years old, and the other about six. In the Morning my Master got Mr. Markham to come and look at the Mares, and I call'd Machell to shew him one of them. He warranted the Mare to be sound; and while Mr. Markham and he were talking together, this Gentleman (Mr. Salter) came in and sent for a Constable, and Mr. Cleaver sent after Mr. Lucas, and fetched him back. I went before Mr. Poulson to swear I received the Mares from the Prisoners. They told me I needed not give them any Corn, for they had given them as much as they would eat at Whetstone. This was on Friday Night, and the next Morning Mr. Lucas came and owned the same Mares, which the Prisoners over Night had given me Charge of.</p>
               <p>Machell. I was going down to Northampton, and met with this Wilkinson, and the two Mares. He told me he had bought them, and offer'd to satisfy me if I would come with him to Smithfield Market to sell them.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. He had none of the Mares from me. I met him at Newcastle under Line with them and a Sorrel Mare, which he swopp'd away at Daventry, and afterwards it was claim'd by another Man I had got 4 or 5 l. and thought to have got a Place, but I spent it with him, and he promised to pay me again when these two Mares were sold.</p>

We sat 'till about 11, and before we went to Bed, the Watchman beat past 9, 10, and 11 o'Clock very hard, and the Door did not open. When we went to Bed I bid the Maid make fast the Door, and I suppose the Watchman having beat at it, and she seeing the Key in the Lock, imagin'd it was fast; but a little after 4 in the Morning the Prisoner (who is a <rs id="t17381011-2-deflabel9" type="occupation">Watchman</rs>

I thanked him for his Care, and gave him 6 d. then I went down, and seeing the Brass and the Pewter standing as they did when I went to Bed, I fasten'd the Door, and was going to my Chamber again; but missing my Hat, (worth about 12 or 14 s.) I call'd up my Family, and then we found one had lost one thing, and another, another Thing. I miss'd nothing but my Hat; and the next Morning a young Man came and told me the Prisoner had sold a Hat; and that the Man who bought it, had pawn'd it in Grub-street. I went to see it, and it prov'd to be mine. When he was before the Lord Mayor, he said he found the Door open, and going in, he saw two Hats hang up, so being a poor Man he took one of them. The Hat was produced before the Lord-Mayor, and he confess'd it was the Hat he took.</p>

Before we got to our Door, 2 Men came with Pistols, - one on each Side of the Coach, and having stopp'd it, they demanded our Money, Watches and Rings in a Minute, or else they would kill us. To the best of my Knowledge, Sylvester is the Man who was on the Side of the Coach where I sat, I take him to be the Man by his Apparel, Stature and Voice. By his Size I believe Powell to be the Person that was at the other Door. Sylvester was the Man to whom I deliver'd a silver Thimble, worth 1 s. and 6 d. in Silver, and about 2 Penn'orth of Half-pence, for Fear of my Life. I can say more to Sylvester than I can to Powell, for it was dark, and there was no Lamps, nor any Moon; but there was a Light from a Window in a House No. 9 and a Maid came to light 2 Gentlemen out of Doors at No. 6, by which Means I was able to distinguish Sylvester's Face. I never saw him after he had robbed me, 'till I saw him at Justice Farmer's, and there I said he was the Man, to the best of my Knowledge; for when the Light was come to the Door at No. 6, they stood some Minutes, and the Gentlemen who were at that Door were coming to our Assistance, but they bid the Coachman drive on, and they ran away.</p>
               <p>Powel. Were they Englishmen or Irishmen that robbed you?</p>

            , Coachman. On the 5th of Sept. at Night, I was called to carry these two Gentlewomen and Mr. Southall from Pye Corner to Princes-Square. As I turned out of Ratcliff-Highway, I observed two Men following the Coach, and I had not gone far into the Square before they took hold of the Horses, and each of them presenting a Pistol, they said if I stirred an Inch they would shoot my Brains out. Then they went up, (one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110006"/> on each Side) to the Coach Doors, and demanded the Gentlefolks Money, &amp;c. or their Lives were gone in a Minute; while they, were robbing the Coach, a Maid opened a Door, with a Candle to light two Gentlemen out. Then I jumped off my Box, and Mr. Southall got out of the Coach, but the Prisoners ran away and got off. It was dark, and there was no Moon, but it was very Starlight, and the Candle coming out close to the Coach, I took a great deal of Notice of them. Sylvester stood at the off Door, and Powell at the near Door; I am positive and sure that the Prisoners are the Men. After this, Mr. Brown's Chariot was stopped in the Street, and he having got the Prisoners into New Prison, he found me out, and desired me to go and see if I knew them. I went thither, and found 40 or 50 Men and Women in the Yard, whether they were all Prisoners or not I can't tell, but the Minute I went in, I saw Sylvester sitting upon a Bench, smoaking a Pipe; Powell was at Pitch-farthing, and I immediately said they were the Men. They were both of them in Irons indeed, but there were more in Irons beside them.</p>
               <p>Jury. We would ask whether he knew them by their Voices, or directly upon the Sight of them?</p>
               <p>Hatton. The People belonging to the Prison did not know what Business I came upon, nor had any one said a Word to me before I pitched upon the Prisoners. I knew them by Sight; - and by their Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Powell. He came into the Prison not like a Man that would do Justice. He came and took no Notice at all of his Business there, till he was going out. Please to ask him if he did not ask a Creature in the Yard, who were the Men that were there, on Suspicion of robbing a Coach?</p>
               <p>Haiton. There was a Woman there who asked me to give her a Pot of Beer, and I did so, but it was after I had pointed to the two Prisoners.</p>

            . I was in the Coach when 'twas robbed in Princes-Square. It stopping suddenly at No. 8. I put my Head out to bid the Coachman drive to the next Light, and immediately a Man came up to me, with his Hat in one Hand, and a Pistol in the other, and cry'd d - mn your Bloods you are all dead, if you don't deliver your Watches and Money this Minute. Powell (I think) is the Man that was on my Side of the Coach, and I sat on the left Hand Side. I don't swear possitively, I only say I believe in my Conscience he was the Man; for he was by me a good while, and gave me 2 or 3 Jobbs on the Belly with his Pistol. As to Sylvester, I can say nothing to him, I am more positive to Powell, for when he had got what he could, he want off a little Way, and then came back again, and told us we had not given him all we had about us. When I heard that Mr. Brown's Coachman had taken two Men for robbing his Coach, I went to New Prison, and the Keepers Wife had about 8 or 10 call'd up; - most of them were in Irons, but I did not much mind that, I looked only at their Faces; and as soon as ever they came up, I said, - Madam I need not give you any farther Trouble, I believe I see the Man that robbed me; and when they were examined before Justice Farmer, I pick'd Powell out again, and said, - he was the Man.</p>
               <p>Powell. Please to ask him if he did not say before the Justice, that the Men who robb'd the Coach were Irishmen, and were taller and bigger Men than we are?</p>
               <p>Mr. Southall. No, I said no such Thing; for they damn'd and cursed so fast, that I could not distinguish what Countrymen they were.</p>

            . I was in the Coach at the same Time the 2 Men came up to it. Sylvester I take to be the Man who was on my Side of the Coach. I really believe him to be the Person, from the View I had of him by a Light which I saw at a Distance; I took Notice of his Face, and of his Cloaths; he had then on the same brown Coat that he wears now. I take Powell to be the Man who was on the other side the Coach by his Stature, he had on a brown Wig, and a lightish coloured Coat, - not the same he has on now. As soon as they came up to us, they cryed d - mn you, your Money, Watches and Rings in a Minute. I charged Sylvester with being the Man that was on our Side, when I saw him before the Justice.</p>

             I am Turnkey of New-Prison; when Hatton the Coachman came to the Goal, he called for a Tankard of Beer, and spoke to a Prisoner; what he said to her I can't tell. I asked him who he wanted, and he told me he came to see the 2 Men that were here, on Suspicion of robbing the Coach in Ratcliff-Highway. Let them have fair Play, says I, and called the Prisoners, I believe 7 or 8 of them were ironed, and these 2 Men in particular were double iron'd. I bid him be sure, for their Lives were depending; upon which he looked round, and pointing to Sylvester, he said, I believe that Man is one. I bid him again be sure, and he asked me whether I would have him say wrong. Then turning himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110007"/> round, he pitched upon Powell and said, he was the other. I again bid him be sure; upon which he said. - let who will have done the Robbery, these Men shall suffer for it; - I have been accused of it, as if some of my Consorts had done it, and to clear my self, they shall suffer for it. There was another Coachman with him, and he peep'd thro' the Checquers in the Gate, and said he wanted to see the two Men that had robbed his Coach.</p>

            . I keep the Suttling House in New-Prison, and saw Hatton when he came to the Prison. He has but one Eye, and I know him again. He came directly into my House, and call'd for Beer, and for one or two of the Women Prisoners; and I heard him ask them in the Yard, (not in the House) which were the Men that came in on Suspicion of robbing the Coach? The Women told him they were the Men which were double-iron'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Discourse between Hatton and the Women, before, or after he had pitch'd upon the Men?</p>
               <p>Lander. I did not apprehend he had pitch'd on them before. I saw him when he came first into the Prison, and the two Prisoners were then walking about the Yard. I saw neither of them sitting; Sylvester was smoaking, and both he and Powell were walking about. He pitch'd upon them, when the Prisoners were call'd together, but they were both double iron'd.</p>

               <p>Lander. I did not see him come in at the outer Gate; but I saw him and another Man come in at the inner Gate, - the checquer'd Gate. Here's one of the Women he spoke to, before the Prisoners were call'd up.</p>

            . 'Tis common for People in Jail to stand at the checquer'd Gate, to see if any of their Acquaintance comes; and seeing Hatton, I knew him, and asked him to give me something. He asked me which were the Men that robbed the Coach? I told him they were double iron'd. Aye, says he, here they are, and right or wrong I will swear against them, or else I shall come into bad Bread.

               <p>Taylor. This Discourse was before he went into the Tap-house; and after this I went with him into the Tap-house, but I did not change a Word with him there. Lander was by, (in the Yard) when this Discourse pass'd and he might hear it. He was present when Hatton said he would swear against them, right or wrong, and I believe heard us all the Time. There was a Man came in at the Gate with him, but he walked towards the Tap, while we talked together.</p>

He deposed, that Powell curs'd and swore so incessantly, that he took Notice of none but him.

He seldom robbs on Land, said she; most of the Robberies that he has committed were upon the Water. On Sunday I met the Beadle of the Parish ( Mr. Blowfield ) and I found by him he had a bad Character, - that of a Robber.</p>

I did go to Mr. Southall, and asked him if he could charge my Son with any Thing (dissaffected?) he told me he had robbed him, and mentioned Pistols. - I don't believe he knows how to handle a Pistol; - however, I said, - if you can't be off from it, but must swear against him, - rather than let him die a shameful Death, endeavour to transport him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. On the 9th of Sept. about 7 at Night, or about 7 or 8 Minutes after, I was coming over the Bridge: The first House upon the Bridge from Southwark, on the Right Hand, is a Paper-Shop, kept by the Widow Stone, - (a very honest good Woman) and the next is an empty House, here there was a little Stop, and the Prisoner gave 3 great, hearty Jumps at me, and jump'd upon me: I could not tell what he jump'd at, - but he jump'd my Watch out of my right Fob, with his left Hand. I miss'd it that Minute; he sprang on the other Side of the Way, and I cry'd out stop Thief. I felt it go out of my Pocket, and saw him run away to a Lamp on the other Side of the Way, 3 or 4 Doors from 'Squire Brooks's. Two other Men were with him, but who they were I can't tell. I am sure the Prisoner is the Man: it was not then dark; so I had the Benefit of the Day-light and the Moon too, and I saw his Face, as much as I desire to see the Face of any Man in my Life. He was exactly in the same Cloaths (upon my Oath) that he is in now. The Watch he robb'd me of, was worth 23 l. the Seal a Guinea, and the steel Chain, (Diamond-cut) was worth a Shilling, - but it cost more. When I saw him run away, I cry'd heartily out after him, but he got through the Gate, into the Burrough, and I heard nothing of him 'till he was taken as a Gambler, (or Money Dropper) the Tuesday following. For being in Trouble and Distress for my Watch, and for my being so unjustly serv'd, I went to Mr. Bird, and told him my Trouble. Says Bird, as you're an old Friend, we'll leave Notes of Description at Bridewell, New-Prison, the Marshalsea &amp;c. of this good Man; and he being taken on Tuesday for Gambling, he sent Mr. Bushel, an Apothecary in St. Paul's Church-yard, to the Compter with me, and I told the Man that tends the Prison, I did not want to hurt any body, but the Man that I meant, was a little taller than I, about 26 Years old, in a light brown Coat, with a slit Sleeve, and a chitterling Shirt. When I saw him, I knew him to be the Man, and here are 2 Witnesses, that I then declared him upon my Sacred Oath to be the Person that robb'd me. On Tuesday, I waited upon my Lord-Mayor, and he was so worthy and so good, as to give me a Warrant of Detainer against him. After that, I brought 3 or 4 Gentlemen of Credit to see him, and then I said again he was the Man; and now I will swear the same to the Day of my Death.</p>

               <p>Mr. Whitaker. On the Prisoner's telling me in the Compter that he was a Servant to this Leeson, I went and enquired at the House concerning him. This Tooley told me she knew nothing at all of him; and I said 'twas a little odd, the Fellow should send me to People that did not know him; he is in the Compter (says I) for Gambling, and on Suspicion of stealing a Watch; they then asked me what Time the Robbery was committed? I told them I could not tell exactly the Time; but then this Tooley recollected him, and said she would make Oath he came in about half an Hour after 8 o'Clock, and seeming to be uneasy, he took a Candle and went up to Bed.</p>
               <p>Leeson was asked what Name the Prisoner went by? He answered, sometimes by the Name of Tho. Brown, and sometimes Tho. Jones. <rs id="t17381011-6-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>The Councel for the Prosecution having open'd the Indictment, it was objected on the other Side, that the Act required, Notice should be given, that the Statute was awarded and issued; every one knowing there is a material Difference between - awarded and issued; the one signifying, the Thing order'd to be done, the other, the Thing done: Whereas in the Indictment, they had only made use of the Word, awarded. It was objected further, that the Act says, the Bankrupt shall surrender to the Commissioners, or the major Part of them; instead of which, in one of their Notices, they spun out their Directions for the Prisoner to surrender to all the five Commissioners, leaving out the Words, - or the major Part of them. And in the other Notice they say he must surrender to 3 of them, without mentioning any of the rest. It was objected likewise, that there should have been an Averment in the Indictment, that the Commissioners did sit, and that those Commissioners should have been nam'd. whereas they were not nam'd in their Notice, and they had only set forth that he was required to surrender to the Commissioners at Guildhall; which might as well be understood of the Commissioners of Sewers, or of the Lieutenancy for they sit at the same Place. <rs id="t17381011-7-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

            . Last Quarter-Day, I happen'd to be at Mr. Ball's a Cane Chair Maker's in the Minories, and this Gentlewoman at the Bar came in, and enquired for a Woman, with whom she wanted to board; and she told me she had something coming in yearly, and would board with me if I pleased I told her, I would ask my Husband, when I went home, if he car'd to take a Boarder. In the Afternoon she came, and I shew'd her a Room above Stairs, where there was a corner Cupboard, in which we kept our Plate; I open'd it, to shew her the Cupboard, and lock'd it again, (all the Plate was then in it) and having some Business to do in Seething-Lane, I went out, and left her in the Room below Stairs. When I came back the Prisoner was gone, but I did not miss the Plate 'till 11 o'Clock; we were then going to Bed; then I observ'd a Policy of Insurance, which was in the Cup, to lie in the Window; upon this I look'd in the Cupboard, and miss'd all the Things mention'd in the Indictment.</p>

When my Mistress (Williams) was gone out, the Prisoner went up Stairs with me into the Garret, to help me tie up some Lines, while we were there, she ask'd me for a Chamber-pot; I told her there was one in my Room, and she went down again by herself; after this she wanted Snuff: I said, if she would go down and sit by the Kitchen-Fire 'till I had done, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110012"/> would fetch her some, but when I came down she was gone, I stepp'd to the Chandlers Shop at next Door, and there I found her; she told me she was only going to see her Mother at the Tower, and would come again, but she never did.

            . The Prisoner was taken in Bishopsgate street, on the 2d of Oct. and was carry'd to the Tower Goal. Next Morning I went to her there, and she told me she had sold the Necklace to Mr. Barnes on the other Side Ludgate for 25 s. and the Cup and the Spoons for 4 l. to Mr. Spring on this Side Charing Cross. I went to them both, and they readily told me, they had bought such Things, and there we found them. She offered to go with us herself to the Places if we would give her a Coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnes. The latter End of Sept. this Neck-lace was brought to me by a Woman in a Coach, she gave it me to weigh; I told her what it came to, and sent the Money to her (in a Coach) by my Boy. I can't swear to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Smedley Moore confirmed Mr. Barnes's Evidence, and swore positively the Prisoner was the Person who was then in the Coach, and to whom he carry'd the Money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spring swore, that his Servant fetched him from a Neighbour's House the latter End of Sept. When he came Home he found a Coach at his Door, and the Cup and Spoons upon the Counter; that he weigh'd them, and carry'd the Money for them to the Woman in the Coach, but as it was Candle-light, he could not swear to her.</p>

I did not care to lend so much upon it, so she took it away; but in 5 Minutes Time she brought it again, and said the Gentlewoman would take 3 Guineas, I told her I would lend but 2 Guineas upon it, which she took, and I sent my Boy after her to see where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110013"/> she went. The Boy watch'd her into a House, and I was satisfied; but the Gown being advertised 2 Days afterwards, I went to Mr. Hayward's, told them I had the Gown, and they have it again. Then I set People to watch for the Prisoner, they sent me Word that she was at an Alehouse; I went and took her from thence and carry'd her to Mr. Hayward's.

            . About 10 Days ago the Prisoner and Mr. Gilbert's Maid came and ask'd for a Spoon, which the Prisoner had pledged to me on the 6th of Sept. last. I brought it down, and the Maid asked her Couzen (the Prisoner) how she could serve her so; they made Words together and went away. I would have sent for Mr. Gilbert, but they did not care I should. In about a Week's Time the Maid came again, and I delivered the Spoon to the Constable. The Prisoner brought it to me herself.</p>

            . I lost a Spoon of Mr. Gilbert's on the 6th of last Month, and not only lost my Place about it, but paid 10 s. for it besides. I taxed the Prisoner with the Spoon, and she deny'd it; but afterwards she carry'd me to the Pawnbroker's Shop, and I saw it with T. G. M. (my Master's Mark) upon it, but he would not let me have it without Money. About a Week afterwards I sent to my Master Gilbert, but because I had paid for the Spoon, he would not come to the Pawnbroker's. Afterwards I found out the Prisoner, and charged a Constable with her, upon which she carry'd me to Smitherman's, and the Spoon he shewed me was the same that was lost.</p>

               <p>Pierce. About 12 o'Clock at Night, on the 12th of June, I was going Home to my own House in Bond-street, in the Parish of St. George Hannover-Square, and the Prisoner pick'd me up; she came a-cross the Way to me, and took me to a Door, where she and I stood talking together about the Space of Time that I have been speaking here; then she went into the House, and carry'd away my Watch and Money with her. I had not got 5 Doors from the Place before I missed it. - But with Respect to the Thing, - here's a Woman can give a much better Account of it than I can.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Door open where you talk'd with the Prisoner?</p>

               <p>Peirce. Yes, but I did not go in, I don't suppose that both my Feet were over the Threshold; and I am sure I was not with her above 3 Minutes, but while I stood there, she went in and fetch'd me a Glass of Liquor, I refused to drink it, and she vow'd, if I would not drink it she would pour it into my Bosom; then she went in, and shut the Door. When I missed my Watch and Money, I went back and knock'd at the Door, no Body would open it, but they told me, if I would come in the Morning I should have my Things again.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could she take your Watch and Money in 3 Minutes, and you not miss it?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I had both Watch and Money in my Hand but 2 Minutes before she pick'd me up; and as soon as she went in I missed a Guinea, a Shilling, and my Watch too.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you a marryed Man or a Batchelor Friend?</p>
               <p>Peirce. A married Man.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Then you had no need to go abroad.</p>
               <p>Peirce. I went the next Day to the House, to enquire after my Watch and my Money, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110014"/> Minute the Prisoner saw me, she ran into another House, and so I lost her. 'Twas a dark Night, but when she came out with the Glass of Liquor, she brought a Candle with her, so I saw her Face. She mov'd her Lodging upon this very Account, else I should have taken her up before. About 3 Months afterward, I happen'd to see her, so I took her up, and carry'd her before a Magistrate; and she told him she did not know me - she had never seen my Face before in her Life. 'Tis true, I had been drinking, - but I was - sensible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take up another Woman for this Fact?</p>
               <p>Peirce. After I took this Gentlewoman up, she got a Man to appear for her before the Justice, who told me I had taken up one or two Women before, tho' I never charg'd any other Woman with this Robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swore before the Justice that he lost his Watch in the House, and the Woman that he had taken up before came and made an Affidavit, that she who robb'd him made her Escape.</p>
               <p>Peirce. There was another Woman before the Justice, but I charged only the Prisoner.</p>

She made some Shirts for my Husband, and was going with me to buy Trimmings for them, when the Prosecutor came with a Butcher and a Constable, and said, I believe this was the Woman that took my Watch, for I remember she had the Sign of the Small Pox in her Face, so he carry'd her before a Justice, and she was committed to Jail. Upon this I got a Lawyer to appear for her, (an Acquaintance of mine) and Peirce went to the Lawyer's House in Compton-street, and told him he was a Party concern'd, and so the Lawyer has got him to be try'd for Scandal in the King's-Bench, The Lawyer's Name is Luttwiche, - he practises the Law, - but whether he is a Lawyer or not, I cannot tell. I have ask'd the Prosecutor how he could charge a Woman who had liv'd so well? Why (says he) if you're her Friend, give me a Silver Watch, or disburse 5 l. and I'll acquit her, else I will swear down-right that she had it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wincup. I know the Prisoner; and when she and Parker brought the Information to my Lord Mayor, I asked her if she knew the Contents of the Paper? She said, Yes; and acknowledged the Name (Mary Pocock ) to be her own Hand-writing. Then she laid her Right Hand upon the Testament, and I said, you shall swear that the Contents of your Deposition, are in all Parts, just and true; and then she kiss'd the Book in the Presence of my Lord Mayor.</p>

She swore that she came into the Shop, and bought a Half-penny Brick, and a Ha'p'orth of Cheese, and a Quarter of a Pint of Geneva; but if the dearest Friend in the World had come to me, and would have given me a Thousand Pounds, for a Quarter of a Pint of Spirituous Liquors, I had it not in my House of any Sort. On my Oath, I sold her no Spirituous Liquors at all, on the 27th of May, nor any one else. I won't pretend to swear, she might not have a Role and Cheese on that Day, for I keep a Public Shop, and it is impossible to remember every one's Face that may come in. I sell no Liquors at all, but Small-Beer, nor have I sold any since the 1st of April. 'Tis probable she might have Small-Beer with her Bread and Cheese, but I am sure I sold nothing but Small-Beer on that Day, nor on many Days before.</p>

            . I am a Nurse, and nurs'd Mrs. Pepper of several Children; she happened to be out of Town at this Time, and I was in the House from the 11th of May, to the 25th of June. I lay in the House, and eat in the House; I took Care of the Children, and of the Shop in Mr. Pepper's Absence. The 27th of May was Saturday, and I remember I was in the Shop from Six o'Clock at Night till Twelve. Mr. Pepper was there, but it was enough for two People to serve in the Shop on Saturday Night, so I was there to attend in the Shop, if I should have have been wanted; for there was a great many People came, but not a great many together, or at a Time; One or Two came in at a Time and went out, and then others came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you particularly take Notice of all that came to Mr. Pepper's Shop that Night?</p>
               <p>Newland. There are two Counters, but they are both on the same side of the Shop. I can say, I never saw that Woman in the Shop in my Life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Notice of every one's Face that came into the Shop from 6 o'Clock to 12? And can you say that Woman was not there in that Time?</p>
               <p>Newland. She was not, as I saw; and if she was, she could not be served with Geneva, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110016"/> we had none in the House: From the 11th of May to the 25th of June, I never saw a Drop there, even for our own Drinking. During all the Time I was there, I saw nothing but Small-Beer and Strong; I never saw any Wine, either sold or fetch'd, to be drunk in the House; I never (during that Time) heard any one come in to ask for Spirituous Liquors, for every body knew he did not sell any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was not in the Shop that Night. I was there about Nine.</p>

            . I lodge in Mr. Pepper's House, and have done so five Years and better. I am a Watchman at Temple-Bar, and go out upon Duty between 10 and 11 every Night. I cannot recollect this very Day, but I know, that from the Beginning of April, to this present Day, there were no Spirituous Liquors in the House. I eat, drink, and lye in the House; my Wife and Family live there; and I never saw any thing retail'd (of Liquor) but Small-Beer; no Ale nor Wine, but what was fetch'd in; may be now and then a Full-Pot of Ale or Beer; as for Wine, I never-saw any fetch'd. I have had Spirituous Liquors fetch'd in sometimes for my own drinking, but it was always from another House, for none were sold by Mr. Pepper. I never serv'd in the Shop, so cannot say who might come there, or who did not.</p>

            . I am a Carpenter, and work'd in Mr. Pepper's House all the Month of April, and, I think, two or three Days in the Beginning of May. Being an Acquaintance, I breakfasted and dined with him; and, as he was a Friend, I us'd to come to Work every Morning at Six, and continue at it till Nine at Night. If in all that Time we had any Liquor better than Small-Beer, it was a Pot of Drink, sent for from the Alehouse. I never saw either Brandy, Geneva, or any Sort of Spirituous Liquors used in the House. I believe if he had any in the House, he would as soon have let me have had a little, as any one in England. I never heard any Body ask for Spirituous Liquors in the Shop, nor did I ask for any myself, because I have heard him profess he never would keep any in the House, not even for his own drinking, for fear he should be brought into a Scrape.</p>

            . I serve Mr. Pepper with Bread, and carry it to his Shop twice every Day, often three or four Times a Day. Since the first of April I never saw any Liquor in his House but Small-Beer. I never had a Cogue from that Time to this, not one Drop. On the 27th of May I was there with Bread about Eight in the Evening, and staid there about a Quarter of an Hour; then a Customer came in for a stale Half-Peck Loaf, and I went out to get a new one chang'd, and came back again, and staid till three Quarters past Eight, and saw no Geneva, nor any Spirituous Liquors at all, from about a Fortnight before the 3d of May; for Mr. Pepper was about that Time convicted in a Hundred Pound Penalty, though (as he said) he was innocent, and I endeavoured to get the Fine mitigated, and from that Time he never would have any in his House, to prevent his Trouble for the future.</p>
               <p>Jury. Please to ask him, who serv'd in the Shop that Evening?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Mr. Pepper himself; Mrs. Newland was backward from the Shop in the Kitchen, as she commonly was. She was not in the Shop during the Time I was there.</p>
               <p>Newland. I was not out of the Shop a Quarter of an Hour all the Time.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I don't remember that I saw any Body in the Shop that Night, but Mr. Pepper, and his Brother the Footman, and old Mr. Pepper.</p>
               <p>Defence. On the 27th of May, about 9 o'Clock, I went to Mr. Pepper's Shop, as I usually did, and a young Man was with me. I call'd for a Half-penny Brick, and a Ha'p'orth of new Cheese. Mr. Pepper serv'd me; no body was in the Shop but he, then I call'd for a Quartern of Gin; he serv'd me, and I paid him 3 Half-pence for it. The young Man (Edward Hassel) was with me at the same Time. There was a Candle in the Shop; and on one Side of the Shop lies Coals, and Salt on the other. He brought the Bottle from behind the Counter, and went into a narrow Passage,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110017"/> between the Kitchen and the Parlour, and there he serv'd me with his own Hands, and I made Oath of it, before the Commissioners, and before my Lord Mayor. The Surveyors then gave me a Character, and said they had never found me in an Error. Mr. Pepper came to the Tap-house in Newgate, and asked me, why I could not pass by his Door? Why should I, says I? Well, says he, I'll put you into the Half-Moon, (the Pillory) and if I can't do your Business, I'll get others that shall. 'Tis a Liquor belov'd by Vagrants and common People; - I lost my Husband and Children by it. When I was before the Lord Mayor, with my Information, the young Man (Hassel) was with me, and swore he drank Part of the Liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wincup. There was an Excise-Officer with her, but he did not speak to the Fact. I don't remember that any one else was with her: No one but she was sworn. <rs id="t17381011-16-verdict78" type="verdictDescription">

Mrs. Bennet having been robbed likewise, and the Prisoner having her Goods, it was suspected that he had got mine; and Endeavours were used to bring him to Confession. At last this Corporal, (

I was not 3 Minutes talking to her before Fletcher returned up, and held both my Arms, while Reynolds tore a Hole in the Corner of my Handkerchief, and got out the Guinea Then I cry'd out, - O my Guinea, my Guinea, she has robb'd me! Will no Body help me! Fletcher ran away, and she try'd to run away too, but I caught Hold of her, and cry'd out again, O, my Guinea, my Guinea! Upon this Fletcher return'd and said, D - mn you what do you want? - and knock'd me down again with his Hand. Reynolds then ran away about the length of this Court, but a Man ran after her and took her immediately, and brought her back to me. She was no sooner came up to me, but she fell upon me, and under Pretence of searching me to see if I had not got the Guinea, she tore off my Cloths in such a Manner, that the Women were forc'd to hold my Petticoats up about me, telling me, if I had 20 Guineas about me, she would have them all. At last a Constable was charged with Reynolds, and she said before the Justice, that she had not the Guinea. Fletcher was taken the Sunday following, and carry'd before Justice Margets, where he confessed he had got it.</p>

            . I am a Watchmaker, and live at Mr. Jackson's a Cheesemonger in Drury-Lane, a little above Long-Acre. Long-Acre is almost half the Length of Drury Lane from Broad St. Giles's. The Thing was done over-against my Lodgings. On the 20th of last Month, between 7 and 8 at Night, I heard some Body cry out, - O my Guinea, - my Guinea! I look'd out of my Window up two Pair of Stairs, and saw a Woman with a Candle and Lanthorn, by the Light of which I could see Reynolds, with her Arms about Blackwell's Bosom, and a Man about Fletcher's Size, had hold of her Arms. As soon as Blackwell cry'd out, - Now she has got my Guinea, Reynolds made off, and the Man came up again and run Blackwell up against a Door, and asked her where she was going. But a Shoemaker happening to come by, took Reynolds and brought her back to Blackwell. Then I ran down Stairs, and found Reynolds very impudent, and a Constable carried her to Mr. Moulsey's in Drury-lane, and there she called Mrs. Blackwell, a dirty Bitch; and said, if I had Twenty Guineas, you should not have one of them. I search'd her, and found nothing upon her, - but we carried her before Justice Margets, and there she was audacious again, and said she knew nothing of it. I saw her do the Thing by the Light of the Candle and Lanthorn, and am positive to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Milbourn. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you then swear to the Knowledge of her Face, when you say you saw her but by the Light of a Candle (in a Lanthorn) 2 Stories from the Ground?</p>
               <p>Milbourn. I came down Stairs as soon as she was stopp'd.</p>
               <p>Fletcher's Examination and Confession before Mr. Justice Margets, was produced.</p>
               <p>The Justice's Clerk. I saw Fletcher sign this; and Justice Margets signed it likewise. It was read over to him before he signed it, and - I believe - he signed it voluntarily; I won't say he had no Thoughts of being admitted an Evidence. I believe he was encouraged with a Probability of his being made an Evidence.</p>

            . On Wednesday, Sept. 20, I went to a Chandler's Shop, facing Parker's Lane, in Drury-Lane, and as I was coming out of the Shop with my Beer, I heard the Prosecutor, (who was then two Doors off) cry out, O my Guinea, - my Guinea! I sat down my Drink, and went to see what the Matter was. I looked at the Prosecutrix, and thought she could not have a Guinea about her by her Appearance, but some Body brought Reynolds back to her, and she said, - that was the Woman who had taken her Guinea Then Reynolds said, - you Bitch, where should you have a Guinea, let me see if I can find this Guinea about you, and she put her Hands down the Prosecutrix's Bosom and unty'd her Petticoats, but could not find the Money.</p>
               <p>After this the Woman Prisoner (Reynolds) went up Meeting-House-Court, facing Parkers-Lane, and came back again directly to the Prosecutrix, - there was no Thorough-fare in that Court, and the Mob was sufficient to prevent her getting away, and so she came back again of her own Accord to the Place where I first saw her. Fletcher stood by the Corner of the Court, but I can't say whether he was concerned or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Parkers-Lane from Long-Acre?</p>
               <p>Orford. About the length of this Court, not a great Way.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Pickerings the Brazier in Drury-Lane, on Wednesday was 3 Weeks, the Woman (Blackwell) was at my Landlord's Door, facing Parker's-Lane, and cry'd out, - she was robb'd. I asked her what was the Matter? She told me she was robb'd of a Guinea, and desired me to hold the Candle; I did so, and asked her if she knew the Person that robb'd her? yes, she said, perfectly well, then says I, was it such a one, or such a one? (holding the Candle to several People in the Croud) Among the rest, I asked her if the Prisoner Reynolds was the Person? No, she was not, 'twas a Man she said, that knock'd her down, and took her Money. On the Vertue of my Oath, she said so once or twice, and was so much in Liquor, that she had been dragg'd thro' the Kennel before I came. At last I asked her, - if I was the Person? - I believe she was so much in Liquor, she was not able to say who it was.</p>

               <p>Edward Backhouse, The 4th of this Month, in the Evening, I lost 9 pair of Worsted Stockings out of my Shop-window, worth about a Guinea. I did not see the Prisoner take them, but I saw him go out with them, and I pursu'd him, and took him with them under his Arm; but when I laid hold of him, he dropp'd them. He seem'd to be surpriz'd when I took him, and did not say any thing at all. When the Constable came, he was carry'd before Mr. Justice Martyn, and there he did not directly own the Fact, but he said, he had liv'd honestly ever since the last Time he was acquitted.</p>
