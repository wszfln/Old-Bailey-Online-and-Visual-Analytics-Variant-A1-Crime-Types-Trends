                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 28, Church Street, Rotherhithe—I was present at St. Andrew's Church, Holborn, on 4th March, 1872, when my daughter was married to the prisoner—the banns had been previously published—this is the certificate of the marriage (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—they lived together about three months afterwards; there was then a separation—since then I have seen the prisoner, but not spoken to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner was not living at my house before his marriage—he was 16 years of age, but he deceived me as to that; he told me he was 20—he never slept at my house before his marriage—I don't know where he lived—I knew where his father lived—he was not living there—my daughter was pregnant before her marriage—I gave him money to keep him after his marriage, not before—I don't know that he was married without his father's consent—he did not warn me against the marriage; he did not say his son was under age, he said he was very young—he came to me with the Relieving Officer one Saturday, a week or two before the marriage, and he said whatever might occur he would not be answerable—I was not keeping the prisoner at that time—I went with him and my daughter to put up the banns, I forget whether I paid for it—my daughter was confined about six weeks after her marriage—after living with the prisoner three months she went away and lived with another man, and has been living with him ever since, and had children by him—she is not the prosecutrix—she is about 12 months older than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. She left him because he did not use her right; he did not keep her, and I found he was very young.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I turned him out of the house about four months ago, because he did not maintain me or his child—I was not told by Wilson, a cabman, before I married him that he was a married man, or I would not have had him—I did not say if the first wife did not mind I did not care—his brother did not tell me he was married—I was a servant at the Express coffee-house before my marriage—I have drank with the prisoner since those proceedings, but not at his expense; he ran after me and spoke to me when he was out on bail—I did not say I would go back and live with him.</p>

She said, 'Nine o'clock to a minute.' She didn't come home at nine, and I was anxiously waiting up all night for her. I laid down on the bed about five o'clock, and got up about seven and cut off a piece of bread and meat and went out with the knife eating it. That's how I came with the knife all day. When I came home at night she was at home. When I took the knife from my pocket she tried to take it from me, and said she did cut herself so that she could give me in charge, as she had heard I had been inquiring where she had been. So she did cut herself, and then called Mrs. Johns.</p>

I am a costermonger, of 9, Turk's Road, Chelses—on Saturday, 24th February, I was passing by the corner of Commercial Road, coming towards home—I saw a mob of people; the prisoner was among them, he had his guernsey off, and was going to fight with some other man—I said to him "Don't fight, I think you are the worse for drink"—he turned round and said "You have nothing at all to do with me"—he shoved me and I shoved him, a constable came up and separated us, and he and the chaps he was with went away—I went on about 150 yards, and saw him standing in-the middle of the mob—I stood looking at him; I had hardly time to do so before he rushed at me and struck me in the breast as if he was going to punch me—I did not see any<lb/>thing in his hand—I felt the blow, and cried out "He has stabbed me"—I went to the station-house and then to the hospital—I felt the knife go out of me—I have on the same guernsey now; there is the hole in it, and in the waistcoat also.</p>

I was house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital when Exall was brought there on the morning of the 24th—I examined him—he was suffering from an incised wound about an inch long over the left breast—it was in a dangerous place, and if it had been deeper it would have been very dangerous—I did not probe it much—he was rather faint from the shock—he was in the hospital six days; when he was discharged the wound was all but healed and he seemed in good health—a knife like this would be likely to inflict such a wound.</p>

               <p>a cheque"—she took a piece of paper and wrote this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said "My uncle Roper left me 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the London and West<lb/>minster Bank"—I said "Then there will be no doubt about the pay<lb/>ment"—she said "Oh, no"—at the time I took the cheque I believed it would be honoured, or I would not have taken it—the goods were sold for ready money—we gave her no credit—I would not have left the goods without the money, or what represented money—I went next morning to the Temple Bar Branch of the London and Westminster Bank two or three minutes after 9.30 and presented the cheque, and the manager wrote on it "No account"—I then went on to Albany Street, about 10.5, and the prisoner had gone and taken the goods with her, half an hour before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The cheque is drawn on the London and Westminster Banking Company and has no date—I did not notice that at the time or I would not have taken it—I expected it to be cashed—I saw her solicitor after she had gone away—I did not say that the only thing I wanted was the money or the goods back—I said I wanted information as to where she was.</p>

On 1st February, about a quarter to 5, I was in King William Street with Wolsey, another officer, and saw Phillips wheeling a truck with a chest of tea; Willow walked beside him through Prince's Street and Moorgate Street into Moorfields, where Willow began to wheel the truck—before that I saw Parrott in Moor<lb/>gate Street; he walked on the pavement behind the other two as far as Moorgate Station, they then turned to the left to Moorfields—I went up to Willow and asked him where he got the tea from; he said "I suppose from Tooley Street"—Phillips said "I know nothing about it"—I said "Where are you going to take it?"—he said "To St. Luke's Church, Old Street; we are going to meet a man, we do not know his name"—Willow refused his address; Phillips gave his, and I found that his mother lived there.</p>

               <p>went into a public-house and came out with Frost—Holden took these gloves from his inside breast pocket and gave them to Frost, who put them in his coat tail pocket—they have been shown to Mr. Rigden, who identifies them—they had some drink and came out and separated—I followed Frost to Guildhall Tap, where he joined Moore—I went in—Frost spoke to Moore about a minute and came out—Moore avoided him—1 followed Frost to Gresham Street, stopped him, told him I was a detective, and said, "What was that small parcel you took from a man in the Old Jewry?"—he said "Oh, I suppose you mean a few gloves," producing the parcel—I asked him if he knew where it came from—he said "I suppose you know all about it"—he was taken to the station, and on the way he took from his pocket a small paper parcel con<lb/>taining these two silk scarves, handed it to Westwood, and said "Here, you may as well have these too, they were given to me by Mr. Whiteman," I think the name was—on Saturday, 2nd February, about 7 p.m., I saw Moore in the Commercial Road—I told him I was a detective and should take him for receiving a quantity of gloves knowing them to be stolen—he said "That is quite right, but I did not know they were stolen—I bought them; I am a job lot buyer"—I asked him if he had any invoice-—he said "No, we don't have invoices for small job lots"—on the way to the station he said "I read this case in the paper; you don't think if I had done anything wrong I should have been in London, I should have been in the country now"—a list was produced at the station of the different pledges at the pawnbrokers '—he said "That is quite right; I pledged them, that is my name and address"—I said "Have you the duplicates?"—he said "No"—I said "Where are they?"—he said "I gave them to the gentleman I had the gloves from"—I said "Who is he?"—he said "I don't know, all I know is he is a commercial traveller and came from Birmingham"—I watched Moore and saw him every day except Sunday, during which time he was constantly in the neighbourhood of warehouses round Guildhall and near the Bell, Gresham Street, and the Poulterers' Arms, Honey Lane Market.</p>

I am 10 years old next birthday, and live with my parents at 19, Effingham Street—I did not see the men knocked down, I neared the man who was knocked down halloa out "Oh"—at that time I saw the prisoner driving a Hansom cab—I saw his hat fall off; this is his hat—I know the prisoner very well, he lives next door to us—after his hat fell off he turned round the corner of Lupus Street—I had before that seen his cab standing at the comer of 21, Effingham Street—there was another cab standing in front of the Stanley public-house.</p>

I am 12 years of age, and live at 19, Effingham Street with my father and mother—on Thursday night, 24th January, I was playing about with some other boys at the corner of Effingham Street by the Stanley public-house—little Asbury was one of us—I saw Duggan and his father after they had been run over at the corner of Effingham Street and Lupus Street—I saw two Hansom cabs by the Stanley; one of them went towards 21, Effingham Street; it stopped there and the cabman got down; he got up on the cab again and drove towards the Stanley, and after the men were run over the cab went straight up Sussex Street—the prisoner was the driver—I knew him before, I have seen him a great many times, I have known him by sight about two years—he was driving very fast—I heard the cry out "Oh," and I directly ran over the road and saw one in the road and one on the doorstep, and the cab was just going</p>

I gave this evidence on 6th February, a fortnight after the accident—Lupus Street turns to the right—Sussex Street is straight on—I am quite sure that the cab that ran over the men went up Sussex Street, I am quite sure he did not drive down Lupus Street—I was asked by Inspector Knight, and Buckstone the detective, whether it was not young Jarvis who ran over the man, and I said "Yes;" that was the first I said about it—I had said something about it to Shellock and Asbury.</p>

When the constable asked her if she had lost anything she said "No;" he said "Will you charge him with kicking you?" she said "Yes."

On 1st February, about 7 a.m., I was near Moray Road, and saw two coats on a wall adjoining Mr. Follet's premises, which are close to the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner take them down and take them into the slaughter-house—I saw him again about 10.30; he called mo across the road and said "Do not say anything and I will treat you"—I think he saw mo when he took the coats—I said "All right."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, in partnership with Mr. Lawson at 44, St. Paul's Churchyard—the prisoner was our traveller—last November he was entrusted with jewellery to go round to customers and to dispose of it—we supplied him with this black bag to place it in—we kept a record of the jewellery he took away every morning, and he had to give us an account of what he sold or left on approbation, and it would be charged against the customer and written on his account—on 12th November a new stock book was being prepared at our premises at Hatton Garden, where Mr. Lawson was—I saw the prisoner that morning at St. Paul's Churchyard, and said "I would rather you did not take your out this morning, because we are going to make a new stock book"</p>

               <p>—he said "I have an appointment with Mr. Harnett of Edgware Road and I will be back by 11.30"—he mentioned that more than once and ultimately left the bag—he returned by 4.45 without the bag and rather excited—I think he was the worse for liquor—he said that he had had his bag taken out of the train, at King's Cross railway station by three men. who passed hurriedly by him, who were in the same compartment with him, that his bag was by his side, and that he found something touch him, missed his bag, jumped out of the carriage, called the guard and said he had been robbed of a bag worth 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked him to stop the train, but he would not do so, and that he then went to Bagnigge Wells police-station and gave information, and from there came to me—I sent him with my partner's son in a cab to Scotland Yard, and they re<lb/>turned for a full list of the property, which was made out by Mr. Lawson, jun., and the clerk—Mr. Slade afterwards made a communication to me and I went to his place at Paul's Wharf and saw the bag; it was open and the empty jewellery cases were in it—when the prisoner came to me that evening he showed me the centre of a diamond bracelet with which he had been entrusted, and said "I have found this in my pocket"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the case of that bracelet, I found it in the bag at Mr. Slade's—I had looked out an order for the prisoner for some shirt studs for Dr. S. Bridges and handed them to the prisoner with some links and collar studs, and also a pair of earrings for Dr. Bridges' brother—on 14th August the prisoner was entrusted with a single stone diamond ring, No. 1082, value about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have asked him about that ring since the loss of the bag, and he said that he had never had it—on 9th October he had a diamond gipsy ring, No. 596, value 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have asked him about that, and he said that it was in the bag—he never suggested that he had been robbed of it by a woman—on 16th August he had a silver hunting watch—I asked him for it on several occasions—he said that it was with Mr. Norbury, who was getting up a watch club, he being employed at Ryland's in Wood Street—on 8th December instructions were given to take him in custody and he was taken—the case was investigated from time to time until 9th January, when he was discharged—we had had no information from Mr. Brown then as to where certain pawn tickets were—I have inspected the goods referred to in these six pawn tickets which Mr. Brown snowed me, and find they relate to some diamond earrings, a diamond and turquoise brooch, a pair of gold earrings, and a pair of diamond and turquoise ear tops, which had been entrusted to the prisoner for sale and which should have been in the bag—I had given Mr. Brown certain instructions previously.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a guard on the Metropolitan Railway—on 12th November, at 4.27, I saw the prisoner at King's Cross station on the platform when the train was running into the station, and after I had started the train he came to me—I can swear he did not come by the</p>

I am a lighterman, in the employ of Mr. Haynes, of Paul's Wharf—on the evening of 12th November, about 6 or 6.10, I found this black bag in the Thames, between Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges—the tide was just on the turn, it was running down in shore—the bag was closed; I gave it to Mr. Slade, to whom the wharf belongs, and saw it opened; it was wet inside, but not very; it had not been in the water a great while.</p>

Written across that is "By doing this you will help to reinstate me in my old position."—He asked what I thought of the letter—I said that I thought it was a very clever invention—I met him on the Tuesday by appointment and he asked me to go with him to Chelsea—I went with him to Mr. Withers' shop, King's Road, and saw some earrings which were in pawn for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for which I had the contract note—I took them out, paid the interest due, and a further advance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made upon them, making the deposit note 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Withers offered to buy them, but the prisoner refused to sell them—we went to a public-house, where he said that we were going</p>

Will meet you to-morrow, Thursday, Bull and Mouth, 11 sharp. Be there, I want to see you very particularly. S. Liversedge."

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 247). On Sunday, 27th February, I was on duty in the Glenthorn Road—I had gone on duty at 10 o'clock and the prisoner also—my beat was No. 12 and part of 9—while on duty I saw the prisoner at 10.40—I told him that I had seen Langston, Police<lb/>constable 161, and he had told me to tell him (the prisoner) that he was to confine himself to 11 beat alone—he said "All right, can you give me a light to my lamp?"—I said "Yes, but I have not any paper"—he said "Have you any matches?"—I said no—he said "Never mind, I have got a piece of paper"—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a pocket book and tore a piece of paper, and I opened my lamp and he lighted his—he then said "I shall take a turn down this turning (meaning Banim Street), as there are several new unfinished houses there, and I have often found men and women asleep in them, and as there are lots of shavings lying about I expect a fire might happen there"—he then left me and went down Banim Street and I went on my beat—about 11.20 I heard there was a fire in Bradmore Street—I saw a fire escape and followed it to 33, Banim Street; I got there about 11.40—I found there had been a fire in that house under the staircase; it was out then—it was an unfinished house—I saw Langston and other constables there, and I saw the prisoner standing on the opposite side—about 4 o'clock in the morning I was in the Glenthorn Road—I saw the prisoner near the Godolphin schools—he told me that he had had another in the Southerton Road, and he said "I am afraid I shall have another in the schools"—I said "Have you seen any one?"—he said "No, I was in the next turning and heard the smash of glass, and running round the place there was a fire"—that referred to Southerton Road—I said "It must be some one invisible"—I left him between the schools and the church—he went in at the small gate leading from Glen<lb/>thorn Road to the church grounds—I went once round my beat and about 4.15 or 4.20 I saw him again at the corner of Oxford Road and Glenthorn Road springing his rattle and whistling—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Run for the fire engine, there is a fire in the schools"—I asked him what schools—he said "The Godolphin schools"—I said "It must be a small one, I can neither see fire or smoke"—he said "It is small, but I am afraid it may get larger; run for the fire engine; it is inside the school"—I went to the fire station in Brook Green Road and gave the alarm, and I assisted with the escape, it did not go as far as the schools—I went to the schools by myself—I did not go in—I saw Inspector Skeats there, and he posted me in a field at the back to watch—that was about 4.60—I saw nothing to attract my attention—I went off duty at 6 a.m.—I saw the prisoner about 6.5 in the Grove—he said "Here, I want to speak to you; have you got the money?"—I said "What money?"—he said "The money for calling the fire engine, the turncock, and the fire escape"—I said "No"—he said "There is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. allowed for that, did you spring the rattle at the fire station?"—I said "I did"—he said "There is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. allowed for that"—I said "I am certain we are not allowed to receive it"—he said "Why?"—I said "How about signing your name for it?"—he said "Have it, and sign a wrong name for it; did you go back with the fire escape?"—I said "I did not"—he said "If you had you would have received the money; do as I have done when in the</p>

On Sunday night, 27th January, I left the police-station with the prisoner—my beat was No. 10 and part of No. 9—about seven minutes to 11 I saw the prisoner in the Church Road, leading out of Banim Street—I said to him "By the acting<lb/>sergeant's orders you are to confine yourself to 11 beat, as I have taken the whole of 10"—he said "All right, give me a light for my lamp and I will go back"—I gave him a light with a piece of paper from my own pocket and we parted—he returned the same way as he came, towards Banim Street—I went round my beat—I saw him again about 4.15 a.m., in the Glenthorn Road, springing his rattle, with his light turned on (I had previously heard of the fire at 33, Banim Street)—he said "Make haste down, the schools are on fire"—I went down to the schools, through the wicket gate, and saw the fire blazing in the middle of the new class-rooms—the prisoner joined me near the door and went in with me from the yard—there was no one in the room when we got there, not until the school<lb/>master came—with his assistance we extinguished it with water—after it was out the prisoner said a few words to me which I did not understand, and he left the class-room the same way we went in—about three minutes after he had left one of the boys said "Oh, master, the shed is on fire"—we all went out together and found a quantity of shavings on fire in the shed just outside the class-room—a wheelbarrow was turned over on the shavings—I helped to trample out the fire—it was put out—I should judge from the appearance of it that it had only been alight about two minutes, or a minute—it was a regular flare—it is an open shed used by the boys when it is wet—I had not seen any appearance of fire as I entered the class-room with the prisoner—the shed was scorched by the flare—there is a small wall between the yard and the shed, about four or five feet high—there is a gateway in it leading to the class-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in orders, and am head master of the Godolphin Schools, Hammersmith—Lord Ebury is one of the trustees—on 28th January we were building new class-rooms—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct plan of the place—the class-rooms are connected with the dwelling-house by four doors, and there are people living therein—it was proposed to divide the class-rooms by folding doors—there is a com<lb/>munication from the class-room into the yard and from the yard into the covered playground—on 28th January, about 4 a.m., I was aroused by a knock at the side door—a communication was made to me and I roused the house—I went into the new wing and there found the prisoner in his uniform at the door opening between the lavatory and the new class<lb/>rooms—I only saw one fire, that was in the centre of the nearer class<lb/>room to the door through which I entered—there was some match board<lb/>ing put together in a sloping direction and that was all on fire—there had been a pile of it against the wall for several days before—the flooring was not fixed, only put down—it appeared that the match boards had been placed there and something set fire to underneath them which was blazing—I said to the prisoner "We had better separate these boards to get at the fire"—he said "No, you had better not, you will cause it to spread"—I at once obeyed him and went and got water from the lavatory and poured it on the fire with the assistance of the boys, and put it out—the joists were burnt—I then noticed a fire in the other class-room, or rather some of the boys were busy about it pouring water over it, and while busy over that one of the boys called out "There is a fire in the shed"—we rushed off to the shed at once—the prisoner was not in the room then, he had gone—I had collected some shavings together in the shed the previous night and put a wheelbarrow over them to prevent their catching fire during the fire in the pavilion—those were on fire, they had not been displaced—they had not been long alight—they were under the barrow where I had placed them—the barrow itself was partly burnt—that fire appeared to have been quite recently lighted—we scattered the shavings, poured water on them, and put the fire out before the firemen came—shortly after the firemen came the prisoner returned; he had been in the class-room while both fires were being put out—I did not notice him go away—he was not in the shed when we were putting that fire out—after that was out I heard of a fire again in Southerton Road—I don't know who said that—I afterwards more closely examined the two class<lb/>rooms and found that the joists were burnt in both—the boys are locked in at night—there were no shavings in either of the class-rooms, the floor was quite clear the night before—after the fire I noticed some charred shavings underneath the flooring in both places, under the joists—I had been alarmed about 10 minutes past 11 the night before by a report that the pavilion had been broken into, and about a quarter past 12 I found it was on fire, it was completely destroyed—that was in the cricket<lb/>ground on the further side of the playground.</p>

I am a builder and live at the Cottage, Church Road, Hammersmith—I was engaged making the alterations at the Godolphin School—my men were at work there on Saturday, 26th, up to 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I left about 4 o'clock, all was then quite safe—the pavilion in the cricket-field was used as a carpenter's workshop; that was locked up all safe—on Sunday morning, at 1 o'clock, it was entirely burnt down—I went to the new class-room on the Sunday, and left between 1 and 2 o'clock; there were no shavings lying about then—some match boards were lying by the side of the front wall in the class-room nearest the lavatory—I went through the shed to go to the class-room, there were a lot of shavings there and the barrow over them—I left all safe—I heard of the fire in the class-room between 6 and 7 o'clock on Monday morning, and I went there and examined the room—I saw the places where the two fires had been—the floor was destroyed for some 4 or 5 inches in diameter—the joists were burnt in one place, in the room nearest the lavatory, in the other only charred and blackened—in my judgment the fires had been caused by some shavings being set alight in the one nearest the lavatory—the fire must have been made first at the top and burnt downwards through the floor into the joists—the fires were about</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector T</hi>). On Saturday night, 26th January, about 12 o'clock, I went to the pavilion at the back of the Godolphin Schools—it was then nearly burnt down—the prisoner was there on duty—the prisoner said "Between 10 and 11 o'clock I found the door of the pavilion forced open, I went and called Mr. Morris, the master of the schools, some one inside the door informed me that the building was in the occupation of a builder in Church Road, Hammersmith, I went there, failed to find the builder, returned, and found the shed on fire, it had just broken out, I called Mr. Morris and called the fire engine—he said as far as he could see there were no tools stolen—he made a report of this in writing—on Monday morning, about 4.15, I received information of a fire at 76, Southerton Road—I went there—I found a pane of glass broken in the window facing the street, about 2 feet 8 inches from the ground, and the putty cut round the glass—I did not go in—I looked in and saw there had been some things burning on the ground—the fire was then out—I went to the Oxford Road and saw a fire engine outside the schools—I went into the class-room and saw there had been two separate fires; they were both out then—I afterwards examined and found some burnt embers of shavings under the boards—I saw the prisoner as I entered the class<lb/>room—I said "What is this?"—he said "Two fires in the new class<lb/>room"—I said "Did you discover them?"—he said "Yes, they had just broken out; I aroused the inmates and sent for the fire engine, and assisted Mr. Morris and the inmates to put the fire out with water; whilst we were doing this, a second fire occurred in the shed just outside the class<lb/>room, I went there and put that out also"—I said "It seems strange, you hare had a fire in Southerton Road this morning "—he said "Yes, I have"—I said "Did you discover that yourself"—he said "Yes, it is a short dis<lb/>tance down Southerton Road; I heard smashing of glass; I immediately ran to the spot and found a fire in the front room of No. 76"—from what I had been told I said "Did you put the fire out?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you enter the premises?"—he said "No, I did not"—I then sent him round his beat with instructions to have a good look round and if he saw any suspicious character to question him—about a quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards, about 4.50, he came back to the Godolphin Schools, out of breath, and said "There is another fire in Southerton Road"—I said "Where?"—he said "At some house in the same road"—the firemen who were there immediately went to the spot, and I followed immediately—when I got to 76 the fireman had a bundle of laths in his hand, just putting them out by kicking them against his toe—there were some candles burning on the bench—it was a very small fire, no water was used, it was put out—I saw the prisoner again at the station, about 6.30—I asked him whether he had been in Banim Street the previous night, as there was a fire there—he said "No, not before the fire"—the constables each have a lantern when they go on duty; there is one for each beat—the lamp for 11 beat is No. 23—the prisoner had that lamp—on Monday morning, the 28th, about 9.30, I examined lantern 23—I sent Sergeant Brooker for it, and he brought it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found some fragments of burnt shavings at the bottom of it and a small portion of saw dust at the side—I have kept it in the same state as I received it—on the Tuesday the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110050"/>
               <p>gave me this written report, it is his writing, signed by him—I saw him on the Tuesday morning, the 29th, about 9.30, at the superintendent's office, Hammersmith—the superintendent said to him "Did you carry lamp 23 on Sunday night?"—he said "Yes"—I took him into custody about 7.45 that evening—I told him he would be charged by order of the Commissioner with feloniously setting fire to the buildings at the Godolphin Schools, &amp;c.—after the charge was taken he said "How are you going to prove these fires to me; I am innocent; I should not care if it was anything I was guilty of."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The lamp was found in an open place where they are put by the men, but there was only this one there—I am positive that I found the saw dust there that morning—I did not give evidence before the Magistrate till the fourth remand—lighting the lamp once would not cause all this litter, lighting it two or three times would—no doubt the men often light their pipes by the lamps—it is contrary to orders, but they do it—I gave no report of my conversation with the prisoner—I made no note of it, I trust to my memory—I gave my evidence nearly a month afterwards—when he spoke of the fire in the shed he said "We put it out"—it is usual for policemen to fix cotton across the windows to see if any one has got in during his absence round his beat—I found some cotton on the window in Southerton Road—the prisoner told me he had done that—I made no report of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Fire Brigade, at Brook Green, Hammersmith—on Saturday, 26th January, about 11.45 p.m., I was called by the prisoner—he was in uniform, with his armlet on—he told me I was to go to a carpenter's workshop alight, near the Godolphin Schools—I questioned him as to what he had seen of it—he said it was well alight—I went and found the shed alight—it was burnt out and had fallen down—on Sunday, 27th January, about 11.51 p.m., I was called by a man named Spring—in consequence of what he said I went to 33, Banim Street, a small private house—I there found a cupboard under the staircase well alight and strangers applying water to it—my impres<lb/>sion was that that fire was caused by shavings—I found a quantity partly consumed, and a great quantity had been totally consumed by the appearance of the ashes—I should think that fire had been burning quite 15 minutes—I saw no policeman there when I arrived—the fire was partly put out on my arrival by strangers, but I extinguished it with my hand-pump, and went back to the station—about two o'clock on Monday morning, the 28th, I was called to a fire at 76, Southerton Road, by a stranger—I found that a quantity of shavings and sawdust had been alight all over the flooring in the front room ground floor, and some loose timber was burnt that was standing there—no part of the structure was burnt—the flooring was slightly charred—my opinion was that the fire originated under the window, as the greater quantity of shavings and sawdust appeared to be accumulated there—I arrived there about 2.13—the lower sash glass of the window was completely smashed away—I extinguished the fire by means of buckets—I left there about 2.50—I sa the prisoner there while I was putting the fire out—he did not do anything in putting out the fire in my presence, on my arrival he showed me a light to pull up by—at 4.35 a.m I was called</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110051"/>
               <p>to the Godolphin Schools alight by Police-constable Bruce—my opinion was that those two fires had been set on fire—there were two distinct fires, some distance apart—I give the same opinion as to the fire in the shed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner called me to the fire on the 26th—I recevied information from other persons as to the subsequent fires—the prisoner has not been to my station to receive any reward—ours is the station where such an application would be made—the person who gives the alarm of a fire would receive a shilling for it—the prisoner would be the person to receive it for the first fire, but not for the others—I have paid all the other cases except the call to the Godolphin Schools and the Oxford Road—they were calls by police-constables, and they have never been paid—in the other cases they have been paid and I have the receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The practice is to give a shilling for the call, eighteen<lb/>pence for assistance with the fire escape, and if life is saved another half crown, which would make five shillings.</p>

The Metropolitan Fire Brigade pays that—the Water Company pays for the call to the turncock—the fee for that is half-a-crown—I pay the rewards myself—if the prisoner had called for the reward to which he was entitled I should have paid him—I have no orders not to pay the police—I pay them as well as others, as long as I get the receipt—there is no reward for springing a rattle; that would be done to assist the man in getting away quickly.</p>

Joyce, 92, Canonbury Road," and the telegram and one of the letters are from Mr. Noel—I took Finch in custody, told him I was an officer, brought him to the door, and saw Sergeant Lambert arrest Baker—I told them both they would be charged with obtaining money by fraud from various persons in the name of Finch and Joyce—Finch said "Where is your warrant?"—I said "I cannot show it to you now, I will show it to you when you get to the station"—I knew him by sight—I searched him at the station and found a pocket knife, a key, and a card, and on Baker a knife and this engraved copy of a promissory note.

The date is the 28th January, 1878—I spoke to the prisoner and consulted my solicitor and applied for a warrant—I had a holiday after the deed was signed and went to business not later than September, 1877—the prisoner guaranteed 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there were some profits, but they did not amount to that sum—I know the prisoner's writing—the endorsements on these cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his—I was induced to enter the partnership by my accountant's report on the business—this is the cash-book beginning in February, 1875—from 18th February 1875.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Court-keeper and usher at the Rolls Court in Chancery Lane—I was there on Friday morning, 22nd February, and saw the prisoner coming towards the Court door, about 9.30—as soon as I unlocked the Court door he came in—I had seen him several times before in the Court—I think the first thing he said was "What time does the Master of the Rolls arrive?"—I said "Usually from 9.40 to 9.45"—he then asked if he was punctual in taking his seat in Court—I said "Yes, at 10 o'clock, or a few minutes after"—I then asked him, being motion morning, if he had a motion to move—he said no, but he had some particular business in the neighbourhood—he then turned round in the Court, and pointing to a large portrait on the wall, asked me if was a portrait of Lord Romilly—I said no, it was a portrait of Sir</p>

               <p>William Grant, one of the late Masters of the Rolls—he said "I thought it was, as he was a great man here"—he had got a note-book in his hand at the time—he walked up and down the Court once or twice—I thought he appeared rather excited—he was looking out of the window—he then immediately turned round and walked out of the Court—I saw him pass the window down the yard, making his way for the Chancery Lane entrance, and about 10 minutes afterwards the Master of the Rolls drew up in a Hansom cab—I went out of the Court hall door down the steps to meet the Master of the Rolls, to receive him out of his cab—I was assisting him out of the cab, and as soon as he set his foot on the ground I heard a report of firearms from behind me, and something struck me on the left ear—I can't tell what it was—it was some blast or heat or something which rendered me deaf the whole day afterwards on that side—it was a burning sensation—I immediately faced round to see where it proceeded from, and I saw the prisoner there with a pistol in his right hand, dropping it down after firing—I afterwards measured the distance from where I saw him standing, and found it was from 11 to 12 feet—the cab had turned into the Rolls Yard right up to the foot of the steps of the Court—as soon as the prisoner had fired he proceeded three or four steps towards the foot of the steps, and taking something from the note-book that he had in his hand either a piece of white paper or a card, he said "My name is Dodwell, Sir George"—I immediately turned round and called out "Police!"—we have a policeman on duty in the yard—Constable Whiting came and took the prisoner into custody—the Master of the Bolls did not take the paper or card, he passed on through the front hall into his private room—I waited outside to see the prisoner secured before I went into his lordship's private room—his lordship took his seat in Court in the course of 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—there is a dwarf wall at the place where this occurred, in the line of firing, about 14 feet high, about 19 yards from where the Master of the Rolls stepped out of his cab; I measured it—I have not had any ex<lb/>perience in firearms since I was a boy—the report of the pistol was very loud—I searched everywhere, and so did others, to see if we could find a bullet, but I could not find anything.</p>

I did not say before the Magistrate all that I have stated to-day; but you did say exactly what I have been say<lb/>ing now—I did not hear you give any reason why you asked about Lord Romilly—I don't remember your saying that you knew the father of the lady he had married—you might have said "How long has Sir George been master, about 12 years?"—I think I said about four years, that Lord Romilly retired about four years ago and died two years since—you very likely said you were not aware of that—I did not look at your book; I saw it in your hand, I did not touch it—I said "Have you ' a case on?" and you said "No, I am brought down here on particular business"—I think you asked me what you have been saying, and you moved up and down the Court and looked out of the window, talking to me at the time—when Sir George got out of the cab I dare say I pulled open one of the fly leaves of the Hansom, I usually do—I was in front of Sir George, he was meeting me; you were behind, broadside of us; we were both the same distance from you—I was at the foot of the steps; you were behind the driver, and Sir George was leaving the cab—the driver did not get down—you stood behind me, about 11 or 12 feet from</p>

               <p>both of us—I did not say before the Magistrate that you were behind me, they did not ask me the question—you could without any difficulty have gone close up to Sir George, there was no one to interfere with you; you could have come close up and touched me—you were pointing at Sir George Jessell's head, my head not being a foot from his—you were about four or five feet behind the body of the cab—I can't say how you hit my right ear, but I felt the effects of it pretty strongly—I did not see any paper flying after the report of the pistol—I have seen you in the Master of the Rolls's Court perhaps five or six times—I can't give you the dates—I think you were there in November, 1876—I don't think I said No<lb/>vember, 1877, before the Magistrate—I think I have seen you in the Court since 1876, I will undertake to swear it—I don't know on what occasion it was; some Petition of Right I know you were addressing his lordship about—I know you addressed him in some way—I don't remember saying before the Magistrate that you appeared excited—you told your name and offered the card or paper as well, but Sir George was nearly up the steps then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Master of the Rolls</hi>). On the morning of February 22nd I came to my Court shortly before 10 o'clock—as the cab turned into the Rolls Yard I saw the prisoner standing in Chancery Lane just in the entrance of the Rolls Yard—I recognised him, I had seen him many times, and I am certain he recognised me, he looked me full in the face—as the cab drew up to the door of the Court I turned to get out, the usher came down and opened the leaves of the cab, as he usually does, and I got out of the cab and was fairly out of it, my feet on the ground, when I saw the prisoner at my right hand side—I saw him take his right hand from under the left side of his coat, and he pre<lb/>sented a pistol at me; it appeared to me to be directed towards my head, he fired at the same moment and I saw the flash as well as heard the sound—I felt a blow on the right side of the head, as if some one had struck me with his fist—I instinctively looked at the pistol to see if it was a revolver, and in that case I should have jumped back into the cab; I saw it was not, and I waited a moment or two till the policeman was at the side of the prisoner, and then I walked on into my private room—the feeling of the blow lasted a very considerable time, some hours—nothing actually struck me, I was not wounded in any way—in earlier life I was familiar with the use of pistols, I have fired a great many—as a matter of opinion I have no doubt that this pistol contained something besides powder, but whether it was a bullet, or a slug, or a wad, one cannot say—I have presided on two occasions, in my own Court and in the Court of Appeal, when the prisoner had suits there—I do not as a rule recollect very much of what occurs before me, but it is very seldom that a man pleads his own case in my Court, for a very good reason, therefore, I do recollect more about the prisoner's case than I usually do, and since the event has occurred I have also refreshed my recollection by sending for the papers in both the cases—the first time I saw the prisoner was when he made an appli<lb/>cation to me in chambers on a summons in 1876—I knew nothing of him but what came before me in my judicial capacity, but it appeared from the papers that he had been a schoolmaster at an endowed school at a place called Collection in Devonshire, that the governing body of that school had dismissed him for alleged misconduct, and he refused to give up possession of the school-house or master's residence, and the governing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110069"/>
               <p>body brought an action against him to recover possession of the house, and the action was brought in my Court—it seems that the prisoner had retained a solicitor, who entered an appearance for him, and that he had then for some reason or other quarrelled with the solicitor, but being ignorant of the practice of the Court he had not taken the solicitor's name of the record; the result was that notice having been given to the solicitor on the part of the plaintiff, and no defence having been put in, the plaintiff signed judgment by reason of default—the prisoner then made an appli<lb/>cation to me, sitting in chambers, to set aside the judgment by default—he represented his case to me, and as I am always inclined to be very indulgent where mistakes of that kind have occurred, I put it to the plaintiff's counsel whether it would not be right to allow the judgment to be set aside, and I set it aside accordingly—The next occasion on which I saw the prisoner was in November, 1876, on the hearing of a demurrer—what had happened was this: he put in his statement of defence where I had set aside the judgment, and the plaintiff's counsel demurred, alleging that it was insufficient in law, and that demurrer came on to be heard before me in November, 1876—of course I had only to decide the question of law, no facts were in dispute—the prisoner again pleaded his own cause and at very considerable length—I was unable to make him understand that I had nothing whatever to do with the merits of the case; like most persons who plead their own cause, he had not quite understood the legal points, but he made a very long harangue to me with reference to his grievances, and the way in which he alleged he had been ill-treated, as to which I told him more than once I had nothing whatever to do; I had only to try the sufficiency of the defence as a matter of law—he then discussed some technical questions of very considerable nicety as to the construction of some ancient deeds or documents under which this school was founded of which he had been master—eventually I decided that the demurrer was well founded, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs—I then saw no more of the prisoner till the following year, when I presided in the Appeal Court one day with two other judges, and to my surprise I again saw the prisoner, who again came to plead his own case—on this occasion it was a Petition of Right—again I knew nothing of the fact beyond what appeared on the papers, but it was a question of law that had to be decided—the prisoner, it appeared from the papers, had been appointed chaplain to an industrial school at Brighton; the guardians of the poor, the governing body, had dismissed him from the office, and the prisoner presented a Petition of Right to the Queen to reinstate him—that petition came on to be heard before Vice-Chancellor Malins upon a demurrer which was put in on the part of the Crown, on the ground that there was no remedy by Petition of Right for anything of that sort; it was a mere question of law whether the Petition of Bight was the proper form—the Vice-Chancellor allowed the demurrer on the ground that it was not the proper mode of proceeding to be reinstated in such an office, and I happened to be the presiding Judge in the Appeal Court on the day that the appeal by the prisoner from that decision came on to be heard—I paid particular attention to the prisoner's demeanour on that day in consequence of an observation made to me by Lord Justice Thesiger, who sat on my right—I heard the prisoner, I hope, with very great patience, and I believe my brother Judges did the same—he made a very long speech that had not the slightest bearing upon the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110070"/>
               <p>legal point to be decided—he recounted to us his divers grievances, and the efforts he had made to obtain redress and the way in which the world in general had conspired against him, and showed how these charges were ill-founded, and so forth—he accused divers persons of various acts of mis<lb/>conduct towards him—I did not attempt to explain to him on that occasion that all that was beside the question, for I felt it was useless—when he had finished, I said, in very few words, that it was quite plain that the Petition of Right was not the proper remedy for any such grievance as he complained of, and the Court agreed with the Vice-Chancellor and con<lb/>firmed his decision—I hoped that would have been the last occasion I should have seen the prisoner, but it was not so—next week I was again presiding in the Court of Appeal when he came before the Court with an <hi rend="italic">exparte</hi> motion—I explained to him that he could not make an <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> motion against anybody in that way without giving notice; there-upon he said he would give notice—I was not at the Appeal Court the next week, therefore I cannot say what occurred, but the following week I was there again, and the prisoner again appeared, and he said he had a new ground to move upon, that he wished to set aside the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor on the ground of corruption in the Vice-Chancellor, that he had discovered that the Vice-Chancellor was a corrupt judge and that he was entitled to set aside the judgment on that ground—of course it was useless to attempt to persuade mm that that was nonsense, and when he persisted in going on, I said to him that if he went on with such language I should be compelled, most reluctantly, to use my power by directing that he should be removed from the Court, and not further in<lb/>terrupt the public business—he said he would not put me to that, and he bowed and went away, and that was the last time I saw him previous to my seeing him at the entrance of the Rolls Court, and beyond that I know nothing of him—his demeanour at the Appeal Court was decidedly irrational—his address was incoherent and irrelevant and seemed to me to show distinct signs of delusion—he seemed to think that every<lb/>body was, more or less, in a conspiracy against him, and those who have experience in those matters know that is a very common sign of the mind giving way; he repeated that several times—he appeared to me under a distinct delusion as to Vice-Chancellor Malins being a corrupt judge; he had no evidence of corruption, nothing but his own assertion, but he seemed to be under that belief, and that belief appeared to be also a de<lb/>lusion—when he was asked on one occasion why he said so, the only answer he could give was that on another occasion in the Appeal Court, when Lord Justice James presided, he had been allowed to call Vice-Chancellor Malins a corrupt Judge without reproof from the Bench, and that that showed he was corrupt Judge—that was what he told us, and I thought that was evidence of delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I saw you just at the entrance of the Rolls Yard in Chancery Lane when I drove in; I am quite sure of that—I do not know the noise that a pistol makes when it has a stone in it—I never fired one with a stone—I should not say that the greater the noise the less likely is the pistol to be loaded; there is a difference in the kind of noise, it is difficult to explain; the loudness would depend to a certain extent on the quantity of powder—I think I recollect you stopping me in the deli<lb/>very of my judgment in the Collation case—I gave my opinion, not that the charge against you was proved, but that if proved it was sufficient to warrant the governing body in dismissing you, and that was the point</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110071"/>
               <p>which I think you did not quite understand—I should be very much sur<lb/>prised to hear that an ex-Lord Chancellor took your view of the question—I do not think I said when you were in custody that I had every reason to believe you insane, but that there was reason to believe so—I said that your Petition of Right was of a very absurd character—I don't know who advised Her Majesty to sign it, but I presume the Attorney-General; it would be his duty to authorise it. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner here read a portion of his petition, which set forth certain complaints as to his dismissal</hi>.) I have decided, in conjunction with my colleagues, that that petition is not within the cog<lb/>nisance of the Court of Chancery, and I now say that it certainly is not—you have certainly made, I should say more than twice, a protest against what you call an unrighteous judgment—you were not punished, because Judges are very reluctant to commit men for contempt when it is merely by improper language; that is the only reason; I could have done so had I thought fit—it is quite possible that on one of the motions you said "Your Lordships are cruelly forcing me to break the law in order to state my case"—I have no recollection of that expression, you said so many things—very possibly you may have said that the charge of perjury was ruinous to a clergyman, I don't remember it—I used the expression "I am sorry it should have occurred," because I was naturally sorry; first, because I had run, as I thought, the risk of being killed, and next, because I thought that an unprovoked attack upon a Judge for deciding a point of law was a very bad example—I certainly did not feel that I had acted unjustly in the Collation case; I thought the demurrer which was put in by a very experienced counsel was a good demurrer, and I so decided.</p>

I was on duty at the Rolls Court on Friday morning, 22nd February, about a quarter to 10—my attention was attracted by hearing a report of firearms—I was in the police room in Rolls Yard, not outside in the yard—I ran out immediately and saw the Master of the Rolls going into the hall—the prisoner said "I have done it"—I said "What have you done?"—he said "I have shot the Master of the Rolls, which is what I intended to do"—he also said that the Master of the Rolls had—did him out of two rights—he said that in two breaths—he repeated as far as "had"—I had hold of him at the time and pulled him round, which caused him to stop in his sentence, and then he said "did me out of two rights"—I saw the pistol in his right hand—I took it from him, the barrel was quite warm, the hammer was half-cocked—I searched the prisoner and found on him some money and a canister containing some No. 2 gunpowder, 18 percussion caps, a note<lb/>book, and this letter, which he wished me to post. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read, addressed</hi> "Mr. Taylor, Tobacconist, No. 1, Moor Street, Soho, Feb. 21, 1878. Strictly private. My dear Sir,—I beg leave to ask you the very great favour of going over to see my wife on the top floor front, and break to her the fact that I am in custody for assaulting one of Her Majesty's Judges. After five and a third year's of incessant struggling I have come to the most unwelcome conclusion that I can gain a hearing, not a grand thing for any man in any country, only by breaking the law. All the press, with one honourable exception, have deliberately refused to admit my state<lb/>ment, and even to say sideways that I have been unlawfully treated—as all my statements are on affidavit, I firmly trust that God, who demands truth in his rational creatures, will bring me out of my very great trouble. All my necessary papers are in my little portmanteau. Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY J. DoDWELL</hi>.") I know the prisoner by sight, I had seen him on three or four occasions—I searched to see if I could find any trace of a bullet on the wall—I was not able to find one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I said before the Magistrate "I found no bullets on him"—Mr. Flowers said to me "Did not he say 'had done him out of two rights'?" and I said "No, your worship, had 'did'"—I say so now—I don't remember your saying that the Lord Chancellor had refused you your right of petitioning against forged returns—I have not the slightest recollection of your saying so—Bow Street is about half a mile from the Rolls Court—you said to me on the way there "Constable, do you remember me?"—I said "Yes, I do; on two or three occasions I have seen you in Rolls Yard and had conversation with you"—you also said something to the other constable in an under tone, which I did not hear.</p>

               <p>the Master of the Rolls into Court in order that he might thoroughly state his case and bring it before the public, and that his case would then show in a different light—he also said that the case of the detectives would be trivial when compared to his—I have been a volunteer—I have fired many hundred rounds with a rifle, both ball cartridge and blank cartridge—I heard the report of this pistol—if it container no bullet it must have had some wad in it, or paper, or something rammed home very tight—in my judgment it seemed to be the report of a pistol that was loaded with a bullet—I assisted to search to see if I could find any bullet—I made a careful examination of the stone and brickwork of the Rolls House and failed to find any trace or indentation of any bullet mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I heard you say nothing about shooting—I was with you and the policeman the whole time—I did not leave you while you were in the office in Rolls Yard—I must correct myself, I did go into the Rolls House to give notice to Mr. Hayes that you were about to proceed to Bow Street, and for him to follow—I did not see the pistol fired—I do not know why it has no ramrod—I am not a gunsmith—I can't say that I ever loaded a pistol, and am not aware how it is loaded—I say my impression was that it was loaded with a bullet, by the sound—it was a very loud report, it made a great vibration, there seemed to be a sharpness about it—I should judge from my experience of the rifle that it had something in it that had been rammed home very tightly—not having fired a pistol, I can't say whether a bullet fired from it does not make so loud a sound—I don't say that it was loaded with a bullet, I thought so—I did not say at Bow Street that I thought it was not loaded with a bullet—I don't think I was asked the question—I will not be sure whether I was or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law stationer—I heard the report of this pistol, and about an hour afterwards I looked for the trace of the bullet, but could not find any—in my judgment, by the sound, there was nothing in the pistol beyond paper; there must have been paper in it to cause the loud report—I did not find any paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I heard the report distinctly—it would make a sharper sound without a bullet, if it was properly loaded—the pro<lb/>per way of loading a pistol depends upon what kind of pistol it is—if loaded from the muzzle you would ram it down; it is not usual to have a ramrod always, some have and some have not—I have rammed them home with a piece of stick—I don't think this pistol unscrews—the Magistrate asked me if there was a stone in the pistol, and I said I should think not—a stone makes a buzzing noise if it was not round, not if it was like a marble, it would make a sound like a blank cartridge—this pistol made a noise like a blank cartridge—I was in my back office when it was fired, about 30 yards off—you were about a yard behind the cabdriver at the time, at least by the side of the cab; of course you were behind the driver—I saw the pistol fired—I was in my back office on the second floor.</p>

I am a grocer, of 12, Clarence Street, Notting<lb/>ham—I have known a man named Leo, a general merchant, in Liverpool, about 17 years—in December last he introduced Horn to me, I do not think he gave a name—he said this is a friend of mine, and I ultimately knew him as Horn—I recommended Leo and Horn to some apartments, and they set up business in the town as Mortimer and Co., auctioneers this is one of their cards; "W. Mortimer and Co., Agents and General Factors, Nottingham"—next day, I believe, Horn asked me to purchase this seal skin jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my wife bought it—he said "I travel in them and this is a sample which was left"—he said he was short, and asked my wife to buy it—she gave him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and we have had it ever since, till it was given up to the police—Leo afterwards showed me the ticket of another sealskin jacket—they were both together—he asked me if I would redeem it, and he could sell it—Horn mentioned the name of a very respectable man where he said he could sell it, a large firm in Nottingham—I redeemed it—I sent the money to Northampton and got it—I pawned it again in London for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because I was rather short—it was a better quality than this—I took both jackets to the wife of Superintendent Pickering, of the Nottingham Police—I was present when Horn was taken into custody at Nottingham—one of the County Police came down and said "I want Mr. Horn"—he said "That's not my name"—he said "Well, if it is your name or not, I shall take you"—he read the warrant to him in a beerhouse—Horn said "It is not me, you make a mistake," when he was taken to the station.</p>

I am a furrier, of Union Passage, Birmingham—on Saturday, 17th or 19th November, Horn came there and asked to see a man named Burnham, who was in my employ—Burnham was not in, and he said he would wait—while waiting he looked at some sealskin jackets and bought one lined with fur for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a tie for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d.—he gave me in payment a cheque drawn by Louis Miller in favour of William Horn for</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—after that he said he should like to have a sealskin jacket on approval—he took the sealskin jacket and tie away with him—this card was afterwards brought to me by the boots of the Lion Hotel—I believe it to be Horn's writing—I had seen him endorse the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Thomas, Red Lion, Commerce<lb/>cial Hotel. Dear Sir,—If you will send by bearer sealkin jacket on ap<lb/>proval until Monday you will oblige yours obediently, W.

In consequence of that I gave a sealskin jacket, value 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to the boots, and on the Monday I received this telegram: "From Mr. Horn, Bedford Restaurant, 22, High Street, Islington.

I meet them. Call on you to<lb/>morrow on my way to Man<lb/>chester, with cash. Reply paid. Say what train they leave." In con<lb/>sequence of that I sent two sealskin jackets to Euston station by train—I paid the cheque into my bank, but it was returned, marked "No account"—I have never been paid for any of the jackets—I saw them at Hammer<lb/>smith—the marks are taken off, but I believe them to be mine.</p>

He has our letter with him, copy of which will be sent to you forthwith. S. T. Shuttleworth." On 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> November. Gudgeon called again and brought this letter; "Dear Sir,—We learn this morning that our traveller, through an accident whilst driving, has not been able to call on your principal in Birmingham, and we now hand you the order transmitted to him, &amp;c."(<hi rend="italic">Giving an order for purses, pocket books and other articles to the amount of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I afterwards wrote to the two references and my letters came back through the dead letter office—Gudgeon then called again—I told him about the references and he gave me two others, to Mr. Newby and Mr. Smith—I saw Mr. Newby and I wrote to Mr. Smith, and from what I heard from them I did not execute the orders—I have never been paid for the samples—I saw them again at Hammersmith police-court in the pawnbroker's possession.</p>

I can also swear he gave Shuttleworth several sums of money which he received, that he has sworn to me more than once, and in one instance I saw money passed for this purpose, and that he used fictitious names to induce me to cash them, saying they was all right, and in these instances implicated me when I had no guilty knowledge for the time being, but since come to my knowledge.

I should like to see him"—he took me round to several public-houses, and afterwards to Hackney, on the pretence of finding Horn, but never found him—Shuttleworth walked away from Gudgeon, but he joined us afterwards—he left us when we went to Hackney—I watched the offices at Ludgate Hill from 23rd November to llth December—Shuttleworth's name was on the door and downstairs, and "Gudgeon, Private" on the opposite door—I could not get in—there was a card on the door marked "Return in half an hour"—I marked it and it was not moved—the old man fetched the letters every morning—I followed him on several occasions, and found that he did not go always to the same place—it was apparently arranged the previous night where they should meet—once while I was watching, some washing machines came there—there was nobody in the office, and they were taken away—I did not follow them—I saw it was a Great Western van—on December let I followed Gudgeon and Shuttleworth from Finsbury Street to the Smithfield goods station—I saw Field come out of the goods station, and they went with Field and the old man, who fetched the letters into a public house—I afterwards saw the van come up the incline with the machines on it, and followed it to Mr. Comfort's—Gudgeon and the old man also followed it, and afterwards I went to Mr. Comfort's and found them there—I found Shuttleworth in custody on 18th December in a beershop in Little Moorfields—I asked him if he would take a walk with me to see a friend, and I took him towards Falcon Square, where I met my inspector, who read the warrant to him—he said that he knew nothing about it—I mentioned a cheque uttered by Horn and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I mean to say that I am afraid of you—I never saw you with a revolver, or any weapons—during the 10 months of our courtship we were on most affectionate terms—I have received presents from you and met you by appointment—I wrote to you after receiving these letters, once on 19th February and again on the 21st—if you had been steady, and my father had not interfered, I might have been willing to renew the engagement—you have advised me to leave the Peacock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Peacock—the prosecutrix was barmaid there before I became landlord—I have seen the prisoner there on several occasions since the early part of January—on one occasion he was in a very excited state, and said if Miss Rowe did not renew the engagement he would shoot her and blow out his own brains at my bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have not influenced Miss Rowe to prosecute you—she has always behaved herself with the greatest propriety, she is a very good servant and looks after my business in a proper manner—I have never seen you with any weapons in your possession.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at Manchester, on 27th February—I told him it was for threatening to kill Lucy Rowe—he said he was very sorry, he did send the letters to her, and he would shed his heart's blood for her; he loved the girl, and he would not see any one else have her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. You were very surprised when I apprehended you—you said you had not the slightest intention of harming the girl; that you had been a fool for writing such letters, and you ought not to have written them; that you loved her too dearly to harm her; you also said that Mr. Gillard had got this up for you—you did not seem to think it was anything serious; you said that you thought it very strange that Miss Rowe should think you meant anything as you had made it all right before you left London; that she had shaken hands and given you a kiss—her father said at the station something to the effect that his daughter had nothing to do with the affair; that she was under his control, and he had com<lb/>pelled her to prosecute.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 14 years old and live at 12, Orb Street, Walworth—on Monday, 18th February, I was standing at the corner of Orb Street and Bedford Street, and saw a Hansom cab coming from Bedford Street towards Orb Street, going into the Rodney Road—it was on the left side of Bedford Street; I was standing at the other corner—I saw some little children there, they had just come out of school, and had been hunting Mr. Bye's chickens—Mrs. Draper tapped at her window to tell them to leave off, and they left off, and went in front of Mr. Bye's shop, on the pavement—the little boy Bollard was about 2 feet from the kerb stone, on the pavement; he was four or five years old—I saw the cab come up, and the chest of the horse knocked him over and the left wheel went over his back—Mrs. Draper said "Stop that cabman, he has run over the child"—he drove on—Mr. Matthews told him to stop, but he would not till he got to the City of Salisbury—I took his number—the little boy got up and walked to a window and fell down, and Mr. Matthews picked him up and took him up to the cabman to show him; he did not seem to take any notice, he turned red in the face—he did not say anything that I heard—the kerb is worn out at the corner, and the horse, in turning the corner sharp, had one foot on the pavement—the horse and the wheel of the cab were both on the footpath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The children had ceased from driving the chickens for about two or three minutes, and stood laughing in front of Mr. Bye's shop—the deceased was on the pavement, his feet were nearly touching the beginning of the kerb.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Draper, of No. 1, Bedford Street, Walworth, which is near the corner of Orb Street—I was sitting at mv window on the first floor on this afternoon, which commands a view of the corner of Orb Street and Mr. Bye's shop—I saw three children at Mr. Bye's corner; they had been in the road driving the chickens; I tapped at the window for them to get out of the road, and they ceased and went and stood on the pavement—the deceased stood with his back towards the road, and the cab drove round the corner and knocked him down and ran over his back—it was not going particularly quick, just a run.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was examined before the Coroner—the deceased boy was standing about a foot and a half on the pavement, where the wheel</p>

               <p>came—I was looking through the window, it was down—the boy was on the pavement, not on the kerb stone—Mr. Matthews was in the street, and he took the boy in his arms first to the City of Salisbury and then to the doctor's.</p>

I am a general dealer in Walworth—I was standing at the corner of Bedford Street and Orb Street, and noticed the deceased standing at the opposite corner about 4 inches from the gutter, on the kerb—I saw the cab coming down the street, and in turning the corner it struck against the kerb, which rather swayed him round and took a little graze off the kerb; the step of the cab caught the boy and knocked him into the gutter on his right side—the cab was not on the pavement—I ran across the road and picked the boy out of the gutter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This corner seems a very dangerous one to drive round, anybody going round it touches the corner of the kerb, which is very low; the wheel of the cab skidded as it came round—when I told the prisoner that he had run over the boy, he said "Eh," and looked very red, and more like a madman, he was so frightened—I took the boy to the hospital—the kerb is about 2 inches above the road; it has been worn down—the boy was on the kerb—if the cab had not driven against the kerb the accident would not have happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Grove House, Old Farthing Lane, Wands<lb/>worth—on the evening of 12th November last, about 9.30, I was coming up Old Farthing Lane and saw four men standing at the corner of a street—I passed them and went a good way up the street till very near my own gate—they passed me and stopped till I came up to them, when one of them came round to me, put his face under my umbrella, which I had in</p>

What good would it do to you after you have robbed me?"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my purse and umbrella, and this is one of the penknives—after they had done what they possibly could and got what they could from me they ran off and left me lying in the street with my head bleeding from eight wounds—I recovered myself a little and tried to get up, but was not able at first—the second time I was able and I got into my own house, and sent for the doctor, who came and dressed my wounds, and has attended me ever since—I was unable to attend the Court for some time—I cannot swear to the prisoners, but I thoroughly believe they are the men.</p>

I went to the public-house where Farmer the barman is who has given evidence. I afterwards went with Weaver and Cum<lb/>mings to the station. Weaver gave me half-a-crown to get some beer, of which we all partook.

               <p>about 9.30, I went to Lack's Dock—the back of the houses in High Street, Vauxhall, looks on the back of the houses in White Lion Court—I saw Gray on the ground—he pointed to the prisoner, who ran across the road—I followed with Glen, and am quite sure the prisoner is the man—he ran into 6, White Lion Court, and the door was shut, but it opened immediately, and I got in, and caught the prisoner by the left shoulder, and told him he must go to the station with me for assaulting 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said nothing, but dealt me a blow on my head with some blunt instrument, which knocked me insensible—I did not feel a second blow—he is the man I caught hold of—I had seen him before, and knew him by sight—I had been on that beat since Monday morning—I have two wounds on my head, and one on my arm—I feel the effect still—my helmet was knocked off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I knew him before, and knew his name was Quillegan, but I did not know his Christian name—I have seen him a good many times—the man who struck me was not on the stairs when he struck me the first blow, I never saw him anywhere but in the passage, another man was there who I cannot identify—a light shone from the top of the stairs over the balusters—it was sufficient for me to see the prisoner's features.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I got into the passage my attention was at once directed to laying hold of the prisoner—I put my hand upon the shoulder of the person immediately in front of me and that was the prisoner—there was no time for anybody else to come up—it must have been a blow from the man whose shoulder I touched—I saw nothing in his hand before he went in, but his back was to me—there was time to get a poker between the time of the door shutting and its being opened again, if it was convenient, and there was no time for anybody to have interposed.</p>

Excuse me until after dinner. I have given the men their orders. Your obedient servant." He did not come back that week—on 28th January I met him in Waterloo Road—he said "I have been to the counting-house, and Mr. Nicholson said I had better not commence business till I saw you"—I said "He was quite right, and had he let you come I should have been very much annoyed; I want you to explain your conduct last week"—he said "I suppose I can come back again, you will look over it?"—I said "Certainly not"—I refused to take him back—he then left me—I had not given him any authority to pay railway charges on 24th January or on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> February—when he left my service on 22nd January he had none to pay—none of my vans had run over a child—Mr. Rees, Mr. Berry, and Mr. Carrington are my customers.</p>

I am head attendant at the Brookwood County Lunatic Asylum, Woking—on 31st January I saw Kirk at Brookwood station, standing on the platform—I saw a parcel like a basket on the weighing machine—I saw "W. Kirk, 218, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East" on it—I saw the porter put it into the van—I heard the prisoner say "Is my parcel gone?"—I made a note in this book at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was taken to the police-court on 10th January and locked up until the Saturday week following, when the woman from the Ship came. A policeman then came to the cell door, and I asked the warder to let me put on my coat. She stood there with the warder, and then they brought me out and stood three more men with me. She did not say I was the man, but walked away with the warder. I was locked up for five weeks and did not know the dates till I came up here last Session, and I have two letters here to prove where I was (<hi rend="italic">Handing them in to Court</hi>). I own to giving one of the florins, but I did not know it was bad. Those letters will show that I could not have been there, and that I was working hard throwing up ballast. I could have proved it at the time, but after being locked up Ave weeks the man I was working with might forget the date. I did wear earrings. I am perfectly innocent.</p>
