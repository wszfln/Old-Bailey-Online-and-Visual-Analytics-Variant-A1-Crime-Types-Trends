                  </hi>. I live at 36, Westbourne Park Villas—about six weeks before I went to Paris there were intimate relations between myself and the prisoner—when we left for Paris I took with me this jewel<lb/>case, containing two large diamond stars, a pair of diamond earrings, a pearl and diamond locket, a pair of diamond screw earrings, a pearl and diamond bracelet, three diamond rings, a gipsy ring, a plain ring, and a gold collar-stud—the box also contained a pair of gold solitaires, a pair of gold sleeve<lb/>links, a pencil<lb/>case, and a turquoise and pearl bracelet with an inscription on the back—we left London for Paris on Friday, 14th June, and left on 24th—I was not present when the railway tickets were bought; whilst in Paris I saw them on the chimney<lb/>piece; they were return tickets—we put up at the Hotel de Rivoli—on the fourth day the prisoner asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he expected a letter from Rothschild's and he had not got it—I let him hove a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he would give it me back next day; it was never returned—on Monday, 24th June, it was arranged that we should return to London—in the early part of that day the prisoner wished me to dress, as a gentleman was coming to lunch with us; and I put on the jewellery—the gentleman did not come, and he asked me to take off the jewellery and put it in the jewel-case; he said it would not be comfortable for me to wear these screw earrings or the diamond rings in travelling—I took off the jewels and put them in the jewel-case—my property was all safe at that time, about half-past 1 in the day—I locked the jewel-case and packed it in my large traveling<lb/>box; that had no lock; it was only fastened with straps across—the prisoner told me to put my jewel-case between my dresses at the bottom of the trunk, and I did so—after doing so we went out to lunch—we went in a cab to some money-changing place, where the prisoner went in; I waited outside in</p>

               <p>the cab—that was about half-past 2—we left Paris that evening about 7; and arrived in London at 7 next morning, the 25th, and went to 36, West bourne Park Villas—Helen Taylor is my servant there—about 11 that morning she made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went to my travelling-box and missed my jewel-case—about 11.15 Taylor showed me my jewel-case broken and in its present state; she told me where she got it from; the gold solitaires, sleeve-links, pencil-case, and bracelet were left in it; all the others were gone—the total value of the property was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not mention my loss to the defendant that morning; I did in the evening, but before that I received this letter from him; it was brought by a cabman—at 9.30 that evening he called—I asked him why he had robbed me—he said I should have the things back on Friday—nothing more passed—I allowed him to stay there that evening—he slept in the house that night—next day I received this letter: "Write me a line, my darling, and forgive me all; by Friday all will be well"—I understood that to refer to his promise to return the things on Friday—on the Friday I received this letter: "By no chance, Emmie, can I return your things before Monday, but I shall be at your house that morning at half-past 10 with them"—he did not come on the Monday or send the things—I then consulted a friend, and on Tuesday, 2nd July, I went to the Marylebone Police-court, and a warrant was granted to take him into custody—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward was offered by public advertisement—on 3rd July I received this letter: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Tuesday. Emmieaa, when you read this and the enclosed, what will you think of me? I have been so wretched and miserable for the last week, hunting about to try and get money, and always disappointed. You wrote me Tuesday, to<lb/>day week, to send you any tickets I had. I said I had none. Such was and is the case, but the enclosed will explain itself. You will have to send Arthur and Co. 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when he will send you the things registered. You will have to send the enclosed letter also. You hall not be out of the money for long, for by hook or crook, if I have to get rid of all future interests I may have, I will get it for yon. I have not been to Long's since Friday 12 o'clock, and by the time you get this I shall be many miles from London till I can repay you what yon have to send. Think as well of me as you can. Some day you may forgive me. I dare not say anything more, I am too wretched. Capel." Enclosed in that was a letter in his handwriting to Messrs. Arthur and Co.—up to that time I did not know that he had obtained 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Arthur and Co.; he never told me a word about it; I did not know where my jewellery was till I got that letter; that reached me after the advertisement offering 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—when in Paris I had in my purse a sovereign and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; it contained the same money when we came to England on Tuesday morning, the 25th—it was in a sealskin bag on the dining<lb/>room table; I placed it there about 8 o'clock, after we had arrived—I saw the prisoner there; I left him there alone from half-past 8 till 9—I then went to my purse, and missed the sovereign—I did not say anything to him about it—I afterwards said in his hearing that I had lost it—I did not charge him with it—Taylor was the only other person there.,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have been living at Westbourne Park Villas two years, under the protection of a gentleman—the same gentleman has pro<lb/>vided the establishment during the whole of that time—I was separated from my husband—I first met the prisoner in 1875, at Cremorne, and for a</p>

               <p>short time afterwards I was on intimate terms with him—I denied with him at the Criterion, at St. James's Hall, and the Pall Mall Restaurant—I did not go to the theatre with him, or to Cremorne, on any other occasion—our acquaintance then dropped for two years; it was about six weeks before we went to Paris that I met with him again, I was frequently in his company during that six weeks; he slept at my house on several occasions, during that time he gave me about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I dined with him frequently at the Cafe Royale and else where—the trip to Paris was arranged about a fortnight before we went—we were not just to run over and see the Exhibition, I was to stay as long as I could, he was to remain with me the whole time—I always knew him by his own name; I only knew by reading it in the papers, that he had been in pecuniary difficulty at one time—it was at Scarborough last year—I did not know that he had been bankrupt—I did not talk to him at all about his financial position-—he did not intimate to me that he was expecting money, or that he had future interests from which he hoped to get money—we reached Paris on the morning of the 15th June and went direct to the hotel, we went to the races on Sunday in a carriage, we sometimes breakfasted and dined at the hotel, and sometimes at restau<lb/>rants—we did not have a carriage on any other occasion—we sometimes drove about in the evening, we did not go to the play, we used to stay at home, I told him I would not stay after the Monday; it was at my suggestion that the visit terminated then—we lunched about 2—my box was packed about 11—he left me at the' luncheon place for about half an hour and returned to me—we came by mail boat from Calais to Dover—I think the luggage was registered through, I left—it to the prisoner to register—we drove to my house and sat up till about 9, he then went to bed, I went to bed, I was up when my servant came and informed me about my jewel case—the prisoner returned that night and slept in the house—some of the missing jewellery was presented to me by the gentleman with whom I lived, I saw that gentleman on the Wednesday evening, and he observed the absence of my rings—he did not accompany me when I applied for the warrant, he was not instructing Mr. Lewis in this matter; I don't know that he was at the police-court, I went with my maid to the police-station, the gentleman was there taking a strong interest in the prosecution.</p>

I read in the paper last year that the prisoner was arrested or brought away from Scarborough for forging a cheque or something, I don't exactly remember what it as—he said nothing when leaving Paris about any difficulty of paying the hotel bill—the jewellery could be carried in a handkerchief or a pocket—I did not know that he had the jewellery upon him when he left me at the luncheon place for half an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that as to the articles charged in the first court the offence, if any, was committed and perfected in France; that the taking and converting was there, and that this Court as to those articles had there<lb/>fore no jurisdiction.

The taking, which must be felonious to satisfy an indictment forlarceny, was com<lb/>pleted in France, and for aught there was to the contrary, it must be a perfectly lawful act here</hi>.<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the cases cited when Reg. v. Carr was before Denman, Justice, were authorities to show that if the larceny was com<lb/>pleted out of the jurisdiction, a receiver in the jurisdiction could not be tried for that offence or for being accessory after the fact to the larceny, because the original offence was not trialable here. The decisiim of Gurney, Recorder, in Reg. v. Nadal was to the same effect. There the prisoner took Mr. Brown's goods in Paris end sent them, to his wife in a false name in London, and afterwards came to London and took possession of them. The late Recorder pointed out that if Nadal had travelled with the goods to London then would have been jurisdiction here, because the carrying away would have been in England, although the taking was in France. The doctrine of con<lb/>tinuing larceny applied wherever the goods were carried by the thief himself from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction</hi>.</p>

Sprange—I heard Hart give his evidence—he said he regarded Sprange as his partner from the first time that he saw him sign the books at the bank—Barclay and Bevan's Bank was mentioned—in answer to my question, Hart said "I never heard Sprange say that he was not my partner"—in March, 1878, Sprange consulted me about Hart's business—there was a conference between Sprange and myself at my office—Sprange was my client—Hart attended—the primary object of the conference was to introduce capital into the business of the National Bread and Biscuit Company, which was not a joint stock company—it was the prisoner's business—there is no company—Hart told me upon that occasion that Sprange was not his partner, and that he would not have a partner—the question was as to what number of shares Hart should have and what number should be given to Sprange in satisfaction of his debt—I sketched a scheme, or rather I spoke of a scheme; then Hart took the objection that as Sprange was not his partner he was not concerned as to how many shares he got—I believe that was on the same occasion—the interview came to an end for that reason, and there was an end of the matter—at the West<lb/>minster County Court I put the question to Hart as to whether he had ever said that Sprange was not his partner, and he said "I never heard Sprange say that he was not my partner."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I do not know that Sprange had been in the hands of another solicitor—he came to me first the end of April—now you mention it I believe the County Court action was in May—six or seven actions have been brought since—the settlement of an action has not been contemplated—the County Court action was for advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi>, on 8th, 10th, and 17th January, 1878—I do not remember the Judge saying "This case depends firstly upon whether there was a partnership as a matter of fact, and secondly whether the defendant did anything that would justify the plaintiff considering him a partner; these are the sole points"—he said there was no defence—he had before him the bank books</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of Seething Lane, City—I had known Sprange many years prior to November, 1877—in consequence of a conversation which I had with him on 5th November, 1877, I went with him to meet Hart to a restaurant in Crutched Friars—he introduced me to Hart as a gentleman wanting a book-keeper in his business, and asked me if I could undertake it, Mr. Sprange having said that he had advanced money to Hart—then terms were made as to what I was to receive—Mr. Sprange said that he could not engage me, it not being his business, but Mr. Hart's, and Hart must make any arrangements that were necessary—I went into Hart's employment immediately, and remained four months—in the course of my business I opened this cash account of A. C. Sprange—I remember a meeting at the counting-house at which Mr. Sprange, Mr. Hart, and myself were present—that was early in January last—Mr. Upton urged being appointed manager of the business, and Mr. Hart was compelled to make that appointment because he was the only person who could make it—Mr. Sprange said so when Mr. Upton came for the place—I always under<lb/>stood Hart to be the proprietor of the business.</p>

I said "What for?" He said "I want to repay money that I have had from other people," and that he had had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Sprange and wanted to pay it off, and if I would lend him that money he would give me a share—I asked him what position Sprange held, and what security Sprange held for his 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Nothing except the profits of the shop"—we discussed whether I should have a third or half share, and in answer to my inquiries he said Sprange was not his partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not asked, but volunteered to give my evidence about a month ago—I did not go to the police-court—Hart did not tell me he wanted to pay Sprange out, and that he wanted it done in six months.</p>

               <p>Simpson's Chop-house, when he spoke of whole-meal bread, which was being made by Hill and Co., and he recommended me to try it—Hart said he should start himself by-and-by—we had interviews from time to time about it—Hart asked me to lend him money—I lent him from half-a-crown to half-a-sovereign, and sometimes a sovereign, but very seldom, small sums—in September, 1877, it was proposed that I should lend him money on the profits of the business—I declined till I was sure I could do it without making myself liable beyond the amount I lent—I then purchased Smith's law book on Partnerships, and Hart and I consulted it together—I am afraid we were none the wiser afterwards—I began to advance Hart money about the middle of September—the first cheque was for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, but it went on to the extent of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in six weeks—with guarantees and everything I am liable for about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had many conversations about my being regarded as his partner—he said he would hot have a partner, and secondly, he would not for a minute entertain the idea of my becoming his partner—that was stated repeatedly—I was present at the interview with Hart and Heritage at Mr. Heritage's office—I heard Hart say distinctly in Mr. Heritage's presence that I was not a partner—I also remember the interview between myself, Hart, and Mr. Clease—Hart then stated to Mr. Clease that I was not his partner, and that it was his own business—I was examined at the Westminster County Court—in none of my interviews with Hart did he suggest that I was a partner, or liable as partner; it was the other way.</p>

I knew Hart wanted money—the first time I went to Beyan's Bank was on 13th November—I signed a book there; I believe Hart did so—Mr. Upton made advances—I cannot tell you when—I cannot tell when Mr. Upton came first upon the scene—it was before Christmas, 1877—he was to act as secretary—he afterwards had authority to write cheques—in January, 1878, a proposal was made to obtain a loan of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of the premises and my personal guarantee—I went to Barclay's on 17th January, when an alteration took place in the books; Upton was then authorised to sign cheques, and Hart ceased to do so—I signed this document—(<hi rend="italic">containing the phrase</hi>: "I shall be jolly glad to have my money returned, with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonus, at any time within six months; of course, being relieved from all liabilities")—Hart asked me for it—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">a letter to Hart, dated 14th December</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">proposing to form a syndicate, and containing the phrase</hi>, "or take another partner")—that was in the pressure of business, and "another" was not meant—I meant, "take a partner"—it was written after a conversation with the bankers, in which I explained my position to them—I distinctly stated before the Magistrate that the conversation occurred in which Hart stated I was not a partner—Mr. Bevan was a witness—I do not recollect his declining to pledge himself that Hart had said I was not a partner—I heard his evidence—I do not recollect his saying, "I have no recollection of anything being said about the position of Sprange in the matter"—this is my writing, "Please honour the signature of Mr. Frederick Upton on our account; H. W. Har will cease to sign from this date.—A. Charles Sprange, H. W. Hart, Proprietors of the National Bread and Biscuit Company."</p>

               <p>—out of the money I received for the resin I paid altogether about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the prisoner's account, exculsive of some money that I had paid to get rid of an execution—I drew cheques for it—the last part of the money was paid to Mr. Wright, the Sheriff's officer, about the 11th July—a day or two after I had given the prisoner the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said in order to make the matter look like a business transaction I must give him accommodation bills for the amount of the resin, to pass through his books, and he sent his clerk out for two blank forms, and he drew the bills out to make up the amount—he had previously made an invoice of the resin to me, to make it appear as if Robinbson and Co. had actually bought the resin—he drew out the invoice to the amount of 882<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I put a receipt stamp upon it—no correspondence had passed between us in reference to the resin, but he asked me to write out two or three emorandums, purporting to come from Robinson and Co., asking his price for the resin—I did that, and the papers were put into his pigeon-holes—a day or two after I had given him the bills he told me that he had been served with a writ that day—he showed it to me and said he was about stopping payment—the writ was for an amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on some action that had been brought against him by some company—he explained the matter to me at the time, but I forget it now—I got rather afraid that they might come down upon me, especially being a bankrupt—he laughed at the idea, and said "You have nothing to be afraid of, you will hear nothing about it; I will invent some means to make matters very pleasant to both of us"—I bothered him a good deal about it at the time, and he told me of a plan which he had of meeting the bills—he said "I have given the bills to my trustees, and have told them they are first-class assets; first of all you must take larger offices." and eventually I took some on the second floor of Gresham House—the person who lets the rooms resides on the ground floor—I agreed to buy the furniture for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Layland was present at the interview with Holmes, the clerk—he advised me what to pay for the furniture and all that—I bought the furniture from the first and second floor—Layland said as he had not got offices, he would give me samples of goods from places, and there were a lot of boxes which he told me to put round the room to make it look as if it was an old firm, and he gave me a lot of calicoes from his own office, which were put about the private room—on the same or the next day he said he would introduce me to people who would introduce me to merchants, and he did introduce me to serveral gentleman—he said "I will tell you the people to whom to apply for goods, give you specification of the class of goods to buy for the different markets, and how to write the different description of the goods, how to order them, and that he would let Mr. Lusk, his buyer or his clerk, go and buy goods in the country—I told him I had better give him some money to go into the country with—I first gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other money afterwards—he had another cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after that—the goods that Mr. Lusk bought were to come up to London to me, and Layland said he knew how to get the money to pay the accommodation bills, for Robinson and Co., would pay those bills, and no reference would be wanted, because they would see that it was a good firm, having paid all that 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in fact, I was to be Robinson and Co., but he was to be the factotum, and when the liquidation was got through, and he had obtained his discharge, he was to be my clerk—he also mentioned that he would put 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business—I wrote to a lot of people whose names he gave me—I concluded</p>

               <p>they were his creditors—I got goods—I was prosecuted—I pleaded guilty to obtaining those goods at the last January Sessions—Layland intro<lb/>duced me to Wisbeach, and they to Garrod and Co.—I obtained from Garrod and Co. white lead to the value of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they drew upon me for the amount—Layland knew it, because he knew I was introduced to Mr. Garrod, and he also told me to buy white lead, but I made a mistake and bought the other, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—he informed me of it afterwards—the object of buying the white lead was to get sufficient money to meet bills that were becoming due in October, in order that Robinson and Co. might be able to get goods from Layland's creditors—first of all he said "I do not think I had better get an advance; you had better try Edward Bouquet;" after that Layland took the bills of lading, and got an advance by some means of 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe he told me so—when I saw there was a difficulty in getting the advance he told me to go to another firm, which I did, but was unsuccessful—the lead was to be shipped to Calcutta—I understood Layland to be in the habit of advancing money on goods, that that was his business—I do not know what became of the 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I never had a fraction of it—he said "I had better render you an account, to make it a business transaction"—that is the account that he sent me; it is for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and is in Layland's writing—it was arranged at the time that all the transactions should be in a business<lb/>like manner—I had no books at that time, but Layland was continually asking me to keep books, and it was to be passed through my books if I had them—this invoice was found at my place in Gresham House; I left it there—they took my papers; that is how they came to know of Layland's letter; I never received any of that money myself—I had to pawn my rings and pay the freight before, I could get the bills of lading—I do not know whether the persons instituting these proceedings are creditors of Layland; they are persons to whom I was introduced through his instrumentality. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am undergoing my sentence of 18 months in Holloway Prison—I do not appear in my prison dress, but I think it is sufficient disgrace to appear at all; a man may have his feelings—I made a statement before I was convicted, not with a hope of diminishing my sentence; I never said so; my sentence was respited from session to session—I had no hope, but I knew if the Judge knew the whole of the matter it would be of some benefit to me—I do not know how many charges there were against me; I never saw the indictment—I was not charged with the white lead—the case of stealing 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was one which Layland introduced to me—as to the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of paper, they had that back—that was charged, also the 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is all through Layland, and paper to the value of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 6th November—on the 20th Novembers quantity of wine to the value of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 30th November wines to the value of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 16th November a quantity of spades, shovels, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>; the spades were in Jackson's case—I did not say that I was innocent—I was taken into custody on the 30th November—I do not remember the amount of goods that I was charged with obtaining during September, October, and November—Layland did not wish his name to appear in the resin transaction; I do not know the reason—my impression was that he was a money<lb/>lender; I did not know for certain that he shipped goods to Australia and India; I did not know the nature of his business—I must have known that he shipped goods because he shipped some for me once—in the white lead transaction he appeared to be raising money for Robinson; he was acting for Robinson and Co., and there his name would appear as a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Layland would not know that I had a cheque from Wilson and Co., unless he looked at my book, or I had told him—it was Bouquet who introduced me to Layland to get an advance—he was on very intimate terms with Layland, but he was not very friendly with me—I cannot say what Bouquet got out of the transaction—he was always having money, and he had apartments in my house and never paid me—as fast as I got money he came to know of it somehow—I was like a spider sucked all round—Miller and Co. wrote to me first of all saying that my first bill had been returned—I was away at the time and Layland went up to the office and inquired of Jackson whether the first bill would be paid—in consequence of most of those goods that Layland was buying at Manchester not coming up on account of the reference of Kohinson and Co. not being satisfactory, people would not send up their goods, and the bill of course was returned, and Miller and Co. wrote to Robinson and Co. the same night, saying that the bill had been returned and that they wanted to. see me, and I went to see them with Layland, Layland fetched me—the object of going was to tide over this time and for the purpose of making some arrangement about the bill—Layland said that I was to say that I was in a good position, and if they would allow me a certain time the bills would be met, and I promised to pay them a certain sum of money—the white lead was got and Layland got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not bring it back to me—he got the cheque cashed in some manner or other and paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Miller and Co.—Layland sent me the account Which shows it—this is the account (dated 2nd Nov., 1877)—it was sent to my office—Layland kept 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. discount on his own acceptance and charged a further 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his com<lb/>mission and liability—the account shows it—I only say it to show you that I of the 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I never got a farthing—I believe the dates on the bills are ficti<lb/>tious, because the bills themselves are fictitious and they won't give the date of the transactions at all—I was guilty, and pleaded guilty, but I had no I idea there were such frauds—I have not said that I did not commit them.</p>

Layland's indebtedness of course depends on the accuracy of the account sales—a considerable quantity have yet to come in—the average time after shipping goods of getting account sales is five or six months by steamer and nine or ten months by sailing ship—Layland did not ship goods if we advised him they were not good in the market—our advances depended on the class of goods—we never discounted foreign bills—some advances were made by cheque; we endorsed bills and sold them again in the market by exchange on India—Mr. Hears was in England in September and October—I do not know whether he had business transac<lb/>tions with Robinson—he knew something of him—the notes part of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. may have come from Mears—a small parcel of resin was shipped through us, 46casks, value 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 12th July, 1877—Layland offered us some other resin before this—I do not remember the date—I told him the parcel was too large for us—we were buying bills to a certain extent—speaking from memory, we offered him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred—he showed us a mememorandum; I cannot swear whether it was the invoice—he said the offer was not enough—we heard no more of it—it was an article which we could have sent out to the Indian market—there was a fall in the Indian market and a depreciation in the rate of exchange between this country equal to about 25 per cent.—to<lb/>day it is equal to 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I take it for granted Layland knew all this as well as I—if the articles were not good for the Indian market we should not have advanced money upon them—we refused several parcels of goods on the ground of their unfitness—we shipped the 46 casks of resin for Layland, not for Robinson and Co.—I have seen some of Mears's letters to Layland con<lb/>taining remonstrances with regard to overdrafts and goods sent contrary to directions—I do not remember the complaint as to leather—that was a fairish account—I remember some, thick leather going out—there was then a prospect of a war with Russia which would have caused a demand for it for saddles.</p>

I have known instances where goods have been con<lb/>demned by the Indian consignees, and where they were subsequently bought and sent out, but I have known also when, Mears's judgment having been incorrect, goods have realised a greater profit when goods have fallen here, and in the face of advice they have made a profit—Layland did not act against Mears's advice, but we had no check upon him, for if he did not like to send them through us he had plenty of others to send them through.</p>

I live at 44, Millard Street, Hackney Wick—in the beginning of July I lived at 20, Ellesmere Road, Bow, with my mother, Harriet Barlow, and my sister—we occupied the ground floor—the prisoner is my aunt, my mother's sister; she lived on the first floor—on 2nd July I had been out with my mother—we were both quite sober—we returned home between 12 and L o'clock—my sister was then in the room—we went into a ground-floor bedroom, and the prisoner came down and asked what the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was—my mother said that there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> and called her a liar, and said she would dash her brains out, and she went to the drawers and picked up a glass thing used for flowers, which holds about a pint of water—she then asked my mother to let her go by; my mother said, "No, when you have put that down," and the prisoner put the glass down and Walked to the room door to go upstairs—my mother then walked to the fireplace, and the prisoner rushed to the table and picked up a flower-pot full of mould with a flower in it and threw it at my mother, who was three or four yards off; it struck her on the forehead; she began to bleed, and ran out to the bottom of the street calling out "Police!"—I went after her, and found her bleeding—she did not return to the house; she was taken to the police<lb/>station, where her head was dressed—the prisoner was not sober—the only <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was that in getting a light I knocked an image off the mantelpiece; it was my mother's—next day my mother appeared before the Magistrate and charged the prisoner with the assault, and she was sent to prison for three months—on Saturday, July 6th, my mother complained of her jaw, and on 7th July she went to the hospital, and died on the 8th.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner—on 3rd July, about 4 a.m., I saw Harriet Barlow at 'the police-station with a wound on her forehead just over one eyebrow, about 2 ¼ inches long and going to the bone—it contained the grit of a flower-pot, and dirt, and it was in a dangerous place, being over certain nerves, and other things might follow—I only saw her once.</p>

                  </hi>. On 7th July I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital, and I think about 2 p.m. Harriet Barlow came there suffering from lockjaw—I dressed a wound on her forehead—there was then as far as I remember a piece of plaister on it—she died of lockjaw on the 8th, fourteen hours after she was admitted—I did as much as I could for her—the wound was in a very unhealthy condition indeed, probably from a con<lb/>ciderable quantity of dirt having got into it—I made a post-mortem exami<lb/>nation, and that was the only wound—she died from lockjaw produced by the wound on her forehead—that is not uncommon, especially in that position, it is a very important nerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I cannot tell when the wound was dressed last—<hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> is attributable to many causes, but generally to a wound—if she had a wound on the back of her head a few weeks before, which had appa<lb/>rently healed, I could not say that that had anything to do with the lockjaw; when I found a wound like this which would be a distinct cause, I cannot attribute it to a more remote cause—if she had been drinking during the week that would make her more unhealthy.</p>

On looking for the paper in the course of half an hour, it could not be found anywhere. I put the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with other moneys of the Society into my desk, and told Captain crowe of the circumstances, and subsequently handed your 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over to captain Crowe, with 2, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides. He paid this 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Hamp<lb/>shire Bank in my presence to the credit of the Society's account You called at the offices of Mr. Crowe about the 3rd July; you were told to wait until the 9th July, when there would be a board meeting, and it was hoped that captain Crowe would be well enough to attend and explain the circumstances. In the mean time Captain Crowe has not recovered, and I have been arrested. If this board meeting had been held, on Captain Crowe's statement the directors would have sanctioned the withdrawal of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least I am informed that Captain Crowe is at the seaside suffering from a sunstroke, but if I knew his address I would write him. However, I have told you the facts. I understand I am remanded this week without bail, in conse<lb/>quence of this intended unfounded charge, and I shall certainly hold you personally responsible for damages if you proceed further before you verify or falsify these statements. The Bank have commenced a prosecution which they cannot sustain, and they are now seeking extraneous aid to bolster up their charges. Rest assured, madam, of the safety of your money. For nine years I have been manager of the Lombard Building Society, and never have my accounts been found wrong, and it would be singular if yours should be the only case out of the many that have passed through my hands that have been dealt with improperly. I am cruelly persecuted by the present adminis<lb/>trators of the Bank, and not because I have taken any of their money, if so I ought to be punished, but simply because they desire to get rid of me without giving me the moneys due to Mr. Do give these statements an investigation before you plunge yourself into false statements and me into further trouble."</p>

               <p>Lombard Building Society—it was my duty to receive all moneys paid in on—account of the Society—Mr. Pryor was acting as manager of the Building Society, and was a servant in their employ—it was the duty of the servants of the Society who received money to pay it over to me, and I entered it in the cash<lb/>book—I don't think the Building Society had any banking account in February this year, except that in the beginning of the year they paid some money into the Hampshire Bank—before that they deposited their money with the Lombard Deposit Bank, of which Mr. Pryor was also the manager, and credit in their books was given to the Building Society—I did not receive from Mr. Pryor the two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes which Miss King paid him on 18th Feb.; I don't believe I ever did, not that I know of—I never got them to credit to Miss King—I had not made any entry of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until Miss King called—I recollect her calling and showing me her deposit-book-up to that time I did not know that she had paid in the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was about a fortnight after 18th February—I spoke to Mr. Pryor about it then; he came outside—I told him that Miss King was there, and wanted the scrip for her shares in the Building Society, and he said they should be sent on—I see some writing on these two notes—on this one, 89912, part is torn off, there is hardly enough of it to judge whose it is; it looks something like Mr. Pryor's, I believe it is, the part that is torn—the "Matthews, 42, Old Kent Road," I believe to be Mr. Pryor's too—I do not know the writing of "Keith" on the other.</p>

The one that is torn off I think looks more like Mr. Pryor's writing, the other does not look so much like it, although I believe—it is his—I have been a clerk in the Building Society about five months, but I have been in the Bank a long time, I was cashier to the Bank—I believe I went to the Building Society in February—after Mr. Pryor's arrest, the secretary or directors would open the letters; Mr. Crowe was act<lb/>ing as secretary, he attended every day—since Mr. Pryor's arrest he has continued to act for the Building Society—I believe he is now secretary and manager of it; he is in Court—he has an office at 151, Cannon Street—when Miss King called about a fortnight after 18th February and spoke to me, there were perhaps two or three clerks there—it then became known to me in their presence that she was a depositor for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the Building Society—this book, initialled by Mr. Pryor, is the ordinary book kept by proprietors, which they bring with them to get their interest—the produc<lb/>tion of that book to any clerk in the office would show that she was a depositor for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a register of shareholders—I don't recollect Mr. Pryor saying anything to me about having lost the slip. with Miss King's address on it—I recollect a search being made on that same day by Mr. Pryor's direction; he searched himself in his office, I saw him looking about his office; I did not take part in the search, I don't know whether the other clerks did—it was known in the office that Miss King had paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe money was lent by the Building Society through Mr. Pryor to the Bank—when it was lent, I O U's were given by the Building Society, and were put in my till as cash—Mr. Pellow was cashier of the Bank—the Building Society would sometimes borrow from Pellow, and sometimes the Bank through Pellow would borrow from the Building Society—I recollect an I O U with reference to this matter being given by Mr. Pellow—there was an inquiry into the position, liabilities, and assets of the Building Society, previous to September last—I believe Messrs.

               <p>as a rule—sometimes in the press of business a few days might elapse—I had two or three <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi>'s in my till, I think, relating to transactions of this kind—I had not five or six—I had about three or four—they would be Mr. Pellow's <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi>'s for money I had lent him, with Mr. Pryor's approval, it was through him it was done, lent by his direction—that was a thing entirely within the province of Mr. Pryor—the books would show that the person producing the book would be entitled to the scrip—Mr. Pryor could not have concealed the fact that Miss King was entitled to the scrip, as soon as the book was produced by her—Mr. Pryor did not sign the book, the directors had to sign it—they met about once a month, and sometimes six weeks—if the directors found that, by oversight, the scrip had not been sent to a depositor, it would be written out and sent, if the money had been paid—on Mr. Pryor having taken the loan an initialled the book, the granting of scrip would be a formality, after the book had gone out—Mr. Edward Lee was solicitor to the Building Society—Mr. Lee is not assisting in this prosecution that I am aware of—he is now the solicitor for the Building Society—there are two of the directors of the Building Society in Court—I believe that Mr. Lee and the directors are no parties to this prosecution.</p>

In February the directors of' the Building Society were Captain Sleeman, Captain Crowe, and Mr. Mahon—Mr. Lee was the solicitor both for the Building Society and the Deposit Bank—I kept the books of the Building Society—I was at 35, Lombard Street before Mr. Pellow came there—I think he came the about the 25th of February last—I was at the Bank before Mr. Pellow came—he is not there now, he left when the Bank went into liquidation—prior his coming I did the work both for the Bank and the Building Society—on 18th February I was acting for both—this was the cash-book of the Building Society in use on the 18th February of the present year—that is the book in which, if I had received the money, I should have entered the sums paid by Miss King—I do not find any such entry in that book—the book goes to the 28th February—I do not find any entry here of money having been received from Miss King on the 28th Feb—this is the 9 cash-book of the Building Society—it was put in use on 1ST March, 1878—it came to be used on March 1ST because I was made cashier only of the Building Society—things are carried over to the Bank—that is the Building Society cash-book only—we began a new book on 1ST March because we had not kept the two accounts separately; we had mixed the money—in that book there are entries only of the Building Society's moneys—the moneys had been mixed—that book is for the Building Society only, and this book of 1ST March is for the Building Society only—on the 18th February I was also cashier of the Deposit Bank—money borrowed for the Bank would be in the I 0 U—it would be my duty to enter into the cash-book of the Bank moneys I received on their account—I have the cash-book here—that book was kept by me—these entries were made by me on the days on which they purport to be made—they were matters which came through my own cognizance—I find moneys entered as received from the Bank to the Building Society, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the Building Society and the Bank money was mixed, and. the difference at the end of the day was brought into the Bank book and was balanced in the same way on the opposite side—there would be an entry in the book at the end, of the different balances—Mr. Pryor was the manager of the Bank, and he was aware of the way in which I conducted the business to which I was appointed—I am not a clerk</p>

Assuming that was not so, there is an end of the case, and I think there is an end of the case as to the larceny with regard to the property of Miss King, because there is no evidence to show that at the time the prisoner took this money into his possession he then had it in his mind to convert it to his own use. He had authority to receive. His duty was to pay over to the cashier, but he had an authority, if he thought fit to exercise it, to lend the money to the Lombard Bank, of which he was manager. The question is whether he did lend it to the Lombard Bank or did account for it in the alternative to the cashier, or whether he appropriated it to his own use with a view personally to take the benefit of it and to conceal it</hi>.</p>

               <p>my manuscript is part of the print and an addition as well—I did not give evidence before the committee of investigation, the accountants—I do not myself know of an entry of 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the Bank by Mr. Pryor, I see it entered here—Mr. Liddington kept the cashier's book of the Building Society, I kept the cash<lb/>book of the Bank—if 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken from the Bank coffers it would be in the Bank cash<lb/>book, or if it was the subject of an I 0 U—I did not see the balance-sheet that was published by the Building Society—the whole of the payments ought to appear in the Bank cash-book—I checked this with the counterfoils of the receipts which were given, the book itself I had not access to; sometimes I gave the receipts, sometimes those at the counter—if there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which a receipt was given that would appear in a counterfoil (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Crowe produced the receipts</hi>)—the I 0 U's were entered in pencil as a memorandum and would be kept in suspense; that would not appear in any book, because in some cases it was repaid, without appearing in the books, perhaps repaid the following day—that frequently happened in the course of business; it might last over three or four days—the entries would be made in pencil for the purpose of making the balance of the day, and then they would be rubbed out—I got value for my I 0 U from Mr. Pryor, and I had it some days before 1ST April, 1 cannot say within a week or ten days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting manager of the Lombard Build<lb/>ing Society—I am a public accountant by profession—I was appointed acting manager one day in August last, at a general meeting of the members—previous to that I acted as secretary, from the 12th <hi rend="italic">of</hi> April (that was immediately after Mr. Pryor's arrest upon the charge on which he was tried and acquitted); and the books were removed to my offices in Cannon Street—the letters and communications after that would not necessarily come to me, some were sent over to me, but the letters arriving at Lombard Street were generally opened before coming to me, I cannot say by whom, the persons in possession—the directors were not in the habit of going in there; the prisoner had not access to them, they would not be given to him—I had no office in the Building Society before he was arrested—saw Miss King at my office, I cannot remember how soon after the prisoner's arrest; it was soon after I was appointed, I think it would be somewhere in April—I don't remember whether I saw the members' sub<lb/>scription book, if I did not my clerk did—that book is regarded as the record of the transaction between the Building Society and the depositor, entitling the depositor to the scrip—it did not come to my knowledge that she complained of not getting the scrip, I think I heard nothing about the scrip—she gave notice to withdraw the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the formal granting of scrip is a matter within the duty of the directors when they meet—I looked through the books with regard to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and found no entry of it, and I informed her that there was no entry in the books showing that she had paid the money—my clerk searched the books, and I subsequently looked and found no entry of Miss King's name; and I sub<lb/>sequently spoke to Mr. Pryor, and he acknowledged to having received the</p>

               <p>money—he explained to me about the entry on the slip of paper—accountants were employed to go through the affairs of the Building Society, and they prepared a balance-sheet—when I first spoke to Mr. Pryor about Miss King's 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said he had accounted for it; properly, he ought to have placed it in my hands—I think that was after he was acquitted; I am not sure whether he was out on bail, or whether he had been acquitted; it was after his acquittal on the first charge—he said he would not pay the money to the Building Society because he had already used it for the Building Society's service, but he would leave it privately in my hands pending an investigation, so that I might pay Miss King; this I refused, because the trustees had passed a resolution that they would only pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound down, to all applicants for withdrawals; therefore I could only have paid her over 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he wanted me to hold the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession privately, and pay her the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Building Society, and when I was satisfied that he had applied the money to the Building Society's use, he was to have it back again—he wished the lady to have the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without giving her further trouble—I never acknowledged Miss King as a member, because I could not trace her name in the books; I am only giving you the explanation that Mr. Pryor gave me—the matter as to how far this money had been applied for the Society's use was investigated afterwards by the accountant a, but before I had time to investigate it Mr. Pryor was in custody again, on the charge of stealing the spoons—Messrs. Lee and Reynolds made out a balance-sheet—they were thoroughly independent persons, appointed by the directors and others at a general meeting; I don't think they knew Mr. Pryor—I have brought the original manuscript of the balance sheet for the prosecution; they subpoenaed me to produce what balance-sheets I had; that is the only one I have ever seen—there is a resolution of the directors approving and adopting that balance-sheet; in it they credit Miss King and debit the Lombard Bank—Mr. Pryor attended on the accountants; I was away at the time when this balance-sheet was made out—I know nothing about Mr. Pellow's I O U—the directors of the Building, Society are not prosecuting Mr. Pryor; they are not the same directors who were in last February; they were not appointed till August.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>:"To Miss King, 75, Riversdale Road, Highbury, from Bossell Crowe and Company, accountants, banking and insurance agents, 151, Cannon Street Dear Madam: Re Lombard Building Society. I beg to inform you that the Chairman of the Board is at present in Paris" (Colonel Mahon waschairman), "and one of the trustees has been sun-struck, and is now at Brighton for the benefit of his health" (that was my father); "conse<lb/>quently there was no meeting to<lb/>day.

That was written after I left at night—I instructed my clerk to write that—I gave him general instructions—I should not have written quite in that sense if I had dictated the letter—before that Miss King had come to my office one day when Mr. Pryor was in the inside office—I don't re<lb/>collect asking her to let me have the book to show Mr. Pryor; I may have done so—I went in to Mr. Pryor in reference to her application, and he admitted the obligation—he said he had initialled the book, but I forget whether I had the book in my hand or not—I told Miss King that if she would call on the following Tuesday I hoped to be in a position to give her a cheque—she said that she was in urgent need of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time the pro<lb/>posal was made to me she wished Mr. to speak to Mr. Pryor, and as he had the money, to be kind enough to let her have half of it—I only knew from what she said that the money had been paid in—I don't know whether it was on that occasion that she showed me the book—I believe I have seen the book—I don't remember that it was on that occasion that she asked me to go back and ask Mr. Pryor to let her have the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she did ask me to let her have it on one occasion—she never asked me to intercede with Mr. Pryor to let her have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if not, a portion; she never put it in that way to me—I told her that we were only paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound with respect to withdrawals—she said she should be very glad to have that—I said; "I cannot let you have it, because it appears to me that you have paid nothing to the Society," and then it was, I think, that she subsequently came with her book—I cannot say whether the interview with her at which I told her that I hoped to be able to give her a cheque on the following Tuesday was before or after that letter of the 11th July; I could not tell without my call-book—I could not say whether it was on the 28th June—I cannot say anything about dates—I don't remember whether I ever took the book in to Mr. Pryor—I remember seeing the book in Miss King's possession—I don't remember whether it was on that occasion that she begged me to give her as much money as we could—I did not say that there would be a meeting of directors on the following Tuesday, and that I would do something for her—our meeting was on Monday—I sug<lb/>gested that she should call on Tuesday, and Mr. Pryor had told me in the meantime that some arrangement could be made by which she could have</p>

                  </hi>. On 27th, 28th, and 29th June last, I was solicitor to the LombardBank I received a letter from Mr. Wontner, Mr. Pryor's solicitor—I wrote in reply—I have not found the letter—I was only subpoenaed his morning. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I have seen my clients on the subject of your letter of the 27th threatening to take proceedings against them for moneys alleged to be due to Mr. Pryor, and also for damage by the late prosecution taken against them. In reply there to, I have to suggest that with regard to the matters referred to in the first part of your letter, all questions of account be referred to two independent accountants.")I received the letter referred to there from Mr. Wontner—Mr. Pryor had made a claim against, the Bank that they were in his debt—I forget the extent—several matters were mentioned in the letter, some were matters of account—I believe <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote my letter after communication with the Board—a special meeting had been called in consequence of Messrs. Wontner's letter, and I was instructed to write the letter which has just been read—the contemplation on all sides was to refer the matter to arbitration, except the threatened execution—I know that gentleman standing there with the black moistache—his name is Mr. Bernard Bowler—no doubt he was made shareholder to the extent of five shares in order to institute these roceed<lb/>ings;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210060"/>
               <p>that put an end to the arbitration—I believe Pryor was given into custody the same day I wrote that letter—I think Bowler was made a shareholder the same week, and I was at the Board and protested against him—he brought a charge first of all against Mr. Pryor for assault at the police-station—these other charges grew gradually—Mr. Pryor had knocked him down for his impudence, then he made this charge—early in the year some difference of opinion had arisen between the new directors of the Bank, and the old directors who were trustees of the Building Society—previous to these differences, money from the Building Society, or received on account of the Building Society, would, as a matter of course, go at once into the offers of the Bank—I recommended the trustees of the Building Society not to allow their money to remain at the Lombard Deposit Bank, I thought they ought to seek other investments—I advised that a banking account should be opened elsewhere—several banks were mentioned, and eventually the Hampshire Bank was agreed upon, and an account was opened in the names of two of the trustees of the Building Society, Mr. Sleeman and Captain Crowe—I cannot fix the date, but assuming the account was opened on 18th February, moneys received by Pryor ought to have gone into the Hampshire Banking Company—after my instructions in February Mr. Pryor was reducing the amount of money he held on account of the Building Society by the Bank, that was by my suggestion—it was a question of thousands at first—at the time when I suggested that they had no right to leave funds in the hands of the Lombard Bank they had 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said as trustees they were personally liable, and the funds bought to be put into some sounder investment—the account was reduced very considerably, to a few hundreds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not present when the account was opened—I cannot tell you when the Building Society ceased to pay money into the Deposit Bank—prior to the opening cash might have been paid into the Deposit Bank up to the 18th February, because the Bank kept the same staff of clerks as the Building Society, and all sums must have passed through their hands—I do not know whether Pryor was a salaried clerk of the Building Society—I do not think he was—he was manager—some arrangement was made that the Building Society should receive certain interest from the Bank for the business which was carried on—it was Pryor's business originally—I do not know that he was paid by the Building Society—he was paid by the Bank <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have not compared these notes carefully—I see the name of Matthews on this one—the "S. E." looks like Pryor's handwriting; I would not like to say positively—I form no opinion upon it—if I had been asked at first whether it was Pryor's writing I should probably have said no, but I do not like to say that in the face of the other evidence—if I had not heard the other evidence I would not say so—I would not say so now—the writing of, Matthews and Keith are certainly distinct—having expressed no opinion with regard to the clear signature I should not like to express one on the other note—I could not recognise them.</p>

I live at North Feltham, close to the powder milk, next door to Aldridge, the deceased—I know the prisoner—about 1 o'clock on 19th December I was walking towards my house with him and the two Fennells—Aldridge came trotting along behind with his donkey cart—directly he got within a yard or two of us he went to get out of his cart with a brush in his hand, and he fell, being beery, and the wheel went over his arm—I picked him up, and he went up to Reeves saying "One to one," and struck him on the head with the brush—Reeves took it from him and struck him back with it on the side of the head, and threw it over his shoulder away from him, and on they went a—fighting, and I walked away and called his wife out and stopped the donkey.</p>

I have known the prisoner ever since he was born—he has always been quiet and peaceable—he works with us at Lee's nursery—he lives at home with his mother, about 200 yards from Aldridge—we were all going home to our dinner—Aldridge was standing up in the cart till he fell out; he was too beery to stand up I think—he had one foot on the shaft; he caught his leg in the rein and fell out, either on the side of his head or his shoulder; he was getting out in a temper—I believe the wheel went over his left arm—none of us had said anything to him—the prisoner's hat was cut and his forehead with the blow Aldridge gave him—Aldridge was about 30 years of age, short, and a good deal bigger-built man than the prisoner—I have often seen him drunk; he was once charged with an assault on a woman and bound over to keep the peace—I saw the prisoner and Aldridge again in the afternoon, they met and Aldridge said something to the prisoner, but I went on and did not hear what passed.</p>

I am the widow of the deceased, William Henry Aldridge, and live at Feltham—on 19th September, about 1 o'clock, I was indoors—I heard some men pass the gate, and I looked out to see what was the cause of so much talk; I saw my husband's donkey cart pass the gate with no one in it—I looked down the Feltham Road and saw my husband lying on the ground and the prisoner bending over him beating him withhis clenched fist—I went as fast as I could and separated them—when my husband attempted to get up Reeves knocked him down in the ditch; that occurred three times; I helped him up, and Reeves then left us and went towards home—my husband did not strike Reeves at all while I was there—when we were going home Reeves turned round to come and fight him again, and took off his coat and gave it to Knight to hold—I persuaded my husband to go back and then Reeves went away—we went home; I unharnessed the donkey and my husband took it into the stable and put some soot in the shed; he seemed sober, he talked to me sensibly—his nose and mouth were very much swollen; I assisted him to undress and wash—about half or three-quarters of an hour afterward he went out again to find his hand brush, and I afterwards saw Reeves pass the gate in the same direction—I went out and looked down the road and 1 saw my husband coming back, and Reeves struck him and knocked him down—I went and got between them and separated them—my husband did not get up again; Reeves beat him about the head and face while he was lying on the ground—Reeves gave me a blow and knocked me down—my husband attempted to get up but did not succeed in doing so; when he got</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">ELIZABETH BUBBERS</hi>. I am 14 years of age, and am in service at 27, City Road—I have known the prisoner seven years—he has been courting me the last two years—he was my Sunday-school teacher—it came to the knowledge of my mother and she forbid me to have any more to do with him; after that I did not speak to him; he tried to speak to me from time to time—on Sunday evening, 13th October, about 6 o'clock, I came out to go to chapel; I saw the prisoner on the other side of the street waiting for me; he was coming across the road and I crossed over to avoid him, he then crossed again to me and I crossed back again to read a bill outside the City Road Chapel, so as to let him go on in front of me, because I did not like him behind me—he did not pass me, he hid in the gates of the chapel—I then went on and he followed me again—I turned round and saw him coming—I then went on again and turned round again, and he was close behind me, and then he threw some hot stuff upon me—I did not see him do it, but there was no one else near—he was close to me, almost touching me; the stuff came on the back of my neck, it almost took away my senses—I do not know whether I fell or not, but when I came to I was in a young man's arms and the prisoner had gone—I went straight home to my mother's and made a complaint—she took me to a doctor's and the burns were dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had been out that afternoon about 3 o'clock—I was not walking about—I do not remember walking in Bunhill Fields Burying Ground—I know a young man at the chemist's shop and another young man it the grocer's—I have spoken to them—I have not walked with them, only with one, the chemist, not the other—they are not rough young men—I did not push one of their hats off that afternoon, or see it done—they do not sometimes push my bonnet off, they are not up to all sorts of larks—it was about 6 o'clock when I left my place to go out—it was about three minutes afterwards that I saw the prisoner at the chapel gates, and about another three minutes when he threw the stuff over me, I do not think it was quite so long—I did not stop only when I was reading the bill—my mother's house is in Noble Street, St Luke's, about ten minutes' walk from the chapel—I looked at my mother's clock and it was then twenty minutes to 7.</p>
               <p>By the <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I looked back twice while I walked along—the gas was flight in the street—I am quite sure it was the prisoner whom I saw stand<lb/>ing on the opposite side of the street, and he was about a yard from me when he did this—I saw his face when I turned round, and am quite sure of him.</p>

On Sunday evening, 13th October, my daughter came home at twenty minutes to 7 by my clock—my house is between five and tenminutes' walk from 27, City Road—she was crying bitterly and com<lb/>plained of somebody throwing something over her, mentioning a name—some time ago I had forbidden her to speak to the prisoner, and I went to</p>

About half-past 10 on the evening of 13th October I went to the prisoner's house—he was in bed—I went with his father to his room—I told him I was a police sergeant, and that I was going to apprehend him for throwing some vitriol over a girl in the City Road, at 6 o'clock this evening—he said "I can prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>; I have not been in the City Road to<lb/>night"—a little while afterwards he said "Oh! I forgot, I came along by St. Mark's Church and Old Street into the City Road up into Church Street, East Road, to see a friend"—I told him to put on the same things that he had on that evening, and come with me—he got a pair of trousers and put on; there were no braces to them, and he turned round to some other trousers and got the braces from them—I took up those trousers, and some money fell out of the pocket—I said "These are light trousers"—the girl had given a description of the clothes he was wearing—he then dressed, and I took him to the station—I then sent a constable for the light trousers, and they were brought; before that I brought the girl and the prisoner together, and he said "lizzie, you did not see me do it"—she gave an account of what had happened and said it was he who had done it—she said "You know you done it, John"—I asked her if those were the same clothes that he had on, and she said that was the same coat—I gave the trousers to the doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The coat was not new, the trousers were very nearly new—I went to the prisoner's house with Mrs. Bubbers—I saw the father and asked whether he was at home—he said "Yes, and he, is in bed now; he has come home queer and very sick"—I did not hear the mother say "I should think he has been ill, after what he has done to my daughter"—Boyden, another detective, was with me—I had a paper with me, upon which the sergeant had written the time at which the offence was committed—it was 6.40—the girl was with me—6.40 was the time when the party came to the station to lodge the information—I did not say it was half-past 6 when the matter had occurred; I said "6 o'clock" because the girl had told me that was the time she came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of the police—about 7 o'clock on the evening of 13th October I went to the station to see the prosecutrix—she had two scars on the back of the neck as though a corrsive Huid had been thrown; they were black at the time; and there was one an the right cheek, the cuticle was removed—I examined her hat and jacket—there was some liquid on the hat, and some holes in the ribbon—the back of the hat and jacket were also discoloured, or rather the colour was removed; they were also wet and in holes—I examined the fluid; it was sulphuric acid; and I believe it was sulphuric acid on her peck and cheek—I was afterwards shown the prisoner's coat and trousers; the trousers were light grey, and on the right leg there was one spot of discoloration, and on the flap of the ticket-pocket of the coat there was some discoloration; the lining was also coloured red, and on the lower part of the front of the coat thorp were also marks of the same description; ' I tested them, on the Monday morning they were fresh stains; it was sulphuric acid.</p>

               <p>saleable value of which, by auction, I imagine was from 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—silver goods are usually sold by weight, and watches by their value—the plate had been inherited by my wife, and had a greater worth than the money value—previous to December, 1876, I told the prisoner I wanted to borrow some money—he asked me on what security, and I showed him the watches and plate, which he looked at; and I told him I wanted to borrow 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them, and I thought they were worth much more than that—he said he did not think so, and told a clerk to write this cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was brought to me, but the prisoner told me he meant 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cashed the cheque by another clerk there, who only gave me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I signed this memorandum of deposit.

I got back this acknowledg<lb/>ment, but received no reply to my request—I made a further payment of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in December—I have not got a receipt for that—on 16th January, 1878, I sent a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and received this receipt—on 8th May I took 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash to the bank, which I paid, and got this receipt, which says "In settlement of advance"—I did not see Pryor then—I asked for the goods; the clerks searched, but they were nowhere to be found, and I did not get them—this list of the articles is in my writing—I took it away when I got the advance—it was shown to Pryor—I made these pencil marks on a memorandum—Drew, the constable, showed me some silver articles—I went to West Lodge on, I believe, May 24, with Mr. Jones, one of the clerks from the bank, and my wife—we found a quantity of silver articles there—I looked them over, and picked out them three salt spoons, two of which we marked B. T., and this gravy spoon marked M., also four teaspoons, two tablepoons, and a ladle; 12 articles altogether—I have not seen the gold watches or the remainder of the goods—I knew nothing of the sale of my property—I never received any papers from the bank except receipts, not even a letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Finsbury Place—I was a clerk in the Lombard Deposit Bank from 1876—I left in January this year, and went back again in May—I remember Mr. Pace getting the advance on his goods in December, 1876, I happened to see them in the lump in Mr. Payor's room at the bank—lie was the manager and had charge of the securities upon which money was advanced—Mr. Tyler, the secretary, drew this cheque and I cashed it—there is an iron safe of which Mr. Pryor had the key at that time—on folio 223 of the ledger I find an account opened by the ledger clerk with Mr. Pace, who is charged with an advance on 1st September, 1876; there are various entries to his credit, and it is settled by the payment of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 7th May—in Mr. Pryor's absence the secretary opened letters addressed to the manager—I never saw the bulk of the goods or the parcel again till 24th May, when Mr. Pace identified them—during 1876 and 1877, sales by auction took place of goods deposited for advances, and I know by the auctioneer paying in, that account sales were rendered and the accounts were squared up with the balance, but there never was a case of spoons and forks before, it was usually bills of sale or wines—I signed most of these receipts and the money went to the bank—Mr. Pace afterwards called at the Bank, and the secretary sent me with him to show him West Lodge, and if he identified anything it was to be brought away—I was present at the station when these goods were produced, which were taken from the house; Mr. Pryor said that he bought them at an auction, and I saw him pull a catalogue out of his pocket, but I do not know what was in it—I cannot say whether this is it—I do not think any one else produced one—he did not read from it, he conversed with the superin<lb/>tendent—a jeweller from the neighbourhood was called in, who said in his presence that they were silver, and he said that he should never have known it—I said that they were silver before the jeweller was called in—a book was kept for the register of mortgages of securities, but it fell into disuse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I still persist in saying that I saw a catalogue come out of Mr. Pryor's pocket—when the catalogue was referred to at the office</p>

               <p>the prisoner pointed out the goods in the hook and said, "That is my lot"—I do not know whether there was a lettering in manuscript of the auctioneer, showing the prices the various goods fetched—I said that they were silver—Mr. Pryor may have said that if there was a wrong description, it was not his, but the auctioneer's; I know there was a long conversation—he afterwards said that he should not have known they were silver unless he had been told by the jeweller—there are twenty different forms—the deposit note is in the usual form for that kind of money lending, but it is the only transaction I had of the kind, and I think it would probably appear in the register of mortgages—the prisoner took a lot. of papers out of his pocket, and I understood there was a catalogue—I swear to the best of my knowledge that he took out a catalogue from his pocket, but there were a lot of people interposed between him and me, a lot of papers were taken from his pocket, and I understood the catalogue came from his pocket, but I cannot swear it exactly—Mr. Pryor had charge of the safe, and there were other valuables in it extending to hundreds, I do Dot know about thousands—we also had warehouses where other property was stored, but not to the extent of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Pryor had the control of everything, and this is the only charge I know of: his misappropriating a spoon—I did not know about the sale before his arrest—I knew that Cooke and several other auctioneers had been in the habit of selling things occasionally for the Bank—they are the same persons who sold these goods—the accounts were made up and entered in the books, but not till after the auctioneers sent in their cross claims—the Bank had a right, on the failure of any one payment, to realise the goods—I know a man named Banks, I met him in July at the European Tavern, opposite the Mansion House—I did not say to Banks that I knew Pryor had bought the spoons which he had been charged with stealing, but I may have told him what Mr. Pryor's explanation was; I do not remember saying so—I db not remember a friend being with me, or his remarking to me in Banks's hearing that the mode Mr. Pryor was being treated was a shame, or my saying "Yes, but I can't help it," there were so many people about having drink; nor do I remember saying, "What a shame"—I left in January; and I have heard since from Mr. Gaskill that there has been a committee of investigation—I do not know of any resolution by the directors with reference to realising any goods for any installments which were in arrear—I was not there in February and' March.</p>

I left in January, 1878, and returned in May—I do not know of a Mr. Lomas having deposited goods for an advance of money from the Bank; I know there was an auction, but I was not there at the time—I saw Mr. Lomas <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> in and out of the office—I did not go with him to Mr. Pryor's residence—I did not hear Mr. Pryor say anything at the station about Lomas.</p>

               <p>Bank for a loan, and were plated goods, and had been sold at an auction, and he had purchased them—Mr. Jones said several times "They are silver goods," and to satisfy myself I sent for a silversmith, who came and said that they were silver—I asked Mr. Pryor how he accounted for their being silver when he represented them to be plated only—he referred me to 8 catalogue, which resembled this which was in the office, and said that be purchased them at that sale, and pointed to lots 170, 171, and 187—170 is "12 plated table-spoons and forks," 171 is "12 ditto," and 187 is "12 superior plated tea-spoons"—lot 172 was not referred to—lam clear as to 171, but not as to the others—after he pointed to those lots the silversmith came in and said "They are silver"—the prisoner said that he bought them at the sale, and if they had been described wrongly in the catalogue that was the auctioneer's fault and not his—the name of Lomas was mentioned, but I cannot recollect by whom—after the catalogue had been referred to I directed the sergeant to enter the charge on the charge sheet—Mr. Pryor took a bundle of papers from his pocket while Jones was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The catalogue was not one of them—Mr. Bowler was there, he made the charge and said "They are silver goods," and then I asked Mr. Pryor to point out to me where silver goods such as those produced were described in the catalogue—he then went through the catalogue, pointed out several entries, and said "These are the goods"—I did not see a description of them in the catalogue—I did not see a watch, there was nothing but the spoons—the lots I pointed out referred to spoons only—Barlow did not charge him with stealing a watch on that occasion, he said that the prisoner was wearing a gold watch which was part of the property, the prisoner said that it was not so, and I found that he had no watch, and only a bunch of keys attached to his chain—Barlow charged him with embezzling 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1873, but I said that I knew that the prisoner was carrying on business on his own account, and refused to take the charge—the secretary said that he knew that at that date the business was Mr. Pryor's, and that he could not be charged with embezzling from the Lombard Bank, which came into existence subsequently—Mr. Bowler then rushed round in a very excited manner and said "I will charge him with stealing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and before I could investigate that charge he made the charge of these silver spoons, which were then for the first time produced by Mr. Jones, and I investigated that charge—I did not take a spoon from a cupboard and show it to Mr. Pryor, nor did Hunt, the station sergeant, that I know of—he is not here—I made no pencil marks in the catalogue, and I only looked at the place Mr. Pryor referred to—the gold watch, brooch, earrings, soup-ladle, sugar-tongs, and forks, various, were not mentioned by Far. Bowler except when he said "The watch which the prisoner is wearing." <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. If I did not mention to the Magistrate that Bowler said that the spoons were silver it was a mistake—Bowler made the charge against the prisoner before Jones said that the spoons were silver, and after that Jones said "They are silver"—I was under the impression that I told the Magistrate that Jones made that observation—I told the Magistrate that it was Bowler who said that they were silver, and upon that I asked Pryor to point out in the catalogue where the silver goods were—I did not to<lb/>day intentionally omit what Bowler said—he first charged him with stealing 12 silver spoons, and Jones several times made several similar assertions aft the charge was made—there had been a criminal charge made against him</p>

                  </hi>. I have been secretary to the Lombard Deposit Bank from its commencement, about 1874, and continued so up to the liquidation last May—Messrs. Plunkett and Leader became the solicitors before the prisoner's trail in June—they acted in that, but he was taken out of their hands and put into Mr. Lewis's jointly with Mr. Lee, and when Mr. Lee resigned Plunkett and Leader became solicitors to the bank—that was about the end of June, and they have been the solicitors from that time and are conducting this prosecution—I am acquainted with the mode in which property was sold by the bank for non-payment of instalments—I was not aware that Mr. Pace's property had been so sold—in the event of the sale of property realising a larger amount than the bank claim, the surplus was paid over to the borrower, and a marked catalogue was sent to him—no account was rendered to the Bank to my knowledge by any auctioneer of the sale of Mr. Pace's goods—from January Captain De Van and Mr. Gaskin have been acting as directors of the Bank, but I do not think they were present at the meeting so early as January—I was sent for to the Seething Lane station when Pryor was given in custody on 29th June for embezzling 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went there with Mr. Jones—Mr. Bowler then said that he would give Mr. Pryor in charge for stealing 12 silver spoons—the inspector asked Pryor for an explanation—he said that he had bought them; the catalogue was produced, and the inspector asked Mr. Bowler to point out where they were, and when they looked at the catalogue they were found to be plated—they were handed round to all of us and we said they were silver—I said "I think two of those are Lomas's spoons."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">cross-examined</hi>.

Have you any about yon now?"—he said "Yes," and produced 14, also perforated with "C. D.," the initials of the firm—I said, "How did you get these?"—he said, "Two clerks," pointing to two gentlemen in the office, "let me have them to write letters for the firm when I am at home of a night"—I said, "You have sold six at a public-house"—he said, "That is a mistake"—I then produced three and said, "Here is three of them; you had half a quartern of gin and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change"—I took him into custody for stealing six—I said that I had known there had been a—thief in the place for the last 12 months, and I should search his place—I went to his place in Balmoral Road, Islington—I found in this flowerpot 19 duplicates and various articles of property; one relates to two flower<lb/>pots, one to a timepiece, one to a drum clock—he said, "Those are all yours, Mr. Beaumetz"—I said, "Here are two relating to—two</p>

I acted as receiver under the Court of Chancery in August, 1872—I am acquainted with the books of the Alders<lb/>gate Street business—about two years ago I believe the premises were sold, and then I left them—this is the day<lb/>book kept by the firm of Godfrey, Brown, and Saull—I have been frequently in Aldersgate Street, and the defendant has been there with these books—here is, at page 239, an entry, "W. Balchin, Fenchurch Street Buildings, six quarter casks pale foreign bandy"—then they are enumerated—they purport to be sold to William Balchin—at page 246, June 11th, is "Two quarter casks brandy" and three hogsheads of brandy to the same man—on page 247, June 13th, 107 gallons of rum, 14 gallons of pine<lb/>apple wine, and one hogshead of sherry—I hare seen the bought ledger of the Worship Street business; I should say it is the invoice book—all this is in the defendant's writing, as far as I can make out—I believe them to be his, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the entries in the Worship Street book—I find an entry here showing the entire amount of purchases for Balchin to be 633<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not been through the Worship Street books before.</p>

I am a wine merchant of Lower Thames Street—I was formerly clerk to the Aldersgate Street business, and was subsequently employed in the Worship Street business—I cannot give the dates, but it was for several years before 1872—I had given notice at Aldersgate Street, and required another situation—I saw the business was moving from one place to the other, and immediately on leaving Aldersgate Street I went to Worship Street and applied for a situation and obtained it—I never bought or sold wine for the business in Aldersgate Street on my own account—it was brought from one house to the other and entered in my name—I never bought of Aldersgate Street or sold to Worship Street—looking at the</p>

Brown"—I was not the only person who came from Aldersgate to Worship Street; there was a cellarman named "Cathaie," and believe one carman, whose name I forget; a Mr. Chitty and Mr. Lazarus, commercial travellers; practically the whole staff went—Mr. Brown managed the firm at Aldersgate Street before I left—I Was clerk to the firm under him and next in position to him in the office; I assumed precisely' the same position when I got to Worship Street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>).

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>that Mrs. Saull borrowed from Godfrey 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he then being her traveller have only been told so—I believe Mrs. Saull always denied having done go—I do not know that she also borrowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Godfrey—you examined me, 1 believe, two years ago—I remember something about an <hi rend="largeCaps">I O U</hi> for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but do not know how or when it was produced—I have been through all the accounts from the time of the partnership to the time when I went in, and from 1858 up to the year 1871 between 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, I believe, was drawn out by Mrs. Saull, and that was about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than stood to her credit in the books—I made out the statement at one time—at the dissolution of the partnership, I believe, 4,068<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stood to her credit, of which she got 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that Godfrey brought in 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by the trustees of William Devonshire Saull out of the estate to the brother, Thomas Saull, Mrs. Saull's husband, after the formation of the partnership; it was a loan, in fact—bills were given for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, as stated in the bill, to Mrs. Saull's children, or the children's trustees—that was not because there were certain moneys of William Devonshire Saull which were to be paid to them out of his estate, and that under the bill it was alleged that the advance of the money by the trustees was improper—the suit was settled—I came in on 30th or 31st of August, 1872—I believe a Chancery suit was commenced in 1868 of Saull Godfrey—Godfrey and Brown had to pay the costs, and they were ordered in the suit, I believe, to give promissory notes—many others were represented in that suit besides the Saull family that had money to receive—I got between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, I think; I won't be certain; a similar amount to what all the others received, 2857. or something like that—I remember Godfrey and Brown coming to my house once and seeing Mrs. Saull, and on no other occasion—the argument that night was about having the balance-sheet signed; Mrs. Saull would not agree with it until a certain deed was given up to her, and then she was willing to investigate the accounts and sign them if proper—it was a deed given to her former solicitor for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent to her, and owing to him—<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., if they charged her with the money as paid, she wanted the receipt for it—I believe Godfrey and Brown pressed Mrs. Saull, when the partnership was expiring, to come to terms which were most absurd—they offered 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goodwill of a business that was worth 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—when it expired there was no agreement come to—the gross profits were between 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the net profit averaged about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—she drew from 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—she drew nothing in 1872—at the end of 1871 her share of the capital was over 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: I think it should have been 4,555<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance at the bank on 31st of December, 1871, was 643<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the value of the stock was 3,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—stock, including implements, 3,782<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I cannot tell what the debts were (<hi rend="italic">Affidavit read</hi>)—the balance of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd depended upon the acceptances of the customers held by the firm being met, and the book debts being good—quite 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. turned out bad—I remember the bill of the 22nd September, 1871, being filed of Godfrey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull, praying for a decree for a sale, and to take the partnership accounts—the bill of Saull <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.

I was some 10 years in the employ of Saull, Godfrey, and Brown—I knew how the business was going on the whole of that time—the partnership expired on 31st December, 1871, and I left in May, 1872, because I found that the business was falling away, and I knew that Chancery suits were going on—I was perfectly free to leave if I chose, and I left and engaged myself to Brown at Worship Street—he commenced business there in May or June, '1872, about six months after the partnership expired—he did not instruct me to make out a list of customers and take it to Worship Street—I forget what I did with the list I made out; I must have destroyed it—I saw it at Worship Street—I never gave it to Brown, nor did I inform him that I had made it out—I know the wine trade well—I am in business now with Mr. Chitty, who was one of the travellers to Saull, Godfrey, and Brown—a traveller to a wine merchant has his own connection, and carries it with him when he leaves—the first transaction I had in my own name was when Brown was away; I sent to a man who had been a fellow-clerk, for 12 gallons of dark sherry to make a butt golden; it was for the business, but he entered it in my name, and it after<lb/>wards came to my knowledge that it was entered in my name, and I protested against it—I do not know that it was still done after I protested—I remained in Brown's employment, and received my salary.</p>

I am a forwarding agent and merchant, of 2, Fenchurch Buildings—my sister was the defendant's first wife, and in May, 1872, he came to me and told me that he had been transferring wine from Saull, Godfrey, and Brown to his own firm, and had had the services of Keeling and Co., wine brokers, who were charging him two commissions, one for selling and one for buying, and asked me if I would do it for one com<lb/>mission, and I consented—I was not really to buy and sell, but my name was to be used—I did not see the goods, but part of them had passed through my hands before in another transaction and put up to auction and bought in—there were five half casks of brown brandy put up to auction about April, invoiced from Saul, Godfrey, and Brown to me, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they were bought at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and three casks of brandy, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Neptune, bought at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and, invoiced to Saull, Godfrey, and Brown, at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that is all that came within my knowledge—the entire amount of those transactions was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the entire amount which passed through my name was about 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never received a cheque that I did not pass through a banker—this cheque has never been through a bank; it is Mr. Brown's writing.(<hi rend="italic">This was dated July</hi>, 17, 1872. <hi rend="italic">Pay Balchin</hi> 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)

               <p>run them up that they should not be sacrificed, and they fetched more than we could buy them for in the open market—some of them were bought in, bat none were sold at a loss—it was about May that Mr. Brown called—he said that he was going into business in Worship Street and wanted to purchase, some of the stock of the old firm for himself—he asked if he might use my name, and said that he had done the same thing with Keeling's—I agreed, provided it was done at a proper price—I did not limit him to any amount—after that I knew that he was doing it—Belling through a broker is an ordinary thing in the way of trade, using a person's name and that person receiving a commission—Keeling's is a highly respectable house, one of the best in the trade.</p>

Saull and the deceased in the matter of this partnership—my son was called on the trial in 1876, and produced the partnership deed—I was the attesting witness to it—W. D. Saull was the brother of Mrs. Saull's husband; he died in 1855, and shortly afterwards Mrs. Saull's husband died, after which she carried on the business with her son, who was about 21 or 22 at that time—he managed it—it was a very good business when her husband died—in 1858 it had been entirely destroyed, and but for the assistance of the trustees of W. D. Saull the whole thing must have been shut up—I saw Mrs. Saull about the state of affairs—at that time Godfrey, who was afterwards a partner, was either the traveller or manager, and Brown was a clerk—Mrs. Saull told me then that Godfrey had lent her money; I don't know how much, but about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thoroughly explained to her that I acted for the trustees, and the nature of the transaction—my impres<lb/>sion is that there was no power for her to give permission to sell—lending 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a breach of trust, but the family must have starved if we hadnot done so—I advised my father to commit the breach of trust for the pur<lb/>pose of saving Mrs. Saull and her children, and Mr. William Saull, of North<lb/>ampton, joined to save us from the consequences—he is in Northampton—I opposed the suit of Webb <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull against the trustees to make them pay the money—I was not beaten in that; I was solicitor for the trustees; it was a—suit calling upon us to account for the trust—I do not remember a suit of Saull <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull in 1875—I remember taxing the costs of two Chancery suits—I do not remember what I paid Miller and Miller for costs—if I said before, "I remember taxing the costs in two of the Chancery suits, and I remember an Order of Court to pay Miller <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Miller 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," that is correct (<hi rend="italic">See Sessions Paper, vol</hi>. 84, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 251).—I known that there was a suit of Godfrey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull in 1871—I was acting for the trustees of Devonshire Saull—a decree was made in Miller <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull, and the 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, part in cash and the balance in bills; the Court decreed that we were to take the bills as cash, and we did so.</p>

If I said before that the order was to pay Miller and Miller 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is correct, I might have referred to some paper—Mr. Miller himself told me that it amounted to considerably more than 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; their costs must have been taxed at considerably over 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no interest in stating anything but facts; Mr. Miller is behind you, perhaps he can tell me; he would have the allocatur, I have not got it—I do not know what my deposition was at the time, I cannot remember now—I think I was solicitor in two of the Chancery suits, but if I was not, I might as a party have attended the taxation; I cannot now tell which two out of the six or seven, or I would tell you directly—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again, will you deliberately swear that the costs exceeded 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi>.

               <p>won't say anything about it at all, I simply say that I do not remember but what I said on my last examination I believed to be true—whatever the amount was it would not come from Godfrey and Brown, but out of the fund paid into Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired captain of the Army, it present living at 91, Lansdown Place, Brighton—I have known the prisoner about two years—in the early part of the present year I was at Southsea, where the prisoner was lodging—I remember travelling with him in the train, when he showed me a bundle of notes which he afterwards told me had come into his possession by some settlement which he had made with Colonel Owen Williams, of the Blues, at Sandown Park; he afterwards said that he had come into the money by his uncle's will—he said there was about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was asked by Mrs. Millward to see Mr. Waddell with a view of making some settlement in this matter—I received 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from her, which money I gave to my solicitors to hand over to Mr. Howlett, the solicitor to the estate—on one occasion when I went into the prisoner's lodging at Southsea I saw him take some notes from under the bed or mattress—I afterwards saw the numbers of four 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; that was in March, at Mr. Clark's house, 7, Osborne Terrace, Southsea—on 3rd April I wrote this letter to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Millward,—It appears I am likely to be treated in a manner like every one who befriends you. You can hays your 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back the moment I am released by Mr. Waddell from my offer," <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>.) I had made an offer of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Mrs. Mill ward's account and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my own, to pay up the whole bankruptcy, and when I wrote that I had determined to drop the proceeding; I have not quarrelled with the prisoner, I have ignored him, avoided him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">cross-examined</hi>. The expression "There is bitter enmity between us" ac<lb/>curately expresses our relation. I detest the man; I have good reason for so doing—he asked me to initial the four bank notes, and in my letter I asked him for an explanation for his doing so—I have never been able to understand it; I think it was a very stupid act and a very extraordinary one—I was at that time in communication with the trustee—I did not tell the trustee about the four 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I knew about the bankruptcy proceedings at the time—my offer to the trustee was to pay him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. costs—it was open to him to accept or refuse, and at that time he had not done either—the prisoner of course knew that I was in communication with the trustee—I have been in England now nine years, and I have been twice to the Derby and once—to Good wood, that is all; no bookmaker in England ever made a bet with me—I do not bet—I have had no betting transaction of any sort with the prisoner.</p>

Coutts'—on 12th September last I was away from business for a holiday, at Hunstanton, and received a letter from Mr. Wakefield, our cashier, enclosing a cheque for my signature—it was crossed as it now appears, "Messrs. Coutts and Co., not negotiable"—I signed the cheque in the name of the firm, and returned it to Mr. Wake<lb/>field—on Saturday, 14th September, I received it back with a letter from Mr. Wakefield—I then endorsed the cheque "Messrs. Coutts and Co. Please pay Mr. Wakefield for Withall and Co.," and posted it to Mr. Wakefield the same morning—on the Tuesday following I came up to town and went to the office and found that the cheque had not arrived—in consequence of what I heard inquiries were made at Messrs. Coutts' Bank—about 26th September the prisoner Andrews was brought in custody to our office—I know Mr. Wakefield's handwriting—the body of the cheque is in his handwriting, bat "James Wakefield" is not—his Christian name is Louis.</p>

Gardner's, in Whitechapel—he was wearing a naval suit, the same as he has now—he said they parted and met again the following day, and then the young man asked him to go to the bank and cash two other notes; and he went to the bank and was stopped, and given into custody—they were the two notes that are at the Bank of England unpaid—he said he had beentaken into custody previously by a detective at the Bank of England and was afterwards let go—he said that the detective took a key away from him and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was the proceeds of the cheque also—I afterwards received that cheque from another detective—it was endorsed—he said that was the key taken from him by the other detective—I have tried the key, but the lock has been altered; it does not fit now—I did not try it before it was altered—after that I went on the 7th, a Monday afternoon, to London Bridge railway station, and saw Warner acting as an outside porter—he was called into the office by one of the authorities—I said to him "You answer the description of a man who presented a cheque that had been stolen to Messrs. Coutts' Bank and got it cashed, do you know the right name of Andrews?" and he said "Yes"—I did not say anything then about how the cheque was signed—I think I afterwards drew his attention to it—afterwards I told him I was an inspector of police—he said "Yes; I know. a lad of the name of Andrews"—I produced the cheque and said "This is a forgery to the cheque," and he said "Yes, that is my writing; I wrote</p>

Bank of England notes, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and the remainder in silver and bronze—when he came out he said Andrews gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the job, and that is all he knew of it—I told him he tfonld be charged with stealing it, and also with forging and uttering—he said did not I consider the explanation he had given sufficient?—I said no I did not—I searched him and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a bunch of keys—one of the bunch of keys opens the letter box—the bolt does not answer to the turn of the key every time, but if you persevere it will come undone.</p>

Ought not the parents to receive the money?"—he said, "No, it is more than they dare do to keep a seaman's money after he has left ship"—he said he had been to some bank; that it was not endorsed; he had taken it back to the owners, and that he was going to have it changed—I advised him to be very careful, as there were always people ready to pick sailors up, and the best thing he could do was to go home to his mother, and I asked him what he was going to do—he said he was going to stay one day in London and see a little pleasure, and then return to his mother in Brighton—I said, "If you like to entrust it in my care I will mind it for you till the. following morning"—he then had a little conversation with my kitchen-servant and the young man I keep in the shop, and he asked the servant if he might go and brush his clothes—on returning to the kitchen he said he had seen a young man who was lodging with me, and was he to be trusted—I said, "What young man? Oh, you mean Gerry," meaning Warner—I said, "You could not have a better friend; place yourself in his care, and go home to your mother directly"—he thanked me, and said he would—Warner then said to me, "This boy wants me to go with him to the bank to pt a cheque changed"—I said, "Oh, go with him, it is a pity he should be lost"—he said, "I will, but I must report myself at the railway"—they then left my house—as they were leaving the. butcher's man came in—I said, "Do you think your master can change this cheque?"—he said, "I have no doubt," he knowing Warner—they went to Mr. Meanwell's; he refused to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210101"/>
               <p>change it—I saw them with the money an hour or two afterwards; Andrews said Warner had got his money—I took the money and counted it, and found there were 12 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—to the best of my recollection the boy gave them to me—I said to him, "Are you going to stay in London another day?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Let me mind them for you, or you will be robbed of them—he said, "Give me one of them and keep the others, and I will lodge here to-night"—I said, "No, you have a balance, and that balance is quite sufficient for a boy to spend in one day"—I said, "You had better go home to your mother"—he said, "No, I should like to see a little pleasure"—I said, "Give them to my care; let the boy see me count them," and I gave them to my niece with my keys, and she locked them in my drawer—I can scarcely say whether Andrews and Warner went across the road about a watch that the boy said he had left at a jeweller's across the road; I think they went across—they came back, and Andrews asked for dinner—I said to the boy that I thought Warner had lost a deal of time; "You ought to give Warner ('<hi rend="italic">Gerry</hi>' I called him) some recompense for his trouble"—he said, "I have already given him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; will that be enough?"—I said, "I should think so"—they took some refreshment—my niece was in the room a portion or the whole time—they sat there some time—I was busy in the shop, and cautioned the boy being a good boy—he then said he thought he should go home, as he did not seem inclined to take any pleasure—I said, "It is the best thing you could do, but let me know when you are going home"—he said he would take a bed, and he paid me the money for a bed—I said, "Let me know, and you shall have your money; I shall not give it to you unless I am certain you are going home"—I served some customers, and then he said he thought he should go home; he should not like to lose it—he said his parents kept a public-house at Brighton—I said to Warner, "You are going to the railway-station; cannot you see him in the Brighton, train, and make him telegraph to his mother, so that he should not be robbed by anybody following him on the road?"—I still had his money—I looked at the time-table; the time for starting was 4 o'clock—I had the notes brought down, and counted in his presence, and folded them, and told him he should have a print bag to put them in—he said "No, I will wrap them up in another paper"—he wrapped them up, and as he left the door he showed them to me rolled in a piece of paper—he replaced them in his pocket, and went away—I did not see him again that day—I saw Warner in the day, or in the evening after 9 o'clock—he came back alone—I said "What did you do with the little sailor-boy?"——he said "Oh! he wanted to buy everything he saw, first a gun, and that gun I thought I should not be able to keep him from buying;" and that he had seen him off—I next saw Andrews five or six days after<lb/>wards—I did not speak to him at night when he took a bed, but in the morning I thought he had a haggard appearance—he went to his ship, and came back—he said "Somebody has stolen my purse, with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I felt hardened against him—he said he had some sailor friends, who went to a coffee-house, and they asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a bed, and one of them was robbed, in a place called the Verity, of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that very night.</p>

               <p>him to change his cheque—my conversation with the boy was before he sew Warner—Warner came down on Tuesday about 8.30—he went to work at 9, or earlier—he had a cup of tea overnight—I cannot say which had the notes when they came in—I do not remember whether Warner slept at my house on the Tuesday night—I am positive he slept there on the Monday—I did not see him till the Tuesday morning—Warner had slept there two months before; not for many days—I gave the notes to the boy on the Tuesday afternoon, about 3 o'clock—when he came back he had no money—I thought an ungrateful boy like that might go at large—Warner slept there once or twice since—we all missed Andrews, and wondered what had become of him—we referred to him as "the sailor boy; that nice boy"—I had never seen him before he came to my house—he particularly said, his father said this was a respectable house, and he would sleep here.</p>

I received instructions on Monday, 6th October, from Mr. Moore, the manager of Brook's Wharf, in consequence of which I went with West wood to Upper Thames Street about 12.30 or 1 o'clock and watched the wharf—about 2.10 I saw a van pull up at the wharf; I asked Westwood to follow it and I went after him; it stopped in Cannon Street—the driver looked round as if expecting some one, we then followed him to Eastcheap, where he stopped opposite the Cow and Calf and went into a beershop in Love Lane—I ordered Westwood to follow him—he returned to his van and drove to Stratford and from there to 25, Cambridge Terrace, West Ham—he knocked at the door and went in—I went in, and while talking with him, Cox came up—I told him I was a police officer and should take him in custody for being concerned in stealing tea, pointing to some tea in the shop and the remaining portion of it in the van—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "You occupy this place?"—he said "I don't, it is Mr. McQuillen's"—one of the witnesses said "You know you do, Mr. Cox"—I inquired for the landlord and Sinclair came and said that he did occupy it and paid 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for it—Sinclair also said "Who is the other party who comes with you?"—Cox said "I don't know and I decline to say"—there was nothing to show that business was being carried on there—I found three empty tea chests there—I took him in custody, took possession of the tea, left Westwood there, and took Cox to Bow Lane police-station, where I charged him for being concerned with others in stealing the tea—he gave his address 48, Lichfield Road, Bow, and about 10.30 p.m. I went there with Westwood, and in a back parlour or kitchen, found Stephens, Wigmore, and another person, and Cox's wife—I asked the wife who those persons were, she said that one was her husband's brother—I had stated that we were police officers—I asked Stevens his name—he said "Stevens"—I said "You are employed at Brooks' Wharf?"—he said "Yes, I am a scaleman"—I said "I shall take you in custody for being concerned with Cox in stealing tea"—I then said to Wigmore "Your name is Wigmore?"—he said "Yes, Joseph"—I said "I shall also take you for being concerned in stealing the tea"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210105"/>
               <p>Stevens said "I know nothing about it"—Wigmore made no reply—Stevens afterwards said "I met Wigmore in the Bethnal Green Road this afternoon; no, I mean this evening, and he told me there was some trouble"—Stevens said in the cab "I know nothing about this affair" and afterwards "I am sorry I am in this trouble"—I took them to Bow Lane—I have omitted that I said to Wigmore "You were in a public-house with Harrison, the carman, this afternoon"—he said "Yes"—I said "Wigmore said you had not that overcoat on then"—he said "No, I had not"—two or three days afterwards I went to No. 10 or 11, Little George Street, Minories, and found these documents relating to sweepings and to the delivery of tea at different wharves and docks—that is where Wigmore carries on business—he has. only one room—I understand they are sampling orders by which he could get access tothe wharf—I found on Cox this document relating to the rent of No. 25; it has Wigmore's name on it—I also found on Cox this newspaper report of a tea robbery at the Mansion House.</p>

You came to Cambridge Terrace 10 or 20 minutes after I arrived—Mr. McQuillen said to you "Oh, Mr. Cox, why do you bring us into this trouble?"—you at first denied being the occupant of the place—that was why the landlord was sent for—we had got the four half-chests of tea reloaded before you arrived, but they had been into your house—I said to Harrison, the carman, "Is this one of the men engaged in this transaction?" and he said "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a delivery carman in the employ of Thomas Warner and Son, of Brooks' Wharf—on 5th October, at closing time, 4 o'clock, as I was leaving I saw Cox and Wigmore—Wigmore asked me if I knew Joe Cook, and would I fetch him—I said "Yes," but I could not find him, and came back and saw them outside a public-house at the top of the street; Cox said "Will you come and have something to drink?"—we all four went into a public-house, and they said "Would you like a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note? "—I said that I should—they said that I could have one by letting goods go away from the firm that I served, and they would give me the money in the evening—they suggested that a carman should come down with a list, and that I should honour the list and give the goods, and that Harrison should be the carman, and I should know him by that name—Stevens said he would see that the goods on the list should be goods in the ware<lb/>house—the pass was to be taken by Stevens or myself in the event of their getting the goods—it was to be given by me—I. was to take it from the gatekeeper's file—the prisoners were all present at this conversation—the passes taken by the gatekeeper are checked every night by the warrants, and if one was taken away it would destroy his record—I then left them, and on Monday morning I told Mr. Moore, and received instructions from him, and about 2 o'clock on Monday afternoon a van came to the wharf driven by a man who I now know as Harrison—he handed me this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a warrant is lodged first, and then the list is brought to, me, and I select the goods to be delivered. (<hi rend="italic">Read: Per Harrison, please deliver</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">chests of Congou</hi> 281 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 300 <hi rend="italic">per Holman's</hi>.) Those were rotation numbers of chests on my floor; they had come by the ship Placenta—Stephens was the foreman; it was his duty to see that it was done—he would have cognisance of all matters contained in that document—I delivered the tea and gave Harrison this pass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was my duty to have the Customs warrant</p>

I have been rather over four months in Mr. Warner's employ—previous to that I was at Hay's Wharf—I believe I had a character from there—I got a week's notice to leave—I was rather puzzled over a ship; they thought I was incompetent, and discharged me—my meeting with you was quite accidental as far as I was concerned—we adjourned to the Hatchet public-house and drank there—Stevens joined us just as we came out of the wharf, and I think he accosted me—I admit that I was slightly inebriated, but I recollect all that occurred, and told my employers—a man came in who I told you was the night watchman—I know you suggested robbery, and I acquiesced in it—you asked me if I should like to improve the state of my funds and I said "Yes, they are not very plentiful"—I do not remember lending Stevens two shillings; you gave me a half-crown to go and get something more to drink.</p>

In consequence of information of this burglary, I made inquiries at pawnbrokers and general dealers and others, and amongst them of Mrs. Wager on 5th September—I asked her if she had bought any children's clothing; that several robberies had been committed about the neighbourhood, and I was endeavouring to trace them—she said no, she had bought nothing—I asked if she had bought a table<lb/>cover or children's clothing—she denied both, and said they were just the very things she wanted; that she had a sale for such articles—7 called again on 19th September, and said I had called again respecting these articles; that I had reason to believe they were sold to some wardrobe dealers—she said she was sure she had not bought anything, and I left the house—after I had got about 300 yards the servant girl ran after me, and said her mistress wanted to see me—J went back, and Wager handed me this pawn<lb/>ticket, and said she had bought it of a woman—I asked who the woman was—she said her name was Hastings—I said "Where does Mrs. Hastings live?"—she said "No. 11, Raymead Road "—the ticket refers to a sealskin jacket and a top coat, the proceeds of another burglary—she also handed me this letter relating to children's clothes, a table<lb/>cover, and watch; it is signed "Mrs. Hastings"—she said Mrs. Hastings had sent that letter hay little girl, and she wanted a shilling for the ticket—I found the table<lb/>cover and the child's frock at Wager's—I found 67 pawn<lb/>tickets at her place, some of them relate to the proceeds of other burglaries; things that I had inquired after, which she denied having—I said so to her—that was on 4th October, the day I arrested her—I called on her five times, and made inquiries.</p>

I am the landlord of Duchy Chambers, 137A, Strand—in June last both the defendants applied to me for an office which I had to let—it is a sort of a toss<lb/>up which came first; I think Wraxall came fast; they used to come a minute or two after one another, they came a great many times—they both agreed to take the office, at a rental of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, a moiety to be paid by each of them fortnightly—Wraxall said that was most con<lb/>venient to him, as he settled on the Stock Exchange fortnightly—he said he was a member of the Stock Exchange, which I knew was a respectable calling—I demanded a good reference, and he gave me the Merchants' Joint Stock Bank, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury; that was after a number of interviews—he told me that he had the placing of the whole of the shares of that bank on the Stock Exchange—Crowley said he was agent for the South African Company; he said very little in the matter, Wraxall did all the talking—he said distinctly that he did not know anything about Crowley; he told me that half a dozen times, but I think he did know all about him—on 4th July they signed the agreement and came into occupation legally on the following Monday—I never got paid a penny—Wraxall gave me the name of Harry Horatio Wraxall, but in all the papers in was Henry William; he did not say he was a baronet, if he had I would not have taken him, I should have made further inquiries about him—I saw both defendants frequently at the office after 4th July; they both sat at the table and appeared to be very busy there; an immense number of letters were received there, the table was always crowded with letters—at Wraxalls direction I had painted on the door "Wraxall and Co.," and then "South African Trading Company," and underneath G. R Crowley, manager <hi rend="italic">rat</hi>—on one occasion when I went for my rent I caught them both looking at the names on the door, and they both approved of it—Wraxall said "Sir Harry Wraxall is the head of my firm"—I did not even ask him for the rent upon that, as he was such a very important person—I went and made inquiry at the Merchants' Bank; I saw Mr. Lake, the manager, and I saw the defendants there, standing at the private door—in consequence of what Mr. Lake told me I was perfectly satisfied—on a Friday before Wraxall was taken into custody he absented himself from the office; the police could not catch him, and I said I would, so I wrote a letter to the bank stating that I had three registered letters addressed to Wraxall, and I did not know his address, and on the Saturday afternoon, the 24th, Wraxall rushed into the office and the policeman put his hand upon him and took him off—I saw him at the Bow Street station about half an hour afterwards—I asked him about the rent, and he said "If you give me those three registered letters with the money in, I will break them open and pay you the rent out of the money"—I asked him if he had authority to break them open—he said "Yes, I have"—those three letters only existed in imagination, it was done to catch the fellow.</p>

In consequence of that I went to the hotel on the day named, and there saw Crowley—I told him I expected to see Sir James Graham—he said Sir James Graham was engaged in Birmingham purchasing goods, and. he was sent in his place—on 10th August I received this memorandum of agreement, which I signed, and enclosed with it a post-office order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did that believing that this was a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> concern, that the persons connected with it were in a position to give me employment, and that it was necessary I should pay the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a guarantee—on 14th August I got a letter stating: "The ship Edith Carmichael sails September 3rd from West India Docks," After that I had no further communication—I gave up my business and sold my house and furniture—I then saw something in the public papers, and received in<lb/>structions from Bow Street.</p>

R Crowley."—when I took Crowley he gate me a great quantity of papers and at his lodging I found 530 letters' answering the advertisement, 30 of them showing that guineas had been sent, and twenty-three showing that the guinea had been refused—on the way from Scotland he said that he had met a person who told him he was Sir James Graham who had originated this scheme, that he had only seen him three times, that on the third occasion he had part of the money that had been received, and he had told him to keep the remainder for himself and for the expenses of the office; that on the second occasion Sir James Graham took some of the money, about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to then had been received, and told him to keep the remainder for himself, and office expenses, that he had not seen him afterwards, sad he then came to the conclusion that the thing was a swindle, but seeing how easily it worked he had continued it on his own account—from the letters I found, it appeared that a brother of his is mate on board a ship called the Edith Carmichael, trading to Nova Scotia, there are two or three letters from his brother to him—all these documents found at his lodging are in the same handwriting—I found on him a letter of introduction to a gentleman at New York, showing that he was going there—Wraxall said he had only had one of the post-office orders, which he cashed at Somerset House.</p>

"—he said, "From my place in Jubilee Street"—I said, "I shall take you in custody for stealing this tea; I am a police-officer"—I took him to the Old Jewry, and found this newspaper in the big bag—this little black bag contained a sample of tea, which would no doubt be at the bottom of the bag and the newspaper at the top, and he had a newspaper in his possession—they were both <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraphs</hi> of 29th August—I left him in charge of Sergeant Green while I went to make inquiries, and then took him to Bow Lane and charged him—I showed him this paper, which I obtained from the wharf, and said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">forgery</hi>"—he said, "I filled it up"—I said, "Did you sign it?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Per procreation"—he said, "Yes, we are allowed to do so in the trade"—he pretended that it was all regular—he gave his address, 11, Jubilee Street—I went there with another officer—there is no shop-front or any indication of the tea trade being carried on, but I found a few invoices,</p>

On 29th August by Sergeant Smith's directions I placed myself in a position to command 11, Jubilee Street, and saw Sims leave about 10 a.m. with a big parcel similar to this and newspaper his hand—he went towards the City—I did not follow him—on 14th September, about 8 o'clock, I was with Berry in Bridge Street, Blackfriars, and saw Roberts—I knew there was a warrant out against him, and said, "Your name is Roberts?"—he said, "I don't know, any name"—I said that there was a warrant out against him, and he would be charged with another man in custody with stealing a quantity of tea from Brooks's Wharf—he said, "Well, if they drag me into it I can answer it"—he was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Robert Warner, the proprietor of Brooks' Wharf—we have sixty or seventy thousand boxes of tea there—on the arrival of a ship the consignment gets a rotation number, and then the consecutive number of packages—that is sent to the broker, who puts it into the merchants' hands—the show<lb/>room is used for public sales and first merchants' samples—We have a couple of advance boxes up from every ship, and they are put in the tea<lb/>room—if this order was 8 genuine one it could only be properly presented upstairs, not on the ground floor at all—these orders, on which 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are paid, would not warrant taking away 45lb. of tea, but only the quantity marked on them—the largest sample delivered out on a broker's order is 2lb. for each break of tea—they are packed up in papers in this way (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each packet must be kept separately or it would be no good as a sample—these goods are in</p>

               <p>bond, but the Customs do not require a duty on samples—this paper would not apply to Roberts; this would be upstairs—the boy would go for show samples, and the card states the quantity you may tale for samples—this bit of red paper is of no use for such samples—Roberts was employed in the show<lb/>room on the same floor as the office—that is the room where the loose bags of tea returned by the person sampling are put—no tea goes out except exchange for tea going in, and excepting the first merchants' samples—the tea is worth about a shilling a pound—this paper purports to be a consignment by the Egeria to the order of Messrs. George White and Co.—the Egeria was on the wharf on 29th August, and Messrs. George White had the ordering—one pound of tea could be got on this paper from the sampler upstairs.</p>

Burt—I had received directions from them to watch the timber—I gave information to the police on the Monday—I saw Maxey that day in his office on the wharf; he was assistant-timekeeper or deputy-foreman there; new works were being constructed for the jam factory—I spoke to the foreman of the works—on Wednesday, 11th September, I was at our gate at 10 minutes to 8, and saw Rice go by with the timber on a cart—I said, "Halloa, old fellow, you have got stopped at last"—he said he knew nothing about it; he was doing as his master told him—I said, "That is the timber that came from the jam factory that I told the police to look after"—he said he was doing as he was told, and he went back and fetched his master, Mr. Ladd—I had no conversation with him; I left the cart with a constable and went over to Victoria Dock to Mr. Ashley, our manager, and gave information—I saw eight pieces of timber on the cart; I cut off the tops of two of them at the Woolwich police-station, and produce them; there are marks on both, and here is a sample from our yard which corre<lb/>sponds with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the small arms department of the Tower, and live at 10, Barclay Terrace, Leytonstone, exactly opposite the prosecutor—on 11th August, about 9.30 p.m, my daughter spoke to me, and knowing that Mr. and Mrs. Marsden were away I watched, and saw a light moving on the stairs—I sent for Mr. Bland, who had the keys, and who lives two doors from me—we knew by the shadows that more than one person was in the house—Mr. Metcalfe came up, and Mr. Bland and my son—I posted myself at the back, and saw a light at the upper back window extinguished, and heard steps going down to the kitchen, the window of which was open; they had got in there—they came to the window, but I could not see how many there were—somebody called out "You had better surrender; if you resist you will be fired upon"—some one said that they had gone to the front; I ran to the front; they pulled the door open on the chain, and then I heard the report of a pistol—I went to the back, and found that Mr. Bland had been knocked down by a man who has escaped—he said "Take hold of him, I will go after the other"—I saw another man being chased round the back garden—if you get over the wall there yon get into a vacant plot; of ground called Mornington Road and Wellesley Road—I saw the man dodging about there across the garden, and he made a spring at the wall—I ran to the side door to intercept him, but he did not get over, and I ran to the front and spoke to a neighbour—I then went with Kitchen to the police-station, and the prisoner was brought there without a hat; he said "What am I here for? search me"—a short time afterwards a person brought a hat and said "You have lost your hat, is this it?"—he took it in his hand, hesitated a moment, and put it on—he answers in form and build and height to the man who was dodging about in the garden, but I did not see his face—it was a bright moonlight night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. About 10 minutes elapsed from the time the alarm was given at 9.30 to the time the man sprang out at the window—Kitchen was arrested immediately—I got to the station about 10, and the prisoner was brought in in a quarter of an hour, and the hat a quarter of an hour after him—as I went to the station I saw a light hawker's cart at the end of Barclay Road, and a young man in it who came to the station the same evening when the two men were in custody—I think only four persons were in the back garden, and not more than eight or nine in front with my wife and daughters—the pistol shot called a number of persons out.</p>

Do you know him?"—he said "No"—I said "You can give me some description of him"—he said "I can do as I like about that"—I then took him to the station, and charged him with having this jewellery in his possession, supposed to be stolen, and not giving a satisfactory account of it—he said that he did not steal it—he bought it of a man last night, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, who told him it was stolen from the Docks from a ship that was gone abroad, and they would not find it out for two or three months, and he thought he could make a pound or two of it—I locked Sherwood up at the same time, and he was discharged by the Magistrate the next day.</p>

Rose's?"—he said Condon was leaving because he was not in want of a barmaid—she entered my service on 10th September—she remained a fortnight.</p>

I am the son of William Edmunds, who has stables at 8, Chester St., Kennington Lane—on June 1st he let a stable to the prisoner Palmer—there were two stalls and a yard in which carts and horses can stand—there is a gate to it, which is closed at night—I used to see Palmer, Goulty, and Parker there—Parker employed me to groom the horses after the beginning of August from time to time—Goulty groomed the horses too, and used to ride and drive the horse at times—I never saw Harding there—Parker told me that Palmer had met with an accident on July 6th, but I afterwards found out that the accident was being taken into custody—there was a roan mare in the stable at that time, which was brought on a Thursday night, and a bay horse or mare—Parker told me that the gate was fastened, and they had to jump over, and he opened the gate and brought the horses in, and that he had been to Wales and brought the roan mare from there—the bay was a darkish one, that was the animal that Palmer took out on Saturday morning as he was arrested in the evening—I never heard Goulty's name; I did not hear him called <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi> till he was at the police-court—I did not see him</p>

               <p>at the stable on the Friday before the Saturday when Palmer was taken in custody—Goulty told me that he was working for Mr. Palmer, and used to do down at the other stables; he did not say where they were on the Sunday after Palmer was arrested Parker came there to groom the bay horse—the roan mare that he brought from Wales was there at the time—I have seen Parker take out other horses and mares and bring them back again—from August down to this taking place I have seen another chesnut and a rat<lb/>tailed bay there from time to time. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Goulty</hi>. I have seen you go out of the street with a horse which Palmer has brought back—he has told me that you were his man—on July 3rd you cleaned the stable, which made a great stink, and I did not see you there for a week afterwards. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Parker</hi>. I first saw you on a Sunday after the roan mare and the bay mare were there—you employed me, but you came on Sunday to feed the horse—you said you could do it up—I was not work<lb/>ing for you when you employed two men—you told my father that you and Palmer were brothers, but I did not hear that. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I did not know Palmer by any name, but I thought he was Parker's brother—when Parker came on the Sunday, the day after Palmer took away the bay mare, the roan mare was in the stable, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM EDMUNDS</hi>. I am a cabinetmaker, of Edward Street, Ken<lb/>nington Lane—at the beginning of June I had some stables to let and let them to Palmer—he never gave his name—I asked him for a reference, and he said that if he paid a week's rent in advance that would do—I was satisfied, and he paid me four shillings for a week's rent—he said "Sometimes I shall have things here and sometimes not"—I saw him at the stables several times, and—Tit also—I have never seen Harding—I cannot say that I know Parker—Palmer paid the rent for about two months, and when he did not come to the stable Parker paid it to the best of my knowledge, but he had no whiskers or moustache—I knew him by the name of Parker—I first saw the roan mare there on a Friday morning—Palmer told me that when they came in at night let got over the rails and broke some of the railings down to get the mare in—Goulty is Tit.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Goulty</hi>. I knew you were, backwards and forwards at work for Palmer occasionally—Palmer said I and <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi> have been down to Wales and bought some horses, and Tit got over the palings and got in—you did not deny that—you may have been there between 3rd and 11th July, but I was never at home, my business is out of doors—I never saw you bring horses there, but I have seen you go out with them.</p>

I keep the Haveringland King's Head, near Norwich—on 27th June, about 7 o'clock, Goulty and Palmer pulled up in a gig at my house—Goulty, who had been in my service some years before, said "I want to feed my mare and stop the night here; you don't know me"—I said "Yes, I do; I recollect your being in my service"—the mare</p>

               <p>was put up, and they came and had supper, after which Goulty said something about going to see his father and mother at Horsford, which is about two and a half miles off, and went away—Palmer slept at my house, and remained all the next day—they said they had been a devil of a long journey, and the mare was stiff and sore—in the evening Goulty came back—he had worked with me as a lad, and went by the nickname of <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi>—I dealt in horses, and he assisted me—on Saturday, the 29th I drove Palmer in my trap to Norwich, and I believe Goulty went by the carrier's cart—I put Palmer down at Norwich market, and in the course of the day saw him with Goulty—I went back alone—on Sunday, June 30th, Palmer came back and slept at my house, and on Monday morning, 1st July, Goulty came, and we all three went to Reepham Fair—Palmer went away the same night with the gig and mare—Goulty left us at the fair, and I did not see him again—Goulty said that he lived at Bramber, and Palmer said he lived at Newmarket.</p>

               <p>we went for a drive before we had the conversation—I said to Harding, "Whose mare is it?"—I don't think I said at the police-court, "I did not contract with Harding for it, I did not ask him whose it was"—I supposed it to be Parker's—Parker gave me his card, not paying the full value until the Monday I took that as a warranty—I thought I was paying the full value for the horse for my work—Parker told me he had bought rather heavily at a sale at Clapham, and wanted to make up the money—Harding was then close by—I dare say he could hear it—I promised Harding a sovereign for his trouble—I did not tell him to call for it on the Monday—he did call on the Monday, but not with Parker—they left together—Harding may have come about 10 a.m., Parker came about 12—I don't remember Harding asking me for the sovereign—I did say "If you will wait a week I will make it 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," but I can't say when he said that I ought to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had to send my wife to London for the money to pay, as I was not very flush at the time—I have not paid him the sovereign yet—he came several times for it—we had some bread and cheese together while my wife went to London to get the money—when Parker came on the Monday he offered to buy the roan mare back, and to give me a considerable profit on my bargain, which I refused—I did not ask him where he got her from, or what he had paid for her—I did not ask for a warranty with the second horse, because I had heard his character from Harding, who said that he was an adopted son of the gentleman at Clapham, whose name I did not hear—my wife was present; I cannot say whether she heard that—he gave me as a reason for disposing of the horse that he had come into property by the death of this old gentleman, and yet he said he was obliged to dispose of the horse because he had overbought himself.</p>

This gentle<lb/>man (referringto Parker) has a horse for sale"—Goulty drove the horse up and down while my husband and Parker watched it—my husband then got up and drove—I saw Goulty and Harding talking together very quietlywhile my husband and Parker were driving—I said to Hard<lb/>ing, "What do you know of this gentleman?"—he said, "He is a friend of mine; I knew him when I lived at Clapham"—I said, "What is he?"—he said, "He is the adopted son of a gentleman, who died and left him all his money"—I said, "He is a lucky one; I am afraid we shall never have nothing, only what we work hard for"—he said, "The gentleman (alluding to Parker) must have some money. He has been to a sale, and has bought a quantity of things"—that was why the horse was to be sold—I said to Goulty, "How long have you lived with the gentle<lb/>man?"—he said, "About 12 months," and that it was a good horse,</p>

               <p>and one that would do a little man service—I said, "We don't want to lose money by buying the horse"—he said that if he called again we should be pleased, and would give him a good dinner—I said, "I shall only be too pleased"—Goulty said, "I have often seen my missus with tears in her eyes; she will be in a way when she finds he has sold the mare"—I said, "Where do you come from?"—he said, "I come from Essex"—I called his attention to the mare having a sore place on her shoulder, and asked him how it came there—he said he was in a hurry one morning to get out and put the wrong collar on—I said, "What, have you another horse besides this?"—he said, "Yes; he has a bay horse at home; a better horse than this"—I understood that the gen<lb/>tleman had died at the Cedars at Clapham, where the sale was—on the following Monday I went to the bank to get some money, and when I got back I found Harding and Parker there—the balance was handed over to Parker—I had no conversation then, as they were anxious to get away to pay some money at 3 o'clock for the things at the Cedars—a few days afterwards Parker brought a bay horse, and on the next day Harding called and said, "Has that gentleman been again?"—I said "Yes," and that my husband had bought the horse—Harding said, "I have been waiting at home for him all day"—when Parker came the bay horse was in a dreadful condition, and the yard was one mass of steam—it had been very badly used—that was about 12 o'clock—my husband had it put in the stable at once, and gave it a good feed of corn.</p>

I am a sergeant in the 2nd Regiment of the Queen's Foot,—quartered at Stonton Barracks, near Guildford—the two prisoners are privates in that regiment—on the 7th August I was in charge of the regimental guard—the prisoners returned to barracks about 3.45 on the 7th in the afternoon—they should have been in at tattoo on the 6th, 10 o'clock at night—when they came in I confined them, knowing they were absent—they had no coats on when they came in—Baker said they had turned a fellow up over night on the 6th, and taken a purse from him with some money, but had not the pleasure of spending it, as they lost it again be<lb/>fore morning—I examined the prisoners' belts—I found blood on one, No. 32, which I believe belongs to Tyrrell—that is the number of the ac<lb/>coutre nent—those shoulder-strapsbelong to the 2nd Queen's—Baker had no shoulder-straps on when he came in—he came in his shirt sleeves—he made the statement I have told you about a quarter of an hour after the arrival at the guard-room, about 4 o'clock—the guard were there—there are two men on guard and the corporal of the guard—I could not tell their names, because they have been on guard so many times since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman at the Borough Fire Brigade—I went to the fire with the superintendent—after the fire was subdued I was left there in charge—I made an examination of the premises along with the other firemen—I opened the cupboard door under the stairs and directly over our heads the plaster was broken away off the ceiling, said in that was inserted a patent fire-wheel—there was one fire-wheel in</p>

               <p>each hole—lower down, about 2 feet, and still in the bottom of hestairs, was another hole with one firelighter or fire wheel in it, and about the same distance down again was another hole with a fire-wheel in it, and below that another one, which was burnt out—I mean that the wheel was burnt out except one little piece—they were not all burnt, but the pieces at the end had all been alight—there was a black mark on the plaster, as if a candle had been held against it—that was not so at all the holes, only at the lower ones, the upper one had no black mark—the highest hole was about nine feet from the ground—there was a box on the floor in the cupboard—I mean that it was under the high hole—a man or woman standing on that box could reach the hole—I saw marks of plaster having fallen on the shelves under the top hole and on a bread-pan, and on the box which stood, against the wall—the plat<lb/>ter was on the lid of the bread-pan and on the box—I also found in the cupboard a lot of wood chopped up, which seemed to be the backs of pictures—it was thin—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is some of it—I also found some pieces of tarred ladder—the tar was fresh then, because I tried my finger on it and found it was fresh, and at the back of the box there were about eight more patent fire<lb/>lighters strewed between the picture backs and the ladder—there was also some brown paper covered with grease, and there was grease smeared on the shelves—we proceeded upstairs, and at the top of the landing leading to the prisoner's bedroom we found about a dozen little pieces of wood—the top of the landing is inside her bedroom, and they were on the floor close to the fireplace, and a composite candle was lying between them—we also found a lot of brown paper under the prisoner's bed, loose—that was not smeared—on the mantelshelf there was a box of lucifers and composite candle—we then went into the young man's bedroom; we did not find anything there, but the bedclothes were thrown about—we then went into the spare room, and the cupboard there was burnt entirely out—we afterwards found a patent fire<lb/>lighter nearly burnt out at the head of the bed—that was apart from the cupboard—it was at the opposite corner of the bed—the cupboard is on one side of the bed, and the fire<lb/>lighter was on the other—it was nearly burnt out—it was against the partition between the bedroom and. the front parlour, and it had scorched the wooden partition, the wainscot—I looked into the man<lb/>hole directly over the stairs—I got to it by a pair of steps which were stand<lb/>ing the prisoner's bedroom—I found one of these fire-wheels in the man<lb/>hole, and some brown paper covered with tar, the ends of which were hanging over the man<lb/>hole—it had not been on fire.</p>

It would have set fire to the roof of her house and two houses adjoining if the fire had communicated with it—I went into the drawing-room, there was nothing there, there were no pictures hanging up that I noticed, but I did not look particularly for pictures—I did not see eight or nine pictures.</p>

I saw the prisoner come back to the house that night—Croucher was with her—she was in custody—she was changing her dress, and she said that she must have a change of socks, and she emptied her pocket into a drawer in her bedroom—I heard a rattle, and drew the salvage officers' attention to it, and we found that it was silver spoons and forks which she had emptied into the drawer—I found these pieces of wood in her bedroom near the fireplace, but I should say that there had been no fire there for some time, for the back of the fireplace was rusty.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A. R</hi>. 351). I was called to the fire in the Maple Road about 2.30 on the morning of 30th August—when I got there I found other policemen there and the firemen—from inquiries I made I went to Mrs. Shuth's and found the prisoner there—she was only partly dressed, she had on a dress skirt and what I fancied was a waterproof—I asked her it she was insured, she said "Yes, in the Royal Exchange"—I asked her if she could account for the fire in any way, she said "No"—I returned to the fire and looked over the premises and in consequence of what I saw and heard I sent for the prisoner—she came and I took her in custody—I had noticed that she was very anxious to get into the house on the first occasion, and when she came the second time she was looking round rather furtively—she said that she wanted to see the place, but I told her that the firemen would not admit her—I went to Mrs. Shuth's and took possession of some things there, among which was an oil painting with a number of water-colour drawings nailed on to the back of it, and some brown paper pasted over them—I discovered that after I got it into the house—there were eight water colours—I also received a box from there—the water colour drawings were given up to a man who had a bill of sale—I do not know why; I did not know that I had power to detain them—I found in the box a quantity of plate—it is not here—I gave it to the man who had the bill of sale—there were perhaps two dozen spoons and forks, and cruet stands, candlesticks, dessert. forks, and table forks—they were in a portmanteau—there was also some wearing apparel, and one or two little articles—it appeared to me to be packed—I also received a desk in which I found this insurance policy. (<hi rend="italic">This was in the Royal Exchange Insurance Company for</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">on the household furniture, plate, wearing apparel, etc</hi>.)—I also produce a copy of a bill <hi rend="italic">of</hi> sale which I received from the man who holds it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I found that a great quantity of the furniture in the shop had been more or less burned—I mean the stock of furniture in the shop, not the furniture of the house, but that was damaged by fire also.</p>

The shop is distinct from the house, but it is part of the house—it is in front of the prisoner's living room—a great quantity of the furniture was burnt more or less—the furniture which was burnt was right through the shop, but in the rear of the shop: and that which was in the front of the shop was damaged by water—there was the remains of a cupboard in the shop, and it was more burnt there than anywhere else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jobbing gardener and have worked for Mrs. Locke over 18 months at carpet-beating and work like that—I was em<lb/>ployed on the premises a week—before the fire, gas-tarring the roof of a shed and beating some carpets—I used some tar to some wood while I was there to boil the tar pot, and when I had finished my job a pail-full of tar was was left, and a scuttleful of tarred wood—I left it in the yard—on the Saturday before the fire I saw Richards about 11 o'clock—he took me to the shed to show me where the water came through—he said that the tar did not keep the rain out—it rained all Saturday morning, and he said "I have a <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi> good mind to burn the whole shed down"—that</p>

               <p>was in the yard—that was after I had tarred it—he thought I had not done it completely—on the last Monday in August I was sent for some fire-wheels—that was before the fire—it was the last day I was there—. Richards gave me the money for them—he gave me a half-crown to get a quarter of a hundred, and told me to go to Littlewood's, but I went to Lane's for them—those are two different shops—before I got to the gate he called me back, and told me to get a wrapper to wrap them up in—I got them, and came back and took them into the room, and he said, "Put them down in the room," which I did, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—last Sunday fortnight he came to my house, and we had a deal of conversation—he said that he heard that Mrs. Locke said since she had been in prison that he had fetched the fire<lb/>lighters, and he said, "You know better than that, for you fetched them"—he also said, "Of course, what I, said about burning the place down was said in a.<hi rend="italic">joke</hi>" or "a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>"—I said; nothing to that—we had a long conversation—he had never been to visit me since the fire, but he had been to see me before the fire when he wanted me to do work for Mrs. Locke—one week there was about seven' rounds of a broken ladder which I pulled to pieces to make a narrow fence. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not use any of the broken ladder for my tar pot—those pieces of wood produced are thinner than I used, and if I had used them for my pot they would have been tarred on both sides—I did not leave above a tablespoonful of tan—gas-tar wants boiling—when he spoke about burning the shed down I said "With that fresh tar on it would burn if it were to catch fire"—J do not know that he was angry with me for not making it water<lb/>tight, but he did not like it—he did not say anything about setting the house on fire—when he came down to see me after the fire I had not mentioned anything about the fire<lb/>lighters—Richards first spoke about them—I saw it in the papers that they were found in the house—I did not talk about the fire till Richards came, but we talked about it when he came—when he gave me the money to fetch the things Mrs. Locke was in the same room—Richards told me to go for them but Mrs. Lock was there—I did not hear her say anything about them—I do not think Mrs. Locke was in the room when I brought them back—it was in the living-room, the parlour or sitting-room—that is where I put down the fire<lb/>lighters—I did not use any of them—I have never been there since—this was on the Monday before the fire took place, at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
