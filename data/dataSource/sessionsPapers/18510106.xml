                  </hi>. I am an attorney, of Henrietta-street. On 24th Sept. I received this letter, not from the prisoner; but I have frequently seen him since, on the subject of this transaction, and have heard from him since that it was his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Sir, I have been recommended to you by Mr. Ellis and Mr. Ramsay, respecting the sale of some reversionary property, both freehold and funded, payable at the death of a lady now in her eighty-seventh year. If convenient, I will call on you this day, between two and three o'clock, and give you the full particulars. It is my father and grandfather's property. Captain William Poulton.")—on the day I received it, the prisoner called; he stated that he was entitled to considerable property, on the death of his mother; and he proceeded to state the instruments by which he became entitled to the property—he gave a description of the property, and the names of the executors under the will of William Poulton—he said he was entitled to 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the death of his mother, who was eighty-seven, and had a policy in the Albion of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on her life, that her</p>

               <p>health was extremely bad, and she was not likely to live long; and on account of her age, she was very imbecile; he wanted to borrow on this reversionary property 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he was a captain in the army, on half-pay, and had been in the 13th Dragoons, in India—I took a memo<lb/>randum from what he told me—he gave me this authority: (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"I here by authorize you to peruse, at my expense, office copies of the wills of William Poulton, of Maidenhead, deceased, who died in 1810, and James Poulton, who died in 1822"—I sent my clerk to Doctors' Commons for them—he said he was the only surviving child, the others were dead—on the 25th I received a letter from him, in which he stated he had seen a gentleman who described his mother as past all recovery, and that he had copies of the wills in a carpet-bag, in the country, which was detained for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and if I would allow my clerk to go into the country with him, it would save all further trouble—he said he would call at my office, and requested me to lend him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had said his mother lived at Colney Hatch—he called, and borrowed of my clerk 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; here is a memorandum for it—on the 28th he called again—I had learned at that time from my clerk that he bad seen him—he appeared greatly distressed, and said he had just received a communication from Mrs. Phipps, who had lived a long time as companion to his mother, that his mother had suddenly died; I then told him that there was no occasion for my going on with the loan, as the property would come into his possession; he wished me then to act for him, and gave me instructions to write to Mr. Robert Harris, of Reading, his mother's solicitor, one of the trustees, and executor under the will of William Poulton—he wrote this letter to Mr. Harris—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Dear Sir,—You have, I presume, been made acquainted with the death of my mother, which took place at Colney Hatch, on Sunday last; as you are the sole surviving trustee under the will of Mr. William Poulton, I shall feel obliged by your giving to Mr. Ford any information respecting the property under the will.")—this was on the 30th, but on the 28th he had asked me to recommend him an undertaker, which I did, a Mr. Smith, the only person I knew—he took a few moments to consider, and then he said he thought he should employ some person at St. Alban's—he said he was going down to his mother's, at Colney Hatch, to look over her effects, to see if she had made any will, and how matters stood; and for that purpose he borrowed 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me, to pay his fare—on that I took his I O U for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I re-paid my clerk the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he had lent him, which made him owe me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 30th he came, and said he had been to Colney Hatch, and seen his mother placed in her shell, and screwed down; and said he had put his seal on all the effects of the house, which he had left in charge of Mrs. Phipps, his mother's companion; that he had ascertained there was no will, and handed me a list of the effects—he said he had discharged ten female, and five male servants; that his mother's debts were very little, and her property amounted to 14,679<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was at this interview he gave me this letter, which I was to forward to Reading—my clerk took it there, and on his return he gave me some information—the prisoner said he had ordered some mourning, but he had not the funds to pay for it; he was anxious to appear respectable, and he asked me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for mourning—I drew a check on my banker for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it, returned from my banker's—the prisoner gave me this I O U for it—I made these several advances on the</p>

               <p>supposition that his mother was dead, and that he would come into posses<lb/>sion of this property—if I had known his mother was alive, I should not have let him had it—he made a further representation that the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not sufficient to pay for the mourning, and he received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more of my son, and gave him orders to pay the balance of the tailor's bill, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; in the whole he received about 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the last was on lst Oct.—in a month or five weeks afterwards I heard he was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You went into the office, and instructed Mr. Savage to give me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave you the "I 0 U" for it, and you instructed me to go to Doctors' Commons, the next day, to read the will; Mr. Savage went with me, and I borrowed of him as. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> So Mr. Savage told me—I said you had better be there on the Monday morning, and I believe you were—I do not recollect that you said you should like 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you possibly might have said that you should like to get the bag yourself—I expressed a wish that you should give me the letter which was written to Mr. Harris; you did express to me a desire to go and get this carpet bag, which con<lb/>tained the documents, and mentioned that it would save my clerk the trouble; I cannot tell on what day—I do not know whether you came on the Tuesday morning with the wills to my office, and gave them to Mr. Savage—Mr. Savage is here—since you had the money, there have been three or four messengers to my office.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">At the prisoner's request, a long letter was read, addressed by him to the prosecutor, dated from Lawrence Pountney-lane, on 25th Oct., in which he stated he was truly ashamed of his ungenteel conduct towards him; and had he not been drinking, he should not have misconducted himself by sending a parcel of cabmen to his office; that he was desirous he should get the money he had advanced him, and he was willing to give him any security on the state for his trouble and expenses.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was fifteen years old last June—I live at 5, Brown's-buildings, with my father, who is a workman in the East India warehouses. I was in the service of Messrs, Wich, Newman, and Co., indigo brokers, as errand-boy—I had been nine months, or a little more, in their employ, before I saw the prisoner—I first saw him in Oct., when I was in Mincing-lane, with an errand-boy, named Frederick George Woodgate, who works for Milner and Co., of Hart-street, Crutched<lb/>friars—the prisoner said, "Boy!" and beckoned to me—I was standing leaning my back against the railings of the Commercial coffee-rooms—he had a basket on his back, which he mostly carries with him, strapped across his shoulders—I left Woodgate standing against the Commercial coffee-rooms, and went to him; he was on the opposite side of the street—he came halfway across the road, and I went halfway across, met him, and we walked back to the pavement where he was before—I left Woodgate—the prisoner said to me, "Boy, are you not in the indigo trade?"—I said, "Yes"—he asked who I was employed by—I said, "By Messrs. Wich, Newman, and Co."—he asked whether they were not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060006"/>
               <p>some relation to Messrs. Wich and Gadsbury, of Great Tower-street—I said I believed they were—he asked me whether my master had any old indigo samples for sale—I told him no, my master always returned his samples to the warehouses—he stopped to consider, and I asked him what he wanted with me—he said, "Who do you let have your dust?" (meaning indigo dust)—I said I had no perquisites; it is sometimes the boys' perquisites—he said, "Then you get high wages?"—I said I did not, my wages were 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when I was employed at sale times, which lasted a fortnight; and if my master wanted me on any other day he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for it—he said, "That is very low;" he knew boys smaller than me, and not so old, who got more money—I said, "Do you; I wish I had a better place, but the work is light, and my master is very kind to me"—he told me he could tell me how I could get more money—I asked, "How is that?"—he said, "Your master has a great many indigo samples down; if he has got 100 samples down, and you only take one square out of each, it only weighs one ounce, you will have 100 ounces, bring them to me and I will buy them of' you"—I said, "An honest penny is worth a silver shilling, and I will not do it"—at that time Woodgate came up and said, "<hi rend="italic">Wich,</hi> I am going" (we go by our master's names)—I said, "Good bye, <hi rend="italic">Mill,"</hi> that was his employer—he went through the sale-rooms which lead from Mincing-lane to Mark-lane—Barnett left me and followed him—I did not see whether he spoke to him; I was in a hurry—this was about half-past ten in the morning—I think there were sales going on; it was in the middle of sale times, but they do not begin until twelve—I had to take some samples from my master's to Mr. Milner to be put up in the sale, and I had to go to Messrs. Mason and Co., in Mincing-lane, to get some samples—the sale is on the second Tuesday in the month, and this was a week after they had begun—I saw him frequently between that time and 6th Dec.—I might have seen him to speak to him about three times a week, or more, but I shunned him as much as I could—it was only when I met with him coming out of a broker's sale-rooms that I used to speak to him—he addressed me; he always asked me if I had made up my mind—I saw him on Friday, 6th Dec, between Hart-street and Crutched-friars—that was not during the sale times; the sales were over about four weeks then—I was not in regular employ at that time; I had had no work the whole of that week—I was standing thinking, and he said, "What are you <hi rend="italic">breaking</hi> your head about, when the golden ball is so near your hand?"—I said, "Nothing"—he asked me whether I had made up my mind—I told him yes, and asked him whether I should bring him some down next morning—he said, "No, it is my <hi rend="italic">Shobbosh,</hi> let me see you down on Monday morning as early as possible"—I went to my master's on the Monday to see if there was anything for me to do; I called in every morning to see—I went about nine o'clock, or a quarter past; I do not think it was later—I took five pounds of indigo; I weighed it—(Barnett told me on the Friday afternoon that he lived at 16, Grace's-alley, Well's-street, Wellclose-square)—I took it from a chest under the large table in the show-room, put it into two brown-paper parcels, and put one into each pocket—there was no clerk there—I took it to Barrett's shop; he keeps an old clothes shop—there are clothes in the window, which was shut down—there is no appearance of any other trade—the door is half</p>

I make a mistake"—he gave me five shillings for it—I had not made any arrangement with him about it previously—next morning I stole 4lbs. more, out of the same chest, and took it to Barnett—he was standing at the door with a round cap on—it was about ten o'clock—the breakfast things were on his table, and he showed me a <hi rend="italic">meerschaum</hi> pipe—I asked him the price of it, and he said he would take 6lbs. of indigo for it; he would take the 4lbs. then, and trust to ray generosity to give him the other two—I said he wanted to make too much of a market of me, wanting six shillings for a pipe which I could buy for a half-crown any where—he pressed it upon me, but I got off it by telling him I did not smoke—he said it was a real <hi rend="italic">meerschaum,</hi> and very good, but it was not—he gave me four shillings for the indigo—his wife came out of the parlour, and asked me whether I could get her any saffron; I said I would see—she said, "Because I use it for colouring my soup"—I said, "What! instead of tur<lb/>meric?"—she said, "Yes"—saffron is 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb.—be said he would give me a very good price, fourpence an ounce—I don't know the price of turmeric—next afternoon I went to my master's—I had to clean the place up—I did not get any saffron—I looked in the drawers, and came across the cochineal drawer—I took 4lbs. of cochineal, and took it to Barnett—I said he must give me a good price, for it was very high in the market (the price in the market was from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.; my master had sold some that morning at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—Barnett gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb., telling me that it did not fetch more than half a crown in the market—next day I stole 5lbs. more of indigo, and took it to Barnett—he said, "You are going on anyhow; you are bringing it like a maid drinks"—I said I could not do any better; I was insolent to him, but I don't recollect the words I said—he said, "Watch it, how you are going on, for I will <hi rend="italic">split</hi>"—I forgot to mention that, when I was up at the court; I was flurried—on Thursday morning, Dec. 1st., I stole some more indigo from another box, called the square box—I think it was 10lbs.; I did not weigh it—I cut some slits in the lining of my coat, and put it between the lining and the cloth—I then went into the counting-house, and Mr. Appel the clerk laid hold of me by the pocket, and found what I had got—something then passed between me and my master, and while he went out for an officer I helped Mr. Appel to mark the indigo with "A," his initial—I then put them into the bags again—I left one bag there, and took the other, which weighed 6lbs., to Barnett (the bags were what I carried my ground-bait in when I went fishing)—the officers in plain clothes walked behind me—Barnett was standing at the door—I went in, took the bag out of my pocket, and gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060008"/>
               <p>it to him—he took it behind the counter, where the scales were usually kept and gave me four shillings, which I kept in my right hand—I only had one penny in my pocket and a pipe—I went out and took off my cap, which the officer had told me to do for him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see which house I came out of—I gave the money to Trew.</p>

               <p>not go with them—there was no one else in the street at the time from the moment I entered it—I suffered palpitations and great giddiness after this—my eyes were swollen to a great extent, and full of water—there was a mark on my neck which I showed at the station, where the instrument was applied—I continued to suffer for several days; for ten or twelve days I was not sufficiently well to attend to business—when I recovered my<lb/>self, and the three men were gone, I found that my coat was torn, and my watch and chain gone—the chain which was under my waistcoat was wrenched, and they had cut my neck severely in their efforts to take it by force—I afterwards saw my watch at the station—I called out after I recovered myself as loud as I had the power to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an architect, of Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital. On Wednesday night, 18th Dec., I was in Upper Norton-street with a friend, on the opposite side to the prosecutor—I saw some persons on the opposite side of the way, and about a minute after I saw them I heard a cry of "Police!"—I saw two men go away in one direction, and an<lb/>other one, the prisoner, came over towards me—there was then only one</p>

               <p>left on the opposite side of the way, and that turned out to be the prosecutor—I caught hold of the prisoner, and held him fast till a policeman came—I think we were near the house No. 38, but I would not swear to that positively—the prosecutor was still on the opposite side—he was partly in the street endeavouring to pick up his hat which had been knocked off—I crossed over with the prisoner—the policeman came up as I was crossing, and we walked over together—while I was there Mrs. Curll brought a watch—the place where it was said to have been found was pointed out to me—I was near there at the time I had hold of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 38, Upper Norton-street. On Wednesday night, 18th Dec, I was in my parlour; I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Stop thief!"—I went to the street-door, and saw three men at the next door—they were close together—I heard nothing said, but I saw a hand through my railing, and something fell from it—it made a noise as it fell—I sent ray servant to pick it up—I saw her pick it up—it was a watch and chain—it was shown to the prosecutor, and produced before the Magistrate.</p>

On Thursday, 19th Dec., about half-past three o'clock, I opened the street door, and saw five boys inside the garden gate, just at the foot of the steps of the house—there is a way by the side of the house, where there is a door that goes to the back kitchen—John Woolcombe was one of the boys—I do not recognise any one but him—I am sure of him—he spoke to me, and asked if a person named Wells lived there—I said, "No"—I then shut the door, and left them there—I did not see them go out of the garden—in about a quarter of an hour I missed a coal-scuttle that I had put the coals in, and left it by the side-door near the kitchen—the side-door was open—this is the scuttle, I have been in the habit of cleaning it, and can swear to it—this is the scoop, it was whole then, but it is now broken—they are my mistress's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at a factory, at Tottenham-road. On Thurs<lb/>day, 19th Dec, at twenty minutes past three o'clock, I saw the prisoners; I had not known them before, I am able to swear they are the persons—I only passed them—they were in Beauvoir-road, near St. Peter's Church—I went on to the factory, and about twenty minutes afterwards I was look<lb/>ing out of the window, and saw the same five altogether coming across the field—Joseph Woolcombe had a coal-scuttle—they were running, and went into two empty carcasses of houses near ourfactory—I, with Lyne and Wood, went out into the road—we saw all the prisoners except Joseph Woolcombe, coming from the carcasses—Thompson had the handle of the scoop in his hand, and Hooper had the other part of the scoop—I stopped Rose, and some boys who work for us stopped the other three—Rose said, "Pray, Sir, pray, Sir, don't take me; I have got a mother lying very ill"—the others said, "Pray don't take us, you may have the coal-scuttle"——the four were given into custody; Joseph Woolcombe was not taken then.</p>

I work at the same factory with Turner—on that day, about a quarter to four o'clock, I saw the five prisoners coming across the field; Joseph Woolcombe had something in his hand which turned out to be a coal-scuttle—they were running towards the carcasses—I came out, and we met the four coming out of the carcasses, but Joseph Woolcombe made his escape—Hooper and Thompson had the two parts of the scoop—they all begged for us to take the scuttle and let them go—one said he had a mother very ill who had four children—I did not see Joseph Woolcombe again till he was taken the next day, on another charge; I knew him again directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Beck, of 18, Great James-street, Bedford-row, a printer. Thompson was in our service—on 26th Aug. I went out; on my return the prisoner was gone, and I missed a gown, a pair of stays, a petticoat, a velvet mantle, a mantle trimmed with crape, and a whole suit of black of my husband's; another pair of trowsers and a black satin waistcoat—I went to Thompson's parents in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars, where I had been with her two or three days before, but did not see her—on 31st Dec. I met her in Castle-street, Hol<lb/>born, and said, "You know, Caroline, you have robbed me; you are my prisoner, you must come with me"—she pulled my shawl off me in the street, called a crowd round me, and told the people I was drunk, and that she knew nothing at all of me—I kept hold of her till we got into Holborn, and then she said, if I would not expose her in the public-streets she would come to my house and tell me the truth—when we got there she said, "It was not I that robbed you, it was a person assisted me to rob you; I was set to do so;" or something similar to that—a policeman was sent for, but before he came she told me, without my asking her, that on the Friday previous to her robbing me on the Monday, she met a person of the name of M'Carthy, who said, "What, are you living in this neigh<lb/>bourhood?" that she answered, "Yes;" M'Carthy said, "Can't you take some things from them people?" or "Can't you rob them people?" that she, Thompson, said she could not do it, or she did not wish to do it, I cannot exactly recollect what she said, but I believe she said she met her twice, and impressed it on her mind that she must do it—I know nothing of M'Carthy—my house is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn.</p>

               <p>High Holborn. I produce a waistcoat and coat, pawned on 26th Aug. by a woman in the name of Ann M'Carthy, of 60, Baldwin's-gardens, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say who the woman was—my attention was not called to it till last week.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 8). On 31st Dec. Thompson was given into my custody at Mr. Beck's—she stated that she was induced to commit the robbery by a woman named M'Carthy, who charred at a house where she formerly lived servant—I afterwards, in consequence of inform<lb/>ation she gave me, took M'Carthy at 18, Ely-place, Holborn, where she was charring; I told her I took her for being concerned in a robbery, in Great James-street, at the latter end of last Aug.; that Thompson said she had aided and assisted her—she said, "Good God! I know nothing about it; the girl must be mad!"—when the charge was being taken at the station they were both present, and M'Carthy said to Thompson, "Why, Caroline, you know you gave me a coat and waistcoat, which I pledged at Mr. King's, in Holborn"—Thompson said that M'Carthy was the cause of her being in trouble, or words to that effect, and M'Carthy made no reply—I asked M'Carthy for the duplicate, and she said she burnt it when in a passion, with some of her own—she told me she lived at 60, Baldwin's-gardens, I went there, and in a box in the front-room second-floor, I found this waistcoat, which Mrs. Beck identifies, and under the bolster of the bed I found this pair of trowsers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she told me her room was the second-floor, and I asked the parties there which was M'Carthy's room—she did not say whether it was front or back—there was another person in the back-room—this was the only one unoccupied—there were two beds in the room; it appeared occupied by a man as well as a woman—I took seven keys from her, and one of them opened the box, which contained women's apparel, except this waistcoat—I then went to 18, Brook-street, Holborn, which Thompson said was her lodging, and there found these two mantles, and this collar (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I reside with my sister, Mrs. Getliffe, at the British Queen, George-street, Hammersmith, On Christmas-eve we went to bed about half-past twelve, and before doing so we bolted and locked the doors and windows—on Christmas morning I was down about half-past seven—before getting up, at about a quarter to seven, I had heard footsteps in the prisoner Standen's room—there are four rooms on the floor—I sleep with my sister and the three children in the front room, and Standen slept in the back—I can hear a tread in his room, and the joists spring when they get out of bed in that room—there is a brick wall between the rooms—Standen was a lodger in the house, and carries crockeryware for sale—his usual hour for getting up was about eight—when I got down-stairs I took hold of the strap of the front door that straps it back, and the door opened—there is no lock; it fastens by a bolt in the middle, and another at the top; they were drawn—I found the bar-door forced open, and one leading to the bar-parlour, the top part of which was locked on the pre<lb/>vious evening, and the key taken up-stairs—the bottom was bolted, and the other door also—I found the bottom part broken open, and the top still locked—I found the bar-parlour in confusion, the cupboard forced</p>

I know the prisoners Standen and Cooke—about ten days before Christmas, or it might be a day or two before that, I went to the British Queen for my supper beer, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw Standen and Cooke outside the door, in the street, and heard Standen say to Cooke, "She takes the cash-box up-stairs every night."</p>

               <p>information that there had been a robbery—I examined the premises—I found the front door had not been forced, but the bar doors had—one sash of the kitchen window was slided back, and an iron grating outside very slightly removed—the inside of it next the house was fixed between bricks, and remained in its former position—that might have been moved from the inside—it is a little window area—it had not been moved half far enough for a man to get in—there were some ashes and cinders, and a piece of wood projecting over the grating, and they must have been moved to admit any one—I apprehended Cooke in George-street, about a quarter-past nine, took him to his house, and searched it, but found nothing relating to the robbery—I searched it again on the 27th, and in the yard, under some ashes and rubbish, I found two silver table-spoons, four silver spirit-labels, two brooches, three shirt-studs, three rings, one shawl-pin, and five skeleton-keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I apprehended Lee on Christmas-day, at his house, 2, Plantation-place, and in his room found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which corresponds with marks I had found on the bar doors at Mrs. Getliffe's, and the chisel is bent—Mrs. Getliffe's house is in Hammersmith parish.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Mrs. Dormer came down-stairs, did you not unlock the door, and come and tell her that Mrs. Parnell had had her throat cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see what you mean; if you will let me explain it, I will tell you how it happened—when Mrs. Parnell came running in, she fainted away, and I was frightened, and I locked the door, because I thought some one was running in after her, and I called for Mrs. Dormer, and she came down with a light in her hand—I hallooed out, "Mrs. Dormer, is any one there?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure?"—she said, "Yes," and I unlocked the door, and she came in—she was frightened to come in be<lb/>cause she thought it was my husband's cousin, and she said, "I was frightened to come in, because I thought it was that drunken woman"—those were her words—I saw the two prisoners run away—I do not know Har<lb/>riet Bradley, of 46, Hare-street, Bethnal-green, not by name—I know Mrs. Callow of Abbey-street; she was the first one I ran up to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say at any time, in the hearing of Mrs. Bradley, or any one else, that it was a singular thing you should be standing at your own door, and that you should hear nothing of it, alluding to the struggle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no remembrance whatever of saying such a thing—I went up ex<lb/>hausted, for I was almost stupified when I went up, and know not what I said, and I brought two men away with me—I do not remember saying to Mrs. Callow, "It was very curious that I should be standing at the door and hear nothing of it"—I will swear that to my recollection I did not say that—I did not at the same time say, that the first I knew of it was Mrs. Parnell coming in, and saying, "Take care for George has cut my throat"—I never uttered such a word—I never recollect ever saying such a word—I did not say after I returned from the police-court to any woman who was with me that I wanted Mrs. Parnell to understand what I had been saying at the police-court as our stories must both correspond at the next hearing—I can swear, and be on my oath that I never uttered such words—I was quite sober on that day—I could not have said any<lb/>thing of the kind—I am never given to drink—I will defy any one to say they ever saw me tipsy—I have never been at the police-court for that, or for anything—I was never summoned there as a witness before; this is the first time—I have only known Mrs. Parnell from the time of her being with Mr. Hopwood, when we worked for him—her husband is at sea, I believe—I do not know a person of the name of Anderson—Parnell resides all alone now—she did work for Mrs. Callow till this last winter.</p>

I was going along Ramsay-street, between six and seven o'clock—I had come from Sale-street, and was going to Mrs. Dearn's—when I was about halfway down Ramsay-street, I was attacked by a man and woman, both with masks on—the man put his hands across my mouth, and the woman <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> an instrument across my throat—I struggled with them for some time, when I fell—I raised myself up again by the skirt of the woman's dress, (the man's hand was on my mouth all this time)—I struggled again with the prisoners, and she drawed the instrument again across my throat—I first knew that an instrument was being used by feeling something across my throat; I was then standing as I may be now, with the woman in front and the man behind—I felt the instrument before I fell, and again after<lb/>wards—the masks were on the persons all this time; while the struggling was going on the mask came off the woman, and I then recognised to be the prisoner, Mrs. Hop wood—the man then came in front of me and threw me forcibly to the ground, and they then ran away—I am able to say that the instrument was in the female's hands—it was used twice altogether—as soon as I recovered myself I got up and went over to Mrs. Dearn's—I found the door open, and I knew no more of what passed—I then became insensible—I found afterwards that my throat has been injured—I am not able to say who the man was, only the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 8, Nottingham-street, Waterloo-town. On the evening of 2nd Dec. I was called in to see Jane Parnell, between six and seven o'clock—I found her at 18, Ramsay-street—she was lying on the bed in the front room down-stairs—I found her neck covered with blood, and part of her dress was sprinkled with it—I afterwards examined her neck and throat minutely—after removing the necklace which she had on the throat, I found three distinct incisions, quite parallel to one another—they penetrated the skin entirely, but it was merely skin-deep altogether—in some portions it was rather deeper than in the other, but nowhere was it at all below the skin—the skin was entirely divided, but none of the muscles or adjacent parts were injured—the cut was right across the throat—there was no injury beyond the skin being cut through, with the exception of the fright at the time, and the hysterical feeling, and a little fever that was produced afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it such a wound as might be made if you were to pinch up the skin and make a wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would then be decidedly deeper in one place than another—this was a wound of the same depth nearly, for the whole length.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The wound was the same depth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly the same; the skin was entirely cut through in one part, and not quite through in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not the same depth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not the same depth—the skin was entirely divided, but it was a little deeper in one portion than the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the length of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three inches—it was three distinct incisions, but it appears they were so parallel that they were all done with the same instrument at the same time—it was a clear cut wound, an incised wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you acquainted with any sort of instrument that could produce three parallel wounds of that sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not; that wag one reason why I could not give the Magistrate any answer about it, but it appeared to me beyond where the incisions were made there was a red mark both above and below, as if the instrument that had been used had been protected in some way, as I suggested, an instrument which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060053"/>
               <p>the weavers use in dividing their silk in making their velvet—they have a very sharp instrument, which is sometimes protected <hi rend="italic">so</hi> that it cannot cut beyond a certain depth—I know that weavers have a cutting instrument that is protected so that it will only do a certain quantity of mischief; but it is not an instrument that will allow of three incisions in one place—it must have been used three times if that was the instrument that was used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice the position of the necklace that you took off with reference to these wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I hardly know how to answer that question, because the wound being directly across the throat the necklace would hang directly across the throat too, and the neck<lb/>lace was as near as possible over the wound at the time I saw it—I believe that the necklace had protected the throat <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a certain extent—it was a red coral necklace, with small beads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you speak to her when you first saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was not in a fit state to be spoken to, for she was insensible at the time I Saw her; she appeared <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be so to me—I dressed the wounds—I have stated before that there was no danger from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person might of course inflict such a wound themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, because the depth of the incision was on the right side, unless a person was left-handed, and then they might do so—that is not the only reason I can give; it is also from the appearance of the wound at the time, which it is almost impossible to describe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before that it was impossible for you to say how the wound was inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With what instrument it was inflicted; most decidedly I cannot say that at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would have very little doubt, from the character of the wound, that it probably was not with a razor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not, nor with a sharp knife—the wound was not of that character—had it been with a razor the wound must have been a great deal deeper, and of a different appearance altogether; it was either with one of the instruments which weavers use, or with a three-pronged fork, which, if the edges had been very much sharpened, would have made a similar kind of thing—I am merely giving that as a suggestion, but I do not know any instru<lb/>ment that would account for the parellelness of the lines I saw—the three lanoets of a cupping instrument would have done it—that would be the kind of instrument that would do it—that is what I mean to describe—they were clean incisions, not jagged.</p>

My husband occupies the house, 18, Ramsay-street—Mrs. Dearn lodges in the parlour—I remember on Monday night, 2nd Dec, about half-past six o'clock, some one calling out my name from below—I went down-stairs—I found the street-door open, and the parlour door shut—I looked into the street—I did not see any one, and was going up-stairs—I heard Mrs. Dearn unlock the door—she asked me to come in—I hesitated, knowing there was a drunken woman there frequently—she said, "It is not the woman you think"—I went in and saw Mrs. Parnell lying on the floor, leaning her head against the bedstead—Mrs. Dearn said, "Some one has cut her throat, she knows who"—she appeared to be in<lb/>sensible—Mrs. Parnell said, "I struggled hard"—I looked at her throat, two men came in, and she fell under the table, and exclaimed, "George Hopwood! George Hopwood! I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> you no harm"—when the policeman came she said she could swear to the woman, but not to the man—in the morning after that I saw Mrs. Dearn returning from the police-court—she was rather in liquor—there was another woman with her—Mrs. Dearn said, "I want Mrs. Parnell to understand what I have said up at the police-court so as her tale shall correspond with mine"—I am positive I heard her say that—Mrs. Parnell was introduced to me as her sister, but I have found out since that she is not her sister—Mrs. Parnell came and told me that Mrs. Dearn was her sister—there is a gas lamp on the side of the dead wall—I have tried from my door to distinguish the features of persons at the spot where this scuffle is alleged to have taken place: I am not able to distin-guish the features, I could not distinguish my own child—I have toler<lb/>able good sight—I am not at all short-sighted.</p>

               <p>of Mr. Wellington Williams, of Gutter-lane. I have been in his service four or five months—I am seventeen years of age—I know the prisoner Hart—I first became acquainted with him about two months ago—he was then in Gutter-lane, crying "Old clothes"—I sold him a jacket within about twenty yards of my master's house—I believe I got a shil<lb/>ling for it—he asked me where I worked—I said at Mr. Williams'—he asked me what he dealt in—I told him collars, shirt fronts, ladies habits, and children's dresses—he asked me whether I had any soiled collars to sell—I told him no—he then asked me if I could get anything—I told him I could get things, but I should not—he said, "If you do get any things I will buy them of you, and give you a better price than any one else"—we then separated, and I saw him again in a morning or two after<lb/>wards—he then asked me if I had anything I could sell him—I told him no—he asked me if I could get anything—I told him no, I could not—I saw him again in two or three mornings afterwards—he then asked whe<lb/>ther I had got anything for him—I said not—after I had seen him six or eight times, I agreed to let him have something, and there was an arrange<lb/>ment made between us—I was to come down to White's Ground, under the archway—I told him I did not know where it was—he said, "Then meet me in Artillery-lane"—I did not go—I saw him a morning or two after that, in Gutter-lane—he asked me why I did not come down—I do not remember what answer I made—I went down to White's-row, last Monday week—that was the first time—I had not seen him anywhere before that, except in Gutter-lane—on Monday week, I took the articles stated, to the archway, in White's Ground—I had taken them from my employer four or five days previous, I believe on the Thursday, and deposited them at a tobacconist's in St. Martin's-le-Grand—on Monday week I took them away from there—I took an omnibus at the corner of Cheapside, and went with the goods to Bishopsgate-street—they were shirt fronts, collars, and habits—I do not know the value of them—they were in a bag—I had cut the top off the bag at the tobacconist's because it was too large, and also because there was a mark on it—when I got down from the omnibus I went to the arch—that is the archway leading to the Wellington—I went to meet Hart—I had made an appointment with him that same morning to meet him there at three o'clock—he told me to meet him at the archway in Widegate-street, and said he would be there—I went and he was not there—I crossed the road, and went into a public-house at the corner of Crispin-street—I do not know the sign of it—I went in to have a glass of beer—I was not in there a minute—I came out and went across to the archway—I did not find anybody in the archway—I looked down the street, and saw Hart and another man—Hart did not come up to the arch<lb/>way, but he beckoned to me—he was standing at a doorway in Tenter-street—I went down directly—he saw me coming, and he went away—I followed him to a public-house at the bottom of the street: I do not know the sign—we both went into the parlour—the other man was also in the parlour—I had seen him before with Hart—Hart said something to him, and he went outside—Hart then asked me what I had got—I had my bag with me—I told him some collars, shirt fronts, and habits—he asked how many I had—I told him I did not know—he took some of them out, looked at them, and asked what I wanted for them—at that time I heard a whistle come from the door (the other man was standing at the door)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060063"/>
               <p>Hart then threw the things in a corner—I think he had not then offered me any price for them—he went out, saying he should be back in five minutes—I stopped in the parlour—he came back, and went down the passage into a court-yard on the left hand—he then came into the parlour, and asked what I wanted for the things—I asked what he would give for them—he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them (I did not know the value of them—I never saw the prices of them)—I said no, I would not take that—he asked me how much I would take for them—I said 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he could not give that—I said he could not have them for less, I should take them back—he then agreed to take them at that price—he said he should not pay me unless I promised to bring down some more things—he said what I had brought was of no use—he put his band into his pocket, and showed me from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "If you bring me down 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth I can buy them"—it ended by his giving me 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me a duplicate to hold as a security for the two shillings—I asked him why he did not change one of the sovereigns and give it me—he said it would look too suspicious—I then left him—I was taken into custody on Tuesday morning—I gave Webb a description of him on Wednesday morn<lb/>ing, about half-past eight o'clock—I was accustomed to see him from a quarter-past eight to half-past eight—I told that to Webb, and he took him—when I was at the public-house I saw the servant Ellen Conway—she saw me and Hart at the public-house.</p>

W. and the name "Griffith, 32, Gutter-lane," on it—Newland tied the bag, and went with it to the corner of St. Paul's churchyard—he took a bus, and Wardle and I took a cab and followed it—Newland got down opposite Widegate-street, in Bishopsgate-street—he went along Widegate-street, across Petticoat-line, and along Artillery-passage to Crispin-street and White's-row—there is an archway leading to Tenter-street, and Butler-street is thirty yards from the arch on the left-hand side—the Wellington is about 100 yards from the arch—Newland went into White's-row and stood in the archway—this was about five minutes before three o'clock—he had the bag in his hand—he remained standing still in the archway about two minutes—he returned back to White's-row and went into the Paul's Head at the corner—I followed him—I had to pass the archway before I got to the public-house—as I passed the archway Hooked down, and saw Hart standing with another man near the corner of Butler-street—I then passed the public-house and went round the corner—I returned back in about two minutes; New land was not then in the public-house—I then went to the" archway, but could not see Hart—that was about ten minutes after I first saw him—I had not till then known the Wellington—the archway leads to it—I took Newland on Tuesday morning—he afterwards gave me a description of a man—I went to Gutter-lane on Wednesday morning—I saw Hart calling old clothes, and I took him—I told him it was for receiving stolen property—he said he knew nothing about it, and he was an honest man—there was nothing in the bag which he was carrying—he, had one halfpenny in his pocket, a cigar-case, a tobacco-box, and a pencil-case—he lives in Freeman-street, leading to Tenter-street, about 500 yards-from the, arch way-from information from Newland I went, to the Wellington—I saw Con way there—I received information from her, and brought her up as a witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, at 5, Trinity-square, Tower-hill; I have more than one partner—the prisoner came into our service about the beginning of March, 1849, as head book-keeper and cashier—when money, which he had received from the clerks or other people, had accumulated a little, it was his duty to pay it into the bankers', Messrs. Rogers, Olding, and Co.—a book was kept, called the rough cash-book, in which it was the prisoner's duty to add up the various sums paid to him, or which he had received, and to carry it out into the first column—when the other clerks received money, it would be their duty to do the same, and when the payments had accumulated it would be the prisoner's duty to add them up, bring the total into the second column, and pay the amount into the bankers', having first received from the other clerks the sums they had entered—there was a book called the fair</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060076"/>
               <p>cash-book, containing a debit and credit side; the debit side would be made up from the counterfoils of the check-book, and from the bill-book and the credit side from the rough cash-book—memorandums are made on the counterfoils of the check-book of the amount and object of each check—bills payable to the firm are paid at the bankers', and a balance ought to be made once a month, but I am sorry to say it was not made up to the end of the year: I found it was added up in pencil, and spoke to him about it, and said it was not the proper way—it is in ink now—I cannot say that I had told him that that was his duty, but the previous clerk had done it so—this is the rough cash-book—I find here, under a line which refers to Aug. 1849, a sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. carried out into the second column—the total is composed of six items; the first is "<hi rend="italic">King William,</hi> Felto and Co., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is in the writing of a clerk named Simmons—"<hi rend="italic">King William</hi>" is the name of a ship; Felto and Co. are parties who have paid freight on goods brought by it—this next item, "Traveller, J. Carves, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is also in Simmons' writing; and also this "duty, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the next entry, '"Barnes, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18," is in Watmore's writing—this "Achitre de Ambolo-Returned Customs, light out, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," on the 9th, is in the prisoner's writing—that is the way in which he should enter the receipt of <hi rend="italic">money</hi> if he had received it from the party—this "Bills receivable, No. 149. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." on 10th Aug., is the prisoner's writing—these six items added together make 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is carried out into the second column in the prisoner's writing—it was his duty to see it paid into the bankers, to give it to a clerk to pay in—this is the bankers' book (produced)—the amount really paid in on 10th Aug. was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was the prisoner's duty to see the book when it came back from the bankers'—he has never accounted to me for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the difference—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the fair cash-book; it was kept by the prisoner—on 21st Nov. here is an entry on the debit side of a "Bill payable, No. 248, 191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is written on an erasure in the prisoner's writing—248 indicates the number in the bill-book where I find the entry in the prisoner's writing, "No. 248, Thomas C. Horford, Cadiz, Sept. 19, payable at sixty days' date, accepted, 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that makes an entry in the cash-book of 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than was paid on the bill—on 9th May, 1850, I find an entry of the prisoner's in the fair cash-book of 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at No. 270—the corresponding entry in the bill-book is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the alteration has been made in the fair cash-book by putting a tail to the 0., and the figures have been gone over again—they are darker than the rest—the two bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., are those to which the entries in the bill-book refer.</p>

EDWIN JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did the prisoner go into your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the beginning of March, 1849—he left about Aug. 23rd, 1850—I am a ship and insurance-broker—the prisoner has been carrying on the business of a ship and insurance-broker at Corbet-court, Gracechurch-street, in partnership with Mr. Blackwell, both since and previous to leaving us, down to the day 1 made the charge before the Magistrate, which was about three weeks ago, I forget the date—we did not, to my knowledge, previous to making the charge, send to him to explain a sum of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was sent for, when he first left, to come back and explain various things, but after that, I know nothing of</p>

               <p>his being sent for—it might have been Mr. Obert or Mr. Powell who sent for him—I have not interfered in that part of the business—Mr. Obert is here, in the gallery—Mr. Obert had been looking over the books himself, and was going over them afterwards with me—between the prisoner's coming in March, and his leaving, somewhere about 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has passed through his hands—the aggregate amount to be paid into the bankers', appears in the outer column of the rough cash-book—sometimes one of the boys paid it in, and I have known the prisoner to take it—I am not aware how frequently we had the pass-book from the bankers; it was trusted implicitly to the prisoner—he used to sit in the counting-house, with five or six other clerks—I chiefly managed the money part of the business, but I thoroughly trusted the prisoner with the pass-book—I did not even question him; the only thing I demanded of him was the amount at my bankers', of an evening—my private account was sometimes over-drawn, with the sanction of my partners—I have not been in the habit of asking the prisoner for sums of money out of his Tough cash; when I wanted money of him, and he had gold in his hands, I would say, "Mr. Gardner, give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I should give him a check on my bankers for it; I should draw it in the name of the firm, And mark, "J. H. T." in the check-book—that was a common custom, if one of the partners wanted money, instead of sending each check to be changed—I might do so once a month, not once a week—that was not because my private account at the bankers' was over-drawn, nor have I told the prisoner so—on my solemn oath, I never drew money of him that be ought to have paid into the bankers', nor did I tell him so—I believe it was over-drawn about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it did not remain so; I think it was altered in Nov., I paid in 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we only have a business account at my bankers'—it was my private account between myself and my partners which was over-drawn—that was with their sanction—I had mentioned to them that I should require to over-draw it—at one time it was only 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over-drawn—after I had paid the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was still 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over-drawn—a bill was drawn by me, and discounted by the bankers, for my accommodation—that is not in the bill-book; it was my own private bill—it appears as cash to my credit in the pass-book; it is, "Partridge and Co., 5th Nov., 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I am debited with the discount—the entry is, "Discount, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I forget whether I drew a check for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I certainly did not draw a check for it in the name "discount;" if I drew it at all, it would be in the name of "J. H. T."—it was to make up a deficiency in my private account—it was a private matter between me and my bankers, who were personal friends of mine, and said, "Yes, we will do that for you"—I was a member of the firm of Partridge and Co., in Liverpool; they are ship-brokers, in Crutched Friars—Mr. Obert is another of that firm, and Mr. Partridge; Mr. Powell was not a member at that time—Mr. Obert and I have not been on friendly terms all the time; we were when the prisoner came—we only had one check-book; we both bad the control of it; I took it into my possession for two days in Nov., during a quarrel; that was while the prisoner was in our service—I never but once gave the prisoner a signed check blank for him to fill up; that was when I was called out of town by the illness of a sick child—the prisoner had nothing to do with the disbursements—Simmons kept the petty cash; the amount of it was generally under 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the first date when a balance of</p>

               <p>the fair cash-book was come to, was 10th Aug., 1849—it was then balanced all but 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we have found out an error of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check was paid away in 1849—on 31st Dec. 1849, the credit and debit sides are made to agree exactly—the prisoner made the balance, not under my inspection; I did not see it, not in that book—he brought to me every evening in 1849, on a slip of paper, my balance at my bankers'—I have not got those slips of papers for 1849, they were not kept; the books were in the book-keeper's possession, and were locked up in the ordinary way—there has been no balance since, but the prisoner came and added up his cash two days after he left, I think, and two days after, I found out that he was in partnership with Mr. Black well—that was accord<lb/>ing to an agreement when he left—I do not think we sent for him, for be came of his own accord—this is the adding up, it is in ink—I had found the amount added up in pencil, and spoke to the prisoner, and said it was not quite correct; he said he would have it put in ink, but he had done it so as to be certain of his accounts being correct—I am not aware that an error of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was then discovered—the amount here in the bill-book on 21st Nov. 1849, bill 228, is 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that bill was payable at the bankers', and was due Nov. 21st; I find by the pass-book that the bankers did pay it, and return me the bill in the ordinary way; the entry is, "Orthur, 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is no bill in the bill-book for 131<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 9th May here is a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was paid by the bankers, and is in the pass-book; the entry in the pass-book is "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. t Orthur;" it is iden<lb/>tified by the number in the bill-book—the cashier kept the old bills, I do not know where—when he left, I found all the checks and bills in bit drawer—six or seven other clerks sat in the office, but the prisoner had a desk at the other end of the office closed in—no one but him made entries in the books while he was with us—a clerk who made a payment to the prisoner would enter it in the rough cash-book—one of the boys who took money to the bankers is here; he is not in my employ now—there were two or three—it was generally paid in about four o'clock—we are constantly making small disbursements by check or petty cash, twenty or thirty times a day, for pilotage and lightage—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the smallest sum I should draw a check for; over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was always paid by a check—when the petty cash-keeper could not make a payment, we signed a check for it—that might be sometimes a dozen times a day; the average was five or six checks a day—I brought an action against the prisoner for an over-drawn account for his salary; for a conspiracy; not for going away or get<lb/>ting my business—I directed a solicitor to sue him for damages for leaving my service without notice; he had started in business then with Mr. Black-well, in Corbet-court; that was three months before I made the charge at the Mansion-house—he paid me 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over-drawn account—he had not the right to retain money for his salary, but I signed checks for too much—it was not disputed between us whether he was to have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; when he came he signed a paper that it was to be 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at the end of a certain number of months, I said, "I am very well satisfied with you, there is 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you"—the action against him was withdrawn by the advice of my solicitor, because there bad been a change of partners, and their lawyer paid the expenses for us; I received no damages for the leaving my service—in the interval, three months before I preferred this charge, f had submitted the books of 1849 to examination; we have not</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And at that time was it not stated, in your presence, that you proposed that Mr. Hobler should have them for ten minutes, and that three hours was preposterous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had nothing at all to do with it; I was in my solicitor's hands; he acted, and not me—it was not stated in my presence—I remember Mr. Humphreys saying, in Mr. Ballantine's presence, that he would turn to any account in the books which the prisoner might request to look at; I cannot recollect the exact words; and Mr. Hobler required the books for three or four hours by himself, to which Mr. Humphreys said, "Nonsense; a quarter of an hour will do"—our book-keeper, Mr. Waddell, had the examination of the books daring the three months, and Mr. Obert, Mr. Powell, and myself—I do not know whether, during the difference between me and Mr. Obert, he got a sepa<lb/>rate check-book from the bankers; I think he went for one.</p>

               <p>the bankers' with the money—on the slip of paper which the prisoner used to bring me, was what he had paid, what he had drawn out, and the balance left at the bankers'—I had no means of knowing whether the papers were right at night—I never asked for the pass-book—the prisoner used to draw the body of the checks, and I signed them; and in no other way would the check be honoured, unless drawn by myself or partners—it might be filled up by anybody—I had an arrangement with my partners how much each I was to draw—it was with the sanction of both my partners that I overdrew my account—it was known to Mr. Obert well that we had both done so—that would be known to the prisoner, as clerk; he kept my account, and in that way he learned what has been asked me—we have banked with Messrs. Rogers since 1847; they are friends of my family—the blank check which I signed, was in the latter end of July or the beginning of Aug., 1849—I gave it into the prisoner's hands—I do not know whether it was used; if it was, it would go to whatever account he paid the money for, and the check would appear in the ordinary way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, at Wanstead. I knew William Reed when he was alive—he was a labourer at Wanstead—I know the prisoner—one day last month, he and Reed and I, my father, and a man named Connor were engaged in pulling down a shed belonging to Mr. Kennerton—we were removing the remaining part of the shed in a cart—I and Connor were on the shafts, and Reed and Jolly were <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> behind—when we got between Mr. Finnis's gate, and Mr. Brown's lodge, Reed said that Jolly did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> enough, and struck him somewhere about the body—it was no particular blow—they might have four or five rounds—it might last ten minutes, tumbling and falling about—the falling was the worst—there was no particular blow, but Reed was striking Jolly a round or two afterwards, and Reed overreached himself and fell, the road being a bit <hi rend="italic">slippy,</hi> and he cut a bit of skin out of his forehead and down his nose—I persuaded them to leave off, and I thought Reed would have struck me—I and my father parted them—Reed did not like being parted at all—Jolly was agreeable to leave off—Reed seemed to walk very well after that—we then came on for 100 or 120 rods, and I then left them—he walked that distance—he seemed to be a little bit <hi rend="italic">freshy like,</hi> from a drop of beer—neither of them were quite sober—we had been allowed two pints a piece, and they had had an extra seven pots unknown to us—they both seemed a little excited by drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Wanstead. I was called in to see the deceased, on the evening of 11th Dec, I found him suffering under fearful erysipelas of the head and face—he appeared in a dying state—he died on 17th—he never rallied—the disease was so violent that I could merely discern a scratch on the face, one on the left temple, and one on the forehead, as though from a finger-nail or gravel—if he had fallen forward on the gravel that might have produced the appearances—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found the membranes of the brain adherent—that was caused by inflammation—the vessels of the brain were con<lb/>gested—the brain itself was healthy—I could not at all judge what had produced the inflammation, but inflammation readily takes place when the scalp is injured by the merest scratch—the scratch would account for the erysipelas, and the inflammation would follow the erysipelas—he died in an exhausted state from erysipelas—I should say he was of a bad con<lb/>stitution, not one to stand up against such a disease—I found no symp<lb/>toms of violence in other parts of the body, no laceration or any broken bones—the skin was a little discoloured on the shoulders—I am of opinion on the whole that the erysipelas originated in consequence of the bruise on the forehead, and that death was the consequence of exhaustion fol<lb/>lowing the erysipelas—I saw no other mode of accounting for the death.</p>

I went to a cottage in Alderways Lee, in Derby, and found the prisoner there—I searched the house, and found the property now produced, and some other also—she said it was her own, property, and, correcting herself, said, "Otherwise, Mrs. Dickens's."</p>

I buy and sell beasts—I had a bay gelding—I came to Horsham on 16th Nov.; I stopped there over Sunday—on the 17th I went to feed the beasts in the field, about five o'clock in the evening; at seven the next morning I went to feed them again, and I missed the gelding—I got a description of it inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>—on 12th Dec. I saw it again at the Castle Inn, in the Old Kent-road, in the possession of the ostler—it was the same that I had lost, but it had been altered; they had cut its tail since I lost it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-merchant, at King's Arms Wharf, Belvedere-road, Lambeth. Higgs was in my employ as a carman on 6th Dec., and had been so for six or seven months—Mr. Reddin, of Holland-street, Blackfriars, is a customer of mine—on Monday, 9th Dec., I went to Mr. Taylor's premises, near the Horns, at Kennington—I found there half a load of second-cut clover hay tied with canary straw bands, which is very unusual—there was nothing particular about the quality of the hay, only its being second-cut clover—I also went to Mr. Dack's, a corn-dealer, in Lambeth-walk—I found about half a load of hay there, of the same description, tied in the same way, and similar in every respect—I had some hay of that description at that time, and on the previous Fri<lb/>day one load of it went to Mr. Reddin's by my order—I sent six loads to Mr. Reddin's on Friday, and one of them was this clover tied with canary straw bands—I saw Thomas Higgs take that load out of the yard about three o'clock in the afternoon—in consequence of information I went to George Giggs—he is the brother of Edward Giggs, who is in my service—George Giggs had bought two loads of hay of me sometime in the early part of that week—he had a written order from me to fetch one of those loads from the Great Western Railway—the hay that I sold him one load of, was lying there, and the bulk from which the other load was to come was at the Southampton Railway—the hay that he bought of me at the Great Western Railway was cinquefoil hay, and the other was black clover hay, neither of them were similar to this second-cut clover hay—they were very much inferior—he gave me 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load for the two loads he had—the hay I found at Taylor's and Dack's was from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. better—</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mason-street, Stamford-street. I re<lb/>ceived directions on 6th Dec., from Mr. Trampleasure, to take some clover-hay to Mr. Reddin's—I left about four o'clock, as near as I can guess—Thomas Higgs and Kicks went with me, and Coombs came after—we three had each a load; and when we got a little way out of Mr. Bennett's yard, Higgs said to me, "Old fellow, one of these loads belongs to us"—I said, "What do you mean, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>?"—he said, "Why one of these belongs to us, we shall have one of these loads ourselves"—I said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Tom;</hi> I will have nothing at all to do with it"—he said, "Yes you shall"—I said, "No, I won't, by God!"—nothing more passed at that time—the three carts kept together, and we went on to Mr. Powell's, in John-street, Commercial-road—one of the two men there ordered a pot of ale, and they made me have a glass—I left the other two at Powell's, and I went home to get my dinner, in Mason-street—that was in my way to go to Mr. Reddin's—I took my load of hay to my house; it stood before my door while I got my dinner—after that I went with it to Mr. Reddin's—I saw Kicks there, and Green was there, but Higgs was not—I did not see him at Mr. Reddin's at all—Coombs came afterwards—when I had delivered my hay, we came away to a public-house in Holland-street—there was Kicks, Coombs, Green, and I—we had a drop of beer; and when we came out, Green jumped into Coombs's cart, and they went galloping on; I and Kicks went gently after—they said we were to go to Powell's—I said to Kicks, "What does he say?" he said, "He says we are to go to Powell's"—I went there, and Coombs's cart and Higgs's cart were both there—Higgs's cart was then empty—when I left it there before, it was full, and it had got a load of second-cut clover on it—I went into the tap-room at Powell's house, and they stood at the front of the bar—after some time, Higgs came into the tap<lb/>room, and said, "How are you, Mr. Hopkins?"—he caught hold of my right-hand with both his hands, shook my hand, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into my hand—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> what is this for?—he said, "That is what I owe you"—I said, "You don't owe me <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>"—he said, "Go on, you stupid old man;" I said, "I won't have it;" he said, "Go on, you stupid old man, you shall have it"—I kept it till I got out of doors—I would have given it him again, but he would not take it—I told him I wanted to give it him again—I said, "Here is this money back again, <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> for I won't have it"—he said he would not have it—Green had gone some little time before Higgs put the money into my hand—Stangate is about half a mile from Powell's beer-house—I should think I was not away from Powell's more than an hour and a half or an hour and three-quarters before I got back—we started off about four; I do not think it was six when we got back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sylvan-cottage, West-street, Walworth. About half-past twelve o'clock on Christmas night I met the prisoner near St. George's Church in the Borough—I went with her to a house in Flint-street, Friar-street—I went up-stairs and took off my coat and waistcoat—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket, with a braid guard attached to it, which was round my neck—I did not leave the watch in my waistcoat pocket; it was hanging to my neck; after I had been there a few minutes I missed it—the prisoner was sitting on the bed close to me—I accused the prisoner of taking it—she denied it—I picked my guard off the carpet; it had been cut from my neck—I then took the prisoner out of the house—I asked her to go out—I then seized her, threw her down, and called for assistance—a policeman came; we both got up, and I gave her into custody—I accused her of taking my watch—she denied it, and said I had it on my person—she asked me to search—I had put on my coat and waistcoat again, and I searched every pocket, including those by the fide of my coat—a policeman came and the prisoner said, "Search your pockets again, you have it on you"—she came close to me, and I felt her hand touch my right-hand coat pocket—I put my hand in that pocket and found the watch—I gave it to the policeman—I had been drinking, but was sensible of what I was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Robin Hood, Kingston-bottom, and am assistant game-keeper to the Duke of Cambridge. On 12th Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I was going my rounds, and beard the report of a gun in the direction of Mr. Day's cover, which was about a quarter of a mile off—I went towards the spot, and when I got about halfway I heard a cry for help—I heard Croxall's voice, which I knew—be sung out, "Come on!"—I went to Mr. Day's preserve, and found Croxall with his head bleeding, in the field near the orchard—he was on his legs when I came up to him, and he and I went towards the Common—I did not at that time see any men running away—when we went in chase we saw two men running, and we followed them, but lost sight of them on the Common—they were going towards Wimbledon—we returned the same way, as near as we could—there was no path, and when we got between 200 and 300 yards from the place where Croxall had been, I saw the prisoner come over Mr. Day's fence in a direction from where I first saw Croxall, and was going towards Wimbledon—when he came close to us Croxall said, "This is the man that struck me; I can swear to him"—we both laid hold of the collar of his coat—he was very obstreperous—we could not bold him, and be got out of our hands—we chased him 150 or 200 yards, and came up with him again, took hold of his collar again, and he drew a knife from his pocket—Croxall said directly, "Brockwell, he has got a knife in his hand; mind your hand"—the prisoner then said he drew the knife to cut his handkerchief—I had hold of him by the hand<lb/>kerchief—he shut it up and put it away again—I saw Croxall take this bludgeon out of the prisoner's pocket—while the prisoner was running away he called out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>! <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>! "two or three times—a person could hide himself very easily in Mr. Day's cover if be wished—the prisoner had on a light plaid cap, a snuff-coloured shooting-jacket, corduroy trowsers, and a light jacket underneath—I assisted Croxall in taking him to the con<lb/>stable; and on the way to Wandsworth police-station he told me he was to have been with the party, but was half an hour too late—he then said that if he had been there twenty men should not have taken him, for he would have knocked them all down as fast as they came up to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>might be forty or fifty yards, or a little further off the prisoner when we first saw him—I think fifty was quite the outside—he was about three-quarters of a mile from Coomb-lane—there is no road where he was—he was walking gradually along—his coat was not buttoned completely up, only by one or two buttons—the moment he came up, Croxall identified him as the person who struck him—the prisoner said he had done nothing, and he did not see why he should be taken into custody—he said he had heard the cry for assistance as he was coming down from the main road—he did not in my presence say he had gone into the orchard to see what it was—I did not hold him at all tight when he drew the knife, I only just took hold of him in the common way by the handkerchief—I did not put my knuckles down his neck—he did not complain that I was choking him—he said, "I am not going to cut your hand at all, I am going to cut my handkerchief"—he shut the knife up immediately—I had no conversation with Croxall going along, more than his stating that there were three of them; that two were gone away, and he thought one was left back—he did not mention the prisoner's name, or describe his dress.</p>

               <p>half above the right ear, about three inches in length, extending towards the forehead; half an inch of it was deeper than the rest—I strapped it up—in my opinion, such a wound might be inflicted by such a stick as this—I did not attend him afterwards.</p>

Cooper was brought to our shop on 17th Dec., about seven o'clock in the evening—she had a small wound over the left eye, about an inch long, and about one-eighth of an inch deep—the skin was lacerated, but not cut through—she had lost a good deal of blood—the flesh around was very much swollen as if the blow had been inflicted by some heavy instrument—the poker might have done it—it was not a dan<lb/>gerous wound—I have not seen her since—I do not think the poker could have bent in that way—she may have guarded it off with her arm, and that may have bent it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present a private gentleman living on my property. At the time of the fire I resided at Clapham—I now live at East Hackney—I have considerable property at Clapham, consisting of freehold land and houses—I am erecting a very great number of buildings there—there was a workshop on a vacant piece of ground behind the houses—there were all sorts of deals in the workshop and materials used for the purposes of building—on Friday, 20th Dec., a fire took place, which reduced the workshop completely to ashes, nothing but charcoal remained, nothing of the building itself, and a very small portion of the materials—the fire broke out between half-past seven and a quarter to eight o'clock—I was on the spot very soon after it broke out—I should apprehend from the materials being very dry, and there being a great many shavings and other combustible materials there, it must have flared up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060117"/>
               <p>instantaneously—it broke out after dark—the prisoner had been employed on the premises some weeks previously, not directly by me, but oy another man named Wood, a sub-contractor—he had been working on the premises, but not when the fire occurred—I did not discharge him or give orders to have him discharged—he came to me about five weeks before the fire and said that he apprehended Wood was about discharging him, and he said, "Sir, you have a great many mouldings to make for houses that are about being erected, I will engage to do them for you at so much a hundred," naming the price—I said, "My good fellow, I do not see why you should not have as good a chance as any other man, and I will take care that you shall do them at the price you have named"—I did not see him again until I saw him in the station-house on the Sunday after the fire—I went there merely to identify him, or to see if the man Amos was really the man who had been at work on the premises—I had heard that a man had given himself up accusing himself of this matter—I saw him and recognised him—I said, "My good fellow, what inducement could you have to injure me?"—he said he wished to be revenged against the Woods—as I was coming away he asked me how much the loss was—I told him over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he did not think it had been so much—he said he was now ready to give me all the satisfaction in his power, that he had done it, and as a proof that he was there he stated that he saw old Mr. Wood's boy taking his tea to him about five o'clock, but the gate was locked leading to Wir<lb/>temberg-place, and he saw another boy help Wood's boy over the wall; that he went to the Cock and had some beer and bread and cheese there, and as a proof of it, a man who took beer from the Bowyer's Arms some time since, but is now discharged, and who was a Norfolk man, could prove that he really was there—he said he went into the workshop at six, having found the door open, and he remained there until he heard the two chimes after seven; that he then took a lucifer match and set fire to the place; that he was resolved to be revenged of the Woods, and wished they had been there to be burnt in it; that he did not mind having seven years, but he hoped he should not have more, as he was a good tradesman, and would be bettered by being sent where be could get better work and better wages than here—after uttering other expressions of revenge against the Woods he ceased, and I came away; in fact, he pressed the latter part upon me, for my child was outside in the carriage, and I wished to get to her—I had seen the prisoner while working on my premises, but have not spoken to him above twice in my life—there was not the slightest appearance of insanity about him when he spoke to me—he seemed to take care of the pounds, shillings, and pence, as well as any man I ever met with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a character had he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really do not know anything detrimental to the man; up to the time of the fire I should have had no objection to give him a character—nothing occurred after my interview with him to induce him to leave—I was quite ready to have employed him the following day, and if he had chosen he might have remained there till this hour—in the course of my interview with him at the station, he said he remained there from six till a quarter-past seven o'clock, till he became so cold, and nobody came there; he did not explain what he meant by that, except that he was expressing great revenge con tinually against the Woods—he said he then took a lucifer match, and something came over him, and he was resolved to do it, and then he set</p>

               <p>the place on fire—I do not recollect whether I have stated before that he said he was resolved to do it; but he certainly made use of that expression—I signed my deposition before the Magistrate; he stated what I signed to, but I did not say that he might not have said a great deal more—one of his expressions was, "I do not know what came over me to set fire to the building," but he also said that he wished to be revenged, that he was determined to be revenged on the Woods; that seemed to be all his aim, and he wished they had been there to be burnt—I have been an officer in the army—I am not in any trade or vocation—I do not keep a shop—this is a plan of my premises—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—the houses are erected, and fit for habitation—I should say they are about thirty yards from the work<lb/>shop, the workshop was upwards of forty feet square; in the centre part it was about twenty-four or twenty-five feet high; the outside part was perhaps not more than thirteen or fourteen—it was covered with slates, and had glass windows at the side—there was only one door—there had been two, but one had been closed up for a long time, and could not be made use of; it had not been opened for two or three years; it was a double door, wide enough to admit a carriage—the windows were a con<lb/>tinuation of glass on one side—it was covered in all round; it was not painted, it was weather-boarded—there was brickwork at the bottom, merely to prevent the timber sinking into the ground and rotting—when I saw the prisoner at the station, I immediately addressed him, saying, "My good fellow, what could have induced you to do me this injury?"—I am not aware that he had said anything before that—he was not alone, a police<lb/>man was with him—I addressed him in a kind way, and he thereupon made the statement—I have not the most distant recollection of his saying anything about a letter; I do not believe he did, or I should have some slight recollection of it; I cannot venture to say whether he did or not, he might or might not—he might or might not have said, "A man sent the letter to Clapham to inform them all about it;" I have no recollection of it—his statement was not coupled with the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the amount of damage done by the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a difficult question to answer—no money can replace what I have lost, because it would be impossible to buy the same materials which were six or seven years old and well seasoned; it was a considerable loss—the workshop was erected immediately after I bought the property, in 1846—it was used as a warehouse for various things, as a workshop, and a place in fact to put anything out of the weather; as a universal convenience—the Woods took contracts for different kinds of work—they were not the proprietors of the workshop or the materials, everything there belonged to me—I was my own architect, and my own everything.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Old Kent-road, and am a gas-lighter. About 5th Sept. I wrote to the prisoner, and he came the following day, and said he was an officer belonging to the High Court of Chancery—I had heard be was an officer, and asked him so when he came, and he said, "Yes"—I told him I had some property in the Court, and he said he would draw me up a petition, which would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I should hear from him in a few days—he afterwards came, and brought me an answer to the petition—I have not got it, he took" it away with him—I signed my name to each of them, but did not keep a copy—I signed my name to the petition and the <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> I think he called it—he said the expense of the last was 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for the petition—he said I could not have had a better answer if I had paid 100 guiueas for it—he called several times; but when he brought the <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> he did not call for three or four weeks; and I wrote to him, and he did not come; I wrote again, and he came, and said the property would be settled by 22nd Dec.—I paid him the 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (I do not know the coin) for the <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> believing he was doing me justice, and that what he told me was true—he showed me a seal, which he said he got from the Chan<lb/>cellor's Court, and for which he paid three guineas; it was on a red piece of wax, with his coat of arms—the next I heard of him was, that he was in custody—the last time he came he said he thought mine would be put off till May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, at 10, London-road—we are gold-beaters—the prisoner has been in our employ three or four months. On 16th Dec. I gave him 2ozs. 9dwts. of gold, worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to heat into leaf—none of the men were allowed to take the gold off the premises—he worked that day; and the next day, Tuesday, he was the worse for liquor—I think I saw him on the Wednesday, but am not quite certain—on the 19th, Thursday, at five o'clock, finding the work was neglected, I went and looked, and found the gold gone, box and all, and the prisoner also—I found him the same evening, at ten o'clock, at the Seckford Arms, Clerkenwell-green, and said, "Gilson, what have you done with the gold?"—he said, "It is in the shop"—I said, "It is not there; and if you do not come with me I shall give you in charge"—he wanted to have some more to drink—I said I should give him in charge if he did not come, and he came—on going down St. John-street, Green, who is in our employ, and was with me, spoke tohim, and the prisoner pulled the box from his pocket with the gold in it, and Green instantly handed it to me—it was the box he usually kept gold in—not a grain of the gold was removed while I had it, and on getting home I weighed it, and found it weighed only 16 dwt. 12 grains; being a deficiency of 1 oz. 12 dwt. 12 grains, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a very small quantity, not half a grain, was found in his pocket—he had no authority to remove it from our premises.</p>

                  </hi>. On 19th Dec. I saw the prisoner in our shop, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I saw the box there on his bench, at nine o'clock in the morning—I had seen the gold in it at nine the evening before—I did not weigh it, but from my knowledge of the material, and from the fulness of the box, I conclude it was all there—he was tipsy on the 18th, but not on the 19th.</p>

I was with Mr. Jennings on 19th Dec., and on coming down St. John-street, in consequence of what he said, I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Gilson, give me the box"—he gave it me directly—I kept it two minutes, and handed it in the same state to Mr. Jennings—I took no gold out—I was present when it was weighed; it weighed 16dwts. 12gr.</p>
