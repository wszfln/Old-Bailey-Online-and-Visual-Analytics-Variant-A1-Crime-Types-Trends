                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Cosgrove, of 74, Lancaster Gate, which is a private hotel—my husband and myself are the pro<lb/>prietors—last year the male prisoner was in our service as head waiter—we had an excellent character with him—his wife was in our service at that time as staff housekeeper; that is looking after the basement and the servants—they both left of their own accord, having remained about six weeks, I think—they came back to me at a private house where I was living at Maidenhead, in the capacity of butler and cook—that was in May—they stayed with me six weeks that time, and returned to Lan<lb/>caster Gate with me—the house at Maidenhead was a hired furnished house—when we came back to Lancaster Gate I do not think the male prisoner had any definite position for the first week or two—afterwards he went back again to the dining-room as head waiter, and his wife accom<lb/>panied me to Dublin as maid—Mr. Cosgrove was not very well, and I took her as a sort of nurse—she was a very useful person—we were a fortnight in Dublin—we came back, and they remained a short time—the male prisoner remained out one night and they left—they came again in March, 1904, but not at my request; the manageress asked them—the male prisoner came to the dining room and afterwards became hall porter—the wife remained quite a short time then, and the male prisoner until October last, when he gave notice—his wife had only come temporarily to assist, and when the manageress recovered her health she left—while the male prisoner was there I missed a quantity of property from time to time—it started with a dozen of apostle teaspoons, then some more tea<lb/>spoons, about three dozen altogether, then a plated teapot, then seven sovereigns in gold, a £5 note and various articles of jewellery belonging to persons staying in the hotel and to myself; also two overcoats and a quantity of house linen almost new, which I have seen in the possession</p>

If you do not wire me £2 by 4 p.m. to<lb/>morrow, Monday, to Post Office, Leinster Terrace, W., I shall go straight to Mrs. Cosgrove and tell her all about West's £1 and the £7 matter, and also about the numerous things that you have in your possession. If you comply I will keep silent. I think the way you have treated me and the lies you have told about me has been most disgraceful. Now, mind, I have quite made up my mind this time that should there be no reply, and money, you can wire that, forthcoming by 4 p.m. sharp, I will go straight to Madam, and most probably she will have you arrested. If everything is right I will keep silent as before, so for your own sake do not fail. You had no mercy on me; I shall be exactly the same with you. Charlie H.

Own up like a man, and get the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> off"—when I saw you and your wife in Waterloo Road I followed you to your mother-in-law's house, where you waited half an hour for your wife, who went away—you then went to the Ship in Kennington Road with your mother-in-law and wife, and from there to Lambeth Walk, when you went to Aaron's, the bootmaker's, while your wife went to Harvey &amp; Thompson's—your wife then came out and waited outside Aaron's for you, where her mother joined her with a little boy—I made inquiries at the shops you had been in, to see if bad money had been changed—you then went into the French Horn—you never purchased any eye-glasses whilst I had you under observation—your mother-in-law and the child left you, and you and your wife tried to board a tram—you gave the key of your room to another officer—we had you under suspicion, and that is why we watched you—you were very difficult people to follow.</p>

At 9.15 p.m. on March 31st I was in the New Cut, when Reed called me—I saw the male prisoner in custody, and the female prisoner a few yards ahead of him—Reed was searching the male prisoner when I came back with the female prisoner—Reed pulled out a shilling, a sixpence, about 5d. in bronze, and four counterfeit coins wrapped up in a piece of brown paper separately, with a layer of paper between each—there was no sovereign among the money that I saw—on bringing back the female prisoner Reed said, "This is a case of counter<lb/>feit coins"—I took the female prisoner to the station, and on the way I saw she had a purse in her hand, and I asked her whether she knew what was in it—she said, "Yes, there are two 2s. pieces and a shilling"—I examined it at the station and found in it two good florins and a counterfeit shilling—I held the man with my right hand and the woman with my left, Reed walking behind—another uniformed constable joined us at Waterloo Road, and he walked behind too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Evans, of 67, St. George's Road, Borough, where I let rooms—the prisoners had been my lodgers for three weeks before they were arrested—they came on March 11th and took the first floor back room at 4s. 6d. a week—during the three weeks else would have the use of that room, and I never went in—they did not have attendance—they had a key—at 9.30 p.m. on March 31st four gentlemen came to my house and one went away to get the key to the prisoners' room—I had not a key—they searched the room, but found nothing—they went away with the key—on the morning of April 1st two of the detectives came again, and I saw them find three small pieces of metal in a vase on the mantelpiece of the prisoners' room, which they took away—they gave me the key and I locked the room and took the key under my own care—I did not go there again until the Sunday week, April 9th, up to which time I had had the key in my possession—I unlocked the door and gave the room an airing and emptied the <hi rend="italic">slops</hi>—I took up the prisoners' tin teapot from the right hand side of the hob, when I heard something rattle—I took it downstairs and in the presence of all my children I found twenty-seven shillings—I did not know then whether they were bad or not—they were all loose amongst the tealeaves and tea, and at the bottom of the teapot—another officer came on the Monday and I gave them to him.</p>

I have had the prisoners under observation for some time—at 7.30 p.m. on March 29th I saw them in London Road—they boarded a tram and rode to the foot of Westminster Bridge, where they got off—I boarded the same tram—they walked over the bridge, through Whitehall, Charing Cross, to Castle Street, Oxford Street, I following—they walked about twenty yards past No. 16, Castle Street, a confectioner's shop kept by Marianna Fietta, and stood at the corner of Margaret Street, apparently looking about—I saw the male prisoner put his hand to the female's—she then walked back to the confectioner's shop and looked in the window and shortly after went inside—through the glass I could see her having a conversation with</p>

               <p>Fietta, and she shortly afterwards left—she pulled the door behind her and walked very hurriedly back to the male prisoner, who was standing at the corner of Margaret Street, looking in the direction of the shop—they turned into Margaret Street—I went into the shop, where I saw Fietta, who handed me this counterfeit florin (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I got her to mark it and left the shop in search of the prisoners, but I failed to find them—I afterwards went back to Fietta, marked the bad florin and took possession of it—on the night of March 31st, before their arrest, I saw the prisoners leaving Mrs. Evans and I followed them with other officers—I saw them afterwards at the Kennington Road police station, when I told them that they would be charged with uttering a counterfeit shilling to Hayes, and with being in possession of five counterfeit shillings, being the four found in the male prisoner's pocket and one in the purse—they made no reply—I do not think I said then anything about the counter<lb/>feit florin, but I charged them with that on April 19th, and with being in possession of twenty-seven more counterfeit coins, to which they made no reply—I did not see any sovereign that had been found on the male prisoner—when I saw the four counterfeit shillings they were out of the paper, which was lying by the side of them on the desk—counterfeit coins are usually carried with a layer of paper between each of them to prevent them getting rubbed.</p>

Do not get so excited"—I said, "Let me out," but they would not do so—they said, "We will give you every penny back, only keep quiet"—they locked me in, and both went out two or three times—they did not say they had not got my money—they locked me up for two and a half hours, and as soon as they let me out I said, "I will charge you," and I went to Upper Street police station as fast as I could go—a policeman came down with me and I gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statement before the Magistrate: Wheeler:</hi> "Lewis came up to me on the day I was arrested and said that in Great Eastern Street he had kicked along a parcel, and when he opened it he found some money in this packet. He showed me this money and asked me if it was all right, so I took one of the shillings and tried it, and I broke it and said, 'I do not think the shillings are any good.' When I tried to break a 2s. piece I found I could not break it, so I was under the impression that the 2s. pieces were good, so I gave him the money I had, and took away the separate 1s. pieces, so that my good money could not be mixed with the money that I came to the conclusion was bad. Afterwards, walking into Old Street; we met Smith. We told him we had found some money. He asked me if we were going to treat him. I said, 'Take one of the 2s. pieces,' and I told him to go and get a couple of scones. He took it, thinking the same as I did, that it was good money. So he took it into the cake shop, and they said it was no good, and they did not like it, so I told him to take it somewhere else. They told him also it was no good, so we were making towards home, through Great Eastern Street, when the two plain clothes officers came and arrested us on suspicion. For the minute I was very much surprised, and could not make out what was the matter. When he told us he was going to arrest us on suspicion I said, 'All right, we will go.' "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith:</hi> "About 3 p.m. on Saturday week I was proceeding to Exmouth Street. Clerkenwell, to see my father, when I met Lewis and Wheeler at the side of the City Road. Wheeler asked me where I was going. I told him I was going to see my father at Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell. He said, 'I have just had a piece of luck.' I said, 'What is that?' He said, 'I have found some coins.' I said, 'Well, you had better treat me now, then.' He said, 'All right.' We turned back. He then gave me a 2s. piece, and told me to get him two scones in the baker's. I went in and asked for two scones. The woman in the shop, the keeper of the shop, said she did not like the look of the 2s., which I was under the impression was good. I bounced it on the counter, and said, 'I think it is all right by the sound of it.' To make sure whether it was good or bad I went into a confectioner's and tobacconist's shop close by, and asked for a packet of Woodbines. The young lady said, 'I do not think it is a good one,' and I paid for the Woodbines with a penny. I came out of the shop, joined Lewis and Wheeler, and gave them the 2s, back, and</p>

               <p>told them it was bad. They said, 'Well, I think we will go home.' We were going through Great Eastern Street towards Spitalfields, when the two officers in private clothes came up and arrested the three of us on suspicion of counterfeit coin. I said, 'I know nothing of them,' and I was taken to the station. Nothing was found in my possession."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lewis:</hi> "About 2.30 p.m. on the Saturday when we were arrested I was walking along Great Eastern Street when I kicked a bundle and picked it up. I found eight 2s. pieces in it. I put them in my pocket, and went down Commercial Street. There I met Wheeler. I showed Wheeler the money, and he took one of the shillings and put it in his mouth, and broke it, and took them away from me, and said they were no good. He then took one of the 2s. pieces, and tried to break it, and could not. He said it was good. The two of us then went down Old Street, and there we met Smith. Smith asked us to treat him, and I gave him one of the 2s. pieces. He said he felt rather hungry, so I told him to buy a scone, and he went in a shop. When he came out he said that the woman said it was no good. I then asked him to get me a packet of Woodbines, and he went into a tobacco shop. When he came out of this shop he said that the woman said it was no good. I took it away from him, and we were making towards home, when we got into Great Eastern Street, two officers in private clothes arrested us, saying they had suspicion we were uttering counterfeit coins. They took me to the station, and they searched me. They found 11s. 6d. in silver, and 6s. 8d. in coppers, eight 2s. pieces in bad money, and one shilling broken. I said that I had these in my possession, thinking they were good."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wheeler, in his defence, said he had no felonious intention, and that he thought the coins were good. Smith handed in a written statement. Lewis said he did not want to say anything.</hi>

I am a laundry proprietor at Acton and am Chairman of the Urban District Council—I produce a minute on June 27th, 1880, of the prisoner's appointment as a clerk, at a salary of £100 a year—I was not a member of the Council at that time—it would then be the Acton Local Board—he remained in our service till October, 1904, when he was receiving somewhere about £300 a year—he was a man in whom we placed complete confidence, and he bore an excellent character as far as we were concerned—the Chief Clerk was a Mr. Hemsley, a man getting on for eighty, and in business for himself as a solicitor with some sons—he is still alive, but practically retired—his nominal salary was £120, but he could charge on the legal business of the Council—during his time the office to a large extent was in the prisoner's hands—in the early part of 1903 Mr. Hemsley retired, and a Mr. Hodson was appointed in his stead at a salary of £450 a year, rising to £600—he was not a solicitor—the reason we wanted to make a change was that we wanted to have a man for the whole time, as, of course, Acton was growing largely, and wanted a good deal more attention than had been given to it previously—at the same time the prisoner was made accounts clerk—before that he had to deal with the committee work and accounts, but now he had only to deal with the accounts, which made his duties lighter—when he received amounts payable to the Council it was his duty to make out a receipt from the Council's receipt book, enter on the counterfoil the items corresponding to the receipt, enter the amounts in the books as having been received, and to pay the moneys over to the treasurer, who is the manager for the time being of the local branch of the London &amp; South Western Bank—I question whether the manager got any salary for that; it is an arrangement between ourselves and the Bank—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the agreement with the London &amp; South Western Railway, dated October. 1881, under which they covenant to pay us a half-yearly sum of £20 in January and July of each year towards the maintenance of a bridge at Acton—the accounts of the Council were audited every year by an auditor appointed by the Local Government Board—the Council kept all the books prescribed by the Local Government Board, so far as I know—in the morning of October 1st, last year, I think, my attention was called by Mr. Hodson to the alleged discrepancy which the auditor, Mr. Young, had discovered with reference to the £20 cheque of July, 1903, and on October 3rd I and the vice-chairman told the prisoner of the discrepancy discovered, and asked him for an explanation—that was the only discrepancy we then knew of—he was very much astonished and said, "If there is anything wrong, we will make it right"—I said to him, "I do not think your explanation, so far, anyhow, is satisfactory, and I think you had better make your explanation in writing, and send it to each member, and then we can have the whole facts before us, and we shall be able to deal with the matter upon your explanation"—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020038"/>
               <p>is the reason why we had this explanation which was sent round to each member of the Council—he did not say anything as to cash in hand—I might say with regard to the letter, he said, "I do not want every office lad to know about this, and I do not want it to go through the ordinary course of letters from the office," and I said I did not want anybody to know about it except the members of the Council, and he sent this letter to us on October 6th—on October 11th there was a meeting of the Council—he was called before it and questions were put to him about the matter, but he made no explanation beyond that contained in the letter—he was asked to retire, and we discussed it—we considered his explanation so unsatisfactory that on his return we asked whether he would resign—he said, "I will resign," and he did so straight off—at that time only the one cheque, July, 1903, discrepancy was known of; we knew nothing at all about the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been with the Council four years—at the time Mr. Hemsley retired I think the prisoner tendered his resignation—he wanted to be Chief Clerk, and I told him at once that there would be no chance of his obtaining the clerkship, but there might be a chance of making another office by dividing the accounts from the general business of the clerks' office, and we proposed to make him accounts clerk at practically the same salary—he did not send in a formal application, but he gave us to understand that he would like the clerkship—it was then that he tendered his resignation and we offered him the position of accounts clerk, which he took—he had a great deal to do between 1880 and 1903, but of course the work varied with the attendance of the Clerk, and all the votes were under his control—he had to attend the committee meetings and generally look after the whole office—the population of Acton has been nearly doubled by the Tube and the electric trams—the prisoner had to look after the sundry payments account, the cemetery accounts, the private roads, the allotments and the petty cash accounts—I cannot tell you where he put all the cash; that is a matter with which I have nothing to do—I presume there was only one cash box in which all the money that was paid was put for the time being—the South Western Railway cheques have receipts attached to them—I do not suggest that the receipt books, from which the receipts would be taken, or the counterfoils have been tampered with—I do not wish to be pressed as to whether there are any other discrepancies other than those represented by the £148, which the prisoner is alleged to have embezzled, because I have my own opinion—I do not wish to import anything further into the case than what is already in the indictment—I do not know anything about when Walter Hill &amp; Company's cheques were sent—the prisoner would probably have £20,000 or £30,000 pass through his hands in the course of a year.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> His work was heavy before 1903, but he never made any complaint as far as we know—I could get from the official records what month of 1903 the prisoner's position was altered to that of accounts clerk.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020041"/>
               <p>consequence of what I discovered with regard to that year, I afterwards extended my investigations back to 1895, with regard to these particular items of £20 and rents; it would have been impossible to examine the whole accounts—this is a book which they call the Sundry Deposits, July, 1895, being a cash book for receipts (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—between June 19th and July 6th it appears from this book that various sums had been received, amount<lb/>in to £21 2s. 2d., so that there would be that amount to pay in—there is one amount of £12, and one of £3, but all the rest of them are under £1; there is no mention of the London &amp; South Western Railway Com<lb/>pany's cheque, either in that or any other book—the £21 2s. 2d. was paid into the bank on July 6th—if it were paid in by means of the London &amp; South Western Railway Company's cheque for £20 and £1 2s. 2d. in cash, the result would be that the person paying it in would be in a position to abstract £20 from the sums received for these small receipts and there would be a loss to the Council of that amount; the railway company's cheque had nothing to do with these small receipts at all—on February 3rd, 1899, it appears from this book that between January 9th and February 1st they had accumulated to £50 6s. 7d., made up of a number of different payments, and not containing any sum of £20, and upon February 3rd that amount was paid into the bank by the help of the London &amp; South Western Railway Company's cheque for £20 and £5 in cash—the cheque for £20 is not entered in the books as having been received, and there is no trace of it anywhere—the effect of that would be the same as in the last instance—on January 14th, 1898, it appears that £49 1s. 1d. had been received, made up of various amounts—there is no amount there of £20 from the London &amp; South Western Railway Company—that sum was paid into the bank by means of the railway company's cheque and other amounts—the result would be the same as in the other oases—that cheque for £20 is not entered anywhere as having been received—on July 8th, 1898, there was a sum of £33 14s. to be paid in, made up of a number of rather small amounts, the largest being for eight guineas—there is no cheque for £20 from the railway company either there or in any other book, and if that cheque were used to help make up the £3314s., the result would be exactly the same—on July 4th, 1899, there was £56 5s. to be paid in, and again the cheque for £20 forms part of that—on December 30th, 1899, there was £36 1s. 6d. to be paid in, which was paid in with the help of a cheque for £13 18s. 8d. from Walter Hill &amp; Co., which is not entered as having been received—there is a cheque for £20 from the London &amp; South Western Railway Company in that December that is properly accounted for, and there is no charge as to that—the result of that would be that this particular sum paid in would be deficient to the amount of £13 18s. 8d.—on November 8th, 1902, there is £33 7s. to be paid in to Cemeteries Account, the biggest item of which is £7 17s. 6d.—that contains no mention of a cheque for £15 from Walter Hill &amp; Co.—of course that cheque would have nothing to do with Cemeteries Account—it was used to help pay in that sum of £33 7s.—the £15 cheque is not entered in the Sundry Deposits Book, where it ought to have been, or anywhere else, except afterwards in the Rents Ledger—that would have the result of en<lb/>abling somebody to appropriate £15 in cash.</p>

Then he said he arrested Neville and he let him go when he saw me fourteen or fifteen yards away taking the prosecutor away. I cannot tell where he could see me taking the prosecutor away, when the prosecutor was booking the charge at the time at Commercial Street police station against Gregory. On the other hand, he said before he arrested me that he had not seen me before only while I was taking the prosecutor away. Then in the evidence at this Court last week he said I had a light jacket on, and he had not seen me previous to the arrest and I had this coat on when I was arrested. The prosecutor was sup<lb/>posed to lose 4s. or 5s., and when charged at the station I had one penny found on me. I plead not guilty."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Neville's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> I think this is a great mis<lb/>take on the constable's part.

                  </hi>. I am a general shopkeeper, of 80, Bramcote Road. South Bermondsey—I had a stable to let and on March 24th I put an advertisement in a newspaper—on the same evening McMinn and a tall man came to see me—I let them the stable at 3s. 6d. a week—a horse was brought to the stable the same night—the two men came daily to see the horse, McMinn especially—I made a complaint that the horse kicked,</p>

               <p>and told them there would have to be some alteration—they told me they would take the horse away and bring a pony and cart in its place, and that the horse would be taken to another stable, and the pony would be very quiet—they gave me no notice they were going to leave—I had no rent from them, only 2s. deposit—McMinn took the horse away—I thought he was going to take it out for a run—the horse was there one week.</p>

I am a packer by trade, and live at 29, Cowley Road, Brixton—I have a stable there which I let on March 28th to McMinn, at 5s. a week rent—he paid a deposit of 2s. 6d. and gave me the name of Francis—I did not see the horse in the stable before Saturday. April 1st—it was a black one, with white on the forehead, nose and heels—I have seen it since—it is the same horse—I saw later on, a bill offering a reward, and in consequence I communicated with Mr. Hearn—the latter's manager came with an inspector to my place and looked through the window of the stable and saw that it was their horse, so I gave them per<lb/>mission to burst open the stable door—we went in—while there McMinn came in to feed the horse and the inspector arrested him.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of the last witness—on March 28th McMinn and a tall man not in custody, called to see our stable—they asked about the rent, and were told 6s. a week—they said some<lb/>thing about 5s.—they asked when they could see my husband—I told them at 7 o'clock that night—McMinn came that night—I did not hear what took place—on April 5th Smith came about 4 p.m.—I opened the door to him—I had not seen him before—he asked me if I had seen the boy—I said, "Yes"—he asked if he had given me any<lb/>thing—I said, "No"—he asked if the horse was in the stable—I said, "Yes, where do you think it would be?"—at that time McMinn was in custody—Smith further said, "The governor is rather anxious about the boy"—I said, "If you see your governor you might tell him I want him"—I asked him to call the next night—being a bit suspicious, I put my hat and coat on and followed him and saw him meet the tall man—about 10.30 the same night Smith came down and tried the stable gate—I was standing there with Crocker and my husband—the detective arrested Smith.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspector, City</hi>). On April 5th, from information received, I went with Mr. Hearn's foreman, Mr. Savage, and two detec<lb/>tives to 29, Cowley Road, Brixton—we went to the stable in the rear of the house—I saw the horse which was identified by Mr. Hearn—I forced the door open, went into the stable and concealed myself—about 10.45 McMinn entered—I confronted him, and asked him who he was—he said he had come to look after the horse—I said, "Yes, whose horse is it?"—he said, "The governor's"—I said, "Who is your governor?"—he said, "Mr. Brown"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where did he sleep last night?"—he said, "I don't know; he sleeps anywhere where he can"—I said, "Where did he sleep the night before?"—he said, "Pearce's, John Street, Clerken-well"—I said, "Where is your address?"—he said, "Coutts Road, Bow"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Jack Brown"—I asked him where he got the horse from—he said, "My brother gave it me to fetch round here from the Elephant and Castle"—I then took him to Bridewell police station, where he was charged—on entering the stable I found concealed in the manger this chisel in a sheet of newspaper—it is not Savage's—at the station where the prisoner was searched we found on him this button-hook which is <hi rend="italic">construed</hi> into a picklock—I subse<lb/>quently saw Smith brought in by Crocker—they were both charged with being concerned together in stealing and receiving this horse, buggy and whip—they made no reply—at the station McMinn gave his correct name and address, but he had previously said his name was Jack Brown—Smith gave no address.</p>
               <p>

On April 15th, about 3 a.m., I was on duty in Milner's Mews, Paddington—I saw Silver—he came running towards me—he was very excited, perspiring, out of breath, and had no hat on—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "Nothing, I am only going to the coffee stall to get a cup of coffee"—I asked him what was the matter, where he lived, and where his hat was—he replied, "I have left it on the bed while I ran out, as I was in a hurry. I live in Hall Place"—where I met him was about 500 yards from St. John's Wood Road—I said, "You would not be in that condition with running so short a distance and you would not take such a roundabout way as this to get to the coffee stall in Earl Street"—he replied, "I always come this way"—I said, "I think there is something wrong and you will have to accom<lb/>pany me to Edgware Road to see if there is anyone after you"—we went into Edgware Road and stayed there a few minutes—as no one came up I allowed him to go, keeping observation on him—from information received about three minutes later, I ran in the direction he had taken and took him into custody—he was just leaving the coffee stall—he was still without a hat—I took him back to Mrs. Du Croz's house—the prisoner was seen by her—she said, "I think that is one of them"—he was then taken to the station.</p>

I do not know, I only wanted my cheques back—there was an interview at the Royal Hotel, Cardiff, I think, in September—I cannot swear that it was not August 25th—at that interview I simply said I wanted my cheques back, and I thought you would cancel the arrangement for shares, because I found the company was not in the flourishing condition you said it was—Mr. Payne advised me to stop the cheque because I could not get the shares—I am not the prosecutor in this case, I am only a witness—I cannot state who started this prosecu<lb/>tion; I am subpoenaed to come here by the King—I do not know who has the control of the Land Dealers' Association at present.</p>

               <p>ham did not put any money in the company that I know of—I drew no I salary, I drew commission, the others drew salaries, because they were inside the company, I was outside—when Burleigh died we made up our minds to sell the London Landed Estates Company to a new company which was registered on January 3rd, and called the Land Dealers' Associa<lb/>tion—the price was 6,000 fully-paid-up £1 shares, which were allotted to the Estates Company and its nominees—I signed that contract (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) as one of the vendors—no money passed—the company was sold for shares—the secretary or managing director would send out the notices, and not I, because I was outside—it was the secretary's duty to send the notices—I mean Talbot—everyone connected with the company would have a notice—if Burleigh's executors say they never received such notice I should be surprised—of the 6,000 shares I had 1,003—I had been working without remuneration in this business some con<lb/>siderable time—I have not the figures, but I believe Burleigh's executors got 1,500 shares and Rackham and Talbot 1,711—the members of the Land Dealers' Association were Burleigh, two clerks, Mr. and Mrs. Talbot, Mr. and Mrs. Rackham; I came in afterwards—I was agent—I was ad<lb/>mitted one of the managers after the purchase of the estates—I had no qualification as manager—after Burleigh died his executors wrote for information, and as to whether Burleigh had any money in the London Landed Estates, I believe, but I was not a director during Burleigh's time—I was a director when he died in September, 1901—the object of selling to a new company was that more capital was required, because the business had extended, the estates had developed, a number of plotted portions had been sold, and there were many contracts on each estate—more money was brought in—there were several shareholders—I did not bring in any, nor did Rackham or Talbot, but we were all officers of the company—we took three-fourths of the shares as a guarantee; it was more as a partnership—the capital being brought in, we found the experience, and developed and sold the estates—the shares were a division of profits on the sale of the old company—I do not know that it was these dealings the Court of Chancery was asked to investigate—I believe you made charges against the company as soon as your scheme was interfered with for taking the money, but nothing came up till that time—whatever we were charged with, the injunction was dismissed—[<hi rend="italic">The writ issued December</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th, which was to prevent the witness and executors from dealing with shares, and for an account, was produced</hi>]—Austin's and Boaler's names have been added since I left the company—I do not know what arrangement was made with Burleigh; I know he received interest—one sum of £25 I found in the cash book when I was asked at Bow Street—the books show when it was, and they are properly kept, but I was, not the secretary—I believe Burleigh's executors asked for information, but the correspondence did not come to my hands, because I was outside the office—what money there was, Burleigh put into the company—I took no steps to give information, because my duties were outside the office—I was not a director when the estates were purchased, nor when Burleigh advanced money—I was afterwards—I received my information</p>

               <p>from Talbot or Rackham—I heard from time to time how the company was progressing, and when a new estate was to be purchased, but my duties were away in the country—I know the executors said they wanted money and not shares—Burleigh had lent about £1,080—then the pro<lb/>perty which his money had bought was sold to a new company and his executors were offered a fourth of the shares—they got nothing—I was paid in founders' shares, which, unfortunately, were worth nothing—I was only paid a commission on plots I sold—I received £2 a week as advances against commission—I sold plots as an agent—my accounts were properly vouched—I do not admit that it was found that I had drawn in advances more than my commission came to—by forming the new company on January 3rd, 1902, £400 to £500 capital was introduced—no prospectus was issued—one was printed—the new company was not advertised—I do not know that the prospectus was ever used—I saw it afterwards—allotment was to be made after 1,000 £1 shares had been subscribed for—I think 400 or 500 were subscribed for before we went to allotment—applications were made for shares at different dates, but I do not know about them, because I did not receive the applications—I attended the directors' meeting—a register was kept—I cannot answer is to what applications were made from memory—I am sure there were more than 200 shares applied for before allotments, which would be made at any date when shares were applied for—At field's was one of the earliest applications—I was not present at every allotment; it was not necessary, and I was on the estates in the country—if a cheque for £24 10s. was sent to Burleigh it would be recorded in the cash book—interest was paid—many cheques were drawn—I do not know how many were sent to Burleigh—there were several transactions between Burleigh's executors and the company, they printed the Articles of Association, plans and contracts of the company, and cheques were sent in payment of accounts as well as for interest—Talbot made secret profits by purchasing the plots and selling them to the company at an enhanced price—I bought plots and sold them at a profit—having bought them, they were mine to sell, and there<lb/>fore I was not making secret profits—I was not a director, but an agent—Talbot made £1,350 out of the last estate, £350 in cash and £1,000 by a bogus mortgage—he made £625 secret profit out of the purchase of three estates, and I got nothing—the bogus mortgage was subsequently can<lb/>celled—it was not paid—I introduced Miss Sands, who bought two plots from me in the first instance on the Pines Estate at £70 and £35—you became connected with the Land Dealers' Association on July 13th, 1904—you agreed to bring in new capital—you insisted on a balance sheet—one was prepared for use in the office—the directors were there—you took it away and had it typed—it was not false—it set out the position of the company as stated in my letter to you—it was not audited, but it was substantially accurate—this is my letter to you of June 28th, 1904, enclos<lb/>ing this list of plots, the amount of purchase money, including interest at 3 per cent., the amount received and the balance to be received—the balance shown was £3,455 instead of £1,833—roughly, £10 was due for interest—there were two mortgages—the amount was £4,050—Rutter was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Rising Sun at Great Scotland Yard—between 6 and 7 p.m. on December 24th Goddard, whom I have known for thirteen years, came to my house and asked me if I had a turkey for sale—I said, "Yes, I have"—I brought and showed him one and asked him 12s. for it—he offered me 11s., which I accepted—he also had a bottle of Three Star brandy, Martell's, a bottle of Black and White whisky, a bottle of gin, and a bottle of port, the total amount coming to £1 7s.—I packed it up and have it to him, and in return he handed me this cheque for £10 (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 1)—I murmured very much at taking a cheque, and he said it was for wages and work done, and produced this letter (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 3), which I wanted to keep, but he would not allow me to—I let him have the goods and £8 13s. change out of the cheque—I took it up to the National &amp; Provincial Bank myself on the Tuesday morning, it being an open cheque—it was returned to me marked "R.D."—I took it to the bank on several occasions, but I never got anything for it—I went on December 29th to the Avenue Theatre, saw</p>

               <p>Goddard and told him what had happened about the cheque—on one occasion he referred me to his solicitor, Mr. Pike, in Craven Street—I got this letter from Goddard [<hi rend="italic">Asking for leniency till Wednesday, January</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd, on which date the cheque would be met, and stating that Seymour expected a considerable amount of money which was being delayed by legal formalities</hi>]—after that I presented the cheque on several occasions, but did not get anything for it—I saw Goddard on several occasions, and he said once that he would <hi rend="italic">set the matter alight</hi>, meaning, "Go on and do your worst"—the reason that induced me to part with my goods was on account of the letter, and that I believed that the cheque was a good one.</p>

During the thirteen years that I have known Goddard he has been very seldom a customer of mine—I cannot say whether for the last two years he has been an electrician at the Avenue Theatre—I met him as a customer before I took the Rising Sun—there was no occasion for his keeping away from me—when he came in I was arranging the Christmas hampers for a Goose Club, and he asked me whether I had a turkey to spare—when I gave evidence at the Police Court on April 1st I thought it was about 10.15 p.m. that he came in—I know it would be late, because I should not have known whether I had a bird left from the hampers—when I was at the Police Court I did not have the letter of December 24th, 1904, which Goddard showed me, saying, "Dear Sir,—Enclosed please find cheque for £10 salary and account in settlement to date, Yours faithfully, H. A. Grant Seymour," so I could not have produced it—I meant to have referred to it on April 1st, but I did not—I was recalled on April 8th to produce it—when I saw Goddard about the cheque not being cashed he said, "I will see Mr. Grant Seymour about it."</p>

               <p>was a member of the Young Men's Christian Association, 125, Barking Road—I have known the prisoner since last July—he came first to my house to ask about my son helping him in his mission—my son had given him money weekly—the prisoner often had meals at our house, sometimes four or five times a week—he told me that he was very poor, and that he was working his mission without any salary—about November last there was great destitution in our neighbourhood—my husband and sot both fell out of work—I had heard of Mr. Speyer—at my request my brother wrote to Mr. Speyer for assistance—in consequence, a gentle<lb/>man called upon us and relieved our immediate wants—on Christmas Eve he gave us a sovereign and paid a 16s. bill we owed at a grocer's—the prisoner never told us he had received £5 on our behalf—on December 31st he came and said he had had some money given to him for people in distress, that we had been good to him, and he would give me a sovereign and would send it by my son, which he did—my son gave it to me—the following Saturday night I received a further two half-sovereigns from my son, who said the prisoner had given it to him for me—our distress continued right on through January, February and March—at the end of January we had a distress put into the house—I told the prisoner of this, and asked him if he could borrow a sovereign for me and I would repay it—he said he could not borrowany money; the relief fund was closed, but he would lend me 2s. out of his own pocket—I told him he was as poor as we were, and I could not think of taking it—I received no more money from him except the £2.</p>

I live at 25, Cantwell Road, Shooter's Hill, and work for the Charity Organisation Society—from instructions received I went on April 3rd to the prisoner's house—he was not at home—I made an appointment for the next day and went there then—I saw him and said, "I have come to see you in reference to receipts that you have received for money that has been sent on to you by Mr. Speyer"—he said he had not got them, and it would take him two days to find them—he then said, "I have kept out of the money that Mr. Speyer sent to me, 15s."—he did not then say how much he had received, but I had in my possession his receipt for £5—I asked him why he had kept 15s.—I said, "If you had sent on the whole of the money you would have prevented that poor family from losing their home"—he said, "I have been keeping the young man in food and he has broken a window, and I kept the 15s. to cover that expense"—I told him he had no right to keep money that was sent to him for a specific object, he ought to have paid it over at once—he said, "Well, I have no means of living; I have no salary except the money that I get from friends. How am I to exist if I don't get money in this kind of way?"—I said, "You had no right to take the money at all unless you got permission from the donor"—I said further, "Will you show me those receipts or will you not?"—he went upstairs and in about ten minutes came down with this receipt—I said I had been told there were two receipts, one for £1 and the other for £1 5s.—he said, "I have no other but that receipt"—I looked at it and said to him, "Why, the figures are of a different colour to the body of the receipt; how is this?"—he said he did not know—I said, "It appears to me that it has been tampered with, the ink that you have written the figures with; you have done it after the body of the receipt has been written"—he denied doing so—he told me he had paid over to the family the whole of the amount he had received except 15s.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). I am stationed at Canning Town—on April 18th I received a warrant for the prisoner's arrest, which I executed that day—I said to him, "I am a police officer and I shall arrest you on a warrant for being entrusted with certain property, to wit, the sum of £5 in money, in order that you might pay the same to a certain person, to wit, Olaf Johansen, did fraudulently convert part of it, to wit, the sum of £2 15s. to your own use and benefit, contrary to the Larceny Act, 1901"—he replied, "I don't know Littlejohns, nor do I know Edward Johansen"—I took him to the station, where he was searched and a letter, a receipt and a pocket book were found on him—the letter is signed by Littlejohns, and the receipt is the one produced here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I say that I received the cheque. I hadn't time to cash it when I received it. My wife said to me, 'See if you can get something for them Christmas.' I took the cheque to the Estate Office. When I first went the agent was not in, and when I went the second time it was too late to cash the cheque. My reason for taking it there was because it was crossed. The agent asked me if he could help me by lending me a sum. I said, 'Thank you very much; I should be glad of £1.' He gave me £1. That was on Christmas Eve, The witness for the prosecution, Christopher Johansen came to my house in the evening, and I gave him the £1, I intended taking him into the City the following Monday, so that I might take him to an optician's for a pair of spectacles he was badly it need of. The thought did not occur to me that it was Bank Holiday on the Monday, so when the shops were open again I took him to Mr. Manhood's. Mr. Manhood was not in, and we were to leave the spectacles, and Mr. Manhood would see that they were done properly. I had on the'27th given Christopher Johansen £1. On the day that he went for his glasses I gave him 5s., and he came back in the evening and brought me 6d. change from the 5s. I told him to put that into his pocket. On December 31st I gave him another £1. He was in my room and I said,' You may an well sign a receipt for the money you have received.' He said, 'All right.' He signed the receipt marked 'H.' I had only one kind of ink in the house. I had taken some and thinned it for the purpose of, my stylo<lb/>graphic pen. I had no stylo ink in the house. The receipt was written with that pen and signed with it. The ink was on my desk in a vessel, and of course it was open ink and it was thick. It was the same ink, but I didn't doctor it. My little girl called me to say 'Good-night' to her after the witness had signed the receipt. I left him in the room whilst I went. I thought no more about the receipt until the morning. In the morning I picked the receipt up. The only difference in the receipt when I made it out was that with my stylo pen I made the figures thicker than the writing. The figures were not altered. In the morning I noticed that they were darker than when I left them. They could not have been touched with the stylo pen; that was in my pocket all night. I have said nothing about this. I merely admitted that I had made the figures' thicker</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020078"/>
               <p>than the writing; but I declare that the figures had not been altered by anyone. Through the whisperings I knew that the witness, Mrs. Johansen, was terribly set against me. I saw that they were determined to upset me. I was slandered. I hadn't any money to prosecute, and to tell the truth, I wanted this prosecution to come. I wished to be prosecuted so that the truth might come out. This hatred of Mrs. Johansen's, dates from the time when I would not allow her to stay at my house all night; and so, seeing the ink was of a darker colour I at once knew that it had been used from the ink-well which was on my table, and of course I had only one conclusion to come to, and that it had been used. The figures had been made thicker and darker with an ordinary writing pen for the sake of bringing evidence against me. I think I can prove by witnesses that perjury is in the case through and through. Mrs. Johansen told me that her husband had turned her out of the house and also the man who came with her. She told me this in the presence of my wife. I didn't know what to say, and while we were talking the matter over, the son came down and told his mother that his father had gone to sleep. I sent Mrs. Johansen home and the man stayed in my house all night. My life has been threatened through these two."</p>

I am married, and live at 67, Vincent Street, Canning Town—on the evening of Saturday, March 25th, I went into the Pitt's Head with Mrs. Cox—the prisoner came in with a Mrs. Connor—we were not drinking with them—some time after the prisoner came in the deceased came in with her little boy—me and Mrs. Cox had two glasses of ale—the deceased called for two glasses of ale—she gave one to someone in the bar, but I do not know who, and had one herself—I had lent her 1s. on the Friday night, and 3d. on the Saturday morning—I thought she put 1s. on the counter, but it was a sovereign—I put my hand on her shoulder and said, "Have you forgotten me to-day?"—she said, "No, I have not, old girl"—she called for two glasses of porter and handed me one—I said, "You know I cannot drink the Pitt's Head beer "—it is not bad beer, but it does not suit me—she said, "You have my ale and I will have your beer"—she took the ale off the counter and put it between me and Mrs. Cox, and said, "I have drunk out of it, but you won't mind"—I said, "No"—she said,. "It won't poison you"—she took the glass of porter off the counter and said, "Never mind, I am only an old whore after all"—the prisoner turned round and struck her in her face twice—I cannot say if the deceased had spoken to the prisoner before that—the blows were quick—the deceased said, "Oh," and down she went on the floor—I did not know the prisoner very well except to pass the time of day—I knew the deceased very well—the prisoner always seemed to be very much against the deceased, but I cannot say why.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 12, Ford's Market, Canning Town—at 6.15 p.m. on Saturday, March 25th, I was called to 79, Vincent Street, where I found lying in bed the body of a woman evidently quite recently dead—on the Monday morning I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found an old bruise over one eye—on the outside of the eye I found a small bruise on the lid running up to the edge of the bone and not quite so large as a sixpence and very slightly dis<lb/>coloured—above that there were a few scratches and the skin very slightly swollen—there was also another injury, evidently a bruise, between the base of the thumb and the forefinger of one hand—there were no other signs of external injury except an old scar at the back of the neck—on opening the skull I found on the under surface of the scalp near the pole of the head a bruise slightly larger than a sixpence, evidently recent, but it could not be seen from the outer surface of the scalp—on taking off the skull cap I found the membranes of the brain bulging, and on opening them I found the space between the membranes and the surface of the brain filled with a moist clot of semi-fluid blood, which had extended down to the opening of the brain—on opening the chest I found the lungs both showed signs of old bronchitis—there were blood clots in the chambers of the heart, but there were no signs of disease, and the valves could do their work perfectly—the kidneys and liver were free from disease, but the liver was slightly enlarged—the stomach was practically empty except for a small quantity of fluid—death had taken place through compression of the vital centres in the brain—the compression was due to haemorrhage on to the surface of the brain—the haemorrhage was due to the rupture of one of the branches of the basilary artery, and was due to violence,</p>

               <p>do you mean by passing this?"—the prisoner said, "What is wrong with the shilling?"—Mr. Smith said, "You must know it is bad"—the prisoner asked what was going to be done with it, and Mr. Smith said he intended to keep it—the prisoner said no more, but took the two glasses of ale over to the table in the public bar, and then came back and paid for them with two pennies—he then left the house—about 8.30 the next evening he came into the bar and called for a glass of ale—I called the manager's attention to him and a detective was sent for—the detective came and the prisoner was given into his custody—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man I served on those two occasions.</p>

I never heard anything about any bad money. I was in there last night.

               <p>—I said to him, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I have come here for a <hi rend="italic">chum</hi> of mine"—I told him that I should take him into custody, to which he made no reply—he was not drunk at the time—I took him outside, when he became very violent and tried to get away—I got him about 150 yards along the road, and as he was still struggling I called upon a private person for assistance—he assisted me until White kicked him. When he let go—White then slipped his coat and his neckerchief that I had hold of him by, struck me a severe blow in the stomach, which caused me to vomit, and then got away—after a while I blew my whistle and gave chase with two other constables—after that I returned to the house and went through it with the prosecutor—it was in great disorder—under the dresser where White had been concealed there was a basket with vegetables, amongst which I found this watch and chain—on searching White at the police station I found 3s. in silver, 4 1/2 d. bronze, five pawntickets and a black handkerchief.</p>

When he (Brown) opened the door I said, 'Brown, is it you?' He said, 'Yes, what do you want?' I said, 'Only a friend of yours.' Brown walked back into the house and we followed him and went into the kitchen. I will not say I did not assault Police-Constable Buckman, but I did not assault Police-Constable buckman"—Maltby said, "I went to the house with White, because I wanted the 2s. back that Brown's wife robbed me of on Sunday, the 16th instant, at Customs House. Brown could not be possessed of 30s., as he has done no work for six months to my knowledge."</p>

I am an oil and colour merchant, at 44, London Street, Greenwich—34, High Street, Deptford, is one of my branches, and has been managed for me for three years up to March 27th by Thomas Farrow—he had been in my father's service and mine for twenty-four years—I do not know if he was about seventy years of age—he and his wife were the only occupants of the shop—there was only one shop assistant, and his name was Jones—it was an ordinary oil and colour shop—the hours of business were from 8 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.—persons wanting to buy paints or colours might call at the shop out of business hours in the morning; it is a common practice with oil and colour shops—painters and decorators would call at that time—I always called at the shop on Mondays, sometime before mid-day, when I received from Mr. Farrow the takings of the previous week—he was at liberty to make deductions for out-of-pocket expenses and his wages, and he handed me the balance—it was always handed to me in money—towards the end of March the net takings would be £12 or £13 a week—the money was handed to me over the counter in the shop, done up in a little brown paper parcel—it must have taken place while customers were in the shop, but they would not notice it, because it was passed quietly—on Monday, March 27th, a detective came to Greenwich and took me to the shop, where I saw Farrow lying dead in the shop parlour.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police, practising at 327, New Cross Road—shortly after 9.30 a.m. on March 27th I went to 34, High Street, Deptford, and saw Thomas Farrow lying dead in the parlour—I saw him at 9.50—he had been dead about an hour—I went upstairs and saw Mrs. Farrow—she was almost unconscious, suffering from shock and severely injured in her head—I sent her to the Seamen's Hospital, where she died on Friday, March 31st—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the body of Thomas Farrow on the 28th—I found a number of severe injuries on his head—there was a wound above his right eyebrow—that did not cause fracture of the bone—there was another wound on the right side of his nose, extending to the right side of his face, tearing away part of the cartilage—about 3 inches above the top of his right ear there was a large contused scalp wound—on the left side of his head, about 3 inches above his left ear, there was an exactly similar wound, and about 1 inch behind his left ear there was an incised wound with sharp cut edges, somewhat circular in shape and penetrating down to the bone—above that there was a triangular wound, also going down to the skull; also some bruising at the back of the skull—on remov<lb/>ing the scalp I found the bone had been fractured in one place—it was a comminuted fracture, one in which the bone was broken into several pieces at one particular place—that was in the region of the temple in front of the ear—the cheek bone was also fractured on the right side—it was further round than the wound by the nose—there had been haemor<lb/>rhage from the blood vessels of the brain—apart from the injuries the body was in a healthy, well-preserved state—death was due to shock and haemorrhage, the direct result of the injuries—in my judgment there were about six blows—the, major portion of them must have been inflicted with a heavy and blunt instrument, such as a bar or a flat steel weapon 1 inch or 2 inches in width and of some considerable length—I was present</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspector R.</hi>) About 9.10 a.m. on March 27th I went to 34, High Street, Deptford, and into the bedroom upstairs, where I saw Crutchett—I saw this cash box—I did not touch it, neither did Crutchett while I was there—I picked up the 6d. and a penny which were on the floor—I examined the room—hanging over the foot of the bedstead was a woman's skirt, in the pocket of which I found two purses, one containing 5s. 6d., and the other £6 10s.—on a little dressing table I found a box containing some brooches, a silver watch and things of that sort—I also found this mask (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) of some black material—the cash box remained in the bedroom until the Assistant-Commissioner and other officers came—I gave orders that it should not be moved or touched by anybody—downstairs in the shop parlour I saw two small pieces of black material (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they were on the floor in the shop parlour—I also saw a mask there and I think the pieces came out of the holes in it—they appeared to be made on the same material—on the morning of April 3rd</p>

               <p>I was in High Street, Deptford, when I saw Albert Ernest Stratton—I said to him," What is your name?"—he said, "Stratton"—I took hold of his right arm and said, "Come along"—we walked towards Blackheath Road police station, and on the way I said, "I am an inspector of police and you must consider yourself in custody for being concerned with your brother Alfred in the wilful murder of Mr. and Mrs. Farrow at 34, High Street, Deptford, and stealing £13 in money"—he said, "Is that all?—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Thanks"—I took him to Blackheath Road police station, where he was seen by Chief Inspector Fox—he was searched and two or three shillings were found upon him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). On the morning of March 27th I went to this shop in High Street, Deptford, and on April 2nd I gave some directions as to the arrest of the prisoners—that night I saw Alfred at Blackheath Road police station, and told him who I was and what the charge against him would be—he said, "What evidence have you against me?"—I said, "Do you wish to know? If so, I may tell you"—he said, "I do wish to know"—I said, "A milkman and his boy saw you and another man come out of the shop at 7.30 in the morning. A young woman who knows you saw you and another man running from the top of High Street across New Cross Road towards Wilson Street at about the same time"—he appeared to be about to speak, and I told him I was not asking him to say anything, but I did not want to prevent him from saying anything—he said, "I was in bed until 9.15 with Miss Annie Cromarty at 23, Brookmill Road"—I read that over to him—he signed it and was de<lb/>tained—on the morning of April 3rd, at Blackheath Road police station, I saw Albert—I told him who I was and what the charge against him would be—he said, "All right"—the Assistant-Commissioner pointed out the finger prints on the inner tray of the cash box, and I saw Sergeant Deacon take possession of it—I arrived there with the Assistant-Commissioner and Deacon about 11.30.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROOTH</hi>. I first saw Cromarty on Sunday night, April 2nd, about an hour after Alfred's arrest—I sent several officers out to find her—she was brought to the station by Gall and Allford—I was anxious to get a statement from her—I was told she came willingly to the station, but I had told the officers that if she did not come willingly she was to be brought—she was taken into the superintendent's room—I was never left alone with her; Chief Inspector Kitch was with me—he was present before the Magistrate, but was not called—I put questions to Cromarty—I was anxious to get the truth—I had before me a statement made by Alfred, that he had been sleeping that night at this house in Brookmill Road—I knew that to be untrue before I saw Cromarty, but there was an object in seeing her; we got a lot of evidence from her—long before I had Alfred's statement I had given directions to get him and Cromarty and not let them speak to each other—when I was told that they had got him, but not her, I said, "Go and get her"—I sent out about a dozen officers—I examined her in the same way as the other witnesses—I did not threaten them, I had no occasion to—at the inquest the prisoners suggested that I had threatened Cromarty and in a way she acquiesced—I bind myself to the accuracy of that statement, that it was in answer to the prisoners' questions—I was there and heard it—I have not seen the Coroner's depositions—I have seen the newspaper reports—the Coroner did not put in writing what the prisoner said—I was looking at the Coroner and could see he was doing very little writing—I do not know if he put down, "The police threatened to keep me if I did not speak the truth"—the deposition was not read aloud—I do not remember Cromarty saying to the Coroner, "The police threatened to keep me there and to tell my parents"—there was a good deal of controversy, and the Coroner had to stop the prisoner putting questions into her mouth and suggesting the answer—I do not suggest that the Coroner wrote down on the depositions anything that Cromarty did not say in answer to the questions put by the prisoner—the prisoners were not represented by a solicitor the first day—one was there a little while the second day—I did not press Cromarty, and any statement which she made was not extracted by me—I had to get all the evidence I could—it was my duty to do so—when Cromarty heard that we had found money on Alfred she seemed quite prepared to tell the whole truth, because she seemed to think he had deceived her—I suggest that she said he had deceived her about the money—that did not occur before the Coroner—it was desirable that I should extract any statement truthfully and by fair means—I think the statement I made to Alfred when I arrested him was a fair and proper one—he had not been confronted with the milkman and the boy then, and they had not identified him, but I had had a description from them—when the milkman and the boy were con<lb/>fronted with him they did not identify him—I think I am right in saying they "did not" instead of "could not."</p>

Don't Bay anything to him, I shall not say anything until I can see there is no chance, and then—"—he stopped speaking and started walking round the cell—he came back to the door, and said, "I do not want to get strung up. He has never done any work in his life, only about a month, and then they tried to put that Brixton job on him, but they found out at the time he was at work.

                  </hi>. I lived at 23, Brookmill Road, Deptford, for about six weeks—I left on Friday, March 31st—I occupied the downstars front room—the street comes up to the window—Alfred Stratton occupied the room with me—I had been living with him for about twelve months—I knew Albert Stratton as <hi rend="italic">Ockney</hi>—I knew he was Alfred's brother—I have never seen or heard <hi rend="italic">Ockney</hi> in the night time when I have been in bed—some<lb/>body came to my window when I was in bed—I do not know whom—I did not hear any voices outside—Alf spoke to the person who came to the window—that was only on one occasion—I understand that I have sworn to tell the whole truth—I do not know what the occasion was on which I heard Alf speak to someone outside—they never said anything to me, only that Alf was to go out—it was on a Sunday night, as the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Farrow was on the Monday—that night, between and 10, Alfred and I had a quarrel, and I had a black eye—some neighbours came into my room, Mrs. Bayne and Mrs. Chatfield—I knew Mrs. Bayne as Mrs. Wood—they came into my room about 9.15, and stayed a little time—they were going away, but I called them back, and they stayed until 12—Alfred was there when they came in—he stayed for a little time, when I asked him to go out—he did so and came back about 12—Mrs. Chatfield and Mrs. Bayne were there then—I said good-night to them, and they went upstairs to bed—Alfred and I went to bed—I went to sleep—the next thing I remember was about 12, or shortly after, when a tap came at the window, and Alfred got up—he pulled the blind aside and spoke to the person at, the window—he said, "Shall we go out to-night, or leave it for another night?"—I did not hear whether there was any reply—I am not positive whether Alfred went out or not, because I laid down again and took no more notice—when Alfred had come to bed that night he had undressed—I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him dress again—I made a statement before—I spoke the truth then, as far as I could remember—when I woke in the morning Alfred was at the bedroom door dressed—I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him dress—I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him get up—you see, I had it in the eye, and I did not remember hardly any thing—I have never known Alfred leave that room otherwise than by the door—you can get in and out at the window to the street—I know that because I have done it—I have seen Alfred do it—the last time was about a week before the murder; that was about 2 a.m.—Alfred did not get out of the window; he got in and got me in—on the morning of the day that the murder took place I do not remember what happened at the window—I just remember that he got up to the window and spoke—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020100"/>
               <p>I laid down and went to sleep—I saw him at 9.15, and asked him the time—he said it was 9.15—he was then dressed—he was inside my room with the door shut—I did not see him come in—I did not say before the Magistrate that I saw him get up and dress and go out—he did not get up; he sat up on the bed and spoke to someone at the window—there was a light burning in the room—we always keep a light at night—I said before the Magistrate that; at 9.15 he was dressed in a blue coat and vest, a black sort of <hi rend="italic">greeny</hi> trousers, and brown boots—I do not remember saying before the Magistrate, "I had not been long awake, but so far as I know that was the first time he came into the house after going out"—on the Sunday before the murder I had no money—I had not asked Alfred for any—he did not tell me whether he had any—I told the Magistrate that I had asked him for money, and he said he had only got 2d., on the Sunday, a week after the murder—I did not ask him for any money on the Sunday before the murder—on that day we had not any food or firing in the house, because I had no money to get any—on the Monday morning when Alfred came in I was in bed—he laid down on the bed in his clothes—I noticed a little smell of paraffin—I said to him, "Your trousers smell of paraffin"—he said, "I spilt a little over my trousers filling the lamp up the other night"—he used to fill the lamp—I had never noticed that smell—he had never come to bed with his trousers on before—I was not very well, and he came to speak to me—I said to him, "You have had a bath, Alf"—he made no answer—I said, "You can get money for baths, but I cannot afford to get money for food"—he never made <hi rend="italic">no</hi> answer—I heard of the murder that morning when I was in bed—Alfred was there—Mrs. Chatfield told me—she said, "Is not it a terrible thing, the Farrows down High Street?"—I did not know their names, and said, "Who?"—she said, "The Farrows. There has been a murder down there, an old couple"—I said, "Oh! what a terrible thing"—Alfred did not say anything—he got a paper that day with the murder in it—I do not remember what paper it was; it was an evening paper—I read about the murder—it contained a description—I read it to myself—I do not know if Alfred read it—he did not take it out of my hand—I said, "Is not it like you?"—he said, "Do you think I should do such a thing and take you out and walk about Deptford, knowing I had done such a thing?"—I said, "I should not think so, Alfred"—the description did not describe Albert's clothes, because I always thought he had a black suit—I think it said the man had a brown or blue coat—I said, "Is it you, Alf?" because Alf has got a blue coat and waistcoat—I do not think I said anything about trousers or a brown coat, but Alf had a brown coat, but whether he gave it away on the Tuesday or not I do not know—I do not know if there was anything in the description about either of the men having a brown coat—Alfred's brown coat was usually kept on the partition at the side of the door—I saw the "Morning Leader" on Tuesday—it had a description of either a brown or a blue coat—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the paper I saw—it says, "A blue serge suit"—I am not positive whether it was the Tuesday or the Wednesday that Mrs. Bayne lent me a paper, or what the paper was, but she showed me one, I think it</p>

               <p>was in the afternoon—I cannot remember if I left the room after I had seen the paper—I do not remember when I saw Alfred's brown coat last—I had no intention of looking for brown coats, but he told me he had given it away to a fellow who was hard up—that was after the murder, either on the Tuesday or the Wednesday—I had not seen him wear it for weeks—we had put it by on the wall because he had got a tidier one—I missed it on the Tuesday or the Wednesday; I am not positive about the time—I do not remember saying, "I saw it on the Monday morning; I do not remember what time. It was generally kept hanging just at the head of the bed. Alfred said he gave it away. I said,' Where is the jacket gone off the wall?' He said he had given it away. I think that was on Monday afternoon; it was either Monday or Tuesday I missed it; after I had seen the description in the paper. When I asked him where it had gone to, he said he had given it away, while I was out, to some poor fellow who wanted one. That was Tuesday. I had not been out many seconds"—I do not remember speaking about the jacket at all—I do not know how he came to speak about it—he had a pair of brown boots—when Mrs. Bayne came in on the Monday or Tuesday he was blacking them over—he had done that before—I was not present when he got them, so I don't know how long he had had them—he had had, them seven or eight weeks when I came out of prison—they were brown when I first saw them—he first began to black them three, four or five weeks before the murder—on the Monday or Tuesday Alfred said, "If anybody asks you where I was on the Sunday night and Monday morning, say I was in bed with you, and I went to get some work at Braby's at 9.15 and came back at 10"—it was after I had heard of the murder that he said that, and I had seen the newspapers—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are his boots—he continued to wear them down to the time of his arrest—I remember the Friday when we left Brookmill Road—I do not remember if it was March 31st, the following Saturday night, I slept on Giffing Street stairs—early on the Sunday morning I went with Alfred to the waterworks, called "Ravensbourne"—Alfred started digging—I do not know what with—he said, "I am looking for a tool"—then he said, "I am not looking for a tool; we will go. I am looking for some money which I put here some weeks back"—he said he was looking for about four <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> which he had put there some weeks before to get me over my trouble—he said his brother had seen him put it there—he did not find either the tool or the money—he said perhaps somebody had come along and seen him put it there and had taken it—I said perhaps his brother had taken it—he said, "Oh! no, I don't think so"—I afterwards went with Sergeant Cleveland and pointed out the spot to him and he made a mark on the fence—during the week commencing with the Monday on which the murder happened Alfred had got no money—he had to go to his mother for some—he had one waistcoat in pawn which he got out, but I do not know when it was—I saw it on the bed and said, "Oh! You have got your waistcoat out of pawn"—I saw the waistcoat and the coat on the bed—he did not take the suit out of pawn—he had the trousers—it used to be called his best suit—this cap (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is Alfred's—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020102"/>
               <p>he was not wearing it, it was kept hanging on the door near the brown coat—I do not remember Mrs. Bayne coming in one day after the murder when the brown coat and cap were hanging up there—I do not remember her saying anything to Alfred about the descriptions in the newspapers or about her suspicions.</p>

I hope A If is not <hi rend="italic">got</hi>"—he was making a bother outside and said they wanted this Annie Cromarty, as they called me, and it turned out that Alfred was <hi rend="italic">got</hi>—I was taken to the police station and put into the superintendent's private room with Inspector Fox, who asked me a lot of questions—my answers were unsatisfactory, and he pressed me with more questions—he told me, unless I gave him an answer that was satisfactory he would keep me there, and that is how I came to make a written statement—during the week after the murder Alfred did not appear to have any more money than he had the week before—when I was first asked about the boots, I said they had been blacked weeks before the murder—on the Monday Alfred got a few things in, some coal, wood, tea and sugar—I don't know where he got the money for them from—they would only cost about 9d. or 1s.—the next day he told me he would have to go to his mother, as he wanted 3d.—up to the time he was arrested he did not appear to have any more money than before the murder, and we lived in great poverty—I do not know if he gam<lb/>bled on races when he had a little money—I only knew that he had won money on races from what I heard at the Coroner's inquest—I was angry because he ad made a little money and kept it back from me—it was the Sunday after the murder, when I asked him for some money, and he said, "I have only got 2d. on me; you can have that"—I said, "All right, that will do"—it was on the Sunday morning that we went out when he dug for the money—we were not looking for it long—he just dug a few places and said, "We had better go; I cannot find it"—since this charge has been hanging over Alfred's head I have been at 15, Circus Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, which is a home—I have not had an oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing the people in our neighbourhood—I was taken to the home by Mrs. Marsh, and the matron brought me here to-day—I do not re<lb/>member all the evidence that I gave before the Magistrate—I am not prepared to say whether it was actually accurate or not—I was bothered and frightened when I gave my evidence.</p>

               <p>he was broad shouldered—he was standing opposite and under the window on the pavement—I had never seen him before—on April 11th I went to Blackheath Road police station and saw a number of men—I did not count them—I picked out the man who I had seen standing below my window on that Sunday night—it was Albert Stratton—after I had looked out of the window I went back to bed—I was afterwards disturbed by Stratton's window opening—I did not get up—I did not pay any attention to it—I went to sleep again—next morning between 9 and 9.30, I went to Cromarty's room—Alfred was there, sitting on the end of the bed dressed, with Cromarty—I did not have any conversation with him—I spoke to Cromarty—on Tuesday, March 28th, I went down again to their room and saw Alfred blacking his boots—they were brown boots—I asked him why he was blacking them, as Mr. Bayne had some brown polish upstairs—Cromarty said she did not know—I did not notice if Alfred had worn the boots before—on the Sunday night when the quarrel occurred he was dressed in dark clothes, but I cannot swear if they were dark brown or navy blue, because he had both—I have not seen him dressed in brown, but he had a suit hanging on the door—on the Monday morning he was dressed in a dark navy blue cloth suit—I did not see any brown clothes then, but on the Tuesday morning I saw a brown jacket hanging on the door—he was dressed in a dark-navy blue suit—that was between 10 and 11 a.m.—I had a newspaper with me with a description of the man wanted—I had read of the brown boots, the light cap and the dark suit in the newspapers—on that Tuesday morning in Alfred's presence Cromarty asked me for the paper which the Deptford murder was in, and I gave it to her—it was the "Morning Leader"—I did not read any part of the paper aloud in the room—I said I had my suspicions, and I would not leave a stone unturned, with God's help, until I brought the guilty ones to justice—I said that in Alfred's and Cromarty's hearing—neither of them made any answer—the brown jacket was hanging up then—I went down to see Cromarty on the Wednesday, but I did not take any more notice of the room—I did not notice if the brown jacket was there then because I had seen it hanging on the door on the Tuesday.</p>

I have been employed in connection with the Finger Print Department since the formation of the finger print system in 1901—previous to that I was employed for two or three years on the anthropometric system, which Was a system based on certain body measurements and embodied for part of the time finger prints—I have studied the works on the subject by Mr. Francis Galton and Mr. Henry—so far as I know, those are the only works on the subject of finger prints—at Scotland Yard we have now between 80,000 and 90,000 sets of finger prints, which means between 800,000 and 900,000 impressions of digits—in my experience I have never found any two such impressions to correspond—in comparing the im<lb/>pressions we proceed to classify them first by types and sub-types, and then by counting and tracing the ridges—that is when we have com<lb/>plete prints of the whole finger; we then compare what are called the characteristics—in my experience, if the type or sub-type or the number or tracing of the ridges differ, they cannot be the prints of the same finger—if those matters agree we then proceed to compare the characteristics—in my experience, the highest number of characteristics which we have ever found to agree in the impressions of two different fingers is three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020112"/>
               <p>—that occurred, to the beat of my belief in two instances; it may have been three, but not more—we have never found as many as four—these photographs (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are enlargements of two finger prints of the same digit, the first taken in August, 1898, and the second in February, 1905, and they show that a particular man's finger did not alter in seven years—from my experience I find that the finger prints of persons who come under my notice do not alter—this cash box was handed to me by Deacon—I found a finger print on the inner tray; it is visible now—I photographed that finger print, and for the purpose of comparing it with others I enlarged it—I did not take impressions of the fingers of Thomas Farrow—Sergeant Alden will speak as to that, but they were shown to me; these are they—I compared them with the mark upon the cash box—they do not agree—Inspector Stead man examined the fingers of Mrs. Farrow after her death—I took an impression of the fingers of Deacon and of Crutchett—until the arrest of Alfred Stratton I had not been able to find any finger prints that I tried which agreed with the print upon the cash box—on the prisoners' arrest I took impressions from the digits of them both—I found that Alfred's right thumb corresponded with the mark on the cash box and I prepared for the purpose of comparison an enlargement of the mark upon the cash box, and one practically on the same scale of the right thumb of Alfred—the scales are as near the same as I could get them—I have indicated by red lines and figures eleven characteristics in which those two prints agree—I also point to at least one other characteristic which I describe as a spur, which is also visible in both prints—I did not find any characteristic which is visible in the print on the cash box which does not agree; so far as the characteristics are visible, they agree—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a chart or an enlarged drawing of the finger marks—there is a line coming in from the right, dropping in the form of a crescent-shape where it is marked 1—we have a ridge dropping, nearly touching No. 1 a little to the right, which is marked 7—the next line above is a line coming up and forking to the right—it is a line immediately above 7—inside the prongs of that fork we have a short independent piece of line marked 6, which we call an island—above that we have a line opening at 3 and closing at 5, forming a lake formation immediately above 2—then the 3rd line above that, coming from the right, terminates abruptly, marked 4—8, is the com<lb/>mencement of a tuning fork pattern, which forks at 9 just a little to the left—the upper part of that fork forms a ridge marked I—you follow the lower prong and you will find a little spur which is not numbered—the next line immediately below abruptly terminates a little to the left marked 2—No. 10, the 4th line from 8, has three intervening lines coming from the left and abruptly terminating—I not only point to the form of the char<lb/>acteristics, but to the number of intervening ridges between each, and both the form and the number of intervening ridges and their respective positions are identical in the two prints—from my experience I should say that it is impossible that those can be prints of two different digits—I have prepared enlargements of the right thumb prints of Crutchett, Deacon, Mr. Farrow and the two prisoners—none of them agree, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020113"/>
               <p>none of them agree with the print on the cash box except Alfred's—I have my apparatus here for taking prints—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a copper plate—a thin film of ink is spread over it by a roller, the finger is placed upon the inked plate, the ridges take up the ink, the finger is then placed upon the paper and leaves an imprint—we have paper forms for the purpose—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the print I took of Alfred's finger.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROOTH</hi>. I have been employed in classifying and comparing finger impressions for between six and seven years—there must be ridges and lakes and peninsulas in every hand—the eleven characteristics which I have marked for the benefit of the Court are the only character<lb/>istics visible from the print on the cash box—they all differ from each other in points of position and character—the points marked 1 to on one enlargement agree with the points marked 1 to 11 on the other—I was not exactly a pupil of Dr. Garson; he was attached to the Anthropometric Office, and when I was working in that office he had very little to do; he was simply adviser to the Commissioner—I have no experience of his ability on the question of finger prints, but on the question of measurement I should value any opinion which he expressed—he taught me to measure criminals in Wandsworth Prison and he taught me something to do with finger prints, but previous to going there I knew the way to take prints—the thumbs in these two prints are looked at from precisely the same point of view—the photograph of the print taken from Alfred is a little more to the right, but it is practically the same—I see the line in print No. 2 forking to the right is more circular in the lower one than in the one above, but in little points of that description pressure would play a lot—it is simply perspiration in the mark on the cash box and in the other the finger is evenly coated with ink—pressure would give you a straight line from one and a curve from the other, but the patterns are the same—in the lower enlargement it is much more curved than in the upper one, which is much more broken up—in the upper one at the end of one part it joins, making a sort of triangle—it is simply a fork to the right, but I do not agree that it is a curve in the lower one—the bifurcation is arched equally in both—I cannot see that the line is much straighter in No. 1 than in No. 2; I cannot see any practical differ<lb/>ence whatever—these vertical lines are scratches which were on the cash box—you can see them on it now—one point I depend upon is the little island between points 3 and 5—there is a difference in size and shape between it and the one in the lower print, but that is accounted for in my experience by pressure—in the lower one you have got ink on the ridges of the finger and by pressure you will fill in the ridges, whereas in the other one you have only got perspiration—the exact size of the open<lb/>ing does not alter my decision as to the point of identity, because I know by experience that pressure will alter it—you must remember the number of times this photograph has been enlarged and the difference is at the same ratio—the smaller the thing gets the smaller the difference appears and the more you enlarge it the greater the difference appears—it is en<lb/>larged thirteen times and I think I have accounted for the difference—the difference—in line No. 6 is where a scratch comes on the cash box—you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020114"/>
               <p>can compare it with the mark on the box—I cannot see any appreciable difference at the base of No. 6—lines Nos. 8 and 10 are practically the same, but you must understand that things such as the hand not striking the same angle make a difference, and the finger is very soft—if you take a soft rubber stamp and push it down with pressure you get a more or less blurred mark and the same with the finger; if it is not touched in the same way you are bound to alter the angle of the pattern—I make it about an inch and three-quarters from the line marked 1 to the line marked, 9; it is not only one-fifth of an inch—all the lines agree in the same ratio with the degree of enlargement, but there may be a slight difference in the degree—I do not make a difference of one-twelfth of an inch between lines 9 and 10 in the two enlargements, but I will concede you that point—between lines 1 and 10 I make the difference about four millimetres, but the degree of enlargement is more in the top than the bottom—I see that the lines in the upper photograph are running much more perpen<lb/>dicular than in the lower, but the pressure of the ridges, will alter that.

               <p>on which "2 "is, is of a different form from that in the upper print; you will see it is a good deal more convex in the under print and the arch is wider in the upper print; it also runs down in a different manner—it also joins the ridge in a slightly different manner below point 2; that is follow<lb/>ing the lower branch; the point in the upper print runs in a straighter line than is the case in the lower print—points 3 and 5 really mark what is called the "lake"—I do not agree that the lake in the upper print agrees with the in the lower print—it is very obvious, on looking at the prints, that in the upper print it is much longer and proportionately narrower than in the lower print—I have measured the lengths and I find that the length of the lake in the upper print is thirteen millimetres, while in the lower it is eleven millimetres—that is a difference of 11.8 per cent. or about one-twelfth of an inch in the length of that short line—Points 4: I do not agree to those being corresponding points in the two prints, because if you make a vertical line, which will pass through the ends of points 1 and 11, raise that up right through the prints, and take the distance between the point marked "4 "in the under print, you will find that the distance from the vertical is five millimetres—if you take and put a rule at the ends of points 1 and 11 in the upper print, and then measure to the end of point 4 from the upright, you will find that it measures thir<lb/>teen millimetres, so that that is a difference of eight millimetres between the two prints, and I say that is impossible, therefore, to be the same point—I have another remark to make with reference to point 4, and that is that in the lower print that terminal end of point 4 is much nearer the next ridge than it is in the upper print—looking at the upper print I would say that the ridge in point 4 is as wide, as far as the actual ridge is con<lb/>cerned, as it is in the lower ridge—with reference to point 6 that has been described as an "island," I do not agree with Inspector Collins that these points in both prints are alike, because, in the first place, in the upper print that ridge measures fourteen millimetres in length, and in the lower print it only measures twelve millimetres; it measures longer in the print that is less clear—there is a difference of 11.7 per cent, of that whole length or two millimetres—let me explain that when I use the right and left I am speaking as regards the person who is looking at the print—you will find that that joins at the right hand side and forms a fork with the ridge below, just where the red line goes through; the red line passes through the junction, and I have had to ascertain whether there is a continuation by examining it closely to see whether the red line is super<lb/>ficial or not, and I find that it is superficial to that junction; it has gone right through the junction in my print—that could not possibly be the case in the under print, which is clearly a terminal end, and, if anything, it is thrown up in the opposite direction towards the top of the print rather than bending downwards—as to point 7, that is not very characteristic; one can deduce very little evidence as to that, but, however, it does not agree in the two prints, because it is continuous in the upper print, and there is a well marked break in the lower print—as to point 8, I am not satisfied that it corresponds in the two prints, because in the first place the ridges in the upper print are very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020117"/>
               <p>indistinct in this place and it appears to me that that point in the upper print is not situated on the terminal point, and is the terminal point of a ridge, but I am of opinion it is continued into the next and prolonged downwards to the right; it is totally different in appearance and direc<lb/>tion to anything which exists in the lower print; it is the ridge which is very black—as to No. 9, I do not agree that those points coincide, because, in the first instance, if you take a measurement from the end of point 1 to point 9 you will find that it measures fifty millimetres, while in the lower print it is forty-five millimetres, a difference of five millimetres or one-fifth of an inch—these two points, 1 and 11, being stationary and the same in both cases, it follows as a corollary that point 9 is not on the same portion of the print in the two cases; therefore I say it is in a differ<lb/>ent position on the finger on each of these two prints—as to point 10, it is distinctly a perennial end in the lower print but in the upper it appears to me to be placed on the cross of an arch, which is running onwards to join the one above it—I have not got the measurement from 9 and 10, but I have from 1 to 10, and from 11 to 10; from 1 to 10 in the upper print measures eighty-four millimetres; in the lower one severty-eight, a difference of six millimetres or a quarter of an inch—as to point 11, I think that fairly corresponds in the two prints—taking off half an inch on the right hand side of the upper print and covering up the left hand side of both the prints about to the middle, there is a total difference in the direction of the ridges; in the upper print they form a very fair curve and fairly vertical, whilst in the lower they are much straighter; in fact, they do not follow the curve at all: there is a double curve, as it were, in the upper print; they curve and become vertical, while in the lower print they curve and become horizontal and rather tend to rise towards the right—from my examination of these two prints, I say as to their being those of the same person it is possible, but as to there being conclusive proof to be those of the same person I say they are entirely different fingers; they may be fingers of the same person, but they are not the same fingers—there is also a remarkable absence of any recognisable or distinct marks in the quarter of the print which may be taken of the lower and upper print as marked by the lines 5 and 7. in the lower set of prints there are at least eight extremely good points, and if you carry it down further there are a considerable number more; I mean by that the junction of forks and peculiarity of ridges, not a single trace of which is to be found in the upper print.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not say that the different digits of one indi<lb/>vidual resemble each other more than the digits of different individuals resemble each other; there is the same variety between my different digits as there is a difference between my digits and yours—I said that the finger prints may be those of the same, individual, but not of the same finger, because both prints show the form of ridge which is called an arch—it is quite possible for anyone to have on two, three, or all the fingers of his hand that arch—it is also possible for two individuals to have arches upon two or three fingers, but it is not frequently found—it is found that different individuals have different arches; that is the primary type</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020118"/>
               <p>—a great many different individuals have that arch on their thumbs—these finger prints are more likely perhaps to be the finger prints of differ<lb/>ent people—when I was retained by the Home Office the Bertillon system was used for classification only—that part of the system which consisted of measurements of bones required expert surgical knowledge—it is not necessary to know the position of bones to find the termini or anything of that kind—the system was based on the length of limbs and head—that is certainly determined upon the length of bones underneath—I was concerned with the whole system of identification, measurements, marks, scars, finger prints and photographs—I gave evidence before, the Commission that sat in 1900—I do not know that they recommended that the combined system of measurements and finger prints should be aban<lb/>doned—they recommended that both should go on—I know the system of measurements has been wholly abandoned—it was owing to the diffi<lb/>culty of keeping the large staff over the country trained up to a certain standard to take accurate measurements—I agree to a certain extent that two persons measuring the same part of the same body get different results—very fine measurements were required, only a difference of a millimetre being allowed in the principal measurements—when the sys<lb/>tem of measurement was abandoned in October, 1901, my services were dispensed with, and I have not had any connection with the Finger Print Department since that date—I know that the use of finger prints has enormously increased since then—I leftover 20,000 finger prints when I left—a few hundreds or a thousand, perhaps, being taken under the new system—I was there in the later period of the new system also—the old system was classification by measurement, and the new was classification by the finger prints themselves—under the old system down to the end of 1901 the highest number of identifications in any one year was 503, but that number did not include 93 identifications by finger prints alone—I was not there the last two or three months of 1901—I will not dispute the figures for that year—the last complete year that I was there was 1900—in 1900 the total number of identifications was 462—I have seen the statistics for last ear and know that the number of identifications by finger prints alone exceed 5,000—you certainly cannot take it that the experience of the officers of the Finger Print Department since I left has greatly exceeded my own with regard to finger prints—I have been at it since 1890—I have seen a number of identifications since October, 1901, but I have had no experience of the working of identifications by finger prints since that date—I think I communicated with the defence first with reference to this case—it was after I had seen the report of what had taken place in the Police Court—I wrote to the solicitor on April 26th—I had not then seen any copies of these finger prints—what, made me write was that I saw Inspector Collins had spoken, according to the papers, a great deal of nonsense about finger prints in the Police Court; for instance, there was something in the paper that he said about the number of cases you would require before you found the same finger print occurring twice, a mathematical calculation of the chances—I be<lb/>lieve that was one of the nonsensical things he said, but there were several</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020119"/>
               <p>things which were not in accordance with my views—that is the only one I can recollect—it is rather a prominent one—in order, to check that calculation I would have to have the basis on which it is made, but the, basis was not given—I, as a scientific man, came to the collusion that, it was nonsense—I knew where he had got it—I accept the statement that one of those prints is the finger of the right thumb of Alfred Stratton and I am prepared to swear before the jury that the one above is not—I formed that opinion after ray examination of the finger prints—I saw them casually last week in the solicitor's offices, but they did not come to me for examination until this week, I think, on Tuesday night—I had not, formed any opinion until I had examined them carefully—I then made; an exhaustive study of them—you can read the letter that I wrote to the solicitor for the defence, as far as I am concerned [<hi rend="italic">The letter of April</hi>, 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi>; 1905, <hi rend="italic">was then read, stating that the witness was not sure whether the Trea<lb/>tury were going to call him as an expert witness o" the finger print system in connection with the trial of the Brothers Stratton at the Central Criminal Court, but that if he should not be called he should be pleased to arrange to give expert evidence for the defence; that he had had the organisation of the whole department at Scotland Yard and had remained there until it was thoroughly established; that Inspector Collins was his junior assistant and that he (the witness) was familiar with the extent of his knowledge; that from Mr. Button's statements, made the day before, he gathered that he (Mr. Button), was not quite familiar with the finger print system; that it was a splendid means of identification when properly used, but that it required careful use, that he had no hesitation in saying that the way in which it was being used by the police was just that which would bring it into disrepute; that he (Mr. But<lb/>ton) must have medical authority to regulate its use as to what extent the prints were to be relied upon in any given case, and that he was without exaggera<lb/>tion the leading medical legal authority, as having had by for the greated experience of the work, with the exception of one man, who was aged]—on the same day I wrote to the Director of the Public Prosecutions, offering to give evidence on his behalf. [The letter was then read, dated April</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1905. <hi rend="italic">in which the witness stated that he would be glad to know whether it was the intention to call him as an expert in the trial of the Strattons of the Central Criminal Court on the finger impressions which wire to be brought forward against them; that it was he who first worked the system up at Scot<lb/>land Yard, and that he felt that the Government had perhaps the first claim on his services, especially as Sir Kenelam Digby had said to him that there were occasions when his services might be required; that he might say that if not retained by the Treasury as an expert he probably would give evidence for the defence, and that was the reason why he was desirous of knowing as soon as possible whether his services would be required by the Treasury for the Prosecution.</hi>]—I am an independent witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman of Messrs. Oppenheimer &amp; Company, Limited, sausage case dressers, at the Cattle Market, Deptford—I have been their foreman eight year on the same premises—Young was formerly a foreman there—Messrs. Oppenheimer had a warehouse in the market called No. 5, Blood Alley, secured by a padlock—of these keys produced No. 5 is the one that opens the lock—No. 9 also unlocks it—this third key also unlocks it—I keep No. 5, the proper key—I locked up the warehouse on March 15th about 7.30 p.m.—I unlocked the lock at 8 the following morning—I did not notice anything wrong till about 4.30 p.m., when I missed four barrels, and I saw empty barrels in the places of the full ones in the centre of about fifty—they were the same kind of barrels—the empty ones had been taken from a place about three feet away—we had "Middle gut "and "Beef bull gut" in them, cleaned and ready for use—we keep them in a barrel rather than in a bag, because they remain moist in a barrel; they keep the pickle, they are in salt water, which we put with them—in bags they will more or less perish—as soon as I dis<lb/>covered the loss I informed my employer—the next morning, the 17th, I saw Bush loading, when he said, "What is the matter I"—I told him someone had taken away full barrels and put empty ones in their place, and I showed him the place, as he was loading there at the time—I know Bush and Bousted as carmen, and I have recognised Hooton as a carman—I do not know Bebrouth—I saw these staves when they were brought back in the warehouse—they are the same as in the missing tierces.</p>

Oppenheimer &amp; Co., Limited, who carry on business in the Cattle Market, Deptford, and elsewhere, as sausage skin cleaners and manufacturers—Young was in our employment from about 1896 to June, 1904, approximately—I think the date when he was discharged was July 4th, 1904—he brought an action against the company for wrongful dismissal, and recovered damages, for the reason that I was rot in England to defend it—he had charge of the warehouse, 5, Blood Alley, and of all the various places we had in the Deptford Cattle Market—the market is enclosed in walls, and there are gates, but I do not believe the gates are ever locked—up to April,</p>

               <p>1904, there was a padlock on the warehouse similar to the one produced—the number was 9—I gave instructions for the purchase of a look for the Deptford Cattle Market premises on my periodical visit to Deptford, when my foreman, Young, requested me to supply a new lock for one of the placed because the old one had worn out—I did not ask him to show me the old lock but I had a new one bought, and sent to him from William Kennard in Little Britton, on May 2nd, 1904, one key of which I sent to the foreman and the other retained—one is No. 5, and the other No. 9—I did not get back the old duplicate from the foreman, and do not know what became of it—the "Middle beef bull guts "produced by the police are the same in kind as those which are missing, and contain the same brand "W," which we put on for "Wides," which we lost—we put on the brand with stencils and a brush on the various kinds, and I recognise our stencil mark "Wide Middles "which we lost—I have no doubt these tierces were formerly in our possession—I never knew Andrew Hemeter, but John Hemeter was in our employment previous to 1896—on one occasion I saw Andrew and John together at the Deptford Cattle Market five to seven years ago, I cannot be accurate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FITCH</hi>. I was first spoken to about this matter about three weeks before I went into this warehouse—I made no ob<lb/>jection because Young said it was his own goods he Was felting out—Bush made no objection, he was boozed when he was working for Young—Hoot on, I believe, knew something about it—a lot of people were in the Albert, but only three on our side of the bar, and behind the bar a couple of young ladies—we were talking quite openly, not exactly showing the keys; they were given to me—we were in the Prince Albert about an hour, till near closing time, they close earlier than others—we were in the next public-house three or four minutes, when they closed—the Lord Clyde is 300 or 400 yards from the market—when we came out we went straight to the market, getting there about 12.30—I was not so boozed as Bush was—the van was back from the market about 2.30—Young was in the market—he did not help to load the van—I have been Bush's carman some time; and accustomed to go to Oppen<lb/>heimer's premises—I know two or three people employed there by sight—I do not know when Young ceased to be foreman for Oppenheiner; as far as I could see, they all seemed to be foremen, and if you wanted any thing, to refer you to somebody else—four or five seemed to be giving orders—there was one head foreman—I gave one statement of this matter when' I was drunk, another when I was hardly sober, and another now when I believe I am quite sober—the barrow man is the man who wheels the barrow to pick up the tubs—(<hi rend="italic">The witness statement "A "read</hi>): "12.45 p.m. March 17th, 1905. Arthur Henry Bousted, 13, Watergate Street, says; I am a carman. I know a man named George Young who works in Deptford Cattle Market. About three weeks ago I saw him in the market. He asked me if I could get the van, unknown to my governor, as he had got a few tierces of guts to take away. I said "Yes, I can do it.' He said, 'We can take them down to the stables early in the morning,. <hi rend="italic">Lust</hi> one open, sack one up and send them on the rail. You're on a suit of clothes and a bit of gold.' Last Monday I saw Young in the Market and he said, 'We will get them away this week, I am going</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505020127"/>
               <p>to get the key off oil the barrowman.' I said, 'All right, very good then. Last Wednesday night, about 12 o'clock, Young came to me at the Albert public-house, Amersham Vale. I was standing outside and he said to me, 'Come on, I've got them; come over to the Clyde, we will have rink there.' I went there with him into the saloon bar. There was a man I don't know with Young, I called for a glass of bitter and Burton, but the barmaid would not serve me. Young, his friend and I, then left the Clyde. Young's friend went away, and Young and I went to the market, and he took me to Oppenheimer's warehouse. These two keys Young gave me when I was standing outside the Albert and when we got to Oppenheimer's he said, 'Try the little a first.' I did so, and it would not fit. I then tried the other key, and the look open. We went inside. Young struck a match and he said, 'Roll them four tierces out here.' I did so. I rolled them into the alley way outside the ware-house. Young then said, 'Lock the door.' I did so. Young said, 'Go and get the van, I'll stop here.' I had previously arranged with George Hooton, who works with me, to get my governor's horse and van. He had to go to Smithfield with some meat, and it was arranged that I should meet him on his return if wanted. I met him near Southwark Park, in Lower Road, got up in the van, told him everything was ready, and we drove to the Alley near Oppenheimer's place in the market. Hooton backed the van in, and Young and I loaded the four tierces up. Young and got into the van and Hooton drove to the Railway Arches, near my governor's place. Young and Hooton knocked the heads out of the barrels, and I assisted them to put the guts into fifteen flour bags. (Young asked me on the Monday night to get flour bags. I bought twelve at Pettitt and Sons, Edward Street, on Wednesday; the other three were in the van. The barrels were then smashed up by all there of us and given to old "Kaffir" to sell for firewood. "Kaffir "looks alter my governor's stables. It was then a quarter past 7. Mr. Young tied labels on the sacks, and these eight labels were left in the van. Young said, 'You know the strong man that used to work with me at Oppenheimer's?' I said, Yes.' He said, 'That's who they are going to at Lynn. They will fetch fifteen or sixteen pence a set, and as soon as I get the returns, you're on a suit of clothes and a bit of gold.' At the same time Young told Hooton he was on a bit of gold. I want home, but before I left, Hooton drove the van away; I don't know where Young went to. (<hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">A. H. BOUSTED</hi>"—there was a man with Young, I did not know—I was arrested about 12.30—in this statement I my no<lb/>thing about Bush—the railways have a place to back vans in the market—part of my statement is not true—Young was not there—he was never in the van—I considered I ought to make a second statement after Be<lb/>brouth had made his—Hailstone came and told me Bebrouth had made a statement, and in it had said that Bush was in the stable, and not Young—this is the second statement that I made: "4.30 p.m., March 17th, 1905. Arthur Henry Bousted says: I desire to make a correction and addition to my statement. When Young met me outside the Albert public-house, Mr. Bush, my master, was in the private bar—Young went</p>

               <p>in to him and shortly after I joined him. When we left the Albert we all three went to the Clyde public-house. After leaving the Clyde we all three went to Oppenheimer's warehouse in the Cattle Market. Mr. Bush was present when Young gave me the two keys; he heard all that Young said, saw me unlock the door of the warehouse, went inside and struck matches, so that Young and me could see to roll out the barrels. When the keys were given to me by Young, Bush looked at them and said,' They are funny shaped keys. After the tierces on barrels had been got out into the alley, Bush and me left the market by the Prince Street Gate to meet Hooton with the van near Southwark Park. We both got into the van and Hooton drove us back into the Market. We saw Young in the market; he went near his place and looked out. Bush, Hooton and me loaded the four tierces into the van. Bush and me got into the van and Hooton drove to Bush's stables. Bush and Hooton knocked the heads out of the tierces whilst I shook the flour sacks. "Kaffir" was there at the stables, and helped me to hold the sacks whilst Bush and Hooton took the guts out of the tierces and counted them into the sacks. There were fifty sets put into each of fourteen sacks and sixty-two in the other. Before we left the market Young said to Bush, 'Be sure and sew up the bags; don't tie them up, or the string will slip off, and after putting the guts into the bags, Bush sent me for some balls of string. I went to Pettitt's in Edward Street and got four balls of string off the boy, returned to Bush's stables with it, and he helped Hooton and me to sew up the fifteen bags. When I got back the barrels had been broken up. I saw the pieces (staves) in the stable. When we first took the tierces to Bush's stable they were taken off the van and put in the stable, and the guts were then put in the bags. Hooton put a fresh horse to the van whilst Bush and "Kaffir "lifted the bags on to my back to carry on the van. I then left the stables, and Bush, Hooton and "Kaffir "there, but I saw the van go away. When we were in the Albert public-house Young said to Bush, 'Be sure and take them out of the tierces and break them up, as they will be known, and don't go to Bishops-gate, as the van is well known there, go through the tunnel' and to a depot the name of which I cannot remember. I did not care to tell the truth at first, as I did not like to speak against my governor. (<hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">A. H. BOUSTED</hi>."</p>

Dear Friend John,—Only a few lines, everybody well, Your friend, G. Young. Meet me. Excuse not much time to write "]—the postmark is London, S.E., and the date 12.15 a.m. March 17th, 1905—I also found at his house a letter signed G. Young, relating to another matter, in a drawer in a ches of drawers, and dated February 27th, 1905—I showed it to H meter—in answer to my question, "Could you tell me where this comes from?" he said, "That is a letter from Young"—I took it out of a drawer when looking for letters—I said, "This appears to be another letter from Young"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You only said you had one, and I shall arrest you for receiving the property well knowing it to have been stolen"—he said, "Well, all right; you will have to take away all the property yourself. I know nothing about it"—I said, "Can you tell me where your father is?"—he said, "No, he is in some hospital; I do not know where, but I think Charing Cross"—I found on him this pocket book containing the entry, "G. Young, 63, King Street, Cattle Market, Deptford," also u Oliver, Islington Cattle Market" on another page—I have made inquiries, but find no one there of that name, or who goes to that market, except one man, who is here to-day—on the consignment note is an address in High Street, Shad well—I can find no such name as "Harris "in business at the Cattle Market, Deptford—I took possession of the bags—I marked them with a cross in red paint and sent them back to Mr. Oppenheimer—I was present when the contents were counted by Chapman.</p>

I want to tell the truth now. I am not going to have it all on my b—shoulders"—he was afterwards brought out of the charge room, and his second statement was taken down in writing, which he signed—the first statement was supposed to be a confession, at the time it was made—neither Hailstone nor I said that it would be better for him—I heard him say so to-day—that is a lie.</p>

I have not seen Hooton for the last three weeks. On Wednesday night I came down from New Cross Station, went into the Clyde, asked for a drink, and a little after, Bush, this man's <hi rend="italic">guv'nor</hi> came in, we had drinks together. A few minutes after this man, meaning Bousted, came in. He had a drink. I then said to him,' I'm going home now.' Mr. Bush, this man and me then went to the Albert, and Bush and me had a drink, and when I left I went straight to the market entrance in Prince Street and spoke to a policeman, Mr. Bell. I asked him if everything was all right. He said, 'Yes,' and gave me this card for a dance on Friday night. I then went home. I left home at half-past seven on Thursday morning and met White, the watchman, outside the Market. We went to the White Swan in High Street, Deptford, and had a drink afterwards. I went home to breakfast"—I took it down and Young signed it—I saw Bebrouth that day at Bush's stables, about 4 p.m., I said, "l am a police officer. I understand you had given you some barrels yesterday morning by a man named Bousted. I want them"—he said, "I had some pieces, and I sold some of them to Mrs. White, of Childers Street"—I went to Childers Street with other officers, and in the back yard staves similar to the ones produced were taken possession of—Bebrouth was taken to Deptford police station and detained—I told him the charge was stealing—just before he went to the station with Beavis he said, "Bush is in it," and that he meant to tell the truth—knowing Bush as I did, I could hardly believe what he said was correct, so that before we moved further I decided to see Bousted again, and I told him that Bebrouth had told us that Bush was concerned in it, and he said, "Well, I am not b—well going to take it all on my shoulders, I am only the <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, and I am going to tell you all about it, to tell the truth "—before we went, any further we took a second statement from Bousted—on that I arrested Bush at 7.30 p.m. in Edward Street.

I looked at a tierce and found it was empty"—I took Bush to Deptford police station—I read Bousted's statement to him about 9.15 p.m.—he made no reply—I read Bousted's second state<lb/>ment to all of them just before they were being charged—Young made no reply—I read Bebrouth's statement to Bush at 9.15 in Bebrouth and Bousted's presence—[<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>]: "7.45 p.m., March 17th, 1905, Alfred Bebrouth says:—I am a labourer, no home, but for past 12 months have slept in stables occupied by Mr. Bush, carman and con<lb/>tractor, at the Railway Arches, Edward Street, Deptford. I know Bousted and Hooton, who work for Mr. Bush. I slept in a loft over Bush's stables last Wednesday night. The next morning, just as it was getting light, Bousted called me to open the stable door. I did so. I then saw the <hi rend="italic">guv'nor's</hi> horse and van; it was the black horse. Mr. Bush. Hooton, and Bousted were there. I saw some barrels of guts on the ground out<lb/>side the stable door. I also saw the barrels in the stable. I saw Mr. Bush and Hooton knock the heads out of the barrels. I assisted Bousted to hold some flour bags whilst Mr. Bush and Hooton took the guts out of the barrels and put them into the bags. I also assisted Mr. Bush to lift the bags of guts on to Bousted's back for him to carry them on to the van. Hooton put the other black horse to the van. Mr. Bush and Hooton went away with the van. Bousted also went away. The barrels were broken up. Bousted gave the pieces to me and I sold the wood, some of it to Mrs. White, 19, Childers Street. (Signed) Alfred (his mark X) Bebrouth"—Bebrouth was brought to the station about 4.15 p.m.—Bousted was then under arrest—they were put into cells on different floors—I got this lock on March 18th from the witness Chapman—the two keys found in Bebrouth's house both lock and unlock the lock—Mr. Oppenheimer produced another numbered key which would not open the lock.</p>

Edwards' premises—they are sausage skin dressers next door to the Morris Beef Company—I measured them—the twenty-five original bundles only made twenty-three bundles when measured at 100 yards each—that was the day before they were sent off—they were measured and salted, and I packed them into a keg and left them with the Morris Beef Company, where I measured them—Young asked me if we would do him a favour as I had nothing to do just then, and he would pay me 2s.—about fourteen more bundles were added to make up a good consignment of about forty bundles.</p>

I am a widow, and keep the Hever Castle in Camberwell—a slate club called the Hever Castle Slate Club meets there every week—I acted as treasurer to the club—the money which the members subscribed was kept by me—the prisoner, as secretary, received it from me and paid it into the bank—the current expenses were paid by me from what I had in hand—it was the prisoner's practice to come to me for the money he wanted for sick pay—he gave me a receipt for what he had—this is a receipt (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), dated March 26th, 1904—on that day he drew from me 16s. 8d. for sick pay for two members named Teals and Weeden—I think there was 6s. 8d. for Teale and 10s. for Weeden, but I am not quite sure—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a receipt signed by the prisoner, dated April 2nd—it is 10s. for Teale—this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), dated April 9th, is 10s. for Teale also—it was no part of my duty to examine the prisoner's sick visiting book—from November 25th to December 17th the prisoner started drawing sick pay for Teale at 10s. a week and I took his receipt—there was another member named Babbage and the prisoner drew sick pay for him during September, October, November and December from 5s. to 10s. a week—I do not know the total amount that he had for Babbaga.</p>
