                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer D.</hi>) On the morning of 4th Novem<lb/>ber, I went to the chapel in Homer Row, I found a door leading from a school-room into the chapel had been broken open—a centre-bit and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> had been used—there were other doors also broken open in the same manner—I examined the iron safe; the door of it had been blown off by gunpowder; it smelt very strongly, and the walls about were blackened—I examined the door of the safe, and found that a hole had been drilled in it, and I found this tube that had been used to insert in the hole, and gunpowder had been poured through it—it smelt very much of gunpowder at that time, and was blackened—it is black now—the interior of the safe smelt very strongly of gunpowder—I saw the prisoners at the Walton Street Station, on a Saturday, about ten days afterwards—I told them the charge—Palmer said "We have been told before; we know all about it"—they were then taken to John Street Station, and the charge was entered against them—Palmer was then put into cell No. 2, and Jarrett into No. 4, and I went into No. 3 cell—after a short time Palmer called out "Harry, where are you?" (I am referring to a paper which I made at the time in the cell) Jarrett answered "Here I am." Palmer said "Well, we are in for it now." Jarrett replied "No, you are not in for it, but I am; they found the b——tools at my place; I should like to take eighteen months for my bit," Palmer said "What can they do with the tools? nothing at all; but I am in for it as two of them picked me out." Jarrett then said "Oh, yes they can, they will go and fit the centre-bit and <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> to the marks on the doors which we broke open." Palmer said "No, they won't think of that." Jarrett said "Had I known they were coming, they never would have found the tools." Palmer said "Well, we have got enough out of the b——stuff to pay for a good mouthpiece, will you have one?" Jarrett said "No, I will be my own mouthpiece; I told you they would not think to search there for it; how will we get it to the old women?" Palmer said "The old women will bring our dinner to-morrow, and we can put it in the dirty things." Jarrett said "No, they might search them, but we can do it in the House of Detention." Palmer said "No, we can't." Jarrett said "Oh, yes, we can give the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> something, and he will pass it." Palmer said "No, they won't." Jarrett said "They would do it at Wandsworth, and I am sure they will do it where we are going. You are safe to get off, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, and if you don't look after my old woman while I am in, so help me God I shall <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on you when I am there." Palmer said "If I get off I will do the best I can for her, but what can I do by myself?" Jarrett said "Do the same as we have been doing." Palmer replied "What, by myself?" Jarrett said "Yes, or go with some of the other</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">blokes.</hi>" Palmer said "Not me, I would not trust one of them." They then paused for some time, and then Palmer again called "Harry, had we known they would have found the little b——who picked me out, we would have left him unable to say much." Jarrett said "Yes, yes, I'm b——if we should not." Palmer then said "What is the name of that church where the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> let us in? or do you know his name?" Jarrett said "I'm b——if I know the name of the church, but I know his name is John, his other name I don't know." Palmer said "Well, it's a good job they did not go to his place, if they had they would have found some stuff; but we can tell my old woman, and she will put him on his guard; she can easily find his address." Jarrett then said "What a good job they did not find any tickets, they would not think to look in the old woman's flour for them."—In con<lb/>sequence of what I heard them say I took Palmer out of the cell into the charge room, and searched him, and found three sovereigns in his stocking—I also had Jarrett brought into the charge room, and in his stocking found four sovereigns and two half sovereigns.</p>

I am a servant, and live at 24, Stafford Street—I was in the chapel, in Homer Row, Marylebone Road, on Wednesday evening week, about 9.30—as I came out I saw the two prisoners standing at the side of the wall, which had a money-box attached to it—I looked at them very hard—they were whispering and talking to each other, and having their hands upon the money-box—I asked them if they were Catholics—they said they were—I said "You are not"—they said they were—I said "If you are Catholics, you are very bad ones, and if you are not, you are quite welcome to go inside if you want to be enlightened in anything"—they did not seem to go inside, so I said "You come out of here, you are not after anything good"—I insisted upon their coming out of the place, and they ran up the steps of the chapel, and swore at me most dreadfully—they then came out, and I came with them, and they stood by the railings of the chapel as the clerk was shutting the sacristy door—this was the night of the great fog—I heard of the robbery next morning, when I went to service at the chapel—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

Palmer is very much like one of them; I think he is the man, by his appearance. Jarrett is also very much like the other man; he has the same features. I cannot swear Palmer is the same man.") I said those words about Palmer because Jarrett was the man, and the more I looked at them the more I recognized them—I was speaking longer to Jarrett, because he kept silent—I know they are the same persons; I will not say anything I am not quite sure of.</p>

I am the son of Richard Cook, of 62, Paul Street, Finsbury, and am getting on for twelve years old—on 1st December I saw the prisoner in Pitfield Street, Hoxton—he said that he would give me a shilling to take a cheque to the Imperial Bank, Lothbury, for him—he gave me a letter addressed to the Imperial Bank, and said I was to bring back a parcel to him at the corner of King Street, Finsbury—I took it there—a gentleman opened it, and took two or three papers out, one of which was a slip like this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the gentleman gave me another letter for it, which I took to the corner of King Street, and waited there three quarters of an hour, but the prisoner did not come—I gave it to Funnell, the officer.</p>

I am single, and live at 326, Kingsland Road—I was in King William Street on this day, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I felt nothing there—I went into Lower Thames Street, and a man endeavoured to prevent my passing—I attempted to go behind the man, and he pushed me up against a cart wheel—I succeeded in getting past him, and after I passed I felt in my pocket, and my purse was gone—it was safe when I went into Thames Street; I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the detective spoke to me as I was turning back—I did not see the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 39, Saville Street, Great Portland Street, Fitzroy Square—I was acquainted with the deceased—on Sunday evening, 6th November, at 8 o'clock, I was in Saville Lane, Saville Street, with Mr. and Mrs. McGill, a cousin of Mrs. McGill, the prisoner, and the deceased—after supper we went to convey the young woman, Miss Maitland, to a 'bus, and on returning we had some drink at a public-house in Cirencester Place—after leaving there the prisoner and I went to a public-house in Carburton Street, and had a pint of beer, and were standing there when the deceased came in—the prisoner insulted the deceased; the words tire too indistinct in my recollection to use them under oath—the deceased challenged him to repeat the insult, which he did—the deceased then struck the prisoner, and they fought several rounds; at the last knock<lb/>down the prisoner would not rise—the deceased then left the bar—the prisoner and I finished our pint, and left to go home—we had not gone very far down the street when the deceased came up, seized the prisoner by the shoulder, and asked him if he had had enough, or did he wish for any more—they then stripped, and fought in the street; it ended in the prisoner being several times thrown, and the arrival of the police, when he was taken to the hospital to be dressed—after being dressed, we left the hospital and went home—immediately after coming out of the hospital the deceased disappeared—the prisoner, I, and the witness Euston went home; we got home about 11.15, and went to bed—the prisoner and I slept in the same bed, and Euston in a bed near us, with the deceased—the deceased came in and went to bed about half-an-hour after us—all was quiet until about 4 o'clock, when the prisoner got out of bed and examined the bed the deceased was in—I was awake, and saw him—after having examined the bed, he exclaimed "Are you there, you b——?"—he then left the bed<lb/>room, and went into the workshop, the next room—he then returned, and requested the deceased to get up out of bed—he did not get out—the witness Euston, having seen the prisoner strike a blow at the deceased, sprang out of bed over the deceased, and took the prisoner out of the bed-room into the workshop—the deceased then got up and bolted the door, and commenced to dress himself—Euston then requested to be let in, he being undressed; the dececased let him in, and again bolted the door—the prisoner then came to the door, and requested to be let in, saying he would show who was the cur now (the deceased had called the prisoner a our in the beer-shop)—he was not let in, but the landlord appeared on the scene, and requested the deceased to open the door to allow the prisoner to go to bed, and, at</p>

               <p>his request, the door was opened, and the prisoner was admitted—the deceased charged him with striking him on the arm with a file, while in bed, when the prisoner said "Me strike you with a file? I could have dashed your brains out with it if I had liked"—thus provoked the deceased struck the prisoner in the face; they exchanged blows rapidly, when the deceased called out "He's got a knife! he's got a knife! I am stabbed! I am stabbed in the guts!"—McGill and Euston then hurried the deceased away to the hospital, and I and Seary were left alone in the room—he commenced to dress himself to go out, and was just on the landing when the police and McGill returned from the hospital, and took him into custody—the deceased's name was James Gordon Kennock—I saw his dead body the day after his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHESTER</hi>. I was one of the supper party at 39, Saville Street—we had the usual glass of beer there, that was all, just one glass at supper—after seeing Miss Maitland to the omnibus, Mr. and Mrs. McGill, the deceased, the prisoner, and myself went to the public-house in Cirencester Place—we had some brandy there, as near as I can recollect five quarterns—we were all friendly, drinking each other's health—McGill and the deceased then went home, and the prisoner and I went to a beer-shop at the corner of Carburton Street, and had a pint of beer, and when the deceased came in he had a share of it, a glass; the prisoner treated him—there was only one pint—at that time the prisoner was a little under the influence of liquor; he was easier affected than the rest of us—I say that from my previous knowledge of him—he was not very much affected—when he has taken a considerable amount he is very much affected by it—I have seen him drunk several times—he is very noisy then, knocking about, and seems not to know what he is doing; he tumbles about greatly—I can't remember the nature of the prisoner's insult to the deceased in die beer-shop; I was so completely upset with the fight: this was before the fight—I remember well enough that it was an insult, because the deceased challenged him to repeat it, and he did; but I cannot recollect the words—he called him a name, something of that—it was a slight insult—Kennock struck Seary first, he struck him in the face—the struggle lasted about a minute—they both struck—Kennock struck him generally about the head and face; I can't say how many blows were struck; it being so short, I should not expect more than a dozen blows passed between them—Seary was knocked down more than once at that scuffle, and in the second fight, in the street, he fell several times—he got the worst of it; the deceased fell as well—I should think the prisoner fell two or three times—I can't say where he was hit—no doubt he was hit on the head as well as other parts of the body—his head was cut by falling on the kerbstone, at the last fall—he appeared to be pretty well sobered after the fight—nothing was said about giving the deceased into custody for the assault—the police accompanied us to the hospital, in case there should be such a thing—I ac-companied the prisoner home from the hospital, and put him to bed—he did not behave very quietly on the way home, he used threatening language—I don't think he was awake when the deceased came to bed—when the prisoner arose, about 4 o'clock, he was partly dressed—he slept in his trowsers; he was just as he had laid down—he went and examined the deceased's bed—he did not look under the bed, that I am aware of; I did not notice that—there was a small gaslight in the room—we had utensils in the room for the purposes of nature—there was one under the deceased's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120021"/>
               <p>bed—I am inclined to think that the prisoner went there and used it, and after accomplishing that he examined the bed; he looked to see if the deceased was in bed—I was about eight yards from that bed; the prisoner was leaning over the bed, looking into the faces—he could have seen from our bed if he had liked; but, being two in a bed, I expect he wanted to be minute—he exclaimed "Are you there, you b——"—the deceased did not make any reply, that I recollect—the prisoner was about a minute in the workshop; when he came back he went to the bed and challenged the deceased to get up now—he did not call roe any name, that I recollect; he struck him with the file—Euston put him out of the room—there was no difficulty in doing it—he did not say anything, that I recollect—he asked to be let in again—he did not try to break open the door—I noticed nothing particular about him when he came in again—I noticed nothing in his hand—he could have concealed anything if he had liked—the knife is much smaller than the file—they struck each other about a dozen times in that fight; the blows were mostly about the head and face—I saw no knife in the prisoner's hand during the scuffle—I had not seen a knife in that room in the course of that day or evening—we have the usual shoe-maker's implements in the workshop; everything we use in the trade—the prisoner did not seem excited when Euston was putting him out of the room; there was nothing particular about him; when he said he could have knocked the deceased's brains out, he said it in a determined manner—the deceased had been living there since March last; I have known him from boyhood, sixteen or eighteen years—he was quiet and peaceable, very in<lb/>dustrious, and steady—I have known the prisoner about fifteen months, since he came to Saville Street—he is quiet and inoffensive when sober; not so very industrious—I was alone with him in the room after the deceased was taken to the hospital—he was siting on a box, by the side of my bed, until they left; after that he searched for his boots, and was in the workshop searching there to get ready to go out; he was just on the landing, going out, when the policeman came—he asked me which public-house it was that was open in Portland Street, and I had just said it was the one below the church, when I heard the footsteps of the policeman—that may have been seven or ten minutes after the deceased was taken to the hospital—when McGill asked the prisoner what he had done it for he seemed rather nasty, and said "Away with your Scotch sympathies, does any more of you want any of it?"—he did not appear to be excited, he quietly sat down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He used threatening language on returning from the hospital—he said "Oh, I will be a Traupman, I will do for him before to-morrow night"—it could not exceed a minute after the deceased struck him before he called out that he was stabbed—I never saw the knife at all—McGill had his hands round the prisoner, attempting to get the knife from him when ho said "Away with your Scotch sympathies."</p>

               <p>awake then or not—the next thing that attracted my attention was the prisoner coming in from the workshop, with a file in his hand—he came forward to the bedside and looked at the deceased—he lifted the file and said, "Get up, you b——"—he struck the deceased on the left arm with the file—I jumped out of bed, and caught him, and pushed him out of the room into the workshop, and the deceased got out of bed and bolted the door, leaving the prisoner and I outside—I was afterwards admitted—the prisoner remained outside—McGill came up while I was outside in the workshop—after I had gone into the room McGill asked that the prisoner should be admitted, and the deceased opened the door and let him in—the deceased pointed to his arm, and said to the prisoner, "You have struck me with a file"—the prisoner said "Me strike you with a file; I could have knocked your brains out"—the deceased had his coat off, and he struck at the prisoner—I could not see whether he hit him or not—they both closed, and fought and struck each other—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand then—I heard the deceased say that he was stabbed; that was not more than a minute, I should say, after they had closed—McGill was with the prisoner then—I did not see whether he had hold of him or not—they ceased fighting, and I took the deceased into the workshop, and examined him—I found he had been stabbed in the belly—McGill and I took him to the hospital.</p>

I am the landlord of the house—these persons were lodging with me—we had had supper, and went out, and returned home—I was disturbed, as near as I can recollect, about 3.45 in the morning, by a noise as if some of them were jumping out of bed—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner and Euston in the workshop, and the room door bolted—Euston asked to be admitted—he was admitted, and the door bolted again—I went down stairs to put on some clothes, and, hearing a noise, I went up again, and asked Seary if he wanted to go into bed—the door was opened, and he was let in, and I went in with him—the deceased, when he saw Seary, said "See what you have done to my arm with the file," and he threw off his coat and undid his arm, and I could see the mark on it—Seary said "Me strike you with a file, I could have knocked your brains out?"—the deceased then threw off his coat altogether, drew his arm, and struck Seary right in the face—they then closed, and blows were exchanged, as far as I could see—there was a small light burning—I could not say for certain that I saw anything in the prisoner's hand at this time—I was trying to get in between them, to separate them—the deceased called out, in about a minute, or scarcely that, "I am stabbed; he has got a knife"—they were then separated—Euston brought the deceased into the workshop to see where he was stabbed—I said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by doing this, here?"—he said "Oh, your Scotch sympathies; do any more of you want any of it?" and immediately he held up the knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a knife used in the trade; not a pocket knife—it was always kept in the workshop, with other knives like it—I assisted the deceased to the hospital, and came back with a policeman, who took</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on the evening of the 6th November the prisoner was brought there—he had a con<lb/>tused wound on the forehead, with the surface broken—it was partly lacerated and partly contused—it was bleeding slightly—it penetrated the whole depth of the soft parts over the forehead down to the bone—it was not a long wound, speaking roughly, about an inch—the prisoner was intoxicated—I did not see him when he was brought in—he was sitting in a chair when I saw him—he was incapable of controlling his muscles—he could not hold up his head, he let it drop down while his wound was being dressed—he was very much affected by drink—such a blow as I have heard described inflicted on a drunken man I should say would not be liable to bring on mania—possibly it might produce compression of the brain—I mean it would not produce mania for any considerable length of time, it might happen after some length of time—the effect of compression would be to deprive a person of control over their actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was not anything like compression—I found no symptom of it, if there had been any such thing it would have manifested itself Afterwards, next day in all likelihood.</p>

I am a wheelwright, and carry on business at 120, New Street, Deptford—I have a freehold house there, which I bought about two years ago—I borrowed 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Musgrove, a butcher there, to enable me to pay off the purchase-money, and gave him a mort<lb/>gage on my property—in November last year Moody came to my house and said that he had seen Mr. Musgrove, my mortgagee, and he said he should come down on me and seize my stock and all, if the money was not paid, and the best thing I could do was to have a bill of sale on my stock and furniture, as well as the house—I told him I owed no money—he said "If I had a bill of sale I could get money on it to pay the mortgage off; and he said he knew a man who would draw it up cheap, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I told him I would consider of it—he came again, and said he had seen Mr. Wilmott; that was the man who drew it up, and he was coming to his house in the evening—it was drawn up on 3rd November, by Wilmott, and on the 4th we met at the prisoner's house again, and Wilmott produced the bill of sale, registered—he had taken it away to get it registered—it was a bill of sale from Griffiths to Moody, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and included my stock and furniture—I never owed Moody a penny at that time, or any other time—no money was ever advanced by Moody to me on that bill of sale—Moody said, after the bill of sale had been made out and taken away to be registered, that we had better write some I O U's, and date them back, to make it appear that he had lent me the money—he wrote them, and I signed them—Eldridge was not there at that time—there was no attesting witness to the I O U s—I paid Wilmott 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for drawing up the bill of sale—on the 4th Novem<lb/>ber, after it was brought back by him, registered, he put it on the table—I took it up and took it home—I kept it till the beginning of December, without it ever being out of my possession, and then Moody came and bor<lb/>rowed it of my wife; he only kept it a day; he brought it back and delivered it to my wife—I was not present—I found it there when I got home; I kept it in my possession from that time till 1st April—Mr. Moody came and borrowed it again to show to his lawyer; he kept it thirteen days, and me and my wife went and fetched it back on 13th April, two days before Good Friday—I kept it then till 15th-August, when Mr. Moody came to me and said he had seen Mr. Sorrell, his lawyer, who had agreed to lend me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I told him I had sold several things included in the bill of sale, and he had better have the deeds of the house and the abstract title, and hand me the money—I said if he paid the mortgage I would give him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own by me at the time; he said it did</p>

               <p>not matter at all; he had seen Mr. Sorrell, and he was willing to lend it on the bill of sale; Mr. Sorrell did not want the deeds, he wanted the bill of sale—I went to London with him, taking the bill of sale and these other papers; we went to Mr. Sorrell's office—Moody told me I had better wait while he went in; he took the papers in—I waited about eight minutes, and when he came out he said he had left the papers with Mr. Sorrell, and he would give me the money in four days; we then went home; I waited a week, and then Mr. Moody sent over to say that Mr. Sorrell was out of town, and I spoke to a policeman about it—Mr. Moody sent the abstract of title and the other papers over to me, but not the bill of sale—I could not see Mr. Moody—on 25th August, a man named Ford came to me and wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had the bill of sale in his hand, and asked me for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I told him I did not owe Mr. Moody 100 farthings—I took the bill of sale out of his hand, tore it up, and put it in the fire, and said it was my property; I was summoned at the Police Court for doing that, in September, and I was com<lb/>mitted for trial—I was released on bail, and when I got home I found my place broken open, and my stock, vans and cabs, and all, gone, and my work<lb/>shop pulled down—I was acquitted of the charge—I had to pay Mr. Mus<lb/>grove by instalments, on 1st February, the 1st May, and 1st August; he never asked me for a penny.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am about forty-six years old—I have been a wheel-wright all my life—I was going to have a bill of sale of Mr. Elworthy before, but I did not because he wanted so much interest—I had a bill of sale of Mr. Moody about six years ago—he did not advance me any money—it was a fictitious bill of sale; my solicitor has it—I gave it to him, there it is—Moody suggested that I should give him a fictitious bill of sale—that was a bill of sale from Moody to me—I don't know that it was done to defeat Moody's creditors—I can't tell what it was done for—I don't know—the bill of sale which is the subject of this inquiry was made in order to pay Musgrove off what I owed him—I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wanted 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay him off—Moody said I could get money on the bill of sale—I did not get any on it—I did not pay Musgrove, because Moody got the bill of sale, and came and took my stock and all—the bill of sale was given for me to raise money on—I had the stock at the time which was specified in the bill of sale—I did not raise money on my stock; I did not want to raise money; I did not owe anything—I did not want money to pay Musgrove then, but Moody said Musgrove wanted the money—he said Musgrove was coming down to sweep off the whole of the shop and stock—I believed that at the time—I should have wanted to pay Musgrove—the prisoner said he could get me money on the bill of sale, and that was the reason I gave it to him and not to Musgrove—the prisoner wrote two I O U's, and I signed them, to make it appear that he had lent money, he said—there was one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, one for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making up 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were all signed on 3rd November, and dated back; all three of them—no one was present—they were not witnessed by anybody—those are the only receipts I signed, except the bill of sale—I can't tell whether I signed a receipt for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it is so long ago—I might have done it—it is in my writing—it did not belong to the bill of sale—I don't know what it was, it is so long ago—I don't know what it refers to—the receipt is in my writing—I don't know what it refers to, it is so long ago—Moody never lent me any money at all, not a shilling—Musgrove summoned me in the County Court for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an I O U; that was last April—he got judgment agains</p>

               <p>me—I got leave of the Judge to pay it by instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I said I had a bill of sale over my property—I did not tell the Judge it was held by Moody—I said I could not pay the money because trade was bad, and I said I had got a bill of sale on my goods; I meant this bill of sale—I did not tell the Judge it was a fictitious bill of sale—I knew it would have no effect on my goods—I said I could pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and I had got a bill of sale—I did not say what one—I said before the Magistrate that I told the Judge I had a bill of sale—I did not say on what; I told the Judge it was on my stock—I had the bill of sale myself at the time—these three I O U's were all given at the same time, in November, and no one was present—after I had taken the bill of sale from Mr. Ford, and thrown it in the fire, my goods were taken away by the prisoner to the value of 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were given away, they were not sold—J mean they were sold so cheap—I don't know what they were sold for; I heard they were sold cheap—about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have the value down here—I inquired what the goods fetched—I have charged the prisoner with stealing them in another indictment; those very goods—I have the value here, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what be took out of the yard when he broke the yard open and tore the shop and all down—I know a man named Rutledge, by sight—I never spoke to him—I did not see Rutledge at the prisoner's house on 17th July, 1868—I swear that—he did not witness the I O U for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my presence—if he swears that, it is perjury—he did not—Rutledge was not present, and not a penny passed—I did not count the money, take it up, and put it in my pocket—certainly not—I swear that Wilmott put the bill of sale on the table, as I said just now, and I took it up and took it home with me—it is not true that Wilmott handed it to the prisoner—I did not tell Mr. Wilmott that I owed the prisoner 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that he held I O U's from me for that amount—I did not show Wilmott an I O U for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the prisoner's, a fortnight before the bill of sale—they were not in existence, I pledge my oath to that—Mr. Ives is the attesting witness to the bill of sale—he was present when it was signed and attested—I make wheels and carts and vans; brand new—I sometimes buy them second-hand, and I also repair them—I had to give one cart back which I bought—it was a spring cart—a man of the name of Plant called with it and said it was his—it turned out he had merely hired it, and came and sold it to me—I used to let it out—I had to give it up—that was three or four years ago—when I commenced these proceedings the prisoner sent me a writ for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the day the summons was to be tried—I have not got the writ—my solicitor has it—he is here—I made the defendant a cart ten or twelve years ago—he did not purchase any furniture of me in 1866—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is not in my writing—I never sold him any furniture in my life—the signature is not my writing—it is a bill for some furniture amounting to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—J never sold him any furniture—I believe it is not my writing—I won't swear that this I O U for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed "T.

Griffiths."—I don't recollect about it, it is so long back—I applied to Mr. Elworthy for a bill of sale to take up an award—that was in September, 1869, two months before the one made in November—I can't say to a week or so, it was nearly three months, it was either the latter part of August or the beginning of September—it was an application to Elworthy for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to take up an award—it was to be lent on a bill of sale—the bill of sale was drawn up—I did not sign that bill of sale to Elworthy because he wanted too much interest—he wanted 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three months—I did not say to Elworthy "I don't want the money because I have got it elsewhere"—I swear that my solicitor, Mr. Wilkinson, supplied the money to take up the award in September, 1869—he took it up himself—Elworthy sued me in the County Court for his costs—I did not swear then that I had obtained the money elsewhere on a bill of sale, because I had not a bill of sale—I swear that; Mr. Wilkinson paid the money—I did not obtain the money on a bill of sale—I told the Judge at the County Court I had obtained the money elsewhere, but I did not say on a bill of sale—I tore the bill of sale up but I did not owe the money, it was my own, I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; it was my property and I did not like to be robbed, that was the reason I tore it up; I had had possession of it all the time, and when Ford brought it to me I tore it up because it was no good to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was in a passion—I am no scholar, and am not able to read much—I have never in my life been charged with any offence till this man took out a summons against me—a young man named Plant came to me, and said he wanted a little money, and asked me to buy the cart, and I did buy it, and paid him for it, and I let it out for a shilling a day—there was a name on the shaft of the cart—I had it three or four weeks—I let it out to a man named Wilson, and he stopped at a public-house where the cart had been hired from; the landlord saw the cart, and stopped it, and took it to the station-house; he came down to me with the cart, and I showed him the receipt for it, and then I gave the cart up to him—I signed three receipts on 4th November—Mr. Moody wrote them, I only put my signature—I am not quite sure whether these are the ones or not—I never sold or parted with any of my furniture to Moody; never in my life—I know nothing about the bill for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for furniture—I had one transaction with Moody with reference to a bill of sale—he told me a man owed him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not get the money, but he got a lot of willow rods, and he asked me if he could put them in my cellar, and I did; then he asked me if I would take a bill of sale—I did not know what a bill of sale was—I took the bill of sale of him, and kept it, and it appears those rods he got from a Mr. Applegate, and never paid for them, and he went through the Court at the time—it was his suggestion that I took the bill of sale—he did not owe me any money—they were willow rods to make baskets of—he gave me a bill of sale on them—no money passed—Mr. Moody took the rods away, and sold some, and worked some up—I heard afterwards that he had them on credit from Mr. Applegate, and he owed</p>

I am Colour Sergeant of the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Foot, quartered at Devonport—the prisoner was in that regiment, in the name of Hurley—in 1866 he was transferred to the 61st Regiment; he had then been in the 2nd Regiment about five years—he was in my Company—there was also a man in my Company named George Williamson; he was discharged by purchase, on 26th February, 1869—the particulars set out in this document correspond with the particulars of George Williamson, as near as I can think—when a man changes from one regiment to another, certain documents go with him, and he goes in the same name; both George Williamson and the prisoner served in the same Company of the 2nd Foot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> dancer at a music-hall, and live at 6, Durham Place, Peffer Street, Borough, near the prisoner—on Saturday evening, 12th November, between 5.30 and 6 o'clock, I was standing against a shop, in Peffer Street, and saw the prisoner and a young lad, Hugh Nicholls, who asked me a question, and the prisoner said "Heugh!"—I replied "Heugh!" to him, using the word back again, as I thought he was jeering me, and I touched him three times under the chin with my fingers, not with my fist—he then kicked my shins three times, and I struck him on the eye with my fist—he then said, "God strike me stone blind, I will go up stairs, and get a knife, and rip you open"—I went indoors, and got my father to come and take care of me—I came out again, and my father and mother followed me—I then saw the prisoner at the corner of the street, about nine yards from me, with a knife in his right hand, and made my way to run home, but, in turning round quick, I ran up against a lamp-post, and he came over and stuck the knife into my left shoulder with all his force, and said, "I have done it for you"—he ran away; my father ran after him, and I followed—we caught him with the knife in his hand, and brought him to the corner of the street—I then felt so giddy that I had to let go of him—I went indoors, took off my coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and found I was bleeding very much, and went to the hospital—I still feel weak, and cannot dance now—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

I am a widow, of 34, Orange Street, at the corner of Peffer Street—on 12th November I was standing at my shop door and saw Priestley eight yards off, or hardly so much, having words with the prisoner; Priestley said "If it is kicking you mean I will brain you," and then Callaghan passed me and they both went home—in about three minutes Priestley returned and stood talking to a young man—in about a minute Callaghan came, and I went round the corner and called to Priestley, "Callaghan is coming"—I thought it would prevent quarrelling, and they were near my window—Priestley crossed the road and turned round with</p>

               <p>something in his hand, wrapped in a white handkerchief; he went into the road and said "Now Callaghan, come on," and he took an aim at Cal<lb/>laghan's head, it hit him, but I do not know whether on his hat or the brim—the thing had a knob at the tip, but it was covered over—he staggered back and Priestley backed into my window—they stood there a minute or two, face to face, and then began to fight in the middle of the road, and then they went on the pavement, exchanging blows—Priestley was backing, and they shut the shops up over the way—they both fell and rose up again, and people called out "One has got a knife and one has got a hammer"—they went on two houses further, and fell again by the wood yard, and struggled five minutes before it was over—Priestley said "I will pull off my coat and have a fair fight," and he rushed home and came out again—I did not see him stabbed, but I heard him say "I am stabbed! I am stabbed!"—I have known the prisoner from a child, and Priestley for twelve months in the neighbourhood—the prisoner is a quiet lad, in fact he is more childish, playing with children—he was in the shoe-black society for years.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—we live at 10, Francis Street, Westminster Bridge Road—ou 27th November, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was in bed, my three children were sleeping at the foot of the bed—my husband came to bed, and afterwards said "I cannot sleep, I shall get up and light my pipe"—I took no further notice but dozed off to sleep—presently I felt him at my throat—I thought the bed-clothes were off</p>

               <p>and that he was putting them on—I then felt a knife going to the bone, and blood trickling down my chest—I laid hold of the blade of the knife, and he had it by the handle—I stood straight up in the bed, and halloaed to my son "Your father has cut my throat"—I saw the prisoner—there was a light in the room, because my boys were out, and I always leave a light—I said to the prisoner "What are you up to?"—he made me no answer—I was cut across my throat, and he gave me two stabs on my right chest, which went to the bone—one of my hands was cut because I had hold of the blade of the knife—my son Patrick came and took the knife out of both our hands—he then got me out on the stairs, threw me my petti<lb/>coats and boots, and I went out of doors, and met a constable, who went back with me, and I gave the prisoner in custody—the prisoner had been in and out all day, and was very good-tempered—he is a shoemaker—he had had a little drop of drink, not very much—I know that because I was with him about an hour and a half at the "Peacock," and he only had a half-quartern of rum, and a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—that was between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—we had supper together between 9 and 10 o'clock—we had a pint of ale with it, 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth—the children were present at supper—we were on very good terms during the day and at night, and directly I had done my supper, he said "Come up to Mr. Coppin's, in the West<lb/>minster Road, and have the tooth out," as I had the toothache; and I did go, and he paid for it—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—sometimes there used to be a few words between us—he threatened me <hi rend="italic">all through the piece</hi> that I should never eat my Christmas dinner in this world—I mean for three or four months—we were not disagreeing, but sitting friendly when he would say that—I do not think he is at all affected in his mind—he was very fond of the children—he used to say that day after day—he was very odd, but I did not think he would do such a thing—he last said it a day or two before he did this.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Manor Cottage, Queen's Road, Peckham; in October last I was living with a person named Annie Augusta, as my wife—I was not married to her—I had been living with her three or four years—I believed that she had a child in November, 1868; the prisoner attended her as nurse in her confinement; it was a girl—I maintained the child until its death, in April, this year—Dr. Fair attended Annie Augusta, as well as the prisoner—I buried the child in my own vault—I registered its birth, and I have the register here. (<hi rend="italic">This was a copy register, from the General Registry Office, of the birth of Mary Laura Loe, on 13th November</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">the name of the father, "George James Loe Harper" and the mother, "Annie Augusta Harper, formerly Bennett" registered November</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1868).—I did not know the surname of Annie Augusta; not positively—about two months after the death of the first child, she led me to believe she was with child; that would be some time in June—I saw the prisoner at my house about two months after she had attended the first child, and I paid her according to what I was told to pay her for attending as nurse—I saw her again on 5th October, this year, about 5.30 or 5.45 in the evening, when I went home to dinner; as I hung my coat up in the hall, and passed through into the dining-room, Annie called out to me, "George, here is Nurse Hall, ain't you going to speak to her?"—I said, "What, that wretch in my house! get out immediately, or I will kick you out!"—I used those words in consequence of something I had heard—I was very much annoyed to see her there, and I put my hat on, and walked out to the road—I altered my mind, and turned back, and went to the house, and Annie pulled me almost to pieces, and pulled my coat off my back pretty nearly; the prisoner was there, and I ordered her out of the house—she came into the dining-room, and I accused her of bringing the previous child to my house, and she got hold of my whiskers—Annie went up stairs, and the prisoner and she had some conversation—the prisoner returned, and she took hold of me with one hand, and shoved her fist in my face, and making use of very bad language, and said what she would do to me if I dared to say such a thing—she certainly frightened me for the time, till I recovered myself—she said she would smash me, and made use of very bad language—I saw Annie Augusta on the Sunday, 9th, for a few minutes; she com<lb/>plained she was very bad indeed, and went up stairs again—I have not seen her since the 9th—on Saturday, the 22nd, I went to Brighton by the "first train" in the morning—I was supposed to have gone for three or four days, on business—in consequence of something I received, I returned to the house on the same day, about 7 o'clock—something was told to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120050"/>
               <p>—Collins, the nurse, spoke to me—Hall was not in the house when I got there—I saw her on the following morning, Sunday—I was waiting for the doctor to come, and I saw her come up the garden, some distance from the road—I went and opened the door, and confronted her—I said "You wretch, you brought a child to my house yesterday"—she turned round immediately, and, as she did so, she said "Oh, did I," and got out of the garden gate, and went back again towards Camberwell, as fast as she could—I called to one of my servants to follow me—I got up to the prisoner, and the said "What are you following me for?"—I said "To give you in custody"—she said "You dare not"—I said "I shall"—she turned down one street, and when she found I followed her, she turned round and came back into the road again—we turned into several streets, and she went to the Queen's Road Station, I went up, and said she should not have a ticket, and she left; as she came out from the station she stopped an omnibus that was passing, and got in—I got on the top of it—I could not find a policeman—she went in the omnibus about three-quarters of a mile, quite the reverse way of her own home, and when the omnibus stopped, she got out and called a cab—when she got in the cab, I dared the cabman to take her—he said he must take the fare—I called another cab, and drove after her towards Peckham; as she got to the Peckham Station, we got in front, and stopped her cab, and I called a policeman, and gave her in custody—I then went home, and found the child in the house—that was between 8 and 9 o'clock—Annie Augusta left the house the same night, and I have not seen her since—Collins, the nurse, had charge of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean really to say I have not seen her since the 9th October—I have not the slightest idea where she is—I have heard from her since; about a week or ten days ago—I have not got the letter—I believe I destroyed it—there was no date, and no name to it—it was left at my office about a week ago—it had an envelope—it did not come through the post—I did not say anything to the police about it—I considered Annie a very beautiful woman, and I was very fond of her; I was also very fond of the little girl that died, believing it to be mine—when I was home I always slept with her—my business took me away at times—sometimes I was away for a week or ten days—I was very sorry when the child died, till I knew it was not my own child—I should have been very pleased if Annie had had Another child, if It had been mine—the first time I knew Annie she went by the name of Bennett; but it was only an assumed name, Mrs. Bennett—on my oath I did not know her surname—my name is not Harper, and never was—I made the register—I gave my name, address, profession, and every<lb/>thing—I put "Harper," because I was asked to do it by the supposed mother, because I believe there was some property it was entitled to, and she asked me to do it—I did not want to make the Registrar and the public believe I was married to her—I don't know the reason—I went and got a copy of the register, and produce it here—I did not wish them to believe she was my wife—I registered it myself—I believe it was put down en a piece of paper why I should do it—I had never registered a child before—I was to register it because it was necessary—my name "George James Loe," is on the register—I don't know why I registered it as Harper—my name is not Harper—my name is there "George James Loe Harper"—I never lived as George James Loe Bennett—I never assumed the name of Bennett—Annie assumed the name of Bennett; I went by my own name—I never knew her name was Harper—I mean what I say that I registered that, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120051"/>
               <p>I believe it is perfectly right, with the exception of the name of Harper—she told me to sign it as Harper—when we went to live at Queen's Road, Annie assumed the name of Mrs. Loe; I never told anyone she was my wife—she had money when she wanted it—she might have paid some debts for me—I used to give her a cheque when she wanted money, and made it payable to the grocer or butcher—I never made them payable to order—I think I can swear I never did—I slept with her during the time I believed her to be in the family-way—she did not sleep with her clothes on; certainly not—I engaged a medical man for her, and I believed her to be in the family-way within a month of her alleged confinement—I should imagine Annie was in a bad tamper on the evening when she was tearing me to pieces—I have got some clerks—Annie did not throw an inkstand at one of the clerks; it would be me that was out of temper, not Annie—I was very much out of temper—I did not throw an inkstand; I should not forget myself as much as that—there was no inkstand thrown; there is not the slightest foundation for saying so—I may say Annie had never been to my office; I don't think she had ever seen one of my clerks, therefore I don't know what you mean; it was at my house where Mrs. Hall was, where they tore me to pieces—no inkstand was thrown at my house, that I recollect—the day Mrs. Hall was there I said "I would rather put my head under the railway-train than that woman should be in my house"—there was a beefsteak in the house that day; Mrs. Hall had some of it in the dining-room—I did not drink wine with her—she might have had some; I believe she did—they had some sherry before I got there; it was never locked up—I did not tell her on the 5th October that Annie was in a passion, and would be better after a bit—I was in a passion—I think it might have been that Annie told Mrs. Hall I was in a passion, and would be better after a bit—I did get better—I don't think I got so much better as to go down to the kitchen and tell the servant to keep the beefsteak hot for Mrs. Hall—I can't say whether I went into the kitchen or not; I think it was most likely to keep my own dinner warm—I had not had my dinner; the prisoner had some in the dining-room—you don't suppose I should sit down, too—I was walking about—I swear that I did not have some at the same time—I don't believe I told the servant to keep the beefsteak warm for Mrs. Hall—it is very possible that I had some wine at the same time she did—if there was any wine on the table I daresay I took some—I did not tell Mrs. Hall, when she went out of the room, that if I required her I would write to her—I did write to her the next day, and dared her to set her foot in my house again—I enclosed a directed envelope to her—when I ordered her out that night I challenged her with regard to the first child—I put this piece of newspaper in the letter, and requested her to return it; it is a report of the Skeplehorn's case—in that letter I dared her to put her foot in my place, and said if she was an honest woman, when she found that it made it unpleasant, she would never attempt to do such a thing—I received the piece of newspaper back from her—I received a telegram when I was at Brighton; not from one of the servants—they did not know about the child coming to the house—the nurse Collins is here—when I came up, on the 22nd October, I went into the dining-room—it was about 7.30—Collins came into the room, and said "This is a bad job, Mr. Loe"—I said "What, Collins?"—she said "There is a baby in the house, but Mrs. Loe has never been confined; and the doctor is of the same opinion"—I believe those were her words—they told me the doctor was coming that night, and I waited for him, and I was waiting for him</p>

               <p>the next morning, when the prisoner came to the gate; no one went up to Annie from 9 o'clock in the evening till 8 o'clock the next morning, and she never asked for anything—Mrs. Hall was arrested a little before 1 o'clock, as the people were coming out of church—I never saw Annie go—I saw her last on Sunday, 9th October—I don't know what time she left the house—I did not dine with her on the day the prisoner was given into custody; certainly not—from what the servants said, she must have gone about 4 or 5 o'clock—Mrs. Hall was supposed to have nursed Annie with the first child; she was there as nurse, and I paid her as nurse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went to Manor Cottage in February, 1869—I had lived there before for eight or nine years—I have a long lease of it—I have never passed by any other name than George James Loe—I have a son twenty-four years of age—he passes by the name of Loe—I lost my wife in the summer of 1868, and after that Annie Augusta came to live with me—I had not lived with her before that—I had visited her—she was under my protection—I bought a house for her in Font Street, Kennington—the prisoner went by the name of Mrs. Jones when she nursed Annie, in 1868—she was in the house three or four days—she came in and out, not like a regular nurse—I paid her for waiting on Annie Augusta, and I paid the doctor for his attendance—Dr. Farr was the doctor on that occasion, the same gentleman who attended her on the second occasion—until I received the paper of which I have spoken, I had the fullest belief that I was the father of the child that came to my house in November, 1868, and died in April—I was in no way a party to this child being brought to the house in October this year—I did not suggest or connive at the bringing of that child by Mrs. Hall—I believe when I went home on 5th October, Mrs. Hall did have some beefsteak and wine—that was before she pulled me by the beard—Annie Augusta had struck me before that, because I ordered the woman out of the house—I said I would go for a policeman, and she got hold of my coat to prevent my going—my coat was torn completely up the back—I gave Mrs. Hall something in the dining-room, and then I charged her with having brought the first child, and it was then that she took hold of me.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Loe was in bed—the prisoner said "It is all over, doctor; it is a little girl," and she immediately brought me the after-birth, and said, "See here is the after-birth," almost immediately I entered the room—nothing was being done to Mrs. Loe at that time; I went to her and said "This is very quick, Mrs. Loe, how are you?"—she seemed too ill to speak for a little time—I took hold of her hand and felt her pulse, and she was not what one would expect to find immediately after giving birth to a child; and in a minute or two she turned her head and said "Oh, is it my doctort"—I said "Yes, how are you"—she said "I am dreadfully bad, I have been very bad indeed"—she said she had so much pain in the stomach—I said "Let me feel where the pain is"—she said "No, don't touch me, I am in too much pain now"—the prisoner was in the room all the time—I then went down stairs, and went up again in about an hour—the process of bandaging was then going on—at that time I had made up my mind that it was not her child—I stood with my back to the fire, rather amused at the operation—she screamed out very much—the prisoner said "It must be done; after this is put nicely on, and the doctor has prescribed some medicine for you, you will be all right"—Hall then collected the soiled linen about the room and went out—I locked the door and said to Mrs. Loe "The presence of that woman has given me a strong suspicion that matters are not all right, and I wish to have a little serious conversation with you"—she said "Good God, doctor, what do you meant"—I said "I mean to say that you have never given birth to this child"—she said "Good God, do you mean to drive me mad with the very idea of the thing"—I said I did not wish to give her any pain, but they were my suspicions, and before I left the house I must convince myself of it—I said "Do you intend to nurse this child," and she said "Yes"—I said "Well, then, let me see your breasts"—I ex<lb/>amined them and said "Now I must make a further examination"—she said "I can't allow you to do it to-day, in the state that I am in, but you shall to-morrow"—I said "Well, now you know what I think about this matter, and I am afraid it is a very serious matter"—I opened the door and Hall came in—I said to her "Where do you live?"—she said "Where I always have lived"—I said "That is no answer to my question; I want to know where you live"—Mrs. Loe then said "No. 6, Cold Harbour Lane"—I said "I take you to be a very good-for-nothing woman, and if Mr. Loe was at home he would kick you out of the house"—I left the room and went down stairs, and almost immediately after the prisoner left the home—I went into the nursery, the room adjoining Mrs. Loe's bedroom, and there I saw the baby—it was a fine, well-developed child, but seemed very pale, and the extremities were very cold—I opened the eyelids and looked at the eye—it seemed to me in such a state of stupor, that I was under the impression something had been given to it—the ball of the eye was very much contracted, and the child really seemed to have very little life in it—I was under the impression some narcotic had been given to it—I told Collins to warm it by the fire, and rub its hands and feet, and then I left the house—from what I saw I should say that Mrs. Loe had not given birth to a child; certainly not—I should say she never had—I examined her breasts, that was all—there was no milk in them—I tried to put my hand on the stomach, but she would not allow me to—I saw the child again on the Sunday, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I was told it had not cried or taken any food, and it still seemed to be under the influence of some narcotic—it was wanner than when I saw it on Saturday—I heard that the prisoner had</p>

               <p>been arrested on the Sunday, and I visited her at the police-station, and I got the name of the mother of the child from her—she said it was Farrant—I saw the child given up afterwards to Mrs. Reeves, the aunt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not examine Mrs. Loe when she told me she was three months gone again—I could not tell, from the examination I made, whether she had had a miscarriage—I should have known it if she had—the child being taken out in the air would tend to make it heavy—if the child cried a great deal it would weaken it—children, after they are born, don't sleep for hours—they mostly cry—I am a married man.</p>

Dover, Richard Cleaver, and John Barnes</hi>)—the Richard Cleaver there mentioned is the prisoner—I served a notice on Peed—I have a copy of the notice—I attended at the County Court—the action was brought before the Court; it was not tried; they did not go on with it; it commenced; it was struck out; they did not appear—an action was afterwards brought on the bond—they justified; I was a witness; there was a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

                  </hi>. I have rooms, at 93, Regent Street—I am a retired officer in the army, having been a lieutenant in the Dragoons, and also in the Hussars—about 20th September last, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for a partner, with from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is a copy of it: "Part<lb/>ner, active or dormant, with 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; can be admitted with or with<lb/>out lucrative and agreeable occupation, in London, into a highly respectable and profitable undertaking. Principals (who will please make appointments, if in town) only, to Partner, Mr. Steel, 2, Spring Gardens, S.W."—At that time I was residing at 56, Commercial Road, Landport, near Portsmouth—I answered it, asking for full particulars—I received a reply, but have not got it—I don't know what has become of it—I think I must have lost it—I well recollect the tenor of it; it was in these terms: "I want 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to establish a new dramatic club. I have taken eligible premises in the Strand; and I also want 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bring out a newspaper, to be called the <hi rend="italic">City Argus</hi>"—I replied to that letter, stating that as I could take no active part in it, I would advance the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided proper securities were given to me—in due conrse I received this letter, marked "B"—to the best of my belief it is in the defendant's handwriting—I had conversation with him afterwards as to it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "15, Parkstone Road, Peckham Rye, London, S.E., September 24, 1870.

In reply to your favour of yesterday, I should be happy to place in your hands a Policy of Insurance for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and promissory note, and give you a mortgage or bill of sale upon the whole of the furniture and effects of the club, which I am going to buy with the</p>

I offer this liberal interest, because I know the value of the property, and what I can do with it; and also because I am not giving you realizable security, though, if you feel disposed to make me the advance, I will send you documentary evidence to show that I have a good business, and can repay your principal and interest quite independently of the success or failure of the club. I shall esteem it a favour to hear from you per return. Yours very faithfully, Thomas Cannon. To H. Bulkeley, Esq.")—I had a correspondence with the defendant, and on 1st October, in reply to a letter of mine, asking for an appointment, I received a telegram, stating that he would meet me on 3rd October, at the refreshment-room, Waterloo Station, at 2 o'clock—I left a letter there for him, appointing an interview at the Hotel de Provence, Leicester Square, from 3 to 6 o'clock—the defen<lb/>dant came to me there at 4 o'clock; that was the first occasion of my meet<lb/>ing him—there was some talk about the club—I asked him if it had promise of success—he maintained that it had—I can't tell you the whole of the conversation—when it came to the business-part of it, I asked him if he had the securities with him—he said he had not; but he held a form of agreement for me to sign, and if I would give him the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would send me the securities—I declined that, and said I would look over the agreement, and in the mean time he could have his securities ready—I received a letter from him in reply to that, which I have since destroyed; I have destroyed a great number of the letters—he wrote to me urging me to fulfil it—I thought there was nothing to come from it, and I wrote and told him that as the Peruvian Stock, in which I had invested, was so low, I could not give it to him then—after that he called-once or twice at my lodging, at Norwood, with letters—I saw him—the next time I met him by appointment was at the Peckham Rye Station, on 20th October; that was in reference to some letters he had written to me, stating that he had the building, 21, Wellington Street, Strand—I asked him how he had the build<lb/>ing, when I saw the board still up to let—he said he did not know how that was; but he had the premises, and there was some conversation, in which he said I had better give him the money, or he would take action in Chancery, an adjudication, or something of the kind, and I should lose all my money—he said he was the man to do it, because he had been a solicitor himself for fifteen years—the result of that interview was that it was agreed I should make an appointment between that day and Monday—I think it must have been the 24th or 25th, both for him to bring his securities and me to bring my cheque—on Monday, the 24th, I wrote appointing to meet him at the building, 21, Wellington Street—when I got there I found him walking outside the building—I asked him to go up stairs—he said he had not the key with him, he had forgotten the key, or some remark of the kind—on my remarking that it was very unfortunate, that no business could be done in the street, he asked me to give him the cheque in the street and he would send me the securities—I told him I had the cheque with me, but it was not made up, upon which he wanted me to go into a public-house to draw it up—I declined doing so, saying that I never went into such places, but that if he liked to come down to Norwood next day I should be at home till 10 o'clock, and after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120064"/>
               <p>that I would go to the Crystal Palace Library, where I always went till 12—it was understood that he was to bring the securities with him; it was mentioned—next day I saw him at the Crystal Palace Library—I asked him at once if he had his securities with him, that I was prepared then to give him a cheque—he then produced an old policy of insurance, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on his own life, six months out of date, and on my remarking that it was out of date he said that I could get it renewed, and that I might deduct 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing so, out of the cheque—of course I declined—I laughed at him when he told me that, because of course I knew it could not be correct—he then said "How do I know, unless you give me your cheque, that it will be honoured;" and he asked what bank it was drawn upon—I told him the London and County Bank—a proposition was then made that it should be sent to Mr. Lawrence, a solicitor—he proposed that—I asked him if he knew Mr. Lawrence—he said he did—I said I should be most happy to place it in his hands, and I wished I had done so before—he then left me, but on going down stairs I met him coming from one of the refresh<lb/>ment stalls—he came up to me and said "You won't make it two months hence?"—I said "No, we will make it for Friday, the 28th" (this was on Wednesday the 26th), and he said "You will write to Mr. Lawrence and mention about deducting 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the cheque for the insurance"—imme<lb/>diately I got home I wrote to Mr. Lawrence, stating the whole particulars—on the Friday, about 9 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my lodging at Norwood—the servant brought up an envelope with his name written on it—I went down and found him in the room, with his hat on—he asked me if I was going to finish the business with him—I told him I must refer him to Mr. Lawrence—he then asked me if Mr. Lawrence had returned me my cheque—I said he had not—he said "But he will, because he told me he would send you back your cheque, and have nothing to do with you"—I told him I did not believe him—he then said I had altered all the affair to Mr. Lawrence—I said I had not, but I would have no further conversation with him personally, anything else he had to communicate must go to Mr. Larwence—he then said "Well, I have my remedy, and unless you give me a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, I will go to the Lambeth Police Court, and have you arrested for forgery in ten minutes"—he said this in the most bullying manner—I then told him to leave the room—he did so—he said nothing more—that same evening I received this letter, marked "I"—I believe it to be in the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Lambeth Police Court, Friday, 1 p.m. Sir. The detective officer from Norwood has been here with me for the warrant to arrest you, but the matter has to stand over till to-morrow morning for the production of one of your letters, which I did not happen to have with me. I do not wish to cause unnecessary annoyance to your landlady and her other lodgers by bringing a policeman to the house, so if you think proper to let me know this evening where you will surrender, any time after 11 o'clock to morrow morning, you can spare her that disgrace and unpleasant<lb/>ness. Yours obediently, T. Cannon.")—When I got that letter I treated it with great contempt, because I thought the man must be drunk who wrote it—next day my landlady brought me up this letter ("K"), and asked me to explain it—to my best belief it is also in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "15, Parkstone Road, Peckham Rye, S.E., October 28th, 1870.

Yours very obediently Thomas Cannon.")—Mr. Lawrence also handed me another letter, but not the name day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the next letter he showed me—I had signed my name "Buckly" in the first letter I wrote in answer to the, adivertisement—that is the way the name is pronounced, but not the way it spelt—I told the prisoner at our first interview how my name was spelt—in the draft of the agreement it was spelt "Buckly"—I said that was not quite the correct way of spelling it, although it was the way it was pronounced, and I told him the way it was spelt—it was not on that occasion that I altered it in his presence—I have been served with a writ by the prisoner far breach of contract-three were served, one at my banker's, one at the Magistrate's Court, and one at my landlady's—I don't know whether it was for breach of contract—it was for debt, I believe—this letter ("M") was also kmded to me by Mr. is the prisoner's writing "November 4, 1870. Sir. By the advice of Messrs.

Yours very Obediently, Thomas Cannon. To H.

               <p>then you first communicated with me I was at Portsmouth—after that I came to town and went to Norwood, and stayed at the Hotel de Provence two or three days—I went from there to Norwood, and then to 93, Regent Street—I gave that address to the Magistrate, and also to my bankers when I opened an account at the London and County; also Portrayne, Ireland—I did not tell the Magistrate that I came from Cheadle, Stafford<lb/>shire, and that it was the Buckly property—I said my family came from Cheadle—I adhere to that now—I don't know Mr. Thacker, a solicitor, of Cheadle—my family is a Staffordshire family; they do not reside there now, they used to—I never told you that I belonged to an old Hampshire family living in the Isle of Wight—I will not swear whether or not the policy was sent down to me when I wrote, saying I would give 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">looking at tome letters</hi>), I can't tell whether these are the letters you sent to me, but this is the paper they came in—I saw some of them were marked in pencil with certain names on them—I won't swear the policy was not inside, but I can't tell you—what made me know that the policy had expired was this, "On grant of undermentioned insurance premium, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—you said I could get it renewed—you did not tell me so till I saw it had expired—you did not say I could deduct it from the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you said I could deduct it from the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you told me you had been a solicitor, and you would ruin me in a court of law, adjudication, or something of that kind—I received this letter from you (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter complaining of delay, and stating that if he did not hear from the witness before 11 the next morning he should file a bill in the County Court for specific performance of the contract</hi>)—I told you that I was the original allottee of the Peruvian scrip; I think they were issued at 82—I don't recollect at our first interview referring you to Mr. Lawrence as my family solicitor—I don't recollect even mentioning Mr. Lawrence's name to you—I did not say "I think the agreement will do very well, Mr. Lawrence, of Bedford Square, is our family solicitor, I will take it to him to look at, and he will write to you to make an appointment about the money"—it is entirely false, every word of it—you first suggested the name of Mr. Lawrence to me at the Crystal Palace—as far as I recollect that was the first time his name was mentioned—(Mr. Lawrence was my solicitor on one occasion)—it struck me as rather strange; I think I said to you directly, "Do you know Mr. Lawrence"—I did not say before the Magistrate that I did not believe you intended to cheat me—I did believe it thoroughly—I believed you meant to get the money from me—I was not served with a writ before I commenced these proceedings against you; long afterwards—I got Mr. Emanuel to write me a letter—there has only been a writ served, no action was brought—you were in the Court at the time the summons was applied for, and you went out, I suppose, to go to Mr. Emanuel—the date of the summons is 12th October—the application was some days previously—the Magistrate was so engaged that day that he appointed a special day for hearing it—I told the Magistrate I had a great number of letters from you, more or less of a threatening nature—I daresay I said as many as three a day—I think very often I did get three a day—a great number were thrown into the fire without reading—this letter ("N"), dated 12th October, is my writing; it is dated from 56, Commercial Road, Landport—I was at Norwood when I wrote it—I intended to have returned to Landport—I had given up my lodgings there, but I could take them whenever I liked—I had no intention to deceive you, I gave you</p>

I have just called to ask whether that is the case, and shall feel obliged if you will leave me an answer should you be going out again.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I read you some portions of Mr. Bulkeley's letter, stating some of the things he required; amongst others was the lease of the premises—you did not make any demand to have the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the letter I received from Mr. Bulkeley, marked "Q" (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "14, Surrey Villas, Woodland Road, Upper Norwood, S.E. 25th October, 1870. Dear Sir. Would you oblige me by arranging the following affairs. I would lend a Thomas Cannon 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of forming a new Dramatic Club, on these terms, that he gives me a policy of assurance on his life for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a bill of sale for three months for amount, and a bill of sale on all furniture and other property that may be put on the above-named Club, 21, Wellington Street, Strand; also that the lease of these buildings be deposited with me. But should the whole of these securities not be deposited at your office at 12 o'clock on Friday morning, I shall decline, most positively, to have anything to do with it. For these reasons I wrote to him at the commencement of the present negocia<lb/>tions, 29th September, that if he could have all the papers aforesaid in this letter ready for me, I would give him a cheque for the amount, and on my coming to London for that purport, he came without bringing a single document, wanting me to give him the money on his promise of sending them; as this I did not like, I invested the money, meaning to have nothing more to do with it, but for a whole month he has done nothing but pester me with letters and visits again. I said if he would come to me with the papers, I would give him the amount, so he came, bringing with him as security an old Policy of Assurance, six months out of date, and wanted me to give him a cheque, saying I could get it renewed, the policy, and he would send me the remaining papers, but I refused to give him a cheque on</p>

               <p>the conditions. I enclose you a cheque for the amount, that you will please to deduct your expenses out of; but as I feel from Mr. Cannon's behaviour that I shall lose this money, I beg of you not to give it him until the whole papers are in your office, and after 12 o'clock on Friday I shall decline the affair; I will come up on Friday, and see you. Your obedient servant, H. Buckley.")—I remember your calling upon me; you did not say you had been referred to me by Mr. Bulkeley, as his family solicitor—I did not so understand you; you said you had been referred to me by Mr. Bulkeley, and you understood I was his family solicitor—you sent in a note by my clerk—I never knew you before—I refused to give the name of the gentle<lb/>man who introduced Mr. Bulkeley to me, because Mr. Bulkeley had con<lb/>sulted me in the meantime, and I had seen the letters you had written to him, to his landlady, and to myself, and I considered them impertinent—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the first occasion of seeing me, did you tell me that Mr. Bulkeley was a man not likely to bring business, or anything; that he had been nego<lb/>tiating with a client of yours for some weeks, and then backed out of the bargain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think there is a word of truth in it—I never said a word of the kind—I did not go to a deed-box, and take out a parcel of papers—that is founded in truth—when you spoke about Mr. Bulkeley, I referred to the papers to see who he was—I had forgotten the name—I simply took out a paper to refer to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long address, commented upon the evidence, and stated that, intending to establish a Literary and Dramatic Club, he had inserted the advertisement in question, with the bond-fide purpose of obtaining the funds to start it; that his negodation with the prosecutor was broken off in consequence of his discovering that he had deceived him by a false representation of his name and position, and that the present prosecution was only instituted upon his taking measures to bring the prosecutor to account for keeping him so long out of the money he had promised.</hi>
