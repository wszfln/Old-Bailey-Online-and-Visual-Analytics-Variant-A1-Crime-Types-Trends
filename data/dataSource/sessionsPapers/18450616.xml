                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Ingatestone-batt, under Lord Petre. I was in town on Wednesday, the 11th of June—I was coming from Cromer-house, Chelsea, towards the Eastern Counties Railway—I wanted to get down by the mail-train in the evening—on my way I fell in with the prisoner—I asked him the nearest way, because I was afraid I should be too late for the train—he said he was going the best part of the way, and he would show me the way—on the way we called in at two public-houses, and had two pints of ale—when I got to the railway I found I was too late for the train—we then went and had another pint of ale—I was about to leave, when the prisoner asked what o'clock it was—as soon as I drew my watch from my pocket, he snatched it from me, and ran away up Sun-street—I pursued, crying, "Stop thief I"—when I came up the prisoner was in custody, and a lad said, "Here, sir, is your watch"—it was secured round my neck by a strongish ribbon—it broke in two as he snatched the watch—it gave way at the first jerk—it required form to break it—I gave the watch to the policeman.</p>

On the evening of the 23rd of May I was engaged in serving Gale and Smith with mouslin-de-laine dresses—Gale wanted to purchase a dress, and Smith was with her, helping her to choose—Smith objected to different dresses—they bought none—whilst showing them the dresses, Gale whispered something into Smith's ear, which I could not hear—Smith told her to go to the window, and see if she saw anything there that pleased her better, and also told me to pick out any<lb/>thing she pointed out—I was near the window, and did not go out—Gale went out, and came back, saying there was nothing in it to please her—Smith was anxious to get off, saying her husband was wanting his tea, and she had to kindle a fire—I went to another part of the shop to bring some more dresses, and when I returned the prisoners were gone.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 29th of May, about five o'clock, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and presented an order—he said he was going to Friars, Smithfield-bars, (which is a tobac<lb/>conist's,) and would call as he returned—the order was signed "Joseph White, Clare-street," who is a customer of ours—I looked at it after the</p>

               <p>prisoner was gone, and sent it to Mr. White—the prisoner returned before the person came back—I said the tobacco was not packed—when the person returned from White's, the prisoner was told the order was not White's, but was forged—he was taken to the station—I was handing the order to the clerk at the station—the prisoner snatched at it, and got part of it, and I suppose he must have eaten it in the scuffle, as his person and the place were searched, but we could not find it—I have the other part of it—I believe the words were, "Please send by bearer 12lbs. of fine shag, and if you are sending by our way on Saturday let me have 12lbs. of birdseye returns; let the shag be good. J. White, Clare-street"—I am sure the order produced at the station was the same the prisoner pro<lb/>duced to me—I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 20th of May, about half! two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty, and saw the prisoners coming over the garden-wall of No. 16, Glo'ster-place, Camden-town—they saw me, and went back again—I went into the garden and found them in the shed—I asked their business there—they said they came to go to the water-closet—I asked how many gardens they had been into—they said into the ad<lb/>joining one, but denied going any further—I saw footsteps where they had been into other gardens—I took them to the station, returned and traced footsteps from 16, Gloster-place to 23, but could not trace them further—about half! five o'clock in the morning, I heard Mr. Boyce's house, 5, Great Camden-street, had been entered—the prisoners were a hundred yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw them—I found footmarks of two persons in the garden of No. 3, having gone over several gardens, I traced them to Mr. Boyce's, and to No. 6, (Dr. Leifchild's,)—I found the wash-house had been entered at the wash-house window, which was open—the shutter was let down inside—it is a sliding window and looks into the garden—I traced footsteps from there down to a summer-house at the bottom of the garden, and there found these three brushes—I found a bath-curtain in the wash-house folded up and laid on the stones, not taken away—there is a narrow passage between the dwelling-house and wash-house—the same roof goes over part of the passage—I cannot recollect whether the wash-house door opens into the kitchen without going into the passage—I came to Newgate by order of the Magistrate the same day when the prisoners were committed, for their shoes—they were brought to me by a tall stout man—he gave me four shoes—I took them to Nos. 5 and 6, tried them there and in several other gardens—I found they exactly corresponded—I first put them close to the marks making an impression by the side of them, and afterwards put them into the marks—the prosecutor's garden had been newly done up and was soft—the impressions under the trees were very plain and fresh—I measured them with a string, the width and length—they correspond with the shoes in both cases—the house is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

On Friday, the 23rd of May, I was on duty on Snow-hill, and just at the end of King-street, Snow-hill, I saw a small spring cart come out of King-street, and going down Snow-hill—the deceased was in it—he was driving at the rate of four or five miles an hour—he appeared to go very steadily, just out of the walk—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about four or five yards behind the cart, at the time it came out of King-street, going in the same direction—the prisoner was driving that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was going at a very swift pace, as fast as the horse could trot—he overtook the cart, and went on the right-hand side of it—I should think there was a space of twenty-five feet between the foot-path and that side of the cart—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> ran against the right-hand side of the cart, struck it, turned it over on the side, flung the horse on its side, and broke the shaft—the deceased was thrown out on his back in the street—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped directly—I ordered the by-standers to take the deceased into the public-house just opposite, which they did—I took charge of the prisoner on the spot—he appeared the worse for liquor—if he had driven carefully he could have avoided the accident—I afterwards went into the public-house, to see how the deceased was going on—he was quite insensible—he was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and live at Isleworth. I was in com<lb/>pany with William Temple on the 23rd of May—we had come fam Dixon's, in Barbican—I was on horseback before him—there was no one in the cart besides him—we were going about five or six miles an hour, slow, just out of a walk—when we got to Snow-hill a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> drove against him on the offside, knocked the cart over, and the horse down, and Temple fell out—he never spoke afterwards—I was in the act of looking back at the time, hearing the noise of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and was just in time to see him fall from the cart—the blow had been given—I cannot say whether there was room enough for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to have passed the cart—I should think there was—there was plenty of room where I was, and he was close against my horses—I had been in company with the deceased all day—we had not been into any public-house—we had two pints of porter with our dinner, which I drank most of, and that was all that we had all day—he was quite sober—when I saw him fall, I got off my horse to assist him—I saw him into the public-house, and afterwards assisted him to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you observe that the whole of the near side of the way down Snow-hill was uninterrupted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the deceased was not driving the cart on the off side—he was driving on the near side. I should say—the cart was more on the left hand than the right—I do not know the width of the road there—I should say it is more than thirty feet wide—I did not notice that the road was greasy—the horses did not slip about much—it is stone paving, I believe, not M'Adamised, but I do not know—I have since looked at the cart—the shaft is broken—we came from Dixon's, down Long-lane, across Smithfield, down the hill, and down King-street, I suppose it is—I do not know the name of the street—I am not much accustomed to London, nor was Temple—I knew my way home—he told me to go on gently, and he would follow me, and that was how I came to be first—I did not see how it happened—I saw no gas alight—it was a quarter to eight o'clock—it was quite light enough to see anything that was done—it was a wet evening, and duskish.</p>

I was in Holborn on the 19th of April, when the Cambridge coach came in to the Bell and Crown—a pas<lb/>senger got off the coach, and two boxes belonging to him were moved off the coach—the prisoner wanted to carry them—Lester went in and called the old porter belonging to the house—the porter came, strapped the two boxes together, and carried them away—when the prisoner saw that, he said to Lester, "What business had you to call the porter out?"—as soon as the porter went away he took and struck Lester in the eye with a tobacco-pipe which he had in his hand, which caused him to lose his sight—I could see that he had a pipe in his hand, he was smoking it just be<lb/>fore, as the coach came along—I did not say anything to him—I removed Lester on one side directly under the archway, and saw that he was dan<lb/>gerously injured in the eye—the prisoner did not say anything when he struck him, but he stood in an attitude ready to come at him again, with his fist shut, but a crowd came round him seeing his eye injured, which caused him not to come at him again—I took Lester to a surgeon with a young man, and removed him from there to the hospital, as the surgeon directed me—I had never seen either the prisoner or the prosecutor before—I called a policeman, and the prisoner made his escape before the</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 27th of May, a little after eight o'clock, the prisoner came to my house in very great distress, crying—he wished me to go-with him to see a female who had taken poison, and requested me to take the stomach-pump with me—I asked if he knew what kind of poison she had taken—he said, "Yes, oxalic acid,"—I took the stomach-pump, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160026"/>
               <p>some antidotes—I went with him to the Coach and Horses, up to the top room of the house, and directly he got within the door he asked if she was dead—I do not think any answer was given—I went into the room, and found the woman lying on the bed, quite dead—I asked when they saw her breathe last—a person said, "About five minutes ago"—she appeared to me to have been dead about five minutes—the prisoner was in very great distress in the room, and said, "Oh, I must tell you all about it, if even I should be hung for it"—he then said he had been following her about the previous evening, along the bridges, and bad great difficulty, in preventing her from throwing herself into the Thames—at the same time he gave me a letter from his pocket—I gave it to the officer, after reading it—this now produced is it—he said that letter had been written, expecting they would have been both dead—he then brought two small pieces of paper out of his pocket, marked, "Oxalic acid, poison"—ow printed and the other written—I observed a red stain on his trowsers—he said he had been sick, and vomited—he then gave me a glass tumbler, tod it had the remains of a salt at the bottom, and part of an orange in it—I think he said, "That was the glass I drank"—he said they had agreed to take poison together, but that he himself felt very sick, and brought bit up—a few white particles dropped from this paper marked "B," and I could feel a crabbedness on it—here is a paper with a few grains of oxalic acid in it—I can tell it by the taste—after saying they had agreed to take poison, he said they had been in very great distress, they had been discharged from their situation at a moment's notice, and they did not know what to do with themselves, they were without a character—I asked him why they had been discharged—he said he had been seen coming out of her bed-room—he asked me what he was to do—I told him to keep himself quiet, he had better consult a law-man, but that I must give him in charge, which I did—the tumbler is not here—I analysed the contents of it—the result was that it contained oxalic acid—a few minutes after I got home another tumbler was brought to me by Davis—I had no conversation with the prisoner about that—I asked him where he purchased the poison—he said he west towards Islington, and got some there, bnt could not tell me where, ex<lb/>actly, and the other parcels he got at different places—I should say half—an ounce of oxalic acid would destroy life—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased's body—I attribute her death to inflammation of the lining membrane of the stomach, and the whole of the intestines, particularly the small intestines—that could be produced by any acrid poison—the kidneys and spleen were very much congested, filled with dark coloured blood—there was dark coloured blood in the cavity of the chest, the pericardium or bag in which the heart rests, and the abdomen and pelvis, and a dark thick fluid blood in the stomach, of the consistence of tar—I attribute all that to the poison—oxalic acid is the most likely poison to produce it, it was so general—I have no doubt her death was caused by poison—I forgot to mention that the walls of the heart were thin and flabby—I analysed the contents of the stomach, but could detect bo oxalic acid by any test—persons generally vomit very freely before death, and the blood would very likely, and does decompose oxalic acid, and oxalic acid decompose the blood, so that it is very difficult when oxalic acid is once mixed with blood to find it.</p>

               <p>have done wrong; I had better state the whole I know: a little after fire I was told by the landlord of the public-house to get out of his house in ten minutes; I did not say nothing to him, but went up stairs, packed up my things, and the porter brought them away for me to the Horse and Groom; I then waited for her coming away with me, about half an hour, and the porter took her things with mine into the Horse and Groom; then we came outside and asked, both of us, the landlady of the Horse and Groom to take care of them, and said we should be in again in the morning; she said 'Very well, I will do so for you;' we then stood out in tit Horse and Groom yard for a few moments, and talking a moment or two together what we should do. I asked her what Mr. Ridler said to her; (be is the keeper of the Bell and Crown,) and she said he gave her ten minutes to get out; then we went into the Horse and Groom and called for a pint of half and half; we both sat down there and cried for about half an hour, and then she pulled out her money and laid it on the table, and she said, 'You take that, for I'm going to make away with myself in the Thames,' and she got up and went out; I immediately followed her and catched her, and said, 'I won't let you do anything of that sort;' I advised her to take hold of my arm and let me take her home to her friends; she said, 'I cannot think of doing so;' I walked down Holborn-hill with her, and then she ran away from me again and said, 'I will go and throw myself in the Thames;' I caught hold of her again and said I could not let her do so; we went up Brownlow-street, went into a coffee-shop, and called for two cups of coffee; she said to the landlady, 'Can we have a bed to-night:' (this was on Monday night;) she said 'Not for ladies;' we came out of that house and asked one another where we should go and what we should do; I said, 'Let us go up Gray's-inn-lane, that is the most likeliest place, I know where we can get two beds;' she said, 'If you don't be with me this night I will destroy myself;' I said,' How can you think of doing so;' we inquired in two or three houses in Gray's-inn-lane; we could not succeed there; then we went into Leather-lane, and asked a man in a coal warehouse if he had accommodation; he said, 'No,' but be directed us to No. 6, opposite, the Coach and Horses; there the woman said she had no accommodation, and then we got the accommodation as you have heard stated at the Coach and Horses; we were shown up stairs, as you have heard, and went to bed together; in the morning she got up and grasped hold of a knife on a side-table, and she said, 'I will make away with myself now;' I immediately seized it from her and told her I could not see her do so;—we then dressed and went down stairs; she asked the lady if we could have the bed to-night, and she said, 'Yes, if you are com<lb/>fortable,' and the girl advised me to pay for the bed for the next night; we came out of the house and came away; we went to a coffee-shop in Hatton-wall; I called for two cups of coffee and two rolls, and she called for two eggs; I read the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, and read of the suicide of a young wo<lb/>man by taking oxalic acid; it so preyed upon her mind that she deter<lb/>mined to do so herself; we came out, and I said, 'What shall we do;' so she said, 'We will take a walk up as far as Islington, and in the chemists' shops as we go along get the oxalic acid;' I said, 'Is there no means left but destroying ourselves;' she said, 'No, not anything;' I then said, 'As you have so fully made up your mind to die, I must die too;' we then walked up to Islington, and going by the chemists' shops I went in and she stood by the door; I asked for a penny worth of oxalic acid at four</p>

I then went up stairs to her again; she said, 'What a time you have been gone, I am waiting to die.' I put a little hot water into each tumbler, and she stirred it up. I then said, 'Now don't be in a hurry, come kneel down with me, we must pray first; where shall we go to?' she said, 'I don't know how to pray.' I said, 'I will pray fir you,' and I prayed God to take us, and she was in such a dreadful way after we prayed; she jumped up off her knees, and stirred it up again, and gave me the glass in my hand, and she came and took the other. I said, 'Stop one moment, let me lay this letter out of my hat on the side<lb/>board.' I did so, and we then both drank it together; in about five mi<lb/>nutes after we were both very sick; I brought mine all up off my storaach, and I thought she had, but I found she was dying, and I ran down stairs, and asked where was a surgeon's, the nearest place, and then ran into a baker's shop, and the young man here ran with me to a druggist's, a few doors further. I ought to have said I asked for a doctor. I asked in the druggist's shop if there was a doctor there; they told me to go to No. 26, Hatton-garden. I did so as fast as I could run; a boy was standing at the door. I asked if the surgeon was within? he said, 'Yes.' I asked the surgeon to come with me with the stomach-pump, for ihe young woman was dying; when we got there she was dead."</p>

                  </hi>. I am now Lieutenant-governor of the Gold-coast. I commanded the ship <hi rend="italic">Saracen</hi>, on the coast of Africa, for nearly four years and a half, from September, 1837, until June, 1841, for the protection of British commerce, and the preven<lb/>tion of the slave-trade—I am acquainted with the Gallinas—I have here a rough plan of the Gallinas, of my own making—it is not a measured</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160031"/>
               <p>correct plan, merely a rough sketch of my own—the river Gallinaa is not navigable for large vessels, nor for such vessels as the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>—there was no trade carried on at the Gallinas, that I could ever discover, or that I ever heard of, but the slave-trade, slave-trade alone—I have landed there frequently—there were six or seven slave establishments there previous to our destroying them—at the latter end of the year 1840 we destroyed six or seven slave establishments, by convention with the natives—I cannot say how many there were during the whole period, from 1837 to 1841, but in 1840 the naval squadron on the station destroyed six or seven—when we landed to destroy them, the Spaniards, or foreigners in possession of them, fled—I can only mention who were the reputed slave factors—I was not present, and never saw any of them purchase or sell slaves, but we found slave barracoons and several slaves—there were from 800 to 1000 given up to us—they left the slave establishments as we advanced upon them, but we caught several before they were out of the slave esta<lb/>blishments, and they were afterwards acknowledged by the natives to have been taken out of the slave establishments—I knew a person named Rolo, connected with the Gallinas—I have seen him at the Gallinas—I never saw him as a slave-dealer, but he is a reputed one—I have had conversa<lb/>tion with him at the Gallinas—I saw him at a place called Dorabocoro—there is one very large barracoon there, and several houses belonging to it—I did not see Rolo in the barracoon, or in either of the houses—he landed from a vessel that had been seized by Captain Denman—the vessel was not seized in my presence, but I saw him land—I do not recollect the name of the vessel he landed from—I know the name of Angel Ximenes—I have not seen him at either of the stations on the Gallinas—I have seen him at Sierra Leone—I know a person of the name of Alvarez by repute, I do not know him personally—I have seen a person who has been pointed out to me as Alvarez, at a small town close to the Gallinas—I saw no barracoons at that town—barracoons are large buildings used for keeping slaves—the number they will contain depends upon the size—they are sometimes very small, and sometimes large—I have never been far in the country myself—I have only seen barracoons near the coast—they are places where slaves are kept, until an opportunity is had for conveying them away—in March, April, or May, 1839, I captured a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>, sailing under the Russian flag—when I absolutely seized her she might have been eight or nine miles from the Gallinas, but she had been previously much closer—when I first gave chase to her she was about two miles from the Gallinas, on the day I captured her—I had chased her before—a person named Bernardos was in command of her—after capturing her, I sent her to Sierra Leone, for the purpose of prose<lb/>cuting her in the Spanish and British Mixed Commission Court—she was not prosecuted there, on account of her being under the Russian flag, the Court refused to receive her into Court—I then sent her to England, to place her in the hands of the Lords of the Admiralty—I accompanied her to Sierra Leone—Bernardos was on board, and went to Sierra Leone with her, and from there to England—in Feb., 1841, I again captured that same vessel, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, and sailing under the British flag—she was then at anchor in the roads at Gallinas—the prisoner was then in command of her—I knew her to be the same vessel instantly, on going alongside—when I captured her as the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi> she had slave equip<lb/>ments on board—I cannot at this time state correctly what she had—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160032"/>
               <p>was equipped for the slave-trade—she had water-casks and coppers—I cannot exactly state the amount of her slave equipments, but she was equipped for the slave-trade, which justified me in seizing her—I did not accompany her to England, I sent an officer with her—when I boarded the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi> I saw the prisoner on board—I recognized the vessel, and talked to him about the vessel—I asked him for the vessel's papers, and he gave them to me—before that, I told him I recognised the vessel as being a vessel that I had before seized—I think he said he did not know, that he was ignorant of my having captured her before—I cannot now recollect whether I mentioned to him the name she bore before—it is so long ago I cannot recollect what my conversation with him might have been with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick.</hi>

Dear Sir,—I had thoughts of sending the schooner under your command to Tampico, but, as will be plain to your good understanding, in such a direction she cannot run along the coast, owing to her small burthen; and for that reason I have resolved to let her remain in this port, under the care of the bearer hereof, to whom I beg of you to deliver her up; and immediately after having done so, you will apply to this your house for the purpose of receiving what may be remain<lb/>ing, so that nothing whatever, under any circumstances or reasons, may be left outstanding. This motive affords me the opportunity to give to you the most expressive thanks for the commission you have just executed so much to my satisfaction, and about which I have written to friends Zulueta and Co., of London, for them, under circumstances, to prefer you, as will always be done by him who has the pleasure to subscribe himself at your disposal, and your most affectionate, obedient, and assured servant, who kisses your hands, <hi rend="smallCaps">PEDRO MARTINEZ."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in her Majesty's Navy—I commanded a district on the African coast during the years 1840 and 1841—the river Gallinas was in my district—I was within sight of that river about eight months, scarcely ever out of sight, watching it closely—there is no trade whatever carried on there but in slaves, and the goods im<lb/>ported for the purpose of buying them—there were six large factories for slaves there, and two small ones—barracoons are one part of a factory destined to receive the slaves—a large barracoon will hold 1000 slaves or more—I knew Ignatius Rolo—he is now dead—I saw him at Gallinas, and also, I think, on board the <hi rend="italic">Wanderer</hi>—I am not certain whether it was on board our ship or another—I know he was the factor of a slave-factory called Jekree—he and his brother were the agents—I never saw Don Thomas Buron—I have captured slave ships—there are parts of Africa where nothing but lawful trade is carried on, and many parts lawful and unlaw<lb/>ful, but at Gallinas there is no lawful export trade—there is no export, except of slaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you take the log, on Tuesday 17th Nov., what would be the position of the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a little to the westward of the Scilly Islands—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a chart</hi>)—this is sufficiently accurate for me to answer the question by—I should say, on the 18th she would be about 120 miles from Cork—the wind is stated to be SSE in the forenoon, and varia<lb/>ble in the afternoon—she would be 800 or 900 miles from Cadis on the 18th—he would have to pass the coast of Portugal to make round across the Bay of Biscay, and he would round Cape St. Vincent—the wind was fair for Cork on the 18th, as direct as it could blow in the morning, but foul for Cadiz; but in the evening it was fair in either direction which she wished to go—it says variable here—I cannot precisely say how the wind might have been, but by the courses it does not appear there was any sud<lb/>den change—the wind shifted to the NE during the night of the 18th, and continued so on the 19th, and during that time it was blowing a heavy gale, and the ship's head SW, and it makes her go three knots and three and a half—it is perfectly impossible, in ships going before a heavy gale of wind, to be going three and a half, especially the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, which was a very fast sailing vessel indeed—the wind was fair for Cadiz, and she was steering a proper course—on the night of the 19th the wind seems to have shifted SE—it was foul wind for Cadiz, but she might have taken advan<lb/>tage of it where she was—on the 21st it was fair for Cadiz—the fact is, the log is so incorrectly kept, it is impossible to judge anything about distance—the latitude and longitude puts it in one place, and the distance from cer<lb/>tain places puts it in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, it appears they arrived at Cadiz on the 6th of Dec, having been 120 miles from Cork on the 18th of Nov.; now, considering what the wind was, and the speed of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, how long would it take her to get to Cork? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might have got in next day easily, I should say, if she wanted repairs on the 18th, and the wind was foul for Cork, she should have looked out for another port, which would have been Lisbon—there is no question if she wanted repairs she should have gone back to Cork.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a vessel comes into a port with dollars and money, and wants slaves, would not that be the readiest mode of obtaining them, the ship having to remain the shortest time in port? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—the more convenient course is to send a cargo out to the slave factors to prepare slaves ready for that cargo, and send other vessels out for the slaves—the ship discharges its cargo, then goes away, in many cases, and by arrangement another ship comes and takes the slaves—that is gene<lb/>rally the most convenient plan—that makes two vessels necessary—the Gallinas is about 200 miles from Sierra Leone—I went there almost im<lb/>mediately after the barracoons were destroyed—I do not admit that I de<lb/>stroyed them—they were destroyed by the native chiefs, between the 17th and 26th of Nov.—I arrived at Sierra Leone about the 28th of Nov.—I carried up the news—there is no slave dealing at Sierra Leone—the aver<lb/>age time between that port and England, is six weeks—that would be a very good passage—I should say it would be about a month to Cadiz, and six weeks to Plymouth or Portsmouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased, William Iles, was brought there on the 2nd of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon—I believe he was led there—he could stand—he had a contused wound, about an inch long, above the right eyebrow—he also appeared to have bad concussion of the brain, from which he was recovering—I sent him to bed—the wound went down nearly to the bone, but not quite exposing it—I am quite sure it was inflicted by a blunt instrument—he appeared to have lost some blood, but not much—I did not bleed him—I applied something to the wound, and gave him calomel—he was a very old man, and it would not have been right to bleed him—on the following morning he was much better, the wound looked healthy, and he was perfectly sensible—he said he wished to leave the hospital—I advised him strongly to stop, and told him he was not out of danger—I expected inflammation of the brain or erysipelas might follow, either of which might end fatally—he left that morning—he came again on the 7th, and then had erysipelas of the head and face, which I should think had been on him two or three days—it was of a very low character, snow<lb/>ing that the powers of life were much depressed—the wound was still un<lb/>healed, still open—it was looking dry, but not otherwise unhealthy—I ordered him to bed, and all was done that could be done to arrest the progress of the erysipelas, but he died on the morning of the 10th of May—the cause of death was the erysipelas and its effects—I could not say positively that it was produced by the wound—erysipelas of the head and face sometimes occurs without any injury, and, as it came on when he was out of the hospital, I could not say positively that it was produced by the wound—it is probable, but I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner five or six years—about last Christmas I was taking a drunken man home—I saw the prisoner take the man's purse out of his pocket, and go away with it, and I gare information of it to the policeman—one Monday, last May, I went to tie Red Lion public-house in Holborn, and saw the prisoner there, about a yard from the doorway—directly I entered the house, he said, "You b—old rogue, I will do for you"—he caught hold of my neckcloth, and three me right down on my back on the floor—he kept hold of my neckcloth, and held it for five minutes, until I was nearly strangled—I could not get up—he was standing straight across me, leaning down towards me—a female in his company interfered, and said, "Let him get up," or he would have strangled me—she did not pull him off—she persuaded him to let me go—he let me get up, and then gave me a very violent blow in the breast, as I thought, with his fist—I did nothing to him—I found it a very curious feel, and as he pulled his hand away he cut the top of my thumb, and I saw the blade of a knife in his hand—he walked out directly—I am down on the bench, and had a pint of beer—my breast felt very painful—when I had had my beer I went home—I did not undress, it was so painful, I laid down with my clothes on—in the morning I found I wat covered with blood all over—I found it so about two hours after I got home—I complained to my brother about it—this is the coat and waistead I wore—the wound was right in the centre of the breast—here is a mark of bloood inside the waistcoat all round—it is a double-breasted waistcost—it is not cut, as it was not buttoned up to the top.</p>

               <p>morning, the 19th of May, the prisoner came in with a female—he was talking to her about the watchman accusing him of taking a purse out of the pocket of a pawnbroker—he swore against the prosecutor's life—he said the moment the watchman stopped his bread, he would stop the watchman's wind—he swore what he would do with him if he got hold of him—the moment Dowling came in, the prisoner caught hold of him and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you are a b----y old rogue"—he caught hold of him by the neckerchief, and held him down on the ground, strangling him, hold<lb/>ing him by the neckerchief, and pulling the upper part of it—he held him to until he was black in the face—I called out to him, but he did not loosen him—I called to him again, and then went to run round the bar, and he allowed him to get up—after that there was a deal of swearing, the prisoner swore two or three times over, and said several times that the moment he stopped his bread, he would stop his wind—after that Dowling moved towards a desk at the end of the bar, from the prisoner—there was a deal of talking between them about this robbing the pawnbroker, and the prisoner laid hold of <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> laid hold of his nose—I was busy at work, and was not aware after seeing him get off the floor, that any<lb/>thing but angry words was going on, and did not pay attention to it—the prisoner aecused <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> of having sent him to Bow-street for taking the pawnbroker's purse—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said, "It served you right," and he wrung him by the nose, and at that time I certainly saw a great deal of <hi rend="italic">fumbling</hi> about the chest—the prisoner struck Joe on the breast, I mean, and the moment he finished that, he ran out, leaving the woman behind—it was not a gentle blow—it was a sort of <hi rend="italic">thumping</hi> with both hands, while <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> had hold of his nose—I did not perceive that the prisoner was drunk in the least—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know what he is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man's badge on—by stopping his bread he meant taking away his li<lb/>cense—it was mentioned before to the female, something about the license, because it would be put on his license about his being sent to Bow-street—Dowling took the prisoner by the nose after he got off the ground—the prisoner was striking him on the breast at the time he had hold of his nose—they were both scuffling together—I am hardly able to tell which laid hands on the other first—it was at the same time, he had hold of him by the nose, at the time he was striking him on the chest—when I saw them one had the other by the nose, and the other was striking him on the chest—he struck him two or three times—I think with both hands—it was a sort of pummelling—they were close together—I saw no violent blow.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 30th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Garden-court, Hoxton-market, and as I was passing by a wall leading to the rear of the prosecutor's premises, I heard a sort of rumbling noise as if somebody was climbing the wall on the other side—I was about three yards from the wall, and there is a short corner in the court, where I lose sight of the wall—I re<lb/>turned to where the sound came from, and met Hasler—I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160051"/>
               <p>him before—I said, "Halloo, where did you spring from?"—he said. "Why, down there," pointing down the court—I said, "Down where?"—he said, "From home"—I said, "Well, come and show me where you I live"—I took him about four yards down the court to where the corner is, and then saw Mack way jump over the wall from the other side into the court—there is no thoroughfare to the court—I called him, and said, I "Where did you come from?"—he said, "Oh, out of the privy"—I said, "What privy?"—he said, pointing to Hasler, "There, he knows"—Mackway then showed me a privy in the court, and said, "Out of I there"—that was on the court side of the wall, but he had come I over the wall—I said, "What did you do over that wall?"—he said, I "Oh, I don't know," in rather a careless manner—I then brought them up into Queen-street, at the end of the court, and got the assistance of two more constables to hold them while I went down to see what I was done—I then heard another person down the court—I went down, and met Twaites in the court, covered with soot—(Mackway had soot on his jacket and boots)—I said, "Well, and where did you come from?"—he said, "Down there, out of the privy"—there are two privies in the court—I asked him to show me the privy—he said, "That one," pointing to the same that Mackway did—I said, "Why it is impossible for you to have come out of there, I have only just looked into it"—he said, "Oh, but I got down the hole"—I looked at his clothes, and could not see any soil about him—there was soil in the privy—I then gave him over to the other two constables, and got on the wall, and saw two window sashes of the shed broken, and the frames—it was the sashes of two windows—there is no glass, but it is covered by canvas—the canvas over two windows was broken down, and the frame-work broken of both sashes—I saw a number of footmarks in the garden—it had been very wet that morning—the shed is detached from the dwelling-house—no one sleeps there—I traced them over the wall—I took them to the station, and found lucifer matohes on each of them, a box on one, and two parcels in the pockets of the other two—I took off their boots, and with Cripps, another constable, compared them with the marks in the garden—there were three different sizes—it was daylight—we found all the footmarks to fit—we called the people of the house up, then went into the yard, and found the kitchen window in the area wide open—it is a sash window—I found these three bobbins, one lying in the area, and two outside on the pavement, also this poker—this large nail, or <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, was on the back parlour window cill, but the poker had been dropped on the pavement—I compared it with that window which had been prised up—it was not broken open—it was forced about half an inch up on one side, where the mark of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was—they had endeavoured to raise it up—we went into the kitchen, and found a number of things strewed about, and the place all in confusion—I compared Mackway's boots with some marks. on the wood inside the, kitchen window cill—one of them was smothered with soot, and being wet, the impression was left—it exactly corresponded with where the naila were, and everything exactly—in the dust-bin I observed several marks which agreed with Twaites and Mackway's shoes—the marks were very plain indeed—I went into the shed, and there was some dirt there, apparently where one had eased himself, and footmarks as well of two persons—the shoes of Mackway and Twaites corresponded with those marks—there was a box which had been disturbed in the kitchen, and several bobbins strewed about the ground besides the three I have mentioned—I saw the</p>

               <p>marks of a sooty hand on the side of the area window, and in the shed there were marks of soot—the soot had come from the kitchen—then was a quantity of soot there, as if somebody had been up the chimney—Twaites was very sooty—there was soot on the hob of the kitchen, it if it was knocked down by a person getting up—there was a mark on the hob about the size of Mack way's boot, but we could not be certain of that—we traced them over the shed into the dust-bin, where they dropped from a wall, they would then be in Torrey's yard—they could get up to the shed by the assistance of the water-butt—after getting over the wall they raised the kitchen window, and got in there—nothing was broken about it—it had been lifted up, as if left unfastened.</p>

I am the wife of John Parker, and carry on busi<lb/>ness as a grocer, for Mr. Ward Slater, at No. 1, John's-row, in the parish of St. Luke's—Mr. Slater does not reside there himself—we live there as big servants—two families lodge in the house beside myself and husband. On the 5th of June, about ten minutes after seven o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs from my bed-room, and opened the shop door—I did not take down the shutters—I went into the parlour to make a fire, leaving the door between the parlour and shop open—while making the fire, I heard some one walk into the shop—I took no notice at first, thinking it was the milk-boy—I afterwards heard a tapping noise, as if some one was sounding a chest of tea—there was a large tea-chest there full of tea—I directly turned my head, and saw the prisoner standing on the tea-chert, with his hand on a bag of coffee that stood upon it—I saw him sounding the chest of tea, as if to see whether it was full or empty—I directly ran into the shop—he took the bag of coffee up in his arms, and ran out at the shop door—I ran after him as fast as I could, and told him to put that coffee down, it did not belong to him—he dropped it on the cill of the shop door—I stood in the middle of the pavement, and kept calling out, "Stop that man, stop that boy, that is him!"—he had not got past one shop window when I first called out—he ran very fast, and almost ran over a witness—I should think he dropped the coffee about three or four yards from where he took it up—he ran down Brick-lane, up Garden-row, and Plant-street, and up John's-row again—I called out both ways, but no one would stop him—I saw Mr. Clark—he would have caught him had I called out "Stop thief," but I had not presence of mind, I was too much frightened—this is the coffee—it is the property of Mr. Ward Slaten.</p>

On the morning of the 5th of June I went into his mother's house, about half-past seven o'clock, as near as I can guess, I will not say to five minutes—I went into the room—there are but two rooms, and they join each other—I saw the prisoner in bed, and spoke to him—I saw him lying in his bed, talking to his sister's baby—I am no relation of theirs.</p>

I life in the Green-yard, over the stable of the Commissioners—from what my wife told me I followed the cart on the 24th of May—it went to No. 88, Wilson-street—I took possession of the haybands there—I weighed the bands, and they weighed 83lbs.—I know something about hay, as I have been a gentleman's coachman—these were not such bands as are used for tying up hay—I have some of them here—there were fourteen dozen bands altogether—I remember the prisoner coming to Sir William Magnay's service—I had I been over the premises—there were very few haybands there—I should I say half a dozen were the most that were left there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go over the stable sufficiently to ascertain that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am certain there were not more than six or eight bands left—some of these bands that are here would go round a proper sized truss, and some would not—they are of various lengths—I do not know on what day the prisoner came to Sir William Magnay's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police. Mr. Magnay, and I, and Haydon, went to Dodge's house on the 18th of April—I had some conversation with Dodge—part of the time I was alone with him in the back room, or workshop—he said to me, "Well, this is a bad job, ray character is ruined; do you think I can do anything with Mr. Magnay?"—(he had been previously to that in conversation with Mr. Magnay)—I said, "I do not know; you can try if you like"—I asked if he could show me the invoices for these things—he said, "No"—he showed me a catalogue of a sale—I searched for invoices, but found none.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership, as a wholesale stationer, with Sir William Magnay, at College-hill. We supply her Majesty's Sta<lb/>tionery-office with paper—we had desired Haydon to watch our carts—on the 18th of April he gave us information—I went with him and Todhunter to Dodge's house—Haydon went in first, and I waited in the immediate neighbourhood—I then went up, and had some conversation with Dodge—the greatest part of it was while Haydon and Todhunter were searching the house—I said to him, "How came you to buy these goods? you knew you were acting improperly"—he said, "I bought them of John Ell"—I said, "Where are your invoices for these things?"—he said, "I have none"—I said, "You know you have acted very improperly; I shall give you in charge for this"—he said, "I did not know I was doing wrong;" on which I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "Ten shillings"—I said, "Ten shillings a ream for paper weighing twenty-six pounds! you must have known you were doing wrong"—he said, "If I have done wrong I am sorry for it; I hope you will not prosecute me"—I said, "I have already given you in charge; you must go to the station."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were speaking at this time about paper found on the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said, "There is that paper I have bought," pointing to some yellow-wove foolscap, and some blue double-wove foolscap, "and I have five reams at Yarranton's, the ruler's"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "At Compton-street, St. Giles"—he said, "I hope you will be lenient"—I said "I will make no promise whatever"—he then alluded to his being just commencing business, having a first-rate character from the Bank of England; that he was going into business; that a friend and hit sister would advance him money, and his prospects in business would be completely blighted by his being taken up on such a charge—his wife was not there then; she came in about a quarter-past eleven o'clock—he said, "If</p>

               <p>I had taken the advice of my wife I should not have got into this <hi rend="italic">scrape</hi>, I should not have known Nicholson"—I found very nearly twenty reams of paper there, which I believe to be our property—about thirteen reams were partly made into books—a great part of it was opened ready to be made into books—Ell had not any authority on my pact to sell that quan<lb/>tity of paper—I had no dealings with Dodge—I did not know him at all—if a tradesman wanted to purchase paper of us, either our clerk would call and offer him a sample, or he would call at our warehouse, and our clerk or myself would sell it him—the paper spoken of was worth from 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream—if a person wanted to buy a ream, I should sell it for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we do not send out articles without invoices—Mr. Wickwar has the charge of the selling—Ell was a sort of under-warehouseman, under Wickwar, but he had nothing to do with selling paper—the Stationery-office, to which it was Ell's duty to go with the paper, is in Great James-street, Buckingham-gate—Dodge lives in Athley-terrace, City-road—I have an idea of where the receiving-house is, but I do not know it—it is somewhere in the Waterloo-road—Corduroy is the wagoner—I omitted to say, that in the conversation with Dodge, he stated he had received two parcels of paper the day pre<lb/>vious—he pointed to the counter, and it was the blue-wove double foolscap that I was telling you about just now—we deliver our paper by our own cart or wagon, and sometimes by the porter, but never by the Delivery Company, unless it goes off the stones.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Magnay. I never gave the prisoner these wrappers—he would not be justified in taking them—each of these wrappers has contained paper—I cannot tell what has become of the paper which they contained—the prisoner was wagoner to Messrs. Magnay—he would not have an opportunity in load<lb/>ing the wagon of putting extra paper in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Sir William Magnay—I have examined these wrappers—the outer one of them is the only one that is defaced amongst them—the defacing of the wrapper shows that the paper has been fairly sold—if we break a ream we deface the wrapper—if we leave the wrappers without being defaced we are liable to a penalty of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the wrappers not being defaced shows that the paper they contained has not been sold—the prisoner would not have any right to the wrappen or the paper—if there had been any waste wrappers they would have been in a state of defacement—I am able to say that these are not waste wrappers.</p>

Mr. Wickwar brought some furniture to our house—it was generally brought on Saturday night, and the prisoner generally brought it—it waa mostly in paper wrappers—I have got a piece of the paper here now, which I found after the inspector of police went away—I gave up a great deal of these paper wrappers to the inspector—some were drab, some blue, and some brown—I occasionally burnt it under the copper-hole when I washed—Mr. Wickwar gave it me two or three days after the goods came into the house—it was wrapped round the goods—there was a good deal of this left in our house, and Mr. Wickwar told the prisoner to take it away—there were some pieces of this kind, some drab paper, and pieces of matting, and patchwork—he told him to take it all away, but a good deal was left—I had a great lap full two or three times—I sometimes lit the fire with it, and sometimes I had paper and did not use it—when the inspector came I gave up some to him—there was one piece of blue I gave up to him, and some I had burnt—this is one piece that was left—Wickwar did not tell me he bought this paper—it came in round the things—the prisoner is no acquaintance of mine, I never saw him in my life before the Saturday night when he brought these goods in—I am still servant in the same house—it it Messrs. Bayford and Bowdler's offices—this wrapper has M. A. G. on it—the wrappers I saw, had the same general appearance as this bundle of blue wrappers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son. I remember Mr. Wick<lb/>war having some goods at Mr. Magnay's—he was saving them up to get them ready to furnish a house—they were up in the first floor at Messrs. Magnay's—my father removed them for him—they were wrapped up in wrappers, and patchwork, and brown paper, and matting—these blue ones are what I call wrappers—after we removed the furniture there was a good deal of wrappers and covers left in the hall, and Mr. Wickwar told me to tell my father to take them home, they would do to light the fire—they were taken away and put into the stable amongst some things of my father's, some tubs and a sack of hay-seeds, the dust of the sweepings, and a child's chaise—we had no room for it and put it there.</p>

               <p>there was a great quantity of it burnt—it was the latter end of Feb. or the beginning of March when we took the things to the house in Great Knight-rider-street—I knew of these things being left at Messrs.

About the 28th Oct., 1843, the prisoner came to my master's, and said he wanted a strong horse to carry a heavy gentleman, a friend of Mr. Harvey Combe—we had a chestnut gelding—I turned it out—the prisoner approved of it, and said he would go and show it to the gentleman—I told him it was twelve guineas a month, if the gentleman hired it, and if he sold it, sixty guineas—in about two houn he brought back the horse, said the gentleman was not at home, and he should require it another time—he came again the same night, and said he should require it in the morning, and I had to send it to Story's-gate by Hurd, one of our men—I did not give the prisoner any authority to sell the horse—he told me it was to go on job, or very likely to be sold—he might not have sold it without consulting Mr. Winch—the next I saw of the gelding was in a stable, near Trinity-mews, in the Borough, on the 30th of Oct., 1843.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been living in a house for the space of six months; if the parties were here they would speak about my character; I said I would live at an hotel while they were repairing it; Mr. Bodman offered me the first floor, to avoid any expense; I accepted the offer; the theft has been committed in the house, and because I was a foreigner, Mr. Bodman went by force into the rooms, and I was accused; all the time I was there my con<lb/>duct was that of a gentleman; he had workmen, with liberty to go to any part of the house they thought proper, and to go away at their pleasure; the opera-glass was taken from the parlour, and the cream-jug from the kitchen; it was impossible for me to have done so; I do not know still where the kitchen is situated, or the parlour, where I have never been; if you look at the dates of the tickets, you will see they correspond with the days the workmen were in the house, in the parlour and the kitchen; the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Samuel Ralph Jutson; he has a shed on his premises, which are in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. We had been missing lead from the roof of that shed for the last five or six weeks—we had Mr. Hopper placed there to watch—he was watching there last Sunday night—my attention had not been called to the roof of the shed shortly before that—I had seen it about two months back—on Mon<lb/>day morning, about five o'clock, intimation was given to me of this parti<lb/>cular fact—I went to the shed, and found the roof had been broken through, and a vast deal of lead had been taken from the premises—part of the roof had been taken off, where a party could get through, and then drop the lead—the prisoners had then been taken, and the lead was gone—I did not see whether the lead fitted the roof, but I saw a vast quantity was gone off the roof.</p>

On Sunday night last I was stationed in the second floor back room of another house which commanded a view of the roof of Mr. Jutson's shed—on Monday night I was there again, and about one o'clock on Tuesday morning I saw the prisoner Satch on the roof of the shed, within four yards of me—I could see he was getting the lead up—he made some noise in doing it—I saw him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I made any alarm—I saw him dispose of two pieces of the lead by putting them down through a hole in the roof—I then went and placed two other constables in other parts, and on my return I saw the prisoner still at work—I called out, "What business have you there?"—he looked round, but could not see any one—he then stooped down, and began his work again—I called to him a second time, and said, "Why don't you be off, you have no business there"—I then turned my light full on his face—he dropped down on his stomach, worked himself backwards, and got down the hole like a rat—I then ran round into a court which led away from that part of the pre<lb/>mises, and while I stood there the two prisoners were brought down by a constable that I had placed there—I afterwards went into the shed, and found two pieces of lead—I found one piece corresponded with the lead on the roof, where it had been broken off—there was a great deal of lead gone from the roof—the piece that corresponded was on the shed—it was partly cut off, and partly on—the other two pieces were in the shed—at the time Satch put the lead down the hole, I could not hear anything—it appeared to be handed down—I should say there was some one underneath to re<lb/>ceive it, it was done so quietly—the lead we found in the shed was right under the hole—I did not hour any noise by its falling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On Tuesday, the 10th of June, I arrived in London from Hull—I had left Hull on Monday, the 9th, at three o'clock—I brought with me a chest and a bag containing my hammock and bedding—I put the chest on board myself—I had lashed it up myself, but before that I had put two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes into a small box, and put that box into the chest—the chest was locked, and had a very good lock too—I saw the chest stowed away in the hold, and I saw a great quantity</p>

               <p>of luggage put above it—when I arrived in London I found my chest in the same state as when I put it into the hold, and quite secure—I do not think it could have been opened on the voyage—when I landed I saw the prisoner—he offered his services to me as a porter—I made some inquiries in his presence, of the City police-constable, No. 533—I hired the prisoner to take my chest and hammock to the Dundee Arms, which is a very well-known house—I have used it these ten years—it is about a mile from the wharf—I did not accompany him—I went to an eating-house—I after<lb/>wards went to the Dundee Arms, but did not find my property—I was looking for the prisoner all Tuesday evening, but I could not find him—I saw him the next day in Thames-street—I said, "Halloo, my hearty, you are the man I am looking for"—he said my things were at the station—I took him with me to the station—I there found my chest and hammock-my chest was not in the same state as it was when I gave it him—the lashing had been disturbed, and the lock had been forced—I opened the chest, and the small box and money were gone—I then examined the ham<lb/>mock, and missed an oil jacket and three flannel shirts—I told the pri<lb/>soner about the loss—he said he knew nothing about it—I went with the constable and a female to the prisoner's lodging, at No. 8, Norfolk-street, Southwark—I searched, and found my small box in a cupboard—when I opened it the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were gone.</p>

I was going past the Admiralty on the 27th of May—it had just struck nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing against the gate—he said to me, "Boy, I will give you a halfpenny to go over the way, and get me a quartern of the best gin"—he said he could not leave the gate—he gave me a little stone bottle from his breast pocket, and gave me a half-crown—I went across to the Duke of Clarence—I asked for the gin, and gave the half-crown the prisoner gave me to Mrs. Jones—she spoke to me about it, and told me to go behind the bar—I went, and took my two little brothers with me—she then asked me to go into the parlour—I went across the road to look for the prisoner, and could not find him—they then gave me into custody.</p>

On the 20th of May the two prisoners and Liddy came to my house—Liddy called for some gin—he gave me a good sixpence—Flood asked for a pio of ale—I served her, and she gave me a shilling, which she untied from the corner of her handkerchief—I put it into a small wooden bowl in the till where were two or three fourpenny pieces and two sixpences, but as other shilling—they drank the ale at the bar, and then went into the tap-room—Liddy then came out, and spoke to me, and brought me a had shil<lb/>ling—I looked into the wooden bowl immediately, and found the shilling which Flood had given me was bad—in about a quarter of an hour Tustin came from the tap-room—she called for a bottle of spruce, and gave me a bad half-crown—she went back to the tap-room, and I sent for a constable—before the constable came the prisoners came out of the tap-room, and went a little way, but not out of my sight—I fetched them back—I gave the two shillings and the half-crown to the officer—I marked them in his presence.</p>

In consequence of something on Saturday afternoon, the 7th of June, I directed Lawrence, the officer, to be on the look out—he came to me on Sunday morning, about half-past nine o'clock, and told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had seen the witness, Na<lb/>than, come out of the yard with a sack—that he followed him into Liquor pond-street, to see where he went to, and he went into Mrs. Isaacs'shop, that after he had put the oats down in the shop, he told Nathan he wanted to speak to him, and brought him up to our house—Nathan was present, and Lawrence asked him where he got it from—he said, "Mr. Lloyd's"—he asked whether he saw any of Mr. Lloyd's family, me or my mother—he said, "No," he did not—the prisoner said he had served him with a sack of oats, but he had not received the money—Na<lb/>than said he had paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said so two or three times, and said it was in four half-crowns, he was not certain what other money, two shil<lb/>lings, or one shilling and two sixpences, he did not know which—upon that the prisoner was searched in my presence, and four half-crowns, one shilling, and two sixpences, were found on him in a bag by itself, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in another pocket—other money was found in different parts—the prisoner made no remark on its being found, only that he had not received the money—his duty on Sunday morning was to clean the shoes and the horse—he had no authority to sell corn on the Sunday—I have the prin<lb/>cipal management of the business—it is not our practice to sell things on a Sunday—he had made no communication to me about having sold these oats—if anybody wanted anything, the prisoner should come and ask the permission of myself or my mother—if it was a regular customer, I should not object to serving them—he had said nothing to me about this sale—we had strictly forbidden him to serve anything on the Sunday.</p>

The prisoner has been in my awe<lb/>vice three weeks—from information I received I measured some pieces of silk and muslin, which my wife had to make into a dress—last Monday, on measuring it again, I missed three-quarters of a yard of yellow silk half a yard of yellow crape, and two half yards of muslin—about six o'clock in the morning of the 17th I went with an officer into the pri<lb/>soner's room—I told her I was going to search her boxes with a policeman—she said nothing—she helped take the things out of her box—I foun</p>

On the 9th of June, on coming down stairs in the morning, I missed some halfpence from the till—I searched the hay-loft—I found a lot of coppers done up in a large piece of paper, with some tobacco—I took them into the bar—the prisoner came in soon after and I called a policeman—I then took the coppers into the tap-room, and asked the prisoner if he knew anything about them—he said, "No"—there was a little tract amongst them—I said, "We will look at this book"—the prisoner then said, "That is mine"—he snatched it out of my hand, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I am a tailor, and live in the Commercial-road—Henry Jolly was in my employ for several months, and I discharged him—I got an officer, and went to William Jolly's house, where all the prisoners live—I saw Phebe who is Henry's mother, and Mary Ann Jolly, who is his sister—I asked if Henry was at home? his mother said he was not—I asked if I could see his new great coat which he had, and which was made out of two yards of cloth—his mother said it was in his own box, which was locked—his sister went up stairs—I saw her break open his box, and there we found the great coat, which was made of the two yards of cloth which he stole from me—in his box we found, belonging to me, three</p>

               <p>short lengths of black silk velvet—we then examined a box, which the mother said was the box of Mary Ann Jolly, who was I believe gone at that time to fetch her father, William Jolly—in that box, which I think was not locked, we found a laventine scarf, two duplicates, and some few buttons—while the daughter was gone to fetch the father, we opened a small box, in which the father kept his private papers—(he stated that it was his)—and in that we found two dozen of my bill-heads—a chest was then opened, which contained the father's and mother's clothes, and in it we found a dress made of Alpaca cloth, which I had lost a considerable deal more than ten yards of, and also a pair of trowsers, made of stuff which I have a piece of here—while we were thus looking, William Jolly, the father, came in, and he solemnly declared that no person was allowed to touch his box in which the bill-heads had been found—that box was not locked—we found a small handsaw of mine under the stairs below, and a small telescope, which was in the looking-glass drawer, in the lower room—I do not know who slept in that room—we found a number of small things belonging to me in various parts of the house—I found my property in almost every cupboard and drawer and box that we opened—I think the whole amount of my loss is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think William Jolly is a flax-dresser—Mary Ann Jolly, I believe, makes slop waistcoats, or is a dressmaker—she said her brother had made her a present of this laventine dress—this is the dress—there is about four yards of what we call laventine silk in it—I believe she has only worn it about one sabbath—I have examined this, and the whole of the things—I believe they are all mine.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house, proceeded up stairs, and found a box of Henry Jolly's—the next box to that was one which the daughter said was hers, and the mother said so also—in that I found this scarf, and some satin for a bonnet, in the same box, and four duplicates—one of them is for a gown—in a box which the father and mother said was theirs, I found this Alpaca dress—in the small box containing writings, which was the father's, I found these bills—I looked in different cupboards, and other places down stairs, and found a number of articles, whieh I produce—I asked the father how he accounted for these articles being in his house—he said he knew nothing about them—he said he had seen the bill-heads in his box, and had spoken to his son about them, and he said they were no consequence—I asked Mary Ann Jolly how she accounted for these things being in pawn—she said they were gowns belonging to her, that some of them had been given to her—but she did not say by whom, and some were purchased—I asked how she accounted for the scarf, she said it was given her by her brother, who told her he had purchased it cheap—I asked how she accounted for the pos<lb/>session of the silk for the bonnet, she said it was part of the silk that the scarf was made of—I asked her mother how she came by the Alpaca dress, she said she had purchased it for mourning.</p>

I placed it on the counter, between myself and a milk-can, about four inches from the edge of the counter on my side—the counter is about two or three feet broad—a person on the other side of the counter could not see it—I took one of the sovereigns partially out, but recollecting that that money was counted for the Joint Stock Bank, I would not pay it out of that, and I replaced the sovereign, but did not particularly wrap up the notes—I did not refold them so tightly as before—I then took out my purse, and was going to pay in silver, but finding I had not silver enough I paid it in two half-sovereigns—I had a number of half-sovereigns in my purse—she gave me a receipt—some conversation occurred about some losses I had had lately, and my not paying the poor woman's rent any longer, I then said, "Mrs. Davies, since I was here I have lost the sight of one eye," (which was the case, and that might have caused me not to observe this parcel)—she commiserated me about it</p>

               <p>—I remained there about ten minutes—I then drove off, and called in Charlotte-street, Bedford-square—I paid no money there—I then stopped in Fleet-street, at the office of the Anti-Corn-law League, to see Mr. James—he was not at home—I had no occasion to put my hand in my pocket there—I went from there straight to the London Joint Stock Bank, and found that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was gone—I told my groom to drive back directly to Mrs. Davies'—I recollected at that time that I had left the money there, and could swear to the spot at which I left it, because when I got back I found the milk-can was moved a few inches from the spot—when I was at the Joint Stock Bank it was as near half-past twelve o'clock as possible—that is in Prince's-street, by the side of the Bank of England—we travelled very fast back to Mrs. Davies, and got there within ten minutes—I dare say I was there about a quarter to one o'clock—I saw the prisoner and her daughter—I said, "Mrs. Davies, I have left my money on your counter" (I did not say how much then) "I left it in this spot, I can take my oath I left it here"—she said, "I have not seen it"—I pointed out the spot, and said, "Who has been in since I left, if you have not seen it?"—she said, "No one, but a woman for some milk, and two boys for a halfpenny worth of milk"—she said she knew the woman, but did not know where she lived—Miss Davies, I think, then asked me in the prisoner's presence what the amount was—I said 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is in one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and ten sovereigns—I believed what the prisoner said at that time, and thought somebody else must have taken it—I said "This woman must be found; if you have not seen it, she must"—I went the same night with a paper offering 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for it—I think I saw both the prisoner and her daughter—I gave the paper to Miss Davies—I then got bills printed offering 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—this is one of them—I took that on the Wednesday—I showed it to Miss Davies in the prisoner's presence, and she said she would put it in the window—I gave one at most houses in the neighbourhood—I went to make inquiry every day—I inquired about the woman that had come for the milk, and I think the prisoner told me she had seen the woman, and she had not seen any money—I afterwards communicated with Sergeant Brannan, and in consequence of information, accompanied him to the prisoner's house on the Thursday night—Brannan and Tate went into the shop first—the witness Wells was called in next, and then I was called in—the prisoner denied having seen the money.</p>

I was charged with uttering counterfeit money on the 10th of May—I was taken into custody, and made a disclosure to the officer of some matters in which I had been engaged—I am sixteen years old—my father lives at Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire—he is a maker of gimp—I was in the habit of going to the house of Morrison and Co. with gimp from my father—I first became acquainted with Simpson about three weeks after Easter—I obtained from the house of Leaf and Co. some goods by means of this order—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I first saw this paper on the afternoon that I presented it—on the 29th or 30th of April I was at a public-house in Shoreditch—Long and Simpson came there, and said to me there were two young men waiting at the Old Crown in St. Giles's for me—Simpson said they had been waiting with two young men at the Old Crown, High-street, St. Giles's, ever since nine o'clock—he said one of the young men said we could get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods without any risk at all—we went off directly to the nearest <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-stand, took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Simpson told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man to drive us to the Old Crown, in High-street, St. Giles's—when we got there, the barman said they were gone, but would be there again from four till half-past four o'clock—we returned about that time, and the two young men came in soon after—we had just drank some ale and ginger-beer—Simpson told me these were the two young men—Long was with him—one of the young men said we could get 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and carry it on for a fortnight, he said 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two days, in the presence of both Simpson and Long—he mentioned the name of Mr. Jones, of Newington-causeway—he said he had lived at Mr. Jones's, and he had got twenty or thirty of his bill-heads—there was nothing more said about Mr. Jones till the next day—on the following evening I went with Simpson and Long to Moss's wine-vaults, in Broad-street, St. Giles's—we got there about four o'clock—the two young men were there when we got there—there were no bill-heads produced, but the young man said he had got some of the bill-heads, and he wanted to write an order—Long said he could go to his lodging and write it there; and we all went to Long's lodging, in Neal's-yard, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials—when we got there I saw a woman, who lives with Long—a person called <hi rend="italic">Irish Molly</hi> and Mary Welsh was there—Long sent the</p>

               <p>Long begged the landlord's pardon for having thrown a pot at his head, and gave him a sovereign to pay for a looking-glass—Simpson was gone to Barnett's at that time—I afterwards, by Barnett's direction, changed my clothes—I afterwards agreed to go down to Uxbridge to get out of the way—I was taken into custody at Farnham Royal—I left this note (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for Simpson, at the Hare and Hounds, Red-hill, two miles beyond Uxbridge—when I drove up to Uxbridge, Long was standing at the door of the Falcon-inn, and Simpson was inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Stokepoges, near Slougb. On the 16th of May I went with Russell to a public-house in High-street, St. Giles—I went in, and Russell had hold of my arm—I saw Simpson there—Russell put out his hand to shake hands, and said, "Ah, Simpson," or "Butcher"—Simpson was sitting on the right-hand side—he was going to shake hands with him, but drew back his hand, and would not know him—Barnes, another officer, was behind me, and whether it was him or me that Simpson saw I do not know—when Barnes came in Russell pointed out Long, who was standing against the bar—he was brought away with Simpson in custody.</p>

I believe Hearn and Russell went into the house first—I followed them in, and was within half a yard of them when they entered the room where Long and Simpson were—Simpson sat on the right-hand side—he said, "Ah!" to Russell, and held out his hand—he looked up at him in the face, and drew back his hand—I was in plain clothes, but I believe I was known to Simpson as an officer for a considerable time before that—Russell said, "This is Simpson," pointing round to the right—that was after Simpson drew back his hand—I believe Russell said "Butcher"—I said, "Simpson, you must go along with me, consider yourself my prisoner"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For j disposing of stolen property"—he got up, I put him outside the door, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was called, and I put him inside it—Long was taken at the same time—as we were going in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, Simpson said, "I do not exactly understand the charge I am taken for"—I said, "For disposing of stolen property to Barnett, at 60, Broadway"—he said, "I do not know Barnett"—we proceeded to the station-house, in Black horse-court, Fleet-street, where the charge was entered—I then handcuffed Simpson and Long together, and they walked with me to the lock-up in Smithfield—they were talking together, and I heard Simpson say to Long, as they were going up Fleet-lane, "The young b—has had his <hi rend="italic">regulars</hi>, and we have always behaved well to him," and he clenched his fist—Long made no answer, but gave him a <hi rend="italic">nudge.</hi>

I saw Hicks on the 19th of May, and I delivered him, for my master, ten trusses of meadow hay, four trusses of clover, one sack of oats, and two trusses of straw, at my master's stable, in Worship-street—Hicks asked me for them, to take down to my master's country house—I helped to put them on the cart, and I saw him leave with them—I have a sample of oats here, which are the tame as those I put into the sack—I saw some clover and oats after<lb/>wards at Ilford, similar to the clover and oats I gave to Hicks—I would not attempt to swear to the clover, as it had been so pulled about, but the oats I think matched very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Leytonstone. On the evening of the 12th of June I saw a hamper on my premises—I had expected a ham<lb/>per from town containing gin, which I bad reason to believe it contained—on the following morning it appeared to have been opened, and nine bottles were missing—there were only three remaining out of a dozen—each bottle contained about a pint and a half—they are what are called quart bottles in the trade—about six of them hold a gallon—I gave notice of the robbery—I think the hamper had come to me on the 4th of June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, and live in Paradise-street, Finsbury. On the 13th of May I was at the Railway-station at Green<lb/>wich, at about twelve o'clock—there were a great number of persons col<lb/>lected about me, and the prisoner Dodson had his arm projecting in my face—I asked him to be so kind as to remove his arm—he said it was almost impossible he could in such a crowd—the side of his arm was to<lb/>wards my face—he then passed his arm over my cravat, and as soon ai he removed it I found my pin was gone—it was a union-pin, two small gold pins and a chain—I had seen it safe not a minute previous—I saw him pass his hand towards the other prisoner—I charged Dodson with taking the pin, and collared him immediately—the policeman came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I live with my mother, Sally Cann, at Woolwich—she washes for the Ordnance department—we have missed a number of counterpanes which were entrusted to her to wash—John Lloyd was in her employ—on the 24th of May, when I missed the counterpanes, I was looking for them, with the assistance of John Lloyd, and several others; and while so doing, I saw John Lloyd with this remnant of one of the coun<lb/>terpanes in his hand—he was trying to conceal it from ray sight, and then threw it down—I took it up immediately—it has the mark of the Board of Ordnance upon it—I found three other pieces, with the same mark, con-cealed in a bag containing cloth, which was in the store-room, where the counterpanes are before they are washed—John Lloyd had access to that room, and to the counterpanes—he had no particular charge of them—I can speak positively to having lost twenty-six counterpanes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and at the time in question, lived at 11, Galway-street, St. Luke's. I opened my shop there on the 24th of Dec—on the 22nd the prisoner came and represented himself as a traveller for the firm of Messrs. Simmons, who keep an emery warehouse in Iron<lb/>monger-row, St. Luke's—I did not know there was such a firm—I gave him an order for some black lead, which I desired him to bring on the 23rd, but he did not bring it till the 24th—early that morning a woman came for a bundle of wood, for which she paid me a halfpenny—she re<lb/>turned in a short time, and asked if I had any emery paper—I had none</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160158"/>
               <p>—the prisoner afterwards brought me the black lead which I had ordered I paid him for it—while he was there, the woman who had been before came in again, and asked if I had any black lead—I told her I had, but if she had been a minute sooner she would have been too soon; for that gentleman, meaning the prisoner, who stood behind her, had that moment brought the lead into the shop—I then undid the packet of lead that was on the counter—she said she did not mean that lead, she meant limp lead—I said I had not got any, but I would get her some—she said she used a great quantity of lump lead, and a great quantity of rotten-stone, and likewise emery paper, she used as much as 12lbs. each week—she said she was a stranger about there, but if I would oblige her by getting it for her, she would be a good customer to me, not only in those but other things—she put her hand in her pocket, and produced a piece of rotten-stone and a piece of lump as a sample—she said she paid 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the lump lead, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for the rotten-stone—the prisoner was there all the time—she ordered 12lbs. of each—I asked the prisoner if they kept it at their warehouse, he said, "Yes"—I said, "You hear what this lady says; can you let me have it by the time"—she wanted it at three o'clock—he said he could—I said I was not acquainted with the articles, nor did I know the value of them, or wbat they were used for—after the woman left, the prisoner turned to me and said, "You have a d——d good customer there," meaning the woman—I asked him what it was used for, he said, "It is used for doing the backs of these little penny looking-glasses, that they hawk about the streets"—I told him I was not acquainted with the things, but if Mr. Simmons would supply me as rea<lb/>sonably, and with as good an article as he supplied to other persons, as he lived near, I might as well deal with him as any other person—I then gave him an order for 14lbs. of rotten-stone, 14lbs. of lump lead, and four quires of emery paper—he returned in twenty minutes or half an hour, with a boy carrying the articles in a sack—he brought them into the shop, and dismissed the boy—the packages were in large brown paper bags—he then produced this bill, and one of Mr. Simmons's cards with it, and said either Mr. Simmons was not at borne, or he was in a great hurry, and he had made the bill out in his own name, but it did not signify—I laid, "No, I don't suppose it signifies, so long as you get the money;"—at the bottom of the bill I perceived the words, "Received same time"—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one sovereign, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, aud he then put "W. Webb" at the bottom of the bill, and went away—I never saw him again till he was in custody—finding the woman did not come for the goods, I went to Mr. Simmons, and made some inquiry—I then opened the parcels, and found only 2lbs. of rotten-stone and lump lead, instead of ten—I gave the prisoner the money, believing he was, as he represented himself to be, a traveller to Mr. Simmons, a respectable manufacturer—being pushed for time, by the woman giving the order for three o'clock, and not knowing where to go for the things, of course I gave him the order.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> In answer to the charge of Mr. Butt, I went to the shop to deliver some goods; I did not receive any order for them, neither was I at the shop before to supply them with goods; I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment, which I delivered to the man I had them from, he being a man I had a slight knowledge of in the oil and colour trade. I was not aware there was anything wrong. When I went on the Monday morning following, it was to ascertain whether there was any goods I could supply them with on my own account, not to ask them for the balance of the former goods. As to Mr. Stafford, I called at his shop, and he gave me an order for 3lbs. weight of black lead, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then ordered the other goods, which I delivered to him, and made him a bill out in my own name, as he bought them of</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Richard James, who did keep the Alfred's Head in the London-road. On the morning of the 30th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I was sweeping inside the bar—I heard a noise, and on looking round I saw Scollard lying across the coun<lb/>ter in the bar, reaching towards a sideboard, on which was some silver—(I had seen him before)—he had got his hand on the money on the side board—there were three or four piles of silver to give change of a sovereiga, in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—Jones, who was a stranger to me, was holding Scollard by the leg—Scollard let his cap fall off while he was reaching—I saw him take the money—I called out, "Stop thief"—I caught Scollard by the leg and Jones by the collar—Scollard gave a kick with his leg and got away—I still held Jones—Scollard was brought back by the barman in about three minutes—I then left Jones with the barman, and I went up stairs to cull Mr. James—I did not count the mo<lb/>ney that was on the sideboard, but I missed three half-crowns, and a good many shillings and sixpences—the barman gave me the money, and I put it on the sideboard.</p>

On the 4th of June, at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the London-road—I saw the three prisoners together in company—I knew Madden and Brennan before—I watched them—they went through Camberwell to Peckham New-town—after taking a little refreshment they returned till they came to the prosecutor's shop, and loitered about for five minutes—then Madden went in and brought a parcel out under his arm, and was joined by the other prisoners—they walked a little way down Surrey-square, and then set off running, and in running Madden opened the parcel and gave something to Bishop—I left them, and ran round to meet them—I met Madden in custody.</p>
