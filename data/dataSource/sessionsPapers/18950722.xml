                  </hi>. I live at Great Greenford—I am one of the churchwardens of that parish—I was appointed in May last—my father, Thomas Dix Perkins was churchwarden within a very short time before his death, which was in August, 1891—the defendant was appointed rector about November, 1890—I think my father was then one of the churchwardens—I did not at that time know of the existence of this trust fund, it was some time after—Mr. Whittington succeeded my father as churchwarden—Mr. Roy was, and is row, churchwarden—the defendant resided at the Rectory—the living was estimated at about £600 a year, gross, including the rent of the Rectory—there would be certain payments out, to Queen Anne's Bounty and other things, which would reduce the nett income to about £375 a year, and the Rectory to live in—the actual value of the income is about £260 a year—in January, 1895, I heard something which took me to Mr. Biscoe—I showed him the certificate of transfer with my father's name on it, relating to Bennett's Charity—I asked him what that transfer referred to—he said, "To Bennett's Charity—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—the Charity was instituted in the time of the previous rector, Mr. Beard, and my father—the amount of it was £463 4s. 11d.—I asked Mr. Biscoe where the stock was—he said, "At the Charity Commissioners"—that</p>

               <p>led me to the office of the Charity Commissioners to make inquiries—I afterwards saw Mr. Biscoe, and told him I had inquired about the stock at the Charity Commissioners, and they said the stock was not there—I asked him again where the stock was, and he said, "At the Bank of England"—I went there and made inquiries—I again saw Mr. Biscoe, and again asked him where the stock was—he disputed my right to ask him—I said I asked him as an overseer and as a parishioner—he said as an overseer I had nothing to do with it, and as a parishioner I had nothing to do with it—I said I ought to take out a warrant for his arrest—he said that would do me no good, as we should get nothing out of the living, for it was under sequestration—at that time Mr. Whittington was churchwarden—I saw him, and went with him to the defendant—I said to him, "You refused to answer me yesterday about the Bennett stock, I now bring Mr. Whittington, the churchwarden, to ask where the stock is—he again said, "At the Charity Commissioners," I said, "That is not true,"—he then said, "At the Bank of England"—I said, "That is not true. You sold out in 1893—where is it?"—he said, "It is in my possession"—I suggested that he should come with us to the police and face it—he then said he had not got it—I said it would be the best thing to take out a warrant for his arrest—he said we should get no money out of the sequestration—he said he should write to Mr. Whittington and let him know what could be done—as far as I know he did not write—I went to the Charity Commissioners and requested them to make some official inquiry—I had known about this Charity, among others—I can't say I could exactly recognise the whole—I think I should recognise the defendant's handwriting—I believe these two letters of 22nd and 24th March are his writing, also the signatures in the bank-books and the endorsements on these cheques—during the defendant's term of office I know that this fund was being distributed—I saw it distri<lb/>buted by the defendant last Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The funds of this Charity have always been distri<lb/>buted up to the present time—the defendant said he hoped the money would be all returned—I think his exact words were, he would com<lb/>municate with his friends and he hoped the money would be returned—he was presented to the living at the end of 1889, by King's College, Cambridge—he came to the living in 1890, and came into residence—I should not like to say that the actual value of the tithes produced £140 a year—probably £100 a year was paid to the prior rector out of the living, and £70 a year to Queen Anne's Bounty—I do not know that he had a number of payments to make for dilapidations and other things on coming into the living—I have seen a letter that Mr. Roy wrote on that subject—if he says that is the fact I should not doubt it—I heard it from his bankruptcy and from other sources—our suspicions were aroused at the end of December or the beginning of January this year—I cannot say the exact date, I do not keep a diary—I know that he was made bankrupt—I have heard the name of Woolf in connection with it—I think the conversations I had with the defendant were previous to his bank<lb/>ruptcy, they were early in January, I think—I did not know Mr. Biscoe before he came to the living—in his letter to his solicitor, Mr. Newton, he states that he hoped that the funds would be returned.</p>

Arthur Beard as trustees—on the death of Mr. Perkins it was transferred into the names of his son and Mr. Biscoe, and so it remained down to 23rd March, 1892, when the probate of Mr. Perkins' will was brought to the bank—on 14th April I find in the books a transfer of £200 by the defendant, as survivor of the joint account, to Alexander Jacks—Mr. Biscoe's signature is here—in December, 1893, I find an entry of a transfer of the balance of the trust fund—there is Mr. Biscoe's signature to it, showing that he was present at the transfer.</p>

I am the wife of William Reed, and keep a shop at 49, Jamaica Road, Southwark—on 9th October last, about 8 p.m., the prisoner came in for a pork chop, value 2 1/2 d.—she gave me a piece of money like a florin, but almost like a piece of lead; it was wearing smooth—it appeared bad—I asked the prisoner where she got it from—she said a gentleman gave it to her—I asked her if she had any more—she did not say—I called my husband, who asked her if she had any more—I sent for a constable, and she was given into custody, taken to the Police-court and discharged—on 21st or 22nd June, the police came to me, and I was taken to the Police court where I saw the prisoner—I am quite sure the florin was bad.</p>

I am a clerk, of 76, Queen's Road, South Hornsey—at 2 a.m. on 18th July I was in the Pentonville Road, Clerkenwell, going home—Lawford came up and said, "Can you give me a match?"—before I could do anything he had got his arms round my body, holding my arms down, and another five men set on me—Magee took my watch and chain—all my money was taken from me—they put their hands over my mouth because I called "police," "murder," and "thieves"—four of the men ran away, and then Lawford held my hands behind me, while Magee gave me a punch in the mouth—then they all ran away; they all ran in the same direction—I followed them—I did not see them caught, because that was round an angle, but I came on them a minute or two afterwards and saw the prisoners in the hands of the police; they were two of the six men—I was robbed of £3 in gold from my left-hand pocket, 15s. in silver, a gold watch, a silver chain with a latchkey attached, and a walk<lb/>ing stick—the police have since shown me part of my chain and my key.</p>

I threw it down the area when you first took me into custody"—the prosecutrix was quite sober; she had a slight bruise on the top lip, and her mouth was bleeding a little—I went back with another constable and tried to find the purse, but we could not do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been employed by Mr. Whiteley two years—I am foreman of these works, of the whole place—I can't say how many persons are employed there—sometimes there are more than at other times—at this time I should say there were about forty—sometimes there may be one hundred—there are more women than men—the regular hours are from six to six—at this time we worked till about ten—the women are supposed to leave at nine—Mr. Clarige has given me notice not to allow smoking in the factory—I have not heard of complaints with respect to smoking—there have not been notices put up about it at the factory—there has been at the farm, I believe—I have once or twice spoken to the men about it—I know that the prisoner does not smoke—he has been about thirteen months in the employ—he is a man that never seems to be guided by others—he is rather opinionated—I never had occasion to interfere with him—he has done his work, not better than others—I can't say whether he has been promoted—I don't know that he had any occasion to go on to the gallery on this particular morning—I can't say whether he took any cases from there to pack jam in to send to</p>

               <p>Westbourne Grove—I won't say he did not—I saw him go up the steps while I was against the clerk's office—I could see him go up to the top of the steps from where I stood—I could not swear to the exact time he was there—there is straw on the right-hand side of the gallery to cover over the jams and fruit during the winter—the straw is on one aide, and the sacking on the other, about sixty feet apart—I was waiting there to lock up after the others had gone—the prisoner was working in shed 35 upon perishable fruit—the shed is badly lightly; it is necessary to have a lamp—the lamps we use are duplex, not enclosed, ordinary chimney lamps; you pull a lever to extinguish them—we had just got outside the door when we saw the light—we had not had a fire in the works before to my knowledge—I don't know that there have been a number of fires at Mr. Whiteley's premises at Westbourne Grove—I have never been employed there—I don't know that the prisoner has—there is no night watchman on the premises.</p>

I made an examination of the drawer in the packing-room—I pulled out the drawer, and found this lid of a jam tin under a hole that was burnt—there was a little dust from the brown paper lying on the top of the lid which had been burnt through—this produced is one of the pieces—I think this card-board would burn more slowly than the wood, it would not ignite—there was some spirits of wine in the next room, the finishing-room—the prisoner had charge of that room—there were a few drops left in the bottle—the pri<lb/>soner had no right to be on the premises so late as half-past ten, he should have left when his hands left—we do not employ the females after dusk, he should have left with them, unless I ask him to stay, which I did not—I know his handwriting—I can swear that these letters are his writing.

I live at 10, Butts Cottages, Hanworth, about five minutes from the factory—I can see the jam works from my cottage—on Friday, 5th July, I received a communication from the prisoner, in con<lb/>sequence of which, I told him he could sleep at my house, and in the even<lb/>ing he came and slept there—when he first came to Mr. Whiteley's, he used to live with us altogether—that was about fourteen months ago—after that he had his wife and family down, and then he lived at Twicken<lb/>ham Green, about two miles away—he had his meals with us—he had not slept with us since; but on this occasion he said he had to be late at work, and had to be at the works early in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for twelve years in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—I am now superintendent at Twickenham—on Monday, 10th July, I went to the factory and made an inspection, in company with Inspector Morgan—in the gallery I saw a number of sugar-bags, which had been burnt, and I also saw the remains of a fire on the carpenter's bench—they were two separate and distinct fires—on the right-hand side there were some bundles of loose straw, which were very dry and inflammable, and on the left side there were a number of empty packing-cases, very dry and inflammable; around the carpenter's bench were a lot of shavings, in fact, the whole gallery was of a very inflammable nature—I went to the country packing-room, and saw the drawer, which appeared to be burnt at the bottom—I saw the tin lid, it had been removed—that was certainly not a fire caused by accidental smoking.</p>

I am chief inspector in the inquiry office in Mr. Whiteley's business—the day after this fire I went to Butt's Farm—I went into the country packing-room where this drawer was; I pulled it right out; I saw underneath that the round tin was immediately under the hole that was burnt in the bottom of the drawer—I also noticed dust in the tin, and burnt strawboard—in the next room I found a bottle which had contained spirits of wine—there was a little left in it, about a table-spoonful.</p>

On Sunday, 7th July, I saw the prisoner at Twickenham Green, outside his house—I said to him, "I am an inspec<lb/>tor of police; I have been to Butt's farm, where three separate fires were discovered last Friday evening; two were found in the gallery directly you had left it; I shall take you into custody for wilfully setting fire to the premises"—he said, "There has been smoking all over the premises, but I think I will make a separate defence"—I took him to the station—on the way he said, "The first boiler, and Bushell and Cuppleditch have been trying to work me out"—at the station I charged him, and said, "Last Friday evening three separate fires were discovered, one under the floor, one on the carpenter's bench, and one in the packing-room, and a bottle containing spirits of wine; you had the key of the room 35 and locked it up at twenty-five past ten—you were seen to go to the gallery, where you bad no business, to come down again, and leave the pre<lb/>mises; under these circumstances, I charge you with wilfully setting fire to the premises with a view of injuring your master, Mr. Whiteley"—he said, "It is false"—the charge was written down and read over to him—he said, "I deny it"—next day I took him to the Court House at Sunbury—on the way he said, "On Saturday morning I found a burnt drawer in the country packing-room, and I called Bushell's attention to it"—the house where the prisoner lived at Twickenham Green is two miles from the factory.</p>

I said: "What does that matter to you? I am looking to buy a pair of boots"—one of them then struck me on my forehead, and felled me to the ground—I have the mark now—I took hold of the man who struck me, and when I got up he tried to escape, but I kept my hold, and he struck me another blow on the side of my neck—I have got the mark still—a policeman came and took him</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first thing I saw was the prisoner chasing the prosecutor round the barrow—only two persons were present then—there was no other barrow there—they were not talking to one another when they were chasing one another round the barrow, but the prosecutor was calling "Police"—a crowd gathered round—the prosecutor got on the pavement, and the prisoner walked away—the prosecutor took one of the sticks from the barrow—he was chased round the barrow about a minute before he took the stick—the prosecutor could not have made use of the stick before the crowd gathered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-collar maker, of 41, Maybury Road, Harrow Road—on 18th June I was returning home late—I saw the prisoners, whom I knew well by sight, standing on the kerb outside my house—as soon as I took my keys out they rushed on me and held me by the throat and very nearly killed me, and took my watch and Albert, a penknife, a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and two florins—Allen went away but Mace stopped, and I got hold of him, and got my watch back from him; he pulled at the chain and it broke—I held him as long as I could and then had to let him go, I was so fatigued—both prisoners seized me by the throat—I was kicked on the body and my knee; my knee-cap is disarranged; I am lame now, and can hardly walk; all my left leg was black and blue from the ankle to the knee, and this side also—my throat is not right now; I have not been well since—I cannot say which prisoner kicked me; that happened in the passage of my house, I had got the door open—on 26th June I gave Mace into custody—I knew both prisoners by sight, but did not know their names—I was not a friend of Mace; I never mixed up with him, but he has asked me for a drink, and I have said he could have one—I was on speaking terms with him—on Saturday last I saw Allen in the Harrow Road, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mace.</hi> On that day you forced your company on me—I gave you 6d. to go on an errand for me—at mid-day on 18th June I left off work about twelve and engaged a cabman, who drove me and you to Wembley Park; you asked if you could come with me, and I said, "Yes"—you were in my company from 12.30 till 11.45 p. m.—I met you outside the Neeld Arms, I was not drunk—I had a small <hi rend="italic">lemon</hi> then; they did not refuse to serve me—we went from there to the Royal Saxon—the cabman was to have 10s. for driving me to Wembley Park and back—I did not leave you with the cabman, and go home to get more money—I had plenty with me, over £3—a lady came to the Neeld Arms in answer to the message you took for me; she did not come with me—we went to the Greyhound at Wembley Park; I showed you over the grounds, and then you and I and the cabman had tea, which I paid for—I did not fall down the steps going into the room—I did not go to sleep in the cab—I did not take the cabman's number;</p>

               <p>I saw him the other day, but he cannot get here—we parted that night at the Oliver Arms at 11.40; I bade you good-night, and when I got to my door I found you both waiting for me on the kerb—the robbery took place in the passage just inside the front door—I unlocked the door, and you rushed in after me—it was four or five yards from the kerb to the door—you sprang on me—I did not take any man indoors with me that night—the lamp was out, and it was dark in the passage, but I saw you both on the kerb, and I knew you both by sight—Allen joined you at the Oliver Arms on our return from the excursion—I took no other men into the public-house—I did not take Allen in; he came in, and I gave him a glass of beer—you and I were alone there till he came in—I did not get into conversation with anyone else in the bar—I am single, and I have lodged with my married sister for twenty-three years—after the robbery I went to the police-station and reported it, with my tie and collar pulled off, as you had left me—I had not fallen down all day long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Allen.</hi> I knew you by sight, not by name—I have seen you in the Harrow Road several times—I never spoke to you—it is about five minutes' walk from the Oliver to my lodgings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw Allen in the bar of the Oliver up to 11.40—he joined Mace, and made himself very familiar to me—I saw him last Saturday, and gave him into custody at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mace, in his defence, said that the prosecutor was drunk at midday, and that he could have robbed him in the cab if he had wanted to do so. Allen said that he knew nothing of the robbery.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Henry Peter Tyler, boot manufacturer, of 629, Holloway Road—no one lives on the premises—on the afternoon of June 27th I left the shop locked up, and everything was then safe—I came again next morning and noticed the till broken from the counter and lying on the floor—I missed 3s. 6d. in coppers and several pairs of boots—this pair was taken; they art; my master's, his name is on them—their value is 8d. 6d. retail—the kitchen window shutter had been forced open; it was securely fastened the day before—I found a knife and an iron rod, something like a poker, in the shop—I went to the station after the prisoner was arrested and charged him—he did not say anything—I did not know him.</p>

I am assistant to How, a pawnbroker—the prisoner pledged this pair of boots on June 29th for 3s., in the name of James Williams—the police afterwards called and gave a description of stolen property, and we produced these boots—they were soiled, and seemed to have been worn—the prisoner brought them in a piece of paper—we asked if they were his own, and he said "Yes"—I think he asked 5s. for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I live at 72, Collier Street, Pentonville—on the morning of 12th July I was in the Street, going over Battle Bridge—I met the prisoner—he pulled out a knife and stuck it into my arm—he meant it for my side—I did nothing, I was standing at the time—he <hi rend="italic">took his hook</hi>, and I went to the Police-station and had my arm dressed—I have lived with the prisoner nearly all my life, but I left him for his cruelty six years ago—I have had ten children by him—these letters were handed to me by my child—they are the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">These were in very abusive terms, threatening the death of the witness the next time they met.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier at 100, Downham Road, Stoke Newington—I knew a girl, Maud Hastings, who lodged last year at the prisoner's house, which I used as a brothel; it was in Spring Gardens, a little turning past the Kingsland Road Station—I visited her three times, and gave her money each time—I made her acquaintance in August at the Mildmay Club, a dancing place—I went with her the next night to a brothel, and then found she lodged at the prisoner's, and I visited her there three times—I heard in January that she was <hi rend="italic">enceints</hi>, about February or March her child was born—she said I was the father; I said it was impossible—I last visited her in January—in January the prisoner came to me at 100, Downham Road and said Maud was coming round to my place to show me up and tell my daughter all about it—that was after I had seen her for the last time—I was a widower then—I told him I would rather anything than that my daughter should know of my disgrace—he said "I can keep her away by threatening her about the man she has been living with, who I know of," and he said he was out of work and asked for a few shillings—I gave him 2s. and he left—I received a letter on the Wednesday that Mrs. Harbidge wanted to see me, and I went and saw the prisoner and his wife—he said "I have seen Maud and she has threatened to come down to your place in rags and show you up"—I said "You know very well she knows I am innocent of this; why do you want to trouble me like this, you are killing me. When you come round to my place like this, my daughter has to give me brandy in the night, my heart is affected"—his wife said he had got no work and would I give them a few shillings and they would keep the girl away from me by frightening her about this man she was living with—I put 9s. on the table and went away—between that interview and 14th June I repeatedly gave him and his wife money, a few shillings at a time, twice a week very often—I gave them about £5 in all, because he said that if I did he would keep Maud away from me, and that it cost him money to keep her away from coming round to show me up—on 14th June he came to my house, and into my parlour where I was at work—two men who came with him remained outside—I said to him, "How dare you come into my parlour; I am done with you, I give you no more money"—he said, "If you don't give me 28s. by eight o'clock to-night I will show you up, and to-morrow I will show you up in the City. When I am done with you I will have you in your box; me and my <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> will wait for you outside"—I sent my boy for a policeman; when he found I was going to put him out he went out and ran away—he came again a week afterwards with another man—he tried to force his way in, but could not open the door—I said, "Go and fetch a policeman"—he stood outside waiting about till he saw the policeman, and then he ran, and the policeman ran after him—between January 7th and 14th June he had said it would be a great showing up for me, and it had cost him money to keep the girl quiet, and he wanted money—I was going to be married at this time—I got married three weeks ago to a lady who lived in the Downham Road, and with whom I was keeping company at this time; that was the reason I gave him money many times.</p>

I promised you?"—I did not promise you £3 if she was married—you threatened me and I had no money to give you, and I had to promise you anything—you asked me to give you money to start you in work, and I did it out of pity for you—when I came out of the bank I said, "Get out of the City; here is a sovereign for you; don't disgrace me any more"—on the 14th you came and demanded money, and banged the table.</p>

I am landlord of the King John's Head public-house in Southwark Street—I know Beaumont—at the end of 1892, 1893, and 1894 he was living at the Star Hotel, 3, Albion Place, Blackfriars—he was frequently in the habit of using my house, and spent a good deal of time there, and had his meals there—I gave him a reference</p>

               <p>to my bankers, the Blackfriars Branch of the London and Midland Bank—while at my house he mentioned the names of persons he was going to see; one named John Carr, who lived in Gordon Square, close to St. Pancras Licensing Court—he spoke of going to see Carr once or twice in the evening time—I remember on one occasion, in 1894, his going away for about a fortnight; he said he had been to Rome—Pleydell came to lunch at my place once; at least I was told so by Beaumont—I do not remember seeing him there; Beaumont told me that he came there to lunch with him; that he did not stay above a moment; and that he went away without having any lunch—Beaumont was arrested outside my house; the detectives came there—after his arrest, while he was at Holloway I received some letters from him—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his writing. <hi rend="italic">One of these, dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1895, <hi rend="italic">was read as follows</hi>: "<hi rend="smallCaps">DEAR ALLEN</hi>,—The storm has burst at last, and what I regret most is that I departed from my principle for the first time, never to enter<lb/>tain intimate relations with people in a respectable position. Of course I entered your house as a mere matter of business, and there, to my present sorrow, I found a social circle, the charm of which seduced me from my duty. I am deeply grieved for the wrong I have done you, and if you can forgive me I can never forgive myself. I am heartbroken over its effect on you. It came so unexpected and sudden, and <hi rend="italic">Pa</hi> knew all about it a fortnight ago, and never told me a word. About the opinions of the Kinnells and the others I am not much concerned, and Bourne won't feel hurt in the least; but Jimmy the Butcher will have such a terrible gig at you, and if you introduce another stranger to him, 'What! he will cry, another old toff.' Oh! it won't bear thinking about. Your dear lady I presume not to address, I dare not. Oh, how disgusted she must be, and so unfortunate. If I had only lasted another six weeks I should have lived and died in the odour of sanctity. Did Pleydell's little sister call on you, and did you do what she asked you? '<hi rend="italic">I sent her</hi>?' Of course you have divined those two men that came into the bar were the two Yardmen on the case, one of them pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot me. I do not know what for I am sure. I want you to do a few little things for me, but if you refuse to hold any further communication you will be quite justified, and I shall not blame you. I want you to go to the Star and see if they have taken away my room from me, and what they have done with my things! I suppose they have burst open my bag without taking the trouble to look for the key. If my room still remains to me tell them to send the bill on to you every Monday, and you will pay it. You can put it down to my account. I pay 10s. 6d. for the room, and tell them if I send anybody for clothes to let them have it. And now once more offering my humblest apologies for what I, being a crook, have done to you; for although crook, I am not a wrong 'un. You might leave your cellar piled up with sovs, and I would not touch one. I conclude, yours, in deep penitence. N. B.—All letters in and out are read.—F. A. B." Pleydell's sister had called.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Coutts and Co., bankers, of the Strand. I attend to the circular-note department—we have a number of correspondents on the Continent, to whom we issue circular notes—we issue at the same time a letter of indication, which has on it a list of all our correspondents in the foreign towns—the list varies from time to time and is corrected—all our letters of credit are printed by the same printers, who we have had for many years—we issue circular notes to our customers, and to strangers on the introduction of persons known to us—we also supply circular-notes through bankers without introduction—the first step necessary to getting a circular note is the filling up of a form of application—if the person is one of our customers there is no difficulty—on the back of each circular-note there is a bill of exchange signed by the person who pays the money—and our circular note cashed abroad comes afterwards to us in the ordinary course—on November 21st, 1893, this application (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came from Williams, Deacon, and Co. for fifteen circular notes, in the name of Alfred Richard<lb/>son—these fifteen circular notes of £20 each (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were prepared on November 24th, with a letter of indication, and handed to Williams, Deacon, and Co's. clerk—they are all signed beforehand, and the name of the person is inserted by us—those fifteen notes came back to us in February—they being payable to Alfred Richardson, the bill of exchange was signed by him—they were all paid on February 15th, 17th, and 18th at Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and the Hague—the name of the payee is not filled in, these notes were never negotiated—they were not uttered in England at all, it is the custom to retain them till they get a certain number; of course our correspondents are entitled to draw a bill in one document, instead of negotiating seven, eight, or ten—they would put in their own name if they negotiated it, but as they drew a bill the bill had the requisite endorsement on it—this one which the Bank of</p>

               <p>Rotterdam put in, as the payee, would not require the endorsement of the Bank of Rotterdam, because they would draw a bill and negotiate that in lieu of it—the other has never been paid at all—if there is an endorsement that is a sufficient discharge; where it is not mentioned I have obtained the information from our correspondent—on December 7th, 1893, I got a personal application for two £50 circular notes in the name of Alfred Richardson—I produce the application form for them, signed in my presence—I believe the prisoner Pleydell to be the person who applied; he referred to the former notes issued to himself, and asked for additional £150, mentioning the name of Richardson—I referred to my Look and found I had issued notes to the amount of £300 in that name, and, being satisfied, I gave him these two £50 notes, payable to Alfred Richardson; one bears the date of February 17th, the other is undated, but it was cashed at the Hague on the 14th—the other came back to us; they were drawn for by a bill—on June 2nd, 1894, a man named Thomas Wray applied for twelve £50 circular notes—this is the application—he is not one of the prisoners—we required some introduction, as he was a perfect stranger to us, and he referred to his friend Richardson—I handed him these twelve circular notes, and he handed me in payment bank notes, value £525, and gold—the notes were paid into the Bank of England in a bundle as they came into our possession—on June 5th Wray came back and brought me the documents I had handed to him for the money—I had a conversation with him, and we handed him £600 in three £200 notes, numbered 27256-57 and 23381, dated Dec. 19, 1893—on June 14th I received from Williams, Deacon, and Co. another application for seven circular notes of £50 each, to be issued to Walter Bond—I produce the form of application—on the same day I sent Williams, Deacon, and Co. these seven notes for £50 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they bear upon them the name of "Walter Bond"—some of them came back in July on our applying for them—they came from agents in Ostend and Brussels—these seven notes purport to be £50 circular notes; but they are forgeries, both as to paper and in every respect—they are apparently identical in every way with the two £50 notes issued on December 5th—Demachy and Seilliere are agents of ours—the letter enclosing the notes reached us on July 21st in the condition in which they now are; it is dated the 20th—by the time it reached us on the 21st it was within my knowledge that there were forgeries of that kind being uttered—these two letters of indication reached us about the same time—they are dated July 10th, 1894, and are also forgeries—they are similar to the letters of indication we issued in November and December, 1893—they are of the two fifties and the £20 on December 7th—our letters of indication are altered several times by our altering a name, or something which makes it necessary—all our circular notes bear numbers, which vary according to the time they are applied for—in June, 1894, the £350 worth of notes applied for by Bond were numbered 40200 odd, and the numbers of the 65 circular notes are 40237 to 40247, so that the numbers on the forged notes would be about the right numbers—the same numbers are repeated in several instances—that is a thing which could not occur in the same year—we have a private mark, which has escaped the forger—we had not issued notes to Lee, Baker, Gay, Finlon, Hurst, or Morris, the persons named on the forged</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. Our correspondents at Brussels were Messrs. Bolser and Co.—the only information we should receive that they had notes of ours was the presentation of the bill on July 27th, but they were cashed on June 27th, and two or three at Ostend on the 28th—in both those cases they drew on us at one month, and they negotiated the bill, not the notes—I had two interviews with Wray in December, the man I believed to be Pleydell—I see a great many persons in business, and attend to them as quickly as I can—I only once saw the man who called himself Richardson—I carried out the whole transaction myself, and drew up the circular notes and took the money—I have a very good recollection of the person—I may have said at the police-court that I had a slight recollection of the person—I daresay I said, "slight," I believe I did—I saw him at the police-court and looked at him, and my memory was strengthened—I said, "I have a slight recollection, I believe it to be Pleydell"—I have examined the writing on the slip he wrote in my presence; I have not seen Pleydell's genuine writing, and have not compared one with the other—there is not much resemblance between this "Walter Bond," and this slip signed in my presence—our customers do not have two names—I should not think these are the same writing—the £50 notes issued to Wray in June were 40188 to 40199—we had not issued many £50 notes between 2nd June and the end of June, not so many as usual; perhaps we issued 20—sometimes circular notes are lost or mislaid, and do not return to us at all—the form of this note, and the signature could be got from almost any of the circular notes issued by my firm within a year or two years, and the letter of in<lb/>dication the same—the letter of indication in issue between November and December was not the same as that in issue between January and June—it might have been altered three times between those dates—the alterations are in the omission of the names of some agents, and the additions of others, or the alteration of the names of certain firms—the face of the circular notes has not been altered for the last twenty years, since the beginning of the issue—circular notes are issued by other bankers besides Coutts and Co.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. We never honoured any of these seven forged notes—they were sent to us as genuine documents for the credit, of the account—no bills were drawn; the notes themselves were in some instances remitted to us for the credit of the account of the person who paid them, and as vouchers merely, showing that they have paid the money on our account—they were sent to us as so many bills at seven days' sight for the credit of the correspondent who had paid them; they would be merely vouchers; we should require no other vouchers—I cannot say that the general practice among all our agents is to draw upon us for the amount of circular notes they have honoured; a great many of them honour the notes themselves; it one or two are cashed by a correspondent it is less trouble to endorse and cash them, but if he has a dozen it is better to put</p>

Coutts and Co. to furnish circular notes for</hi>£100, <hi rend="italic">payable to Alfred Richardson</hi>), and added the name and address "Alfred Richardson, 17, Crookham Road"—we only order a certain number of letters of indication at a time, and during the period we are using those we register any alterations in our books, and as soon as we have come to the end of the particular lot of letters of indication in use we order fresh ones with the corrections, so that we use all up as we go along—only the letters of indication are altered—the circular notes only vary in their numbers—on the genuine ones I recognise our private marks—these notes are endorsed Hurst and Co.

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting—I have studied it for many years, and have had very considerable experience—I was instructed by Messrs.

Groves and James Gordon; also with hand-writing alleged to be that of Carr and Beaumont—I made an examination of the signatures to these two application forms in the names of Groves and Gordon, and compared them with the writing of Carr and Beaumont, and I believe the signature "James Gordon" to be in Carr's writing—for the purpose of my examination I had cheques signed by Carr, the signature of "John Osborn," the diary, cash-book, and loose leaves, and this letter of 27th June, 1893, and the word "Gordon"—with those materials for comparison that is the opinion I have formed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi>. There are several points in the letter of 27th June; the head of the "J" in the signature "J. Carr" is rather characteristic in the proved writing, it is rather short, some persons make it long and some short—I think it is marked in this particular case—most of the "J's" I have seen in Carr's writing are very short—that is one of the things that assists me in forming my opinion—I do not attach much importance to that alone, the evidence is cumula<lb/>tive; there is the slope and shape of the letter in "Gordon," and I compare that with another in the letter of 7th March, 1895, and there in "dear," in another, and the in "Gordon "; of course, the letters are not all alike, there are differences, but the similarity strikes me—I had not seen the thirty cheques or the diary before—I have noticed the a in the "James" on the receipt—I find a similarity between that a and the a in the admitted handwriting—in my first examination I had not sufficient to enable me to form a definite opinion, and I so stated at the end of my examination—the Magistrate put several sentences to me as explanatory of my evidence, merely summarising what I had stated, such as "You think it very likely you are right," and those remarks were taken down more or less accurately by the clerk; but the observations were not mine—I am as certain of my opinion as I can morally be—I signed my deposition containing those statements; I did not think it worth while to take exception to them—I point to the similarity of the a in "James," and also the a in "able," and the a in "Carr" as well—it is very difficult to express what certainty is with regard to expert opinion—I don't think I am entitled to say I am certain of anything which I cannot swear to; I am expressing a belief, not a certainty; I did not see the prisoner write—the "a" bears a certain resemblance to a "u," but it would not strike me so.</p>

Richardson," and believe it is Beaumont's writing, and also the signature "A. Richardson" on the back of two £50 circular notes, dated December 7th—the signature "Arthur Lee" on the forged circular note is in Beaumont's writing—I have com<lb/>pared this cheque drawn to Mr. H. Morrell, and endorsed H. Morrell, with the writing of Henry Morris on a forged circular note, and in my opinion they are the writing of the same person—I have examined the writing of a memorandum with the name and address of Sims on it, and a piece of paper with the name and address of George Gray, and there are such similarities as warrant me in entertaining a strong suspicion that they are the same—the "George Gray" on the back of some of the forged circular notes appears to me to be the same as on the slips—I believe ex hibit 10, the paper with the name and address on it, and also the paper with the name John W. Butler on it were written by the same person ten of the forged notes have the name of John W. Butler, and some of them in my opinion are in the same writing as exhibit 10 in the name and address.</p>

The case here was that they were accessories before the fact to both the forgery and the uttering, and, if accessories, they were liable to be treated as principals. The evidence showed that the felony was planned and carried out in this country, and therefore, although the uttering took place abroad, the parties planning the crime could be tried here as accessories.

By the evidence the notes were completed in point of form, and were changed in Paris; but the payment would have to be procured in England.

               <p>met the prisoner—he said, "Good evening; what are you doing here?"—I said, "I have come down to see what made you leave me so sharp, and did not even stop for your money"—he said, "No; I did not stop for my money, as I did not give a proper week's notice"—I said, "Well, there is a little misunderstanding about two bills," or words to that effect, and asked him about Champ—he did not say that he had had Champ's money—I think I can pledge my oath that he did not admit it; I do not think I said anything about his thinking it over—I said that I did not want to have any bother—he said that there must be some mistake—I said, "No, I think not; Mrs. Norwood keeps the books; you had better come and see here"—he said that he would, and that there must be a mistake—I do not remember his saying he would put it right if there was anything wrong—we went into the Half Moon public-house together, and I treated him to two glasses of ale and a cigar—he accompanied me back to the railway station to see me off—I did not look upon it as a question of account—I did not say, "Charley, think this over. as I think you will find it has not been paid in"—I used the word "Charley," but I said nothing about thinking—I do not think I shook hands with him or said good-bye—I do not think he wished me to go to his parents' house—before I left the station I told him that my mistress would be passing through Bishop's Strotford the next morning at 9.30, going to St. Ives, and he had better see her about the accounts—she did not see him; he would know the main line—on 4th July I had a telegram from her, from Bishop's Stortford station—I did not promise the prisoner, directly or indirectly, that I would send him a statement of the accounts not paid—I considered that I owed him 15s.—my wife said that the prisoner would come up and see me on Saturday—I got this letter from him on July 7th, brought by Pryor, one of my workmen. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was engaged, and could not come, that he should get a cheque on Wednesday: asking for the particulars of what he owed, and stating that it was through lending money.</hi>)—I did not send him an account—this list is my youngest son's writing, but not made out by my instructions, and sent to the prisoner unknown to me—Pryor, who brought the letter, wanted to be security for the prisoner, but I said that I could not say anything about it at that time—my son's position is in the desk—I did not agree to let the matter stand till Thursday—I did not say, "I agreed to let it stand till Thursday"—my son, who signed this letter, lives at the other shop; he is 16—he keeps the books; I cannot say who gave him information of the items, not I, more likely my wife—she is re<lb/>sponsible for the accounts.

               <p>a warrant, because I was expecting him to call to see my wife—I mean to say I never authorised my son to write that letter—I was not at home—if he had come on Thursday, July 3rd, with the money in his pocket, I should still have proceeded against him—at the time I had this letter, "Please let me have the full items, and I will let you have it by your brother on Thursday," I intended to prosecute him then—I did not prosecute him before because I had other business to attend to—I did not write to him and say, "I will not wait till Thursday"—my son wrote the letter without communicating with me—I do not believe I said in his hearing that I would wait till Thursday—I had no warrant on the Tuesday—I gave no instructions to the police to have him arrested on the Tuesday—I got the warrant after he was in custody—I had not given instructions to the police to take him, but I went to them and stated the case.</p>

I am the wife of George Ballin, and live at 20, Lower Park Road, Peckham—on Saturday, 29th June, I saw the prisoner between twelve and half-past at my gate—he said he had got a few tickets to give me in remembrance of his deceased wife; he could not give them to me then; he would give them to me next day—I said, "Why don't you give up those things to the two men Green?"—he said, "No, I would sooner set fire to them"—he seemed to me perfectly sober—there are only two doors between my house and his—I saw no more of him till about ten or half-past two, when my little girl ran in and said something to me, and I went out and saw smoke coming from the back window of prisoner's house—I gave an alarm to Mr. Eyres; by that time the back place was all in flames—I saw the constable lower the prisoner from the window—by that time the place was pretty well burnt down, except the back part of the house.</p>

On Saturday, 29th June, I saw the prisoner three or four times, in fact the whole of the morning—I saw him go into his house about twenty minutes to two. I was standing at my own door, ten feet away from his door, which was next door—he had a bottle in his left pocket, I could not say whather there was anything in it—he was decidedly sober—about eight or ten minutes afterwards I saw the fire—I saw him lower himself from the first floor window, that was after the door had been burst open—there was a policeman there—no one was living in the house besides the prisoner, the house was entirely empty—I, my wife and five children live next door, and thirteen people were living on the other side.</p>

               <p>I was called to the house—about three I saw the prisoner at No. 12, a short distance from his house—I said, "Are you the occupier of fourteen?" he said, "Yes, I have been for twenty-four years—I am a carpenter and joiner—my wife, until about three months ago, carried on the business of a sweetstuff shop—I slept in the house last night—I went in about one o'clock and remained till five—I went back again to the house between eleven and twelve noon, I laid down in the front room first-floor and went off to sleep, and was awoke by a knocking at the door—there was smoke in the room—someone outside called out 'Fire' I put up the window and jumped out A policeman caught me as I was coming down. There was no actual fire in the room where I was. No one else slept in the house. I may have been smoking, and had had some <hi rend="italic">booze.</hi> I am not insured, and do not know if the house is. The house belongs to Mr. Taylor, of Acacia Road, Dulwich. I had a few goods there which I bought of William Dunn, now deceased, a late lodger of mine. I lost the receipts. Garrett Green, who says he is Dunn's stepson, claimed them. He summoned me to the Police-court." I left him then to pursue my inquiry—I saw him again about four, and said, "I shall arrest you on suspicion of having set fire to your house"—he said, "Yes, I knew it would come to that. I have some friends in this neighbourhood; don't forget that"—I took him to the station where the charge was entered—he made no reply.</p>

I live at 2, Vineyard Walk, Mortlake—the prisoner and I work in the Mortlake Brewery—on June 27th, we were in the Ton Yard, on the scaffold—Surridge was there—the prisoner and I quarrelled; he asked me to fight, but I refused—I said after we had done work I would fight—he was not eating anything, but he took a clasp<lb/>knife from his pocket, and stabbed me on my shoulder—I did not take off my neck handkerchief before that to fight him—Storey seized him, and I was taken to a doctor.</p>
