The London and North-Western Railway Company was in the paper on the 11th, and followed a part<lb/>heard case on the 12th, when it was called on, and judgment given for the defendants—after the judgment I went into the Castle public-house, in Portugal Street—I saw the prisoner in the saloon bar talking to somebody for 10 minutes—on June 20th he was arrested in my presence by Sergeant Collins—he was told he need not say anything—he said, "The accident has caused me to be double ruptured; I had only one before. Mr. Wanklin followed me downstairs, and told me he saw me fall; and a lady also informed me she saw me fall. Wanklin helped to pick me up, and he and the lady saw blood running down my neck, and advised me not to go by the train. I do not know the lady, I have not seen her since. I had an appointment in the City, and was anxious to keep it. I have only seen Wanklin once since the accident. He then told me he had been advised not to have anything to do wiih my case, or he would get into trouble, and I have been deserted by my friends. I had lost all my money and my reversion, which brought me in £40, upon which I relied to pay my rent, which is mortgaged lo pay Mr. Van Tromp's costs in the action wnich I hoped to win; but after having seen the papers, for my daughter's sake, I decided not to go into the witness-box. I have been the victim of a conspiracy in this case, because if Dr. Whitlock, Mr. Wanklin, and others had gone into the witness-box as against me, they would have been asked a question which would have startled everybody; but Dr. Whitlock was mistaken, as the only evidence he had to give was about his costs in the action"—he said that when he was picked up, blood was running down his neck, after he had fallen down at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

I am an errand boy, of Roberts' Buildings, Ebury Square—I am 15 years old—I was with Rnockley in Elizabeth Street, about 10.30—I know Patsy Grant—I saw him fighting with a girl named Kennedy, near the Bricklayers' Arms—Bob Grant struck a barber in the face—the deceased was coming along the pavement, and Bradley struck him in the face, and he fell on the kerb—he got up again and walked into the road, when Bob Grant struck him in the face, which knocked him to the ground, and he did not get up again—when the pri<lb/>soners saw that the deceased did not rise they went different ways—the deceased was not interfering with the prisoners—I picked the two pri<lb/>soners out at the station; I have seen them before together—I did not notice that Grant had a ring on his hand.</p>

               <p>brought in—I examined him—he was unconscious, and remained so until be died the same morning at 9.15—he had a wound over bis eyebrow, and was bleeding from his nose and mouth—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—he had a bruise over the right eye, and there was a wound 1 in. long over the inner side right of his eyebrow, and another wound about 3/4 in. long on the right side of the nose, which was bent towards the left side—the nasal bones were fractured—there had been gome bleeding from the nose and mouth; there were no outward signs of bruising on the body—on removing the skin on the scalp there was an effusion of blood in the tissues, corresponding to the wound over the right eyebrow down to the bone—there was also a fracture of the skull extend<lb/>ing about 1 in., and another fracture at the base of the skull, which had ruptured some arteries, and had caused pressure on the brain, and on opening the skull there were about 4 oz. of clotted blood pressing on the brain—his general condition was healthy—in my opinion the cause of death was the fracture at the base of the skull, and the pressure on the brain—I cannot say if only one or more blows had been given, or if the fracture was caused by a blow or a fall—if it was a blow it must have been of considerable force—the blow on the face would be likely to cause the fracture of the skull—there is no evidence to show how the nasal bones were broken.</p>

Going from the Royal Oak on Sunday night, August 6th, just after 11 at night, I met Bradley, the other prisoner. He says to me, 'They have taken a man away.' I said, 'What man?' and he replied, 'The man I struck, whom Bill Curley struck behind the ear.' I then went home. I did not see the blow struck, only by what he said; that is all I wish to say"—Bradley said, "I live at 50, Graham Street, Pimlico. I was outside the Bricks'—that is, the Bricklayers' Arms on Sunday night, August 6th, about 10.30 p.m., a quarrel arose over a girl named Kennedy. Harry Graham threw a beer can at her, and he then ran af ter her, and she went towards the public-house. A man came out of the public-house with a straw hat on. I heard afterwards it was the barber. He tried to separate them. Then Bob Grant hit the barber, and then walked over to the other side of the road with the crowd. Then I saw the man that was killed. He came out into the middle of the road. Bob Grant went out of the crowd, and struck the deceased man. Then some little chap struck him, and knocked him down. I then went into the public-house. Bob Grant was in there. We came out together, and came down to Ebury Street. He says to me, 'You go down there,' meaning Elizabeth Street, 'and I'll go round here,' meaning Ebury Street. I said, 'All right, good-night' That is all"—the prisoners signed those statements after they were read over.</p>

I am barmaid at the Prince of Prussia, 126, Harford Street, Mile End Road—I know the prisoners as customers—on August 29th, between 11.15 and 11.20 p.m., I served them with two mild and bitters, two special Irish whiskies, and two cigars—I looked at the clock—the price was 10d.—James tendered a florin—I put it on the till, and gave him 1s. 2d. change—they paid for more drink, and one of them tendered another florin—the purchases were repeated six times—James passed four and Mills two florins—I put each florin on the till, being a small purchase—there were no other florins on the till—I had a suspicion of the second coin, but being customers, I did not think they would have done such a thing—they left the house, and came back in two or three minutes—they remained until the bouse closed—they had paid two florins before they went out—Mills gave the mistress 6d., which passed through the till—when the house closed I saw the prisoners leave—she took the till—she always clears it about 11.30—she called my attention to the coins—the master came and examined them—I gave a description of the men—the master went out, and came back with the two men—he told them the coins were bad—they denied passing them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are four compartments—I serve all round the bar—the mistress said, "You have taken bad money; who have you taken it from?" and I replied, "It must be from the men in the comer"—the prisoners were the two men in the corner—I have had five or six years' experience—I have taken bad money before—I wondered why they passed so many florins—I do not change large money—when they came back Mills said, "What do you mean by saying I passed bad money?"—when I said ho passed a bad florin James said, "No, I have not"—the pri<lb/>soners live close by—I noticed the time because the mistress cleared the till—I had seen the prisoners two months before—Mills is a horse<lb/>clipper—I have often seen him in the house—there were about 20 in the bars that night, not all regular customers, at least 10 were strangers.</p>

"Your friend Mills tendered two"—when I found Mills he denied it, and said it was not his game—both acknowledged being in the house—I brought them both in front of the barmaid—she said that Mills gave two, and James four florins—both denied that—James took about 6s. from his pocket, and again denied it—I said, "I suppose I must say good night; of one thing I am satisfied, I have six bad coins, if that is any satisfaction"—I communicated with the police the following morning—he took them to Arbour Square Station, where the coins were produced—the barmaid had been in my service 12 months on June 9th.</p>

Ehrman Bros., for the pay<lb/>ment of which I was entitled to six months' credit—on December 5th, 1898, I gave an order amounting to 80s., but 1 was allowed 1s. 6d. off, which made it £3 18s. 6d.—it was due on June 5th—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to me for orders, and from time to time I paid him money on behalf of his masters—I paid him in cash the account which was due on June 5th, and he gave me a receipt for it—on December 31st, 1898, I gave him a second order, which worked out at £5 19s. 2d., which came due on J une 30th—I received this letter from the prosecutors—(<hi rend="italic">Dated July ith, 1899. and requesting payment of overdue accounts, £10 12s. 2d.</hi>)—when I received that account I saw there was a claim against me for £3 18s. 6d. which I had already paid, and when the pri<lb/>soner called I drew his attention to the fact—he said I was to take no notice of anything that had been nent in that way from the firm, as some<lb/>times it was sent out by mistake; it was a kind of business matter, and that he had not really had sufficient time to pay it—he told me that on several occasions—I accepted that explanation—then there came up for discus<lb/>sion he £b 19s. 2d., which was owing on June 13th—I paid him £3 on account, which really left a balance of £2 15s. 6d., because they had not sent me some whisky, and I told Mr. Cohen so—he arave me a receipt for the £3, leaving the balance—I kept ray receipts in a clip hanging in the bar-parlour in a corner, and that was the place where I should put the receipt for the £3 18s. 6s. under ordinary circumstances, but I cannot take my oath as to whether I did or not—I put the receipt for the £3 there, I can swear to that, where it remained for several days—on July 18th the prisoner called again, and told me that Mr. Ehrman had appointed a collector, and that he should not call again to collect money, only to receive orders, and if I would give him my last receipt he would put everything in apple<lb/>pie order by the time the collector would call—I handed him the clip with the receipts on it, I think the receipts were all on it—I am certain that that one was—I put them on the table in the bar parlour—my son was there then—I was called into the bar—I afterwards went back to the bar parlour, and the prisoner was still there—when I handed the receipts to Mr. Cohen they were in folds, and he handed them back to me in folds, and said, "Mr. James, you will find everything nice by the time the collector calls upon you"—I put them into tho clips at the back of mo<lb/>the prisoner had a drink, and then went away—on July 19th I received this circular from Messrs.

Query: Did you call upon James, of Kingsland Road, yesterday, as arranged?" Reply: "I saw James last night; he asks me to let the account stand till after Easter. I shall without fail see him in a fortnight, and get his account. March is always a heavy month with publicans; they have to clear off all right" of rates, taxes, licences, etc, before quarter-day. James is all right"—that was accounted to us on April 14th by the prisoner—he did not account to us for £2 9s. 4d. on May 21st, received from Mr. Rainer; and he never has done so—he never accounted to U6 for the £3 18s. 6d. from Mr. Charles James, or for the £3 from the same person—he did not account to us for a cheque from Mr. Pym on July 6th, for £14. 3s. 6d.; he never has done so—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is crossed and endorsed by the prisoner—he was suspended on July 10th, 1899, after which he was not em<lb/>powered to act for us in any way—we never hod any intention of sending him to Birmingham after that date—we suspended him by a written document on July 10th—we did not intend to start him as a canvasser and take away the collecting from him.</p>

               <p>keep small accounts on hand to pay his expenses; he had no authority to do that—it was not arranged that he should be at liberty to sign cheques "per pro" with his own name; he had not done it before—when he signed the cheque for £3 14s. 6d. he was travelling in Ireland—it did not save any expense by cashing them there; the cheques are passed through our bank, like other cheques—I did not tell him be could use the firm's name so long as he put his own under it, so that if anything went wrong the cheque could be traced—I did not know that he was changing cheques every month—we had a customer named Cathies—in April last I knew that Cathies had paid the prisoner in cash, and it appeared to us that it was rather a large remit<lb/>tance to pay by cash, and we asked the prisoner if he received it by cash—he said he had—now for the first time I hear that he was paid by cheque—he told us that it was cashed—we have a customer named Mr. David Brown, of the Borough—there was a payment by him in the beginning of May—we sent in a claim on May 2nd for the account—he had already paid it to Cohen, and we had a communication from Brown, saying that he had settled with Cohen—I have no knowledge that he paid by cheque—on July 13th we wrote to Brown:" Dear Sirs,—Some time ago you wrote us that you had paid an account of ours by cheque to Mr. Cohen"—that was result of our investigations—we then had a report before us that Brown had stated that he had paid by cheque—the letter is not happily worded—we have a customer named Perry—a statement was sent to him—he said that he bad paid the money to Cohen—ue said nothing about a cheque—Cohen never had any difficulty in getting Ids weekly payments from us—we do not owe him any commission—his account is overdrawn to about £20 or £30—we do not owe him £33 16s. 4d.—we have a customer named Stanley, of the Strand—I do not recollect if we got an order from him for £8; very likely we did—he has been paid every commission—he has made a few fictitious claims—we do not owe him commission on £463 16s. at 17 1/2 per cent.—I have got his June account here—Smith's account, of Shaftesbury Avenue, is not here; it is under another traveller, it is not the prisoner's—he did not obtain that order—the order from Keen, of Carter Lane, for £70 was not accepted; under the agreement we are entitled to refuse orders—we did not refuse that in consequence of this case, or of his claim—I think the order of Hartley, of Green Lanes, wag refused on the ground that it would be a loss—I believe, in the case of Shaw, of Leadenhall Street, an order for £23, the prisoner agreed to take half commission and we credited him with it—the prisoner's turnover while he was with us was about £160 per month—we received a letter in March, giving his turnover—I am afraid that there are a great many defalcations besides the £3 and the £3 14a. 6d. on the prisoner's account—Cohen's successor collected Rainer's account—the prisoner collected £4 16s. from a man named Shipton, and only paid us £4 12s.—I believe it forms part of the indictment—I do not know that he spent 5s. in trying to sell the Golden Goblet, or that he actually spent 1s. 6d. on Shipton for our benefit—I suppose he spent the money for us as in other cases—we have a column ruled in our books for <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> allow<lb/>ances, not fictitious ones—we did not put the 6s. 8d. of James's in that column, we say that the prisoner took that—the prisoner's books were</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller in cigars, of 9, Kilburn Road—I know Cohen and Messrs. Ehrman Bros.—Cohen introduced me the first week in July to Mr. James as a likely purchaser of cigars—at a future date, it was on July 3rd, 4th or 5th, Cohen presented a state<lb/>ment to Mr. James—James said he could not meet the account by pay<lb/>ment, and Cohen asked if he had any loose money on him—James said he could let him have £3, and gave him £3, and Cohen wrote at the bottom of the statement an I O U—I could see that the statement was Messrs. Ehrman's for £9 odd.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 10, City Road—in May last my letters were addressed to 9, Trinity Street, Borough, which I had previously left, doing my business at home, at Hampstead, while seeking another office—I knew Barrett in 1895, and have met him occasionally since—I first knew him as clerk to Mr. Holloway, solicitor, who does not now hold a certificate, though on the rolls—I met Croager opposite this Court while the Wolfenden case was going on in April or May last—Barrett was a witness—I did not see Croager again until on this case at the Police-court—Holloway was a friend of mine, and when I could rot attend at Holloway Prison he went for me, and was associated with me in business—he made appointments for me, and I met Barrel t and Child outside 12 and 13, Arundel Place, Haymarket—we went iuto a restaurant, and I had a conversation with Barrett—Holloway came in—Barrett pro<lb/>posed being my clerrk at, I think, 30s. a week; I to have the use of the</p>

Yes' (<hi rend="italic">Signed "Henry Fisher" and counter signed by John Rogers, acting for the Governor</hi>)—Barrett was then shown into the visiting room, and we had a conversation—he took out some notes, and said, "These are what Croager gave me, but I don't think they are much good," and I did not trouble to read them—he said, "Have you got your statement ready?"—I said, "No; in fact, I have placed the matter in the hands of Mr. Abinger"—he said. "Oh; then there is nothing for me to do"—I said, "Well, you can call on some people in Red Lion Street," mention<lb/>ing their names; people I wished to be called as witnesses—he seemed disappointed, because there was no business to be done, and went away—I did not give him instructions to act for me—I understood from Croager that "Havelock" was simply a name made use of to get admission—I heard nothing of Mr. Havelock from Barrett—the next day Croager came—a warder brought me this paper, which I signed: "J, Thomas Henry Croager, of 32, Langham Road, request permission to see, on professional business, the prisoner, Henry Fisher.—<hi rend="smallCaps">G. E. HAVELOCK</hi>, Solicitor. June 2nd, 1899"—I knew "Croager, and signed the answer, "Yes," asking that he might see me—he saw me in the waiting-room—he brought me a copy of that supposed agreement, that I signed—I did not read it—he told me he had obtained some £5 or £6 of my brother, to which he had added some other moneys, making up £10, and had opened an account at the Birkbeck Bank in the joint names of himself and my brother—I said I would write to my brother—he said nothing about Mr. Havelock then—I did not instruct Croager to represent me as a solicitor's clerk—I was still in commnnica<lb/>tion with Mr. Abinger.</p>

No. 3808, was purchased on January 1st, 1898, for £88—we identify it from a description we have in the books—I have not seen that horse again—the dark brown or bay, No. 1060, we purchased on August 6th, 1898, and gave £55 for it—the bay gelding we purchased on March 26th, 1898, for £131 5s.; her height was 15.2 1/2—there was a pair of them—that price was for one only—we purchased the pair back from a customer who had to go abroad—the chestnut had not deteriorated—if hewas sold at Tattersall's, it would all depend when he was sold as to what price he would fetch; a horse sold at the end of the season would not fetch so much as if he were sold in the early part of the season; we ought to get what we gave for it—I do not know what he would fetch at a place like Diss; he was an aged horse; I think he was nearly 15 years old; but he was valuable to us because he was a good working horse—if we had bought the bay as a single horse we should have paid about £100 for it—the chestnut was down at the farm from about the middle of May—I do not think it was lame—I do not manage the horses at the farm—it might have had a cold—I have not seen any of the three horses since.</p>

W, Robinson and Co.'s, engineers—on Saturday, July 15th, I finished work at 1 o'clock, and laid down after dinner till 5 o'clock, and about 7 o'clock I went out and saw the prisoner—I was talking to him at the street door, and then went to the Custom House to see my mother, and came back at 8 or 8.15, and read the evening paper—it is not true that I was standing outside No. 184 with Bruder at 10 o'clock—I never saw him till very late, and I told him the police had been after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was sitting in my room reading till 11 o'clock, except going into the other room to see my wife—about 10.30 there was a rush to my house, and I said, "Good God! what is the matter?" and the police came in and searched my house for Mr. Bruder, but could not find him—I did not hear the door slam before that—I had not been standing outside, and I did not go in and slam the door—the prisoner lives in the house; he is my lodger—I let the police in, and took a light, and took them right through—when I was talking to the prisoner at 7 o'clock no one else was with me.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, at Ching-ford—on August 11th I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination on the body of Evelyn Constance Hodson—I had seen her on June 6th, and at thesame time I saw McDonald and Keen—I examined them for the inspector—I found Hodson emaciated, under the average for her size—she was clean, in fact, she was in a bath, being washed by the prisoner, who said she fed her on milk and water in equal parts—although she was thin, I did not con<lb/>sider her suffering from starvation—I cannot say that she was neglected—the prisoner appeared anxious to do what I recommended her to do in the way of feeding—I saw Hodson again two days afterwards, and the other two were suffering from diarrhoea—I did not see her again till the 11th, when I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—her weight was 5 lb. 4oz.—the average weight of a child of three months is 9 lb 3 oz.—this child was six months then, and it should have been 12 lb. 4 oz.—the external appearances were emaciaton, no superficial fat, a bed sore on both hips and sacrum, which were mostly due to not having been kept sufficiently clean; the brain was healthy, the left lung was slightly congested, the right lung normal, in<lb/>testines were pale and attenuated, distended with gas; the stomach con<lb/>tained about a teaspoonful of fluid, spleen normal; there was no disease—I should say the child died of improper and insufficient feeding, lasting, I should say, for weeks; it was slow, whatever it was—the distinction between improper food and insufficient food is a fine one—I found no traces of recent diarrhcea.</p>

               <p>said yes—I said I would give her 6s., a week for it—this took place in the front room—she said she was going down into the country—a week later I took the child to her, and about a fortnight after that I went down to 19, Cromer Road, Walthamstow, and saw my child—when I gave the child to the prisoner it was not in very good health—I had given it the breast—when I saw it at Walthamstow it had improved—I saw it once a fortnight up to the week before it died—the last time I saw it, about August 1st, I noticed it looked very ill—I spoke to the prisoner about its condition, and she said it had got convulsions, and that she had seen a doctor about it, she did not say which doctor—I gave her 4s. extra to pay for the doctor—I got several letters from her—I sent her her money by postal orders—after I saw the child on August 1st, I heard that it was dead by telegram signed by the prisoner; I think that was on August 8th—I went to Chingford about August 11 th—I saw the prisoner—she said there was to be an inquest on my baby—I went to it—when I saw the child on August 1st I noniced that there was a brown mark on its forehead—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she said it was a birth-mark, and that it had always had it—it had not had it really—I had only seen her little girl there, a child of about seven—she never told me that she had any other children in the house—I continued to pay her her money, so she lost by the child's death—I gave some clothes with the child.</p>

I am single, and lived at the Royal Oak, Plumstead; I entered the deceased's service as general servant on December 1st, 1898—Mr. and Mrs. Fludger lived there, with two nephews, little boys—the prisoner had been drinking heavily since March—on June 4th, between 6 and 6 p.m., the deceased went upstairs to dress—the prisoner was down-stairs in the bar-parlour—I saw my mistress go upstairs, and I went up</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of Herbert Road, Plumstead—on July 7th I was called into the Royal Oak—I saw the deceased in the room behind the bar—she was up and dressed—the pnsoner was in the same room Iying on the couch—he was in a state of drunken stupor—the deceased complained of pain in her right side—I examined her, and found a bruise on her right side, about six inches</p>

               <p>square; it was recent—she complained of pain in breathing—she placed her hand over her breast, and said that that was where the pain was—I found indications of pleurisy there—her temperature was normal—I should say that the pleurisy was just commencing—I sent her to bed immediately—the prisoner was then asleep—when he awoke I found he was suffering from delirium tremens—I should say it was a maniacal delirium, going on for a long time—it was the first time I had seen him, and it was hard to judge—I had him removed to the infirmary—the woman's temperature increased, and she died on the 12th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—I found a bruise on the right side, also bruises on the forearm—the body was fairly well nourished—on opening the thorax I discovered a few ounces of blood in the right pleural cavity, of a seio<lb/>pleural character, with flakes of lymph in it—the parts of the pleura over the side of the external bruise felt rough to the touch; it was the result of pleurisy—the cause of death was pneumonia and pericarditis—I attribute the pleurisy to the violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen the woman before—there were several bruises on the right forearm, from the elbow to the wrist—they were not old bruises; not given so long ago as three months or three weeks—the pain in her breast was from the lower margin of the seventh rib right down to the margin of the last—there was no albumen in the kidneys—they were not the kidneys of a person addicted to drink—I took her temperature about 10 a.m. on the Wednesday, and again at 3; then it was 99.5—it was a rise from the morning—I have had a good number of cases of pleurisy and pneumonia—external bruising is a very uncommon cause of pleurisy; I have never seen a case of it—pericarditis is an inflammation of the serus membrane enclosing the heart—you can get pleurisy from rheumatic fever; pericarditis can be produced by rheumatism—I think the external bruise caused pleurisy, and the pleurisy caused pneumonia—I cannot say that I have ever known pleurisy causing pneumonia; the pneumonia caused pleurisy—the whole of the right lung was in a state of solidifica<lb/>tion; with the exception of a small part of the apex—I have never in my experience known such extensive solidification of a lung by an external injury—I think the appearance of the right lung would be the same both in idiopathic pneumonia and traumatic pneumonia—I said before that I had never seen crepitation of the lung arise from pleurisy caused by ex<lb/>ternal injury—it is a rare thing to find that the lung has been perforated—I noticed in my <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> that the colour of the liver was red—the ribs were not affected—if she had been a drunkard it would have pre-disposed her to illness of any sort—I do not think that a drunken woman would be more likely to be affected by pneumonia than a drunken man—by the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> I should say that she was in a good state of health—some people bruise much easier than others, especially women; this bruise was at first much discoloured, not afterwards.</p>

I live at 129, Cambell Road—between I and 2 on the morning after this outrage I saw the prosecutor—I found his clothes were corroded, that he had some bums on the right side of the face and neck, and under his vest and shirt there was a large bum, right through his clothes—I have examined the bottle and some of its con<lb/>tents—from that, and from the condition of his clothes, I find it was sulphuric acid, not carbolic: carbolic would burn the skin, but it would subside after a few days; it would not go through the clothes, or leave a red stain, like sulphuric does—water would dilute the acid—I fail to see what one would want sulphuric acid for, carbolic would be very natural—it would be natural for the prosecutor to have an operation—the glands would swell, and would have to be cut—sulphuric is never used for drains; it would eat away all the iron.</p>

                  </hi>. I am House Surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prisoner was admitted on the afternoon of July 20th—I saw him imme<lb/>diately on his arrival—he was collapsed, conscious, but exhausted, suffering from shock—he had a wound on the right side of his neck about 1 1/2 in. long, penetrating the skin, and partially dividing the muscles—we found it necessary to administer chloroform—we told him we were going to do so—we have to ask permission to administer ansesthetics—he could under<lb/>stand what I said to him, and when I told him so he said, "Finish it off"—he wanted the chloroform to end his life—as far as I can remember? he said, "Let the chloroform finish me"—he was quite sober—he re<lb/>mained in the hospital till the 31st, when he was removed by the police—he was under my care all the time—he was quite rational—he was sullen—he did not say anything unless you asked him a question—he under<lb/>stood what was said.</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Reid, and live at 56, Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner's wife is my sister—I remember the marriage—they had two children—the eldest, Margaret, was born about a month or six weeks after the marriage—I saw a good deal of the prisoner and his wife until they went over the water; that was about</p>

               <p>three years ago—they went first of all to the Russells—I remember that a man named Olliffe called on me on July 16th—he had been away some nine years—I knew him before he joined the army—I did not recognise him at first as my old friend—my husband and I went with Olliffe to a public-house near Boundary Lane, for the purpose of seeing my sister and her husband—I left Olliffe and my husband in the public-house while I went and told my sister—I saw my sister—the prisoner was there—I said, "Sam is round the corner with a friend"—Sam is my husband—I went with my sister and the prisoner to the public-house where my husband and Olliffe were—we did not tell them who Olliffe was—he was introduced to my sister as a friend, to see if she would recognise him—my husband called him Thompson, and I called him Ben, as his name was Benjamin—we then all went back to our house—Mrs. Ward found out who Olliffe was when I called him Ben—the two children, Margaret and Louisa, went to our house t oo—Ollifife made a great fuss of them, and so he did of mine; he is very fond of children—Olliffe had walked out with my sister before he went to India—I think the prisoner knew that—at Clerkenwell Olliffe said to the prisoner, "Your wife is an old sweetheart of mine"—he said that about 10 p.m.—up to that time the prisoner and the rest of us had been enjoy<lb/>ing ourselves, but after that the prisoner turned dreadfully angry—he asked my sister if she was going home, and he asked Olliffe if the child was his—he said, "No, God forbid! if she was I would give £10 for her"—she was very pretty—he said it could nob be his, as he had been away 80 long—he pulled his papers out, and showed the prisoner the date he left—the prisoner tried to persuade my sister to go home—he then went out for about half an hour, and then came back and demanded a drink; we offered him a glass of ale, and he would not have it—he then asked his wife if she was going home again—she said, "No; why don't you stay and be sociable?"—he was going to strike my sister, because she would not go but I stopped him, and he went out—my sister and the two children stayed with me over the Monday night—on Tuesday afternoon my sister and the youngest child went home—Margaret stayed, with me until Wednesday evening, and then my sister fetched her home—that is the last I saw of them alive—I went to see the prisoner on the Friday in the hospital—he said, "If she had come home on the Sunday night it would never have happened"—I was there about three-quarters of an hour—I went with my sister, and she had some conversation with him, but I could not hear what they were saying—the prisoner seemed rather strange on the Friday—he seemed rather funny about his eyes—he spoke pretty sensibly.</p>
