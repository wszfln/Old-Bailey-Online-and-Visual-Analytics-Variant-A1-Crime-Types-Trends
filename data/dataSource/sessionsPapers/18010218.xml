               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that this was sugar in your charge? - A. It was very likely it was, for it corresponds with the sugar, I found the hogsheads knocked out; I was responsible for the sugar; I looked upon it there was nearly a quarter of hundred weight deficient; there was more than this two pounds taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this two pounds of sugar? - A. I take it to be about one shilling.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MERRYMAN sworn. - I am a constable, I took the prisoner into custody, I have had the sugar from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming down about nine o'clock in the morning, and there were some hogsheads of sugar knocked down, and I picked it up.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Was it light or dark when you were alarmed? - A. I was rather frightened at the time, and I brought a candle down with me, but when I went to the watch-house, I found it sufficiently light to walk along; there was light enough to distinguish the features of a person's face; I probably was the last of the family up, excepting the prisoner; I cannot say whether my house was fastened over-night, but probably it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any part of your house injured, or broke open? - A. Not that I saw, the patrole was in the entry at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of those shoes? - A. I value the women's shoes at seven shillings, and the men's shoes at three shillings.</p>

               <p>Q.After you had told Mr. Pepperal, did you go back? - A. I went back, and pointed the prisoner out to him, after shewing him the chest.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find a deficiency there? - A. Yes; I then went to the prisoner, and told him to get on with his work, and looked to see if his countenance altered; finding it did not, I called him along-side, and told him to come with me; and as we jogged on, I kept my eyes down towards his breeches; when I came to the stair-case, I put my hand to his shoulder, and begged him not to resist, and he begged for mercy; I immediately told him I could shew him none; he then put his hand to his breeches, and pulled out a bag of tea, and said, he was very sorry for what he had done; he said it was the first time, and hoped I would not take him to the accompting-house; I told him I was obliged; I took him down to the accompting-house, and I gave the tea into the charge of Mr. Brookes, the elder; I went to the chest of tea afterwards, and apparently the tea were both alike; that is all I know about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How many persons do you employ in that warehouse in Jewry-street? - A. I should suppose two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you? - A. Yes; when I went to Mr. Stockwell with him, he said, going along, he hoped there would be nothing come of this, more than a dismissal from his employ; he said, he could not think what could induce him to do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he been in the habit of collecting tripe from your house for Messrs. Payne? - A. Yes; he came on the 4th of February, with the prisoner Pope; Blake asked how many tripes we had, I told him I did not know; he told them over, and said there were eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them to him as the servant of Messrs. Payne? - A. Yes, for Mr. Payne.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not watch his counting, to see whether he counted right? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JAMES TURNHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable belonging to the Thames Police-office: On the 4th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Payne's cart standing at Mr. Hill's door, with tripe and neats feet; I saw Blake and Pope standing together at the door; I saw the cart go up East Smithfield, and at the end of Dirty-lane stood Spencer, with a little poney, about three hundred yards from Mr. Hill's; Pope stopped and spoke to Spencer; then the cart went on to the middle of Dirty-lane; I was going on for Tower-hill; I turned round, I saw Pope and Blake in the cart; I was about forty yards from them; I saw Pope with a sack which was in the cart; Pope had got hold of the sack, Blake was pulling up the tripe; Blake and Pope put the tripe into the sack; their backs were towards me; I saw some neats feet put in besides; then Pope got up and looked round, I thought he saw me; then I ran up King-street, because they should not see me, and went round upon Towerhill, and there I saw the cart, and Spencer, Pope, and Blake at the Black Horse door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the sack? - A. I did not see the sack after; I saw Spencer put his hand in his pocket and give Blake something, but I do'nt know what, which Blake put into his breeches pocket; then I saw the sack taken out of the cart and put upon Spencer's poney, and then they went away for Rosemary-lane: then I took Pope and Spencer into custody at the end of White Lion-street; they asked me for what; I said you know for what, for this you have got upon the horse; I took them to the office, and going along they offered me something to let them at liberty; Spencer said he was just going to begin business, and he would give me any thing; I said, no, they should go before the magistrate; I took Blake the same day at Mr. Payne's; I took him into the accompting-house, and asked him for an account of the tripe that he had brought home; he said, thirty-six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180010"/>from Mr. Mellish and ten from Mr. Hill's; then he said it was the first time he had sold any thing out of the cart, and he hoped his master would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q. At the time this passed, what was said to induce him to confess? - A. I did not hear any thing of the kind; we took him into custodody.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the tripe that you saw put into the sack came from Mellish's, or Hill's, or any where else, you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bag after you got to the office? - A. Yes; there was one tripe, four feet, a rule, a recd, and a bunch of lights.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This was Messrs. Payne's cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Payne). Q. Did you pay Mr. Mellish for thirty-six tripes that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay Mr. Hill for eleven tripes that day? - A. I have not paid either of them yet; my account is not yet come in.</p>
               <p>Blake's defence. I am not guilty; I never stole any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>The other two prisoners left their defence to their Counsel.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH LIFFORD sworn - I am in partnership with my brother, William: I had missed a quantity of new rope from my rigging-house, and Thursday, the 5th, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I went into the rope-ground, and listened if I could hear any body in the premises, and I heard some person walking in the rigging-house; I immediately went in doors to the man who had the keys of the rope-ground, I unlocked the wicket, and as soon as I went in I saw a man's coat tied up with rope in it, about thirty-five yards from the rigging-house door; I then went up the ladder into the rigging-house, with a candle and lantern, in my hand, and found the door open; as soon as I went in, I saw the prisoner lying upon some yarn, asleep; I immediately went down again, I did not wake him, and went into my yarn-house; about four o'clock the man awoke, and came very softly down the ladder; he stopped about five minutes listening if any body was about, and then he went on past where I was, very slowly, to the gate where I had seen the property; he stopped at the gate a little time, and then came back again, past where I was standing; he then went very softly again past where I was, down to the gate; I then heard a creaking, as if somebody was getting over the gate; I went down very softly, and the property was gone; I then unlocked the wicket very gently, and went out, the prisoner was standing outside the gate, with the bundle tied up at his feet; I immediately caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; he said, he had only got a little rope to buy him some bread; I told him if he offered to stir I would knock him down; he rushed from me, and I stepped before him and knocked him down with a stick that I had in my hand; I made him take the rope upon his back, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he work for you? - A. I never saw him at work myself; but I understand from my foreman he did work two days for me two months ago; the rope that I found in the bundle was old rope, such as we used to bind new rope with; we are rope makers.(

            , and when I came out again, he was walking backwards and forwards; he might have got away, if he would; when he was before the Magistrate, he said they belonged to a Mrs. Walker at Gosport; that she had intrusted him to take them into his care, as he was coming to town; the Magistrate then committed him for further examination; the next day, or the day after, Mrs. Withers came to my house, and saw the trunk.</p>

               <p>Mrs. SUNDERLAND sworn. - I live at No. 20, Holles-street, Clare-market: On Sunday evening, the 11th of January, the prisoner came to my house about seven o'clock; he came to take a lodging for himself and another sailor; there was a young man with him dressed like a sailor; the prisoner at the bar had a small box; I saw him open the box, to shew that he had abundance of things in it to pay the lodgings; it was only corded round when I saw it; it was not locked; he told me his wife had gone away from him, and he had kept all her clothes; I said, I could not conceive it could be his wife's, for she was a small woman; he lodged at my house with her four months before; these things were much larger than her's; besides, she had only common clothes; they lodged with me four days, they had no box then; the young lad that he brought along with him, said, have nothing to do with that box, ma'am, for he has stole it; he denied the charge; I let him put it in a two-pair of stairs back room, which he had taken, and then they both went away, and said they would return in about half an hour; I saw no more of him till the next morning, then I asked him what was to be done with the box, and the young man again said he had stole it from a coach, and then the prisoner went to strike him; I was very much alarmed; then they both went up stairs, and opened it; I told him to be honest, and go and give up the box to the inn again; then he came down stairs, and said he would go to the inn, and bring the lady, or get her to send a porter for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say what inn? - A. No; they both said they came by the Portsmouth coach; I then went, and asked Mr. Goring's advice; while he was gone, there came a little woman, who said, she was his wife, that she had come for a box of her things that he had taken away, and that it had been left there by mistake; it was not the woman that lived with him when he lodged with me before; I asked her what it contained, and she could not inform me; she was going away, and the prisoner came in, and he insisted upon my giving up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180013"/>the box, and I would not; I asked him if that was his wife, and he said, no, it was a woman he lived with; about four o'clock, he came with a man that called himself a constable, and three other men, to make me give it up, and then I went and fetched Mr. Goring, but the man afterwards disowned being a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming through Whitechapel; I met a woman that asked me to take this trunk to my lodging; I opened it before Mrs. Sunderland, and when I lodged with her before, I rigged her and her daughter out with money that I had taken at Somerset-house. <rs id="t18010218-17-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am the wife of John Dibble: Last Saturday week, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I went to call my husband from a few doors off, and in returning home I saw two boys come out of my door, the prisoner at the bar had something under his arm, but I did not take any notice of it; I took hold of him, and said, do you want any thing, and he immediately ran past me; I then observed a handkerchief which was falling under his arm; I called to him, and told him, he would lose his things; I then saw a cap lying at the threshold of the door; my husband then came up, and ran after him, and brought him back; I am pretty sure he is the boy; he rather resisted when my husband brought him back; he had under his jacket a shirt and pillowcase; he was taken to the officer's in Shorter-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dusk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the boy had a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He is but a very little boy, and therefore you could not very well have seen his face, you being so much taller? - A. That is the boy that had the clothes under his arm when he went from my door, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell any body you did not think that was the boy you first saw at your door? - A. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>JOHN DIBBLE sworn. - In consequence of what my wife told me, I went after the prisoner; he was then about seven or eight yards from me; I came up to him, and asked him what he had been doing; he said, nothing, he was upon his master's business; I saw the shirt under his coat.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Was it wet? - A. Yes; just wrung out from the wash-tub; I took the shirt and pillow-case from under his jacket, and carried it with the boy to the officer.(The officer produced the property, which was deposed to by Mrs. Dibble).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going of an errand; my mistress sent me to look for my master, and I saw two boys come out of this shop and drop something, and run away; I picked it up; the gentleman came after me, and asked me what I had got; I said I had got a prize, but I did not know what it was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010218-20-verdict104" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Court. Q. If you had not known your cows were missing, and had seen them in Smithfield-market, would you have said, these are mine? - A.

               <p>WILLIAM GRANT sworn. - I am a stone mason: On the 28th of January, about half past twelve, going past New-court, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner with a coal-scuttle in one hand, and a bundle in a silk handkerchief in the other, and the two women running after him; he was walking very fast up the court; I stopped him till the women came up, and Mrs. Swaine said it was her coal-scuttle; he said, he bought it at a shop in Fleet-lane; I asked him if he should know the shop again; he said, he did not; I then took him to the constable's, and he was secured.(Henry Beadle, the constable, produced the coalscuttle, which was deposed to by Mrs. Swaine).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought it in Fleet-lane; I told the lady so, as soon as she asked me; I walked with her to Fleet-lane, but there are so many shops alike in that line, that I could not tell which it was; I went up the passage to see if that was it, and the lady gave the alarm of shop thief, immediately; I had it openly in my hands, and I might have got away before, if I had had a mind.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character, and deposed, that when he had been drinking, he was in a state of derangement. <rs id="t18010218-24-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>THOMAS RADFORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a servant to MR. Bold; On the Friday, the day before the property was lost, I saw the three prisoners on board the lighter; they were taking a few plumbs in their hands, that was all I saw them do; I had some suspicion taht there were some baskets concealed in the lighter, and, on Saturday night, I told Mr. Davis, and he got a key, and I went on board with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you observed them on board the lighter? - A.About a quarter of an hour; we found eleven baskets in the locker, we left them there, and locked them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. Alley. Q. You saw these men tasting the plumbs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is thing you all do, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no key to this lock but the one that Davis had? - A. Yes, they all had keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I went on board the Cazinove with the last witness; I unlocked the locker, and found eleven baskets of raisins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the place where raisins were likely to be found? - A. That place had nothing at all to do with the bulk of the raisins that ought to have been put into the lighter; I locked them up again, and left them exactly as they were; I set Mr. Wilson, another clerk of Mr. Blot's and three others, to watch the lighter; I was with them; we watched from the accompting-house window, where we could see the lighter, that was on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Then you might suppose that there was some robbery going forward? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Bolt: In consequence of information, I took my place upon the staircase of the accompting-house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, where I could see Mr. Bolt's Fghter; I was about eight or ten yards from it; Mr. Davis was with me, Mr. Penford; Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Reece; I saw the prisoner go down into the Cazinove; he walked all round the lighter, and then returned; very soon after, the three prisoners all came together; and went on board the Cazinove again, and loosened the headfast and sternfast, and got her away from the wharf into the stream; I desired Davis and Penfold to stop at Billingsgate; Wilson, Reecc, and I, got into a wherry, and followed as fast as we could to the stairs, and passed the lighter as she was at Ralph's quay; I saw the three men in her when I left Fresh wharf; I lost fight of her five or six minutes, while I was getting into the wherby.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Have your lighters business out of a night? - A.Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them at Ralph's quay; what did you see next? - A.They hauled her up to Dice quay, along-side the William of Aldborough, a Suffolk Vessel; I then desired Reece to row the ashore, for I thought they were then going to take the baskets on to the wharf; I then went on shore, and on to the wharf; I then went over the vessels to see if she was still by the side of the Aldborough vessel, I found she was gone; I then went over some other vessels, and found her along-side the Hawk, of Deal, the three prisoners were in her then; I then went to Smart's quay, and waited there some time, then Reece came to me, and I told him to row about till he found her; she was then gone from along-side the Hawke; I then went on board a Yarmouth vessel, called the Hope, of Deal; in three or four minutes, I saw Saunders hail the Cazinove lighter out of the dock; he then led her along-side the Hawke, of Deal, again; I then went to look for Mr. Bolt, to know what was to be done; I could not find him; I sent for an officer, and saw them coming out of the gun-tap; we followed Saunders and Cole, and took them in Salutation-court.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How long was this after you had seen them on the river? - A. I dare say half an hour; they said they did not know what they were taken for, they were delivered to Green; we did not apprehend Barton till last Monday, at Spice lslands; after we had apprehended the prisoners, we went out, and found ten baskets of raisins inside of the Hope of Deal, and one basket outside, the ten laid between the Hope of Deal, and the Hope of Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.There were five of you set to watch this evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were provided with arms, I take it for granted? - A. I took a pistol with me when I went on the water.</p>
               <p>Q. If the lighter had remained where she was, if they had not hauled her out, would not she have been a-ground? - A. No, she can never be a-ground there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that those men were the three prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180018"/>Q. How do you know that? - A. I know them very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see their faces? - A. Yes; I can swear to their features.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a good many barges about at this time? - A. Yes; at one time I was so near to Saunders, that I turned round, and was afraid of being discovered; I have known Cole working for us for some years, and Saunders has worked five months with us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where was it that you last saw all the prisoners together on board? - A. While the Cazinove lay along-side the Hope, of deal.</p>
               <p>JACOB REECE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was with Mr. Johnson upon the watch at Freshwharf; I saw the Cazinove lay along-side the Hope, of Deal, at Billingsgate-dock; I afterwards saw her shoved out along-side the Hawke, it was dark, and I did not see any body on board her when she was at Billingsgate-dock; but when she was shoved out, I saw the prisoner, Saunders, on board; he shoved her out, and made her fast along-side the Hawke.</p>
               <p>JAMES CUTHBERT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was on board the Hawke, on Saturday night, the 7th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners? - A. I know one of them, Cole, he came on board our vessel, and enquired for the Hope, that was between nine and ten o'clock, there were two more with him, but I don't know them; they made the lighter fast to our vessel, and then came on board our vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Cazinove? - A. No; Cole asked me for my master, Thatcher; I told him my master was not Thatcher, but Hill; then I hailed the Hope, and Cole was going to throw me over-board, because I made such a noise; he called me a young b-r, and if I did not hold my tongue, he would knock me to hell.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. How long have you known Cole? - A.Ever since he failed in the Hawke.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that? - A.Six months.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked there to pick out the man that spoke to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember who you picked cut at that time? - A. Cole.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect yourself - Did you not point out Saunders as the man who spoke to you? - A.They all three spoke to me about making a noise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How came you to point out Saunders? - A. I knew him by his great coat.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to say just now, that the only one of the three that you knew was Cole? - A. I knew Saunders by his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, knowing that man's life is at stake, that Saunders was one of them? - A. Yes; he had on a fustian great coat; and when he was before the Lord-Mayor, he had the same coat on.</p>

               <p>- HISCOCK sworn. - I am shopman to William Nias, in Leicester-fields; I was engaged in serving a customer; there were a great many pieces of calimanco at the door, and I heard one of them fall; I then heard a cry of shop thief, and almost immediately Shelley brought in a piece, but I cannot swear to the property, there is no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss such a piece of calimanco as that? - A. No, we had such calimanco at the door, but I cannot say that is it. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Shelley). Is that the piece that you carried back? - A. I cannot say. A. Is that the piece that you saw the prisoner drop? - A. I cannot swear that it is.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hiscock.) Is that the piece that was delivered to you by Shelley? - A. I cannot swear that, because there were two pieces brought back and delivered to the constable; I cannot say which was which.</p>

If it is your own property, I must see what it is; I looked at it, and found it to be some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180021"/>old rusty iron bars, and some new iron, for something in the farmering line, that I believe had never been used; he said he knocked his knife against them as he was cutting the hay; I asked him who he worked for, and he told me Mr. Mortimer; I went and acquainted Mr. Mortimer, and he came to Bow-street and claimed the iron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.He told you it was iron? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. By what mark do you swear to that iron? - A. Here is a harrow tire, which is made out of an old tire, and here are the nail holes, they are made remarkably stout and out of size.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRADY sworn. - I am a blacksmith, at Camden-town, I made these harrow teeth, they have not been used, they were made out of some old strakes, I never saw such before nor since, I can swear positively to them, I never made such things before in my life, nor any body else, I verify believe.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you made him any promise? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor threatened him? - A.Neither; I kept charge of the prisoner all night, for I could not procure an officer; in the morning I procured an officer, and told him that was his prisoner, I gave charge of him; when I went to look for the sack I found it removed very near the barn door; I went to search for the nail he spoke of, but instead of finding the nail I found this key, (produces a skeleton key); before I put my initials into the sack I looked at the heap of corn on the barn floor, and there appeared to be some gone; It was put there to be cleaned, and I found in the sack a quantity of the same sort of dust; corn is generally skreened, and this was taken out before it was skreened; I have no doubt of it being part of the same heap, there are three bushels and three pecks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the corn with intent of giving it to the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do with feeding the horses? - A.Nothing at all; he had no business with it.</p>
               <p>RALPH ANDERSON sworn. - I am barn-man to the last witness; I was ordered into the barn by my master, on the 17th of January; I had been employed that day in cleaning corn in the barn; the prisoner was backwards and forwards in the barn several times; the street door of the barn was left open in the evening, and I let myself in and fastened the door, and I covered myself in the sheaves that were not threshed; after I had been there about ten minutes, I heard somebody open the door and come into the barn; he came down the barn floor and went to the sack of oats, at the end of the barn; it was upon some trusses of straw, about my height; I heard him take down the sack, he moved it to where the floor rose, and then he took it upon his shoulder; I rose from out of the sheaves that I was covered with, and said, stop, or I will shoot you dead; he turned round and said, will you; I said, yes Henry; I went up to him and told him he must go with me to my master, and then it would be explained who came for the lack of oats; he said he did not care for that, for he was only going to take them to Joe, who was our carter, and has since absconded.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it usual for you to skreen the oats before you gave them to the horses? - A. Always before it is given to the granary, or else they are not finished.(Potter Batson, the constable, produced the sack; containing some oats and a piece of paper with the initials of the prosecutor upon it).</p>
               <p>Hutchings. This is the same piece of paper that I put into the sack; the prisoner came to live with me last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you at all lose sight of him? - A. Yes; while I was going round the hay-stack, that was all; I seized the prisoner and said, what, I have got you at last; upon which he threw down the truss of hay and put his hands in his great coat pockets; I told him to take them out or I would cut them; I then made him take up the truss of hay and carry it to a pair of high yard gates which opened from the yard; I got over the gates to unfasten them; the prisoner then threw down the truss of hay and ton away; I pursued and retook him, at the distance of about forty yards from the gates, and made him come back; I desired him to take up the truss of hay and carry it into the high road, which he would not do; I then threatened to cut him unless he went into the high road, which threats I repeated three or four times to no effect; I was under the necessiry then of cutting him on the leg with a sword; after this the prisoner went with me, and I put him into the custody of the watchman of the night; I then returned to the yard gates where the truss of hay was; I took it to the accompting-house, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180023"/>it has been ever since; he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he had taken the hay for his horses; he keeps a cook's-shop at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Did he not tell you that the man who ran away had told him that he was a servant of your's, and had desired him to take it? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Moggridge. Upon examining the window directly after I came home, I found it had been cut; it was broke before, but had been mended by a glazier; the glass was cut in a three corner square, sufficient to take out the shoes; it was impossible they could have fell out, they were the top pair of a pile of seven that I had taken in from the women binders at five o'clock that evening; they laid one in another upon their sides; there is no particular mark about them, only that they are my own cutting and trimming, and they correspond in the number; there are six pair left.</p>

               <p>Q.What may the value of them be? - A.Four shillings.</p>
               <p>William March, jun. When they were searched Tally had a knife in his waistcoat pocket, which I saw taken from him.(Mr. March, sen. produced the knife).</p>
               <p>Mr. Moggridge. The putty was quite fresh, and might have been taken away with the finger, it was removed all round; I made particular search after the glass, but could not find it; it was puttied inside and out, and some sacks put in to strengthen the frame.</p>
               <p>Tally's defence. I was coming up Fleet-street, and that young man laid hold of me; I saw a pair of shoes lying upon the payement, and I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180024"/>pick them up and that young man knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Mulling's defence. One of my sisters was taken very sick; my father works at London bridge, and I was going to fetch him, and that young man followed me and took me back to the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Tally, called his mother and the mother of Mullings, who deposed that they had never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, in Fenchurch-street: On Wednesday last, between five and six o'clock, as near as I can tell, Sapwell came in to know if our shop-window had been cut; I then looked in the window, and missed the goods; upon which he immediately produced to me eight pieces of ribbon; I looked at them, some had the marks torn off, and others had part of the marks left, which I knew to be my marking; I looked at the window, which had been cut before, and mended by a glazier, the piece which had been put in was gone; I had seen the ribbon there at eight o'clock in the morning; the piece was put in with putty and sacks, about a fortnight before; the hole was not large enough for me to put my hand in, a boy's hand might go in; Mr. Sapwell has the ribbons, they are Mr. Harrison's property.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL sworn. - I am an officer of the Ward of Bishopsgate: Last Wednesday, about four o'clock, I was sent for to Mr. Page's, in Bishopsgate-street, haberdasher, the prisoner was there; I took off his hat, and in his hat I found five rolls of ribbon, and one roll, which I believe dropped from behind him, but I did not see it drop, and two rolls were taken from him by Mr. Bevan; I asked him how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour? - A. No; I said he had better tell the truth. (Produces the ribbons).</p>
               <p>GEORGE THOMAS BEVAN sworn. - When the prisoner was brought into our shop, he fell down upon the floor, and two rolls of ribbon rolled from him; I believe these to be the two.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Litley.) How many servants have you in the house? - A. A shopwoman, and a little schoolboy.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear, that from eight o'clock in the morning, when you saw the ribbons, till Sapwell came in, there was not one minute of time when some one of you was not in the house? - A. I can; I am sure of it.(The two rolls that fell from the prisoner upon the floor, were deposed to by Litley).</p>

Yes; and was discharged: On Wednesday night last, a little after seven o'clock, I drove the cart into Bouverie-street from Old-street-road, my father was not with the cart; the prisoner appointed to meet me in Bridge-street, Blackfriars; he met me there, and shewed me into Bouvrie-street, he was a stranger to me; he told me to turn the horse's head round, and then the prisoner, and two more, put a piece of oak into the cart; a gentleman came up, and they all three ran away; he sent for Mr. March to take care of the cart, and detained me; Mr. Goodman came, and said that was his wood, and that I had no right to take it away; I saw the prisoner again the next morning, at the Compter.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARCH, sen. sworn. - On Wednesday evening, about half past eight o'clock, I was sent for by Mr. Haylett, who keeps the Black-lion, in Water-lane: I took the last witness into custody, and I took the cart and the timber into Mr. Haylett's yard; in consequence of information, I took a person of the name of Josselin into custody, and sent them both to the Compter; they were taken the next morning before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER JOSSELIN sworn. - I deal in coals and wood, in Old-street-road, near the turnpike at Shoreditch Church: I hired Jefferys's cart to fetch away this wood, which I was to buy of a man of the name of Creed, I know nothing of the prisoner; I went into Water-lane, but could not find the place, and I then went home; after I had been home some time, I was informed that the boy, and the horse and cart, had been stopped; and I was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JEFFERYS, sen. sworn. - I let my cart to Joffelin, and sent my son with it.</p>

               <p>LYON SOLOMONS sworn. - I am an officer: I apprehended the prisoner, about ten o'clock last Thursday morning, in Old-street-road; he had another man with him, but he ran away.</p>
               <p>Goodman. The timber is not here; I knew it to be mine by a mark that I put upon it when I bought it; I had not given any body authority to take it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was employed by two coalheavers to help to load the cart, I did not know the men; I lent a hand to put three pieces of timber into a cart, I know no more about it; it is very common at the water-side for us to lend one another a hand. <rs id="t18010218-41-verdict228" type="verdictDescription">

A. I know the horse-shoes to be mine; I also found a pick-lock key; that was found in the prisoner's bed-room; I saw the officer take it up from the bed-room window.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the lock been forced? - A. Yes, with a punch or a crow, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Was it the door that was broke open? - A. They broke in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. A picklock key would be a very useful thing to break open a window with? - A. No; they got at the key afterwards.</p>
               <p>JOHN NUTTMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a smith and farrier, at Hampton; I work upon the premises of Mr. Marston; he has kept the key of it ever since I have been there: On Saturday morning, the 7th of February, the horseshoes were shewn to me; they were found by my boy in a bag upon my premises; I knew them to be Alcorn's shoes from the make of them; I had heard of the robbery on the Friday morning; I went to Marston, and asked him if he knew any thing of that iron that was there, and he said, no, I said, either you, or somebody belonging to you, must; he then went up to the fire with his two hands in his pocket and said, work them up; I could not rightly hear the first word, but he said, work them up; I said, sharply, what I and he said, d-n you, you can't hear nothing, nor yet understand; he called me out, and said, I want to speak to you; I went out backwards, and he said, d-n it, if you had not said any thing to my boy Jack, you might have worked them all up, and nobody been the wiser; I told him I would not do it if he would lay me down 2001.; do you want to hang me; I said, I would go and inform the constable and Mr. Alcorn; and he said again, as I understood him, d-n you, work them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said that? - A. Yes; I then went to the constable, but I went first to speak to two men about it, and he followed me in, and looked very solitary.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you had this shop of Marston? - A. A twelve-month in April; I had a key, and he had a key; he would not let me the place without he could have a thoroughsfare through it; his cart always stood there.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there not a great deal of talk about this robbery, at Hampton? - A. No; I had a little conversation with a sarrier of the name of Franklin about it; and on the Friday morning I saw some gentlemen going to search the farries' shops.</p>
               <p>Q.How early on the Friday did you hear of the robbery? - A.About seven o'clock, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear a great deal of talk about it that day? - A. No; I was at work all that day with my boy; I drank at a public-house on Friday night with some farriers, who told me their shops had been searched.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then a little uneasy, for fear your shop should be searched? - A. No; I had no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy found them in the shop - perhaps you sent him to the shop first in the morning? - A. He always does go first; I found three bars of iron at my own house that were carried home by my boy, which did not belong to me, and that gave me the first suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say he told you to work them up, nobody heard him, I dare say? - A. Yes, my boy heard it.</p>
               <p>Q.What, when he took you on one side to speak to you privately, did he speak loud enough for your boy to hear it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not fear that you might get into some trouble about it yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q.How came your boy to take this iron home? - A.Because I was afraid of being robbed myself; I ordered him to take every thing home.</p>

               <p>Q. He was at no public-house at all? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q.Was he frightened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Since Marston has been committed, have you and he had any conversation about the evidence that you were to give? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. To the best of my recollection I have not; he told me I must come up, and so on.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you mean by so on? - A. He told me I must tell the truth.</p>
               <p>JOHN RUSSELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a constable of Hampton: On Saturday morning, the 7th of February, about half past seven o'clock, Nuttman came into my house, and said, did you not come and search my premises yesterday; I said, why do you ask me such a question; he said, the whole of Alcorn's property is there; upon going with Mr. Nuttman to the shop, I found a bag, containing forty-nine new horse-shoes; we then went to Alcorn's, and Alcorn shewed Nuttman a tool called a pritchell, which Nuttman said belonged to him; I went to Marston's about ten o'clock in the morning, and in his bed-room Thorpe found a picklock key; I was in the room.(Produces the shoes and the tool.)</p>
               <p>Alcorn. I found this tool under the window that was broke open.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you yourself know, that the premises were secured? - A. Yes; I went to bed on the night of Tuesday the 3d of February, about eleven o'clock, the shop windows were barred, I saw them safe; between six and seven o'clock the next morning, we were called up by some people going past; when I came down, I found the window frame<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180029"/>wrenched out from the brick wall, they got in between the brick wall and the window frame, they had attempted at another place, but did not succeed, at the window next the water-side; one part of the house fronts the river Thames, and the other part is in French-street; upon examining the goods, we missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; I found a dark lantern that they had left behind them, in a passage, coming from the upper warehouse to the door; the warehouse and shop are all one, there is a step-ladder goes from the one to the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Shall you be able to speak to the goods, when they are produced? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOHN RUSSELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am constable of Hampton: On Wednesday the 11th of February, Mr. Bushell brought me this bundle, containing eleven shammy leather skins, and in the afternoon I went to search the house of Barnes, at Kensington, Thorpe and Mr. Bushell went with me; we found Mrs. Gillett there, her husband went out upon our going in, and said, he would go and fetch Barnes and Mary Hodges, but I have never seen him since; I found in that room, the articles contained in this bundle, (producing it;) Barnes was brought over to the White-hart, in custody, and upon him was found a pair of breeches, which Mrs. Kern claimed; Mary Hodges was brought in custody also, and upon her person was found this gown and check apron, which were claimed by Mrs. Kern: On Thursday morning, the 12th, I went to Mr. Goddard's, at Sunbury, I told him we were come to enquire what goods he had belonging to Mrs. Kern; he seemed violently agitated, and desired me to go down stairs to his wife, who would inform me, and she informed me, that they were buried in the garden; she directed me to an apple-tree, in their garden, before the house, it was a very frosty morning, and I could easily discover that it had been fresh dug; I dug there and found two pair of stockings, some check, some brown Holland, and some coarse linen, which have been sworn to by Mrs. Kern; I then went to Mr. Luker's, a pawnbroker, at Kingston, and to Mr. Clarke's, who is also a pawnbroker, at Kingston, and from there to Michael Hayman's, in Blackman street, in the Borough, where I found as many goods belonging to Mrs. Kern, as would fill two sacks.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a pawnbroker? - A. He sells a variety of articles, he is a general dealer.</p>
               <p>JOHN THORPE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine.

               <p>Court. Q.Where is Dalton's lodging-house? - A.Very near the church-yard, in the horsefair; Barnes lived in Back-lane; he had on a pair of breeches, and a pair of stockings, which Mrs. Kern claimed; Mary Hodges had on a gown, a check apron, and I think a petticoat, which Mrs. Kern claimed; they did not attempt to deny but what they were the property of Mrs. Kern; Barnes hardly uttered a word; Mr. Russell has had them ever since; I have the dark-lantern, (produces it;) and here is the fill of the window,(producing it;) we have also a tool here that was found at Barnes's, which matches with the marks in the fill.</p>

               <p>Goddard's defence. I am innocent of the charge; my wife was frightened after she heard that my sister was taken up, and she hid them, I did not hide them.(The prisoner Hodges put in a written defence as follows:)</p>
               <p>The defence of Mary Hodges, most humbly addressed to this honourable Court, who am now in your presence, on a charge of buying a gown, a petticoat, apron, and skins: It is represented that I bought them, knowing them to the stolen, which charge I do most solemnly declare is wrong, as when John Gillett spoke to me of buying the things, I had not the least idea of their being stolen; the apparel I bought for my own use, at a price I thought a sufficient value for them; the skins I had no use for, but as I am a tailoress by trade, I told him I thought I could find a purchaser for them, as they would do for linings of breeches; I took them to Mr. Bushell, a master tailor, who bought them of me. My Lord and honoured Gentlemen, permit me to beg of you to consider my unhappy case, with that great judgment, as well as mercy, which is ever known to reign in your breasts, that it is not probable I should have taken these things to any person to tell, with the name of the owner upon the paper round them; being fully assured there was nothing to fear, I innocently went to the first person I thought they would suit, thereby thinking to serve the buyer and the seller, without ever thinking such an affair would end in such fatal consequences as this proves to me; robbed of my liberty, and being now far advanced in my pregnancy, makes my trouble heavier, as I have no friends in London to assist me, or to do any thing for me in my unhappy affair; all my consolation is, that I am to be tried by gentlemen who discard not the poor unfortunate culprits, whose misconduct or misfortunes brings before them, but with mercy and probity searches into facts; that I may be one who may be thought worthy of your attention, is the most ardent prayer of my Lords and Gentlemen, your humble petitioner.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't sell great coats and handkerchiefs? - A. No: On Monday the 26th of January, I had been out the greater part of the day, I came home about five o'clock, took off my great coat, and laid it on the arm of a sofa, by the parlour door in the shop; I had occasion to go out to the back part of the house, and in the mean time the prisoner at the bar, with another man, came into the shop; when I returned I saw them speaking to my wife; upon my coming in my wife cried out that my coat was gone; the prisoner stood between my wife and the great-coat; I then took the prisoner by the collar; he made a strong plunge, disengaged himself from me, and ran away; I went after him, and called stop thief; he went down Pitt-street; I did not see the great-coat upon either of them; it was found in the passage of No. 23, in Pitt-street, just by where the prisoner was stopped; he had run past that door; there was a handkerchief in the coat pocket, and some cards of my address; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GERRARD sworn. - I am a carpenter; I was going along Charlotte-street, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man running across from the corner of Pitt-street, angle corners to Goodge-street; I advanced a few steps towards him, and attempted to catch him; he aimed a blow at me, but I brought him to the ground; he got up again and got from me; he ran, and I pursued him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHINNERY sworn. - I am watch-house keeper: In consequence of information I went to No. 23, Pitt-street, and there I found this coat. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Harris. I am sure this is my coat, here are my cards and my handkerchief in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. While I was in the shop the woman said she had lost a great-coat, and that somebody belonging to me had taken it; I said I was a seafaring man, and not a thief; I was a little groggy, and said I would not be taken by the collar; that gentleman made a blow at me, and I struck him again; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

            : On the 9th of this month, I was going up stairs about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and I saw the prisoner Davis on the stairs, with a stick in his hand; he stood across the stairs, so that I could not go up, and Maynard was stooping down, and doing something to the key-hole of the door; Davis said, here, here, Maynard, and beckoned to his with his hand several times; then Maynard turned round, and began rubbing his hands, and they both seemed very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he see you when he turned about? - A. Yes, he asked me where my husband was; my husband works in Cherry-tree-alley, White-cross-street; then Davis pulled out a piece of cheese, wrapped up in an old silk handkerchief, and asked me if I would buy it; I told him, no; if he wanted any thing with my husband, he was at the shop; Davis asked me if I would give him a crust of bread, and I cut a crust of bread, I know Davis by sight, and Maynard too; then they went down stairs, and I locked my door, and went out; I was going out of an errand; I went to my husband, and told him what I had seen, and he sent me home to take the money out of the drawer, and the watch off the mantle-piece, and put it in ano<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180033"/>ther drawer; then I went out with some bottle-boards, and my husband got home before me; I came back about four, and found the things gone.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Stokes: I found upon Maynard a half-crown, five shillings in silver, and sixpence, at Maynard's lodgings; Richards said he could swear to the half-crown, and two of those shillings; I found them in his fob pocket, on his right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Stokes. I did not search his sob, I did not perceive that he had one.</p>
               <p>SARAH WILKINS sworn. - On Monday, the 9th of February, about half past eleven, the prisoner Maynard came to my mother's, and said his wife was in quod, and said, a guinea and a half would release her; he asked me and my mother if we could tell him where he could get it; I said, it was a good deal of money, I could not tell him where to get it; and he said, he would get it before the afternoon was over, that is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Richards. When I came home, I found the door forced open, and the bolt standing out about an inch and a half, and the bed was tumbled about very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever conceal your money there before? - A. No, my wife came to me about half past eleven, to inform me of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Richards.) Do you know whether the prisoners saw you go out? - A. Yes; when I went out, I saw them under a gateway whispering together.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DUNKLEY sworn. - On the 9th of February. I was going backwards and forwards in the morning about my business, and saw the room-door of Mrs. Richard's apartment; I saw that the bolt was out, and I went and told my husband of it; he sent me to tell Mr. Richards of it, which I did; I saw the bed-clothes had been pulled about, and the glass gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>Richards. I took two seven-shilling pieces, and two half-guineas out of his hand; one of the half-guineas I can swear to.(The money was produced by the officer).</p>
               <p>Richards. This half-crown I took particular notice of, it is marked with aqua-fortis, I had it of my mother; here are two shillings, one of them is George the Second's, and the other a Queen Ann's shilling; there is no mark upon them, but I am almost certain these are the two shillings that I had from my mother, with the half-crown; this half-guinea has a flaw close to the fleur-de-lis; it seems to have been a flaw in making of it, and under the eye of the same half-guinea there was a lump bigger than I ever saw in a half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Maynard's defence. I went up to Richards's upon business, and met with this man, Davis; Mrs. Richards came up, I told her I wanted to see her husband; she told me he was at shop; I went away, and parted with this man at the door, and went immediately to him.</p>
               <p>Davis's defence. On Monday week I met with Maynard; I went up to Mr. Richard's with him; I went in with Maynard, and partook of some bread and cheese; he asked her if her husband would have the cheese; she said, she did not know, but if he did not, her father would; I then came down stairs, and Maynard and I parted; I saw no more of him till I was taken up; they found upon me fourpence halfpenny, between me and my wife and two children.</p>

            , Mrs. Dane's son, came down, and told me there were some suspicious boys about the window; I went up stairs, and took my seat at my work-board, close to the window; I saw three boys at the window; I then observed them divide; one stood at the middle of the window, and the prisoner and another boy at the next window, which is a medicine warehouse; I saw then looking very stedfastly in my face, I looked at them several minutes very hard, and they at me; presently, I heard the spoons jingle in the window; I desired a little boy to pull the sliding-sash back, and he told me the wind came in at the window; I got up, and observed that the window had been cut, and a piece of glass flew to the opposite side of the spoons; I told the boy to call his mother up; I took my hat, and immediately went out of doors; I went about 200 yards down Oxford-street, but did not see any thing of them; upon that I crossed over the way, and presently met the three boys that I had seen at the window; one boy I laid hold of, and the prisoner slipped away; some time in February I was sent for to the Marlborough-street office, I knew the prisoner immediately, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you hear the noise of the glass being cut? - A. No; I heard the glass fall in; the whole glare of the light of the medicine shop, which was transparent, was shining upon their faces, so that I could not be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this was one of the boys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you certain? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boy that you held? - A. He was tried and convicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Upon hearing the jingling of the glass, you did not go out immediately? - A. I desired the boy to pull back the sliding sash, and I went out immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy, upon whom the property was found, was convicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you know the person of the prisoner before that night? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This boy was not at your window at the time you heard the jingling of the glass? - A. No; but he was in company with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him again till a month after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.And then in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have perhaps heard, that there is such a thing as forty pounds reward, if this boy is convicted? - A. I did not know any thing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had a part of the reward for the other boy? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you expect, if this boy is convicted, to have a part of another sorry? - A. I imagine I shall come in for a part of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know, that if you say that which is not true upon your oath, you will be punished not only in this world, but in that which is to come? - A. Yes; I am the son of Mrs. Dane; I was going of an erralid for Mr. Phillips, a paper-hanger, Princes-street, Cavendsh-square, and saw three boys next door to my mother's, and another coming across to them; after I had been back to Mr. Phillips's, I came home; one of the boys had been taken; I went to the watch-house, but I could not swear to him, it was so dark.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. To the best of my knowledge he was one of them, but I cannot swear to him, it was so dark; he was about his heighth, and had a short blue jacket on, and the same countenance, as near as I can tell.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you promise him any favour? - A. No, I did not; I told him he might acknowledge it, or deny it, as he thought sit, for I was convinced I had proof that he had been guilty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make use of the word convinced? - A. I said I was certain he had done it; I asked him if he had received a seven shilling-piece on the Monday; he at first denied that he had; I told him the circumstance of its having been marked; upon which, after some hesitation, he said that he had taken a seven shilling-piece; I asked him what he had done with it; he said he had it up stairs; I said no more to him then, but went for an officer; when he saw me going out, he desired I might be called back, he wanted to speak to me; I came back, and he said he would be glad to speak with me by myself; I then took him into a room by ourselves; he asked me if I would make it up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180038"/>I told him I did not know what he meant by making it up, if he he had any thing to say to me to say it; after some hesitation, he told me that he had taken five pounds of my money, at which I laughed, and walked away; he then desired that I might be called again; I came back, and then he acknowledged that he had taken ten pounds; every time that I returned he wanted to make up the matter; after that, he acknowledged that he had taken twenty pounds; I went away again, and he called me back; he then acknowledged to twenty-five pounds, and expressed the same wish to make it up every time I went away; and when I returned again the next time; he said he had taken sorry pounds; I returned again the last time, and he said he had taken fory-five pounds; when I was going away again; he said he would give this money up to me; I asked him where he had not the money; he said it was at his aunt's; upon which I asked him how I was to get it; he said he would give me a note to his aunt; I immediately went to Worship-street office, and got a search-warrant to search his aunt's house in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he give you directions where to find any money? - A. Yes; particularly forty guineas, his aunt had it in her pocket; I was to ask for it; he said they were most of them new guineas, and were in a shagreen box in her pocket; which we found according to his description.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of those guineas marked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say that they were your's? - A. No; the officer took the aunt to the office; I then went back to my house with the officer, and took him up stairs to search the prisoner's box, where we found the seven shilling-piece that had been marked by Mr. Buxton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Have you repeated every thing that he said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He did not tell you the date at which he took each particular sum? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this poor old woman's house and found forty guineas in her pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman? - A. I believe she is.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not charge you with robbing her of it? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. I think she ought. - Did you not expect, that if this boy was convicted the money you had taken from her would go into your own pocket? - A.That was not the impression upon my mind; I understood it would go to the Sheriff.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: I went with Mr. Gregory to the house of the prisoner's aunt, Mrs. Trumbell, and found sorry guineas in a shagreen case in her pocket, and other money, making in all about sixty-four pounds; I afterwards shewed the prisoner the shagreen box, and asked him if he knew that box; he said, yes, he knew it very well, he said that was the box; I went up stairs into the prisoner's room, at Mr. Gregory's, and the prisoner unlocked his box, and there I found a guinea and seven seven-shilling-pieces; he said the sorry guineas belonged to Mr. Gregory; he begged for mercy, and hoped he would forgive him; he said he had a friend that would make up a hundred pounds, or two hundred pounds, if Mr. Gregory would look it over; Mr. Gregory said he should go before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BUXTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Bishopsgate-street: I marked a half-guinea, and a seven shilling-piece, for Mr. Gregory.</p>

               <p>Gregory. This is the seven shilling-piece that I delivered to Mr. Buxton, and which I saw him mark; it has three marks upon it.</p>

               <p>Buxton. I marked it with a punch; but my eyes are so indifferent I cannot see it. (A pair of spectacles were handed to the witness by one of the Jury).</p>

            , on Monday the 19th of January, to puchase potatoes at Mr. Gregory's, and she brought back five shillings and nine-pence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley Q.Will you venture to swear that it was a good seven shilling-piece? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>HANNAH MORRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Monday the 19th of January, Mr. Buxton sent me to get some potatoes at Mr. Gregory's which I received from the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley Q.He gave you five shillings and nine-pence in change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where did he gave you the change from? - A.Out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gregory). Q.Have you no till in your shop? - A. No; there is an accompting-house, and I left silver on the desk for him to give change with if he wanted it; I left two pound's worth of silver, which he had not touched when I came back; he gave me in all about five or six pounds.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Alley, on the part of the prisoner, took three objections, which were argued on the part of the prosecution by Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>Court. Three objections have been taken, first, That the delivery must be by a third person, and that, therfore, this being by the medium of the master cannot come within this Act of Parliament; I am perfectly satisfied there is nothing in that, if he receives it on account of his master that is sufficient, and all that the Act of Parliament requires; if a master, suspecting his clerk, chuses to send, by another person, even his own money, that is directly within the words of the Act, and therfore there is nothing in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180039"/>The next objection is to the competency of the witness. I am perfectly satisfied that he is a competent witness. Your objection does not go so much to his competency as to his credit; all persons coming here, as witnesses, come with a hope of reward, by the return of their goods, that is always a question for the Jury to decide; and therefore; though Mr. Gregory comes here with the hopes of having his money replaced, yet it cannot affect his competency. But, I think, the last objection, that of the seven shilling-piece, is really a very serious objection, because the Act of Parliament says, any person who shall receive money, goods, bonds, bills, banker's notes, or other valuable security, on account of his master, or shall fraudulently embezzle, or make away with the same, and so on, why then it must be the thing that he makes away with. Mr. Knapp says, suppose a man was indicted for stealing seven shillings, and you only prove a part of it, would not that support the indictment? - Why, yes, because the indictment is for stealing seven shillings in monies numbered; but does Mr. Knapp think, that if a man is indcted for stealing seven shillings, and a seven shilling-piece is produced, that that indictment is good? - Certainly not; if you charge seven shillings in monies numbered, and you prove but one it is sufficient. How is it here? - This man receives a seven shilling-piece; if he had taken the change out of his master's till and given it to the customer, I should have held that that was embezzling seven shillings of his master's property; but here the fact does not warrant that;

             says, he gave her five shillings and nine-pence; then, why might not this indictment have stated, that this man received seven shillings, and embezzled one shilling and three-pence, part of the said seven shillings? - You charge that he embezzled and secreted the sum of seven shillings; no, he has not; he has secreted and embezzled only one shilling and three-pence of it, the rest he paid out of his own pocket. The second count certainly is not proved; I shall state to the Jury the evidence upon the first count, offering such observations upon it as I shall think right to submit to them.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN WOODHOUSE sworn. - On Tuesday night, the 17th of this month, I lost a metal watch, with a gold seal, as I was going in hackney-coach from St. Paul's to my own house, in Park-row, Knightbridge, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I think the number was 192; my watch was found upon the prisoner, in his hat upon his head; he was in the coach with me; when I came to pay the toll at Hyde-park, I missed it; I had taken some punch in the course of the day, which had made me rather intoxicated, having eat no animal food that day; the streets were very slippery; I was staggering in the street, and the prisoner laid hold of me, I believe, in Lombard-street, about nine o'clock; he said, I seemed to be very much in liquor, I told him I was, and if he would see me home, I should be very much obliged to him; he conducted me to a coach in St. Paul's Church-yard, which I got into, and he with me; when I missed my watch at the toll-house, I said, you are a thief, I have got a thief with me; the turnpikeman assisted me, and my watch was found in the crown of his hat, on his head, and my handkerchief under his arm-pit; when he got out of the coach, he got from me, but did not get more than one hundred yards, or perhaps not fifty, before he was taken and brought back, he was then taken to Mount-street watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of your missing the articles contained in the indictment, did you give information? - A. I had strong suspicion of this man, and was advised to proceed, and I went to the officer, Cohan, and gave him information; I did not know exactly where the prisoner lived, but upon enquiry I found where he lodged, and about half after two o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, to the best of my recollection, we went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Farmer-street, Shadwell; I went into the front room, where Mr. Sedarhoon, the proprietor of the house, was, and enquired for this man; he was in a back room, and he was called into. Mr. Sedarhoon's apartment and there I saw the prisoner; I found on him part of the property now produced; I found the shirt upon him, and two neck handkerchiefs, and a pocket handkerchief; I found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180046"/>other articles in the apartment where he lodged; I have attested to all the property except two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - A. He made some defence, but I did not understand exactly what he said; I gave him in charge of the officer; and after the officer went up to the prisoner's apartments I was called up, and there I saw him in possession of two pair of nankeen breeches, which I recognized to be mine; he shewed me them in the presence of the landlord of the house; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.What day was it you discovered the prisoner? - A. On last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to understand any thing that the prisoner said at all? - A.Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that the prisoner had been to church that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that he had those cloaths of a man of the name of Chader, that he might appear decent? - A. I did not understand it from him; the interpreter said something of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted there were other people that lodged in the house besides the prisoner at the bar? - A. That I know nothing of, I only saw one person at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. My question to you is, do you not know there were other lodgers in the same room and same house? - A. I cannot pretend to say; I saw no more than the man who is now in Court and the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked up stairs or not? - A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not tell me where you kept your property, whether your box was broke open or not? - A. The lock of the box has been wrenched where I kept my cloaths; my box was kept on the half deck where I resided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That is a situation which is exposed to the sailors on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COHAN sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to the Institution of the Thames Police: I was applied to by the prosecutor, John Marsh, to apprehend the prisoner at the bar; I apprehended him on the Sunday at Mr. Sedarhoon's, No. 47, Farmer-street, Shadwell; the prisoner had on his person three waistcoats, two neck handkerchiefs, a pair of breeches, and a shirt; all these things Mr. Marsh claimed as his own; they are all marked.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his claiming them, did you take them into your possession? - A. I kept them that night, and then I put them into the charge of my waterman, and he has had them ever since; I was then shewn up stairs into the prisoner's lodging-room; the prisoner was left in the charge of my waterman; I found two pair of nankeen breeches in a closet; Mr. Marsh was called up stairs, and he claimed them as his property; I put them into the same bundle; I took the prisoner into custody, and he was committed the next day.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.When you went up stairs the prisoner was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had three waistcoats upon hiem? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This was last Sunday, it was a hard frost I believe? - A. It was cold weather.</p>
               <p>ANDREW SEDARHOON sworn. - I live at No. 47, Farmer-street, Shadwell; I know the prisoner at the bar; he lodged with me on Sunday last; he occupied a one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the officer up stairs to his room on the day he came? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing found in the room he occupied? - A.Only these two pair of nankeen breeches, and the prosecutor claimed them as his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else lodge in that room? - A. Yes, there were three more; they were sailors: when the prisoner went out on the Friday night he had his own cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return the same night? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return with the same cloaths on? - A. No; he had the prosecutor's cloaths on; I believe he returned about eight or nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. The Friday night was the first time you had seen the prosecutor's cloaths? - A. Yes, the first time I had seen the prisoner wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the Friday before the Sunday that the officer came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about those cloaths? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner? - A.When he came home I asked him where he got all those fine cloaths from; he told me that a shipmate had bought them at Portsmouth, and he had got them from that shipmate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you understand that he had bought them of a shipmate? - A. No; I cannot tell whether he said, lent them or bought them; but after that he said a shipmate had lent them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.How many men lodged in your house? - A. Six at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man of the name of Chader? - A. Yes; that was the same man that he said he had borrowed the cloaths of.</p>
               <p>Q.Since this man has been taken into custody have you made any enquiry after Chader? - A. I have; but I have not been able to discover him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When he said he got those cloaths of a shipmate at Portsmouth, did you understand him to mean Chader? - A. Yes, the same man.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Where was the apartment? - A. On the lower floor; Mr. Shehan persuaded them to leave off, and he put a stick between them; they were quarrelling and pulling one another about, such as scratching one another, but not any blows; Mr. Shehan went off to his watch, it might be a little past ten, and he wished me good night, and I wished him the same; I thought my woman was gone up stairs before me, but when I got up to my room I found she was not there.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know where she was? - A. No; in a few minutes time she came in, with her face a little scratched about her nose; I said, you have got a scratched face by quarrelling with Mrs. Shehan; I said, you had better been in my room and you would not have got a scratched face; she made light of it, and went and wiped her face with a cloth; directly the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180048"/>rushed into the room and caught hold of her with her left hand by the side of the head, and made two blows at her with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the blows given? - A.Under the jaw, on the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether she had got any thing in her hand at the time? - A. I did not apprehend that she had any thing at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did neither of them say any thing? - A.There was no words spoke berwixt them; on seeing her struck, I was sitting on the bed, I jumped off the bed to part them; I made three steps towards them, and I saw the blood run in such a violent stream I had not power to go any further; as soon as I recovered myself I called out for assistance from the persons down stairs, and Mrs. Landrecy came up immediately with a child in her arms and looked in, and she run back immediately; Mrs. Shehan held the deceased up with her left hand against the side of her cheek as long as she could, and then she fell, first falling against a small table, and then upon the floor; after which Mrs. Shehan slipped away down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon afterwards did you see Mrs. Shehan? - A.Not till I saw her at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - A.People stocked in as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a knife being found there? - A. The patrol found a knife there, which he has in his keep; it is the knife which my woman used to have in her pocket for her own use; when I came into the room first the knife was lying upon the table open, with another case knife and fork; I did not see it used; it was found upon the floor; she searce lived a moment after she was down; she could not speak; she made a rattling in her throat and attempted to speak to me, but I could not understand her at all; I was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You were taken by the officer upon this charge? - A. Yes; by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. The knife was the deceased's knife? - A. It was; I had seen it upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not know, of your own knowledge, who took the knife off the table? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.There had been words between the prisoner and the deceased below stairs, before, when you parted them? - A.There had.</p>
               <p>Q. And when they came up stairs they had words? - A. No words till the prisoner came up.</p>
               <p>Q. But who took the knife off the table you don't know? - A. I did not see it taken off by any body.</p>
               <p>Q.When the blood spouted out, then it was that the prisoner was giving all the assistance to the deceased by holding her up as long as she could? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were these two women sober? - A. I really believe they were neither of them right sober.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you quite sober yourself? - A. I had had some been, but not incapable of doing my business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.You were not quite sober yourself? - A. I had had a few pints of beer, but not quite seized over; I had not land above three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you all us, as nearly as you can recollect, what space of time might elapse from their being parted below and their coming up to the room where you were? - A. I don't think it was much less or over than a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether any thing passed between the two women by way of making it up below stairs? - A.Nothing was said in the least.</p>
               <p>Q.You went out immediately? - A. Yes.</p>

            ; he is a watchman in our parish; we live in Mrs. Shehan's house, the two pair of stairs, the room under the deceased's room; Mr. Shehan and the prisoner lived in the lower part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the first part of the quarrel between the two women? - A.They had words below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the quarrel at night in Shehan, the prisoner's room? - A. Yes; it was between ten and eleven o'clock; I went up to my supper, and then Mrs. Griffith's came into our room and had a drop of beer out of our pot; she stopped some time with me, and then went up to her own room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did she go up immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did you hear Griffiths go up first? - A. He was up in the room first.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it whilst she was with you? - A. I cannot say that; she was no sooner in the room than Griffiths and his wife went to quarrelling; they had very high words together; I could not hear what it was about; then Mrs. Shehan came into our room, as I suppose to see whether the noise was there; then she went up stairs to give them warning, as she said she would not have her lodgers disturbed; she was not above four or five minutes up stairs before we heard the alarm of murder cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who cried murder? - A. I think it was Mr. Griffiths; I went up stairs, and I saw Mr. Griffiths standing in the room with a bundle; he was standing as if he was coming out of the room; I saw Mrs. Shehan laying hold of the woman in this way,(putting her hand up to her neck), and trying to stop the blood; I tumbled down stairs; I was incapable of giving any assistance; the two women were quite drunk; they were at it all the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you said the two women were quite drunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Griffiths was not quite sober? - A. I don't think he was; they used to have such a row generally when they were drunk, which happened very often.</p>
               <p>Q. The noise which induced Mrs. Shehan to go up was pretty considerable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it that Mrs. Shehan came into your room, and afterwards went up stairs? - A.She did not stay long in our room; it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night; Mrs. Shehan was nearly stripped and going to bed when she heard the noise; she had only her stockings and her flannel petticoat on.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to you that Mrs. Shehan went up to quell the noise and to prevent the lodgers being any further disturbed? - A. I think it was; I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went up into the room the situation of the parties were in this way, Mr. Griffiths as if going out with a bundle at the time the prisoner was holding up the other woman and giving her assistance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the act of going out with a bundle at the time the wife was supported by the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180049"/>Q.Then it was Griffiths that was attempting to go, but not the prisoner, who was giving all the assistance to the poor unfortunate woman that she could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear Mrs. Griffiths go up stairs into her room? - A. Yes, I did; she was in my room before she went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect about how much time had elapsed between her going up stairs, and the prisoner's going up? - A. Not very long; I cannot exactly tell; about five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>Q.By the place, did you think the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about her? - A.Nothing particularly, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she touch you at all? - A. Yes, I stopped her, and the could not be off touching me; I remarked nothing more but that she was very tipsy, and so was Griffiths; I saw Griffiths going away, and he fell into the passage, and could not get up again, he was so drunk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He was so drunk, he could not stand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I think you said, the prisoner was also drunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Griffiths was so drunk, he could not stand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. YOUNG sworn. - I am a surgeon: I was called in to examine the body of this woman; I saw the wound.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to say, that that was the cause of her death? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where was the wound? - A. On the left side of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose it was from the loss of blood that she died? - A. Yes, I think it was from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you examine the wound? - A. I looked at it, but I did not examine what depth it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively say that the death was occasioned by the blow? - A. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the two wounds in the throat? - A. I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound in her neck was the cause of her death? - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you first of all to believe about it, and next, that you did not examine the wound, and last of all, that you have no doubt about it; - how long have you been a surgeon, young gentleman? - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>JOHN MILLER sworn. - I am an officer; I made all search in my power after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the crime was committed, that you heard or traced any thing of her? - A. It was upon the 18th of December last, I found her at Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means? - A. By a letter sent to her husband; I went to Bristol, and there I found her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I have a great number of witnesses to prove the same fact, as to the way in which those persons lived, and therefore I will not trouble the Court. <rs id="t18010218-80-verdict438" type="verdictDescription">

            with a w at top, and a figure No. 10 underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it on board the Commerce? - A. I had it in my possession from the 31st of December till the 9th of January, and then I shipped it on board the Commerce lighter; I have no doubt but it is the same rope; I saw it at the Police-office; it had the same mark at one time as the other, but the mark was rather defaced, No. 10 was rubbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.How many coils<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180050"/>of rope did you receive on account of Messrs. Hibbert and Company? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it ten, twenty, thirty, or forty? - A. I cannot tell; sometimes one hundred, and sometimes one hundred and twenty; I cannot tell within thirty or forty.</p>

               <p>Q.This coil of rope being left in the rackle-house, did you put it into the Commerce alone? - A. No; with other coils of rope, upon the 19th of January.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Messrs. Ogle and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any rope put on board the Commerce lighter? - A. I did, but I do not recollect the mark; I was to take the Commerce down the River to the West Indian.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Batt go with you? - A. Yes; we went down from Wiggin's-quay, to Deptford; after we had delivered some goods on board the Ann, we delivered the remainder on board the West Indian.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver all that was delivered to you, on board the West Indian? - A. Yes, every thing, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the Commerce afterwards? - A. I brought her up to the ship called the Portland, at Wapping, and made her fast to the Portland, and came a-shore about nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Where did the Portland lay at this time? - A. At Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Saturday night? - A. Yes; I did not go on board the lighter for several days afterwards; the night was dark when I quitted her.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined at the Magistrate's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at the Magistrate's, you could not ascertain whether you delivered all the goods on board the West Indian? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Were any small packages on board your vessel? - A. Yes; there were some under the locker, and I felt about that I might not leave any behind.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOTTIN sworn. I am a surveyor to the Thames Police Institution: At one o'clock in the morning of the 19th of January, I went on board a lighter loaded with sugar, lying along-side the Enterprize West Indiaman, I don't know who the lighter belonged to, she was in the employ of Mr. Briant; on looking under the stern sheets, I observed a coil of cordage matted and packed; from that situation, I considered it as being illegally obtained; I put a man on board the Enterprize, to see who came and fetched this lighter away: in the morning, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner,

            , came on board the lighter to take her away; I stepped into the lighter, and requested he would let me look down the sore peak, which was locked; he said he could not, for he had not the keys; I asked him if he knew of any thing down aft; he said, yes, there was a coil of cordage, or some cordage; I asked him how he came by it; he told me he took it out of a lighter belonging to Mr. Ogle; I asked him how he came to do so, what reason he had for taking it out of Mr. Ogle's lighter; he said, because it was in his craft; I asked him if he had any directions with respect to that particular coil of cordage, or whether he had a general direction, if he should meet with such a coil of cordage in such a situation; he said he intended to take it to Mr. Ogle, but that he had no directions at all; this proving not satisfactory, I took him and the cordage to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other prisoner? - A. I did not; I looked at the mark, and I saw it marked R. S. B. with a w at top, and No. 10 at the bottom; I could not discover the mark at first, it being dark; it had been rolled in the dirt, and by some means had been defaced.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the custody of the rope? - A. I have had it ever since, till this morning I delivered it to the officer of the Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. As soon as the prisoner, Davidson, came on board, you asked him what he had got aft? - A. Yes, and he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him who was with him? - A. He said, Ferguson was the person who was with him, and helped him to take the coil of rope out of the lighter.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIANT sworn. - Q. Were the two prisoners in your service upon the 13th of January? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. In what lighter? - A. I do not pretend to do any business at the water-side; my watermen do all the business.</p>
               <p>JOHN GILMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police-office; I apprehended Ferguson in consequence of a warrant from the office: nothing particularly passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was upon the information that was given by the other man, that the warrant was granted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find him? - A. On board the Enterprize.</p>
               <p>- BROKER sworn. - I am foreman to Messrs. Ogle; I delivered the goods on board the Ann, but afterwards she went to deliver her goods on board the West Indian, and then I left Cole unloading her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at the time you left her, whether the coil of rope was or was not in the lighter? - A. I cannot answer that; there was one in her; whether there were any more, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Davidson in his service likewise? - A. Yes; on the 13th I was at work in the lug-boat: on Sunday, the 11th, I went down about half past eleven o'clock on board the Friendship lighter.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, on that day, see any lighter belonging to Mr. Ogle? - A. Yes, the Commerce; she was laying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180051"/>a-stern of the ship called the Portland; we went on board that lighter, as we had occasion to hand the hurdles over that lighter to put them in our own, and there we found a coil of rope.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Davidson do any thing with that rope? - A. Yes, we took it out of the lighter for safety.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you put it? - A. We put it down out stern sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to alter the mark that was upon that rope in any one respect? - A.Not at all; as we took it we left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in pulling off the mark? - A.We could have pulled it off with our hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mark upon? - A. Upon a mat; we took it only with a view of bringing it to Mr. Ogle, when the lighter came up;  Davidson told me that he should bring the lighter up on the Thursday morning, and then he would take it himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You and Davidson were employed by Mr. Ogle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received no direction from Messrs. Ogle to take care of their property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What day of the month was this? - A. It was upon the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the rope in your possession all Sunday, Monday night, and Tuesday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where Messrs. Ogle lived? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you take the pains to find out Messrs. Ogle? - A. No, I had other business to do; it was done with no other intent but honesty.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you had all day on Monday and Tuesday, and yet you told niether Messrs. Ogle, or made any enquiry about them - Upon your oath, did you mention it either to Mr. Ogle or his servants, or any one member living, besides the prisoner at the bar, that you had found it? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Upon your oath, the reason why you did not take any means to tell Mr. Ogle, was, because Davidson said he would go himself and give it Mr. Ogle? - A. He said, I know Mr. Ogle, I know him to be an honest man, I will give it to Mr. Ogle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know where Mr. Ogle lives? - A. I do not, more than a child unborn.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lighterman and waterman; the prisoners were taken into custody on the 13th of January, on a Tuesday; on the Sunday morning I saw this coil of rope in a lighter called the Commerce; it laid in the middle of the lighter for every body to see; I saw it was a light rope.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Did you take particular notice of this coil of rope? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen it now? - A. I saw it rolled into Court; there is the mark I made with my knife at the time, to see whether it was a coil of rope; the man that was along with me thought it was a mat of brimstone.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never discovered any other mark, except that you put upon it yourself? - A.None at all.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you known Davidson? - A. I have known him since I was first apprentice.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When did you first hear that either of those prisoners were taken up? - A. Not till a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what they were taken up for? - A. I heard that they were taken up for a coil of rope, it was at a public-house; it was mentioned to one Walker; I told 
               <persName id="t18010218-81-person541">Walker</persName>
             that I had been such a coil of rope, and Walker said, I will give your name, and Robert Barrowby's name; I had seen Walker every day for a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account was it that you mentioned to 
               <persName id="t18010218-81-person542">Walker</persName>
             that you had seen such a coil of rope? - A. I told him the night before he gave me the subpoena; I did not know the men were taken to the Compter, nor nothing else.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BARROWBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a waterman, I know Tunk; I knew Davidson before he was taken up, which was upon Tuesday, January 13.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been on the River the Sunday before that? - A. Yes, I was on board a sloop called the Jacob, which was bound for Dieppe, in France; we had occasion to go on board a lighter to make a rope fast, it was the Commerce, Tunk was with me; I saw something laying at the bottom; he stepped down into the lighter, and saw it was a coil of rope, (the coil of rope produced); it is as near like that I saw in the lighter as any one I can see; I did not take notice of any mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.This coil of rope, when you saw it, was lying in the bottom of the Commerce? - A. Yes; I knew who the coil of rope belonged to, though Mr. Ogle's name was not upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying it was Mr. Ogle's? - A. Mr. Ogle's name was upon the craft, and I supposed the coil of rope belonged to Mr. Ogle; I could not tell whom it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you took pains to enquire? - A.Not in the least, I heard no more about it.</p>

On the Monday morning following he came to my house again; I had given directions for Newman and Kinchin, two officers, to be in the house every morning till he came again; the prisoner then offered me another bad shilling, and I gave them charge of him; he threw something in the fire; I first took out a seven-shilling piece with the fire tongs, and then three shillings and a six-pence; I gave them to Newman; they appeared to me to be bad ones; I also gave him the shilling which I had put into the glass wrapped up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not received a guinea from my wife, and was I not to spend three guineas more in your house? - A. There came some people to my house and left a guinea, and they agreed, if I would make it up, to spend three guineas more; they have been tempting me with money all this week.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have taken one guinea then? - A. Yes, it was left at my house, and I forgot it, or else I meant to have brought it with me into Court.</p>

            . The goods were proved to have been sent by the Boston coach to Spalding, and stolen at Ponder's-end out the boot. The first and third counts of the indictment were abandoned; but the Jury found you guilty on the second. A doubt arose whether the goods, which were laid to be the property of Thomas Dancer 
               <persName id="o18010218-1-person566">Markham</persName>
            , who was not the owner of the goods, but the driver of the coach, were properly said. The Judges directed this point to be argued before them. Mr. Knapp was assigned as your Connsel, and he argued the question for you with great ability; nothing that could be urged in your favour was wanting. All the Judges have deliberated, and a very great majority are of opinion, that the property was well laid to be in the driver. The only doubt that arose was, on a ground of distinction between a person having the possession and having only the bare charge of them; but, on consideration, this is materially distinguishable from that class of cases, because here the coachman must be legally considered as not only having the charge, but the possesion also. It is very true, that, not being master of a coach, but coachman, he must be considered as having the charge of goods only, and not the possesion, which would remain in the master, and as against all the rest of the world be must be considered as having such a special property in him as will support the court charging them as his goods; he has the possession and controul over them, they are entrusted to his disposition during the journey, and it would be extremely inconvenient if it was not so; there would be endless mistakes and difficulties in hunting after all the proprietors of a flage coach; so that though a coaching on a indictment against him upon the prosecution of the matter, would be taken to have the charge of the goods in question, against any body else, he would be held to have the possession of them. They are of opinion, therefore, there is no doubt on the second count as to the conviction, and of course, that you are properly convicted.</p>

            , Esq. The evidence of your having actually forged, as well as having uttered it, knowing it to be forged, and having recieved the money, 14l. 12s. 6d. under the said order, was most clearly and satisfactorily proved, the Jury found you guilty, and sentence was passed on you; but it was suggested by the Counsel, that this was not an order for the payment of money on a bill of exchange within the statue of the 7th 
               <persName id="o18010218-1-person574">Geo. II</persName>
            . and it was also objected, that this instrument did not come within the meaning of the 32d 
               <persName id="o18010218-1-person575">Geo. III</persName>
            . which exacts, "That no letter of attorney, or order, made or executed by any petty officer, seaman, non commissioned officer of marines, or marine, who shall have been discharged from the service of his Majesty, his heirs, and successors, and who shall be at or within the distance of seven miles from any of the ports where seamens's wages are paid for such service, at the time of making such letter of attorney, shall be good and valid, and sufficient for receiving the whole or any part of the wages, prize-money, or other allowances of money, due, or to grow due to such petty officer, seaman, non-commistioned officer of marines, or marine, for such service, unless such letter of attorney, or such order shall be signed before, and witnessed by a clerk of the traesurer of the Navy at such port, or by the inspector of seamen's wills and powers of attorney, any thing the aforesaid act to the contrary the notwithstanding"</p>

               <p>In order to give due consideration these objections, seven of the twelve Judges have met and berated upon them, and I am now authorised to declare it as their opinion, on the first point, that the order stated in the indictment proved at the trial, was, in law, in language of the indicment an order to obtain money, and as such, a forgery might be commited on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180054"/>it. With regard to the second point, whether on the second count in the indictment the facts proved, amount in law to the crime of forgery, they are equally of opinion that they do. It is unnecessary for me to say, that the order itself purports to be made by 
               <persName id="o18010218-1-person576">
                  John

            , of Petersfield, which is beyond the distance of seven miles, and within which distance, unless such order is signed before and attested by the proper persons mentioned in the act, it is not good, valid, and sufficient; this attestation the legislature thought necessary for the security of those who are entrusted with the payment of money, and who cannot be expected to know the fact themselves, but who must rely on the sidelity of the attestation, and upon its being fairly obtained; this order purports to have been made by the party claiming the money at Petersfield, which is beyond the distance within which the attestation is required, when in truth and fact it was not at Petersfield, but was an untrue representation, and the money was obtained under such false suggestion, it appearing on the face of the evidence to be false. The Judges are therefore clearly of opinion, that this is such a false making of an order for payment of money as amounts to the crime of forgery; and the Jury having been satisfied with the facts proved in support of such indictment, the unanimous opinion of the Judges is, that no objection arises to the indictment on either of the grounds stated, and that your conviction is therefore good in point of form.</p>
