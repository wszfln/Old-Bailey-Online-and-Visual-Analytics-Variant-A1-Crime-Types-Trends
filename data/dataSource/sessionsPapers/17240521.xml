That soon after she came and said she said had a Dream, and it had put her into a great Hurry and Confusion; she having dreamt that she was muddling among Dirt and a great deal of Plate, among which was a Coffee-Pot, and several Things, such as the Prosecutor had lost; pretending to be very glad that she was likely, by the Providence of God, to be Instrumental in helping the Prosecutor to his Goods again, and wanted him to go and search in the Cellar; that he not giving much heed to it, till she pretended the Dream was repeated, and was very urgent, at last he did go, and in her Cellar, in a certain Corner, he found the Prosecutor's Plate, and the Coffee-Pot uppermost, and it was in a Basket that was the Prisoner Johanna Grundy's. And it did appear that it had been hidden in the Ground in the Cellar, and the Ground had been digged up.
