I had seen the other Prisoner Strafford once in his Company at my House, and therefore suspected that she might be concerned with him; at last I thought if I could meet with her I might by that means hear of him: So next Morning, understanding that some Lawyet in an Alley in Chancery-Lane was acquainted with her, I went to a Chandler's Shop there, and made Enquiry; but all I could learn was, That she sometimes drank a Dram there: I advertised my Goods, and next Day Word was sent me that she was taken with most of the Plate upon her.</p>

             at the Horse shoe and Chequer on Snow-Hill, the Prisoner, Strafford, came in with a Parcel of Plate bundled up in a Napkin in her Lap; she open'd it, and desired Mrs. Slater to let her have some Money upon it. I privately advised 'em to send for 2 Constable and Charge her, because I thought she did not come honestly by it; but they would not, and so she went away with it. Mr. Bains, and the Prosecutor's Landlord, told me next Day that such Plate was Advertised. Upon which we went to enquire for her at a Silk-Dyers in Spittle-Fields, Mr. Barns having heard that she had lived there; but when we came thither, we were told that she had been gone from thence above 4 Months We went away thro' some Back-Alleys into Shoreditch, where we accidentally met her with a Piece of Linnen under her Arm. I stopp'd her, and said, Madam, I am glad to see ye! She asked what Business we had with her. We told her she should soon be satisfy'd, and so we took her to the Swan Tavern in Shoreditch; Mr. Earns and the other Man went for a Constable, and charged him with her on Suspicion of being concerned in stealing the Plate. She directed us to Pet. Hughs's Lodging, which was at the Crooked-Billet, hard-by. The Constable went and fetched him, and as soon as she saw him she curs'd and damn'd him for a Son-of-a-Bitch for bringing her into such a Premunire. Peter took 4 or 5 Tea-Spoons out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040005"/> of his Pocket, and gave them to the Constable. We went again to Peter's Lodging to see what we could find. Strafford pulled out the Drawer of a Trunk, from whence she took this Silver Tankard, 2 Porringers and a Punch-Ladle, and deliver'd them to the Constable: Then we all took Coach to the Prosecutor's House, where Peter owned that he had taken that Plate out of his Master's House.</p>

I, and two more, went thither; where we were told, she had been gone a pretty while from that Place; but in going back, we met with her by Chance in Shoreditch, and carry'd her to a Tavern, where we examin'd her about the Plate. She said she had it out of the Country, and defy'd the World to touch her Honour. Look ye, says I, It signifies nothing to deny it, for that very Plate which you offered to pawn to Mrs. Slater is advertised - It is By-God? Says she, Then that Rogue Hughs has brought me into a fine Scrape.

He came to me next Day and brought a Silver Spoon which he desir'd me to sell for him; telling me, that Newnham having given him leave to take a Shirt out of the Box, he found Means to take the Spoon unperceived. So we sold the Spoon for 11s. and hearing that the Prosecutor wanted a Servant, he went to him and was hired, and I went thither afterwards to give him a Character, because I knew his Friends in the Country. And when he came away from his Place, he brought this Plate to me wrapt up in his Shirt, and desired me to sell it for him, and buy him some Linnen, and other Necessaties; I lodged then at Mr. Brets in Shoreditch; but before I came there, I lived with Mr. Miller, a Silk Dyer, in Slaughter-street, in Spittle-fields.</p>

               <p>Mr. Liger. On Sunday the 13th of October I miss'd some Buckles out of my Shew-Glass; I thought my Man might have lent 'em: But next Morning my Man told me some Buckles were gone he could not tell how. On the 31st of October Mr. White, the Prisoner's Master came over to me and asked me if I had miss'd any Thing. I said, Yes. Then he shew'd me some Buckles, and asked me if I knew them. I answer'd Yes, very well, these are mine. He told me that he had been robb'd too, and was afraid there was Confederacy between his Servant and mine. Upon this I examined the Prisoner, who confessed that between 11 and 12 at Night, when I was in Bed, he came to my Shop and desired my Man, who is near-sighted, to shew him some Buckles; upon which my Man opening the Shew-Glass, he (the Prisoner) at twice took out several Buckles, and put them into his Pocket.</p>

He said he met a Man in the Street who gave him a Guinea. I thought this was a villainous Story, and what encreased my Suspicion of him was, that a Man at a Brewers told me the Prisoner had presented their Maid with a Diamond Ring worth 20 Guineas. - The Prisoner was carry'd before Mr. Justice Deveil, where he confess'd that he took the Goods out of the Prosecutor's Shew-Glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't deny that I had the Goods, but they were given me by the Prosecutor's Wife. My first Acquaintance with her was when he and my Master went out of Town together. Her Apprentice being gone out, she desired me to shut up her Shop for her, which I did. And then she said, Ned, what do you want? I said, A Buckle for my Hat, and one for my Stock She bid me take 'em. I asked her what they came to, she said she would not take any Thing of me. After this, I was at her House Thirteen Nights in Fourteen, while they were in Gloucestershire.</p>

The Prisoner standing next me on my right Side, I collar'd him before he had got his Hand quite from under my Coat, and said, Sirrah, you have got my Watch, but in struggling he twisted himself about, and as I suppose, conveyed my Watch away to some of his Companions. However, some others assisting me we at last got him into a Tavern, where he was searched. My Watch indeed was not found upon him, but the Constable took from him a Handkerchief which was own'd by Mr. Gain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came you to expect me?</p>
               <p>Mr. Salisbury. Expect ye? I suspected ye, because I found your Hand under my Coat at the same time that I felt my Watch drawn out of my Fob.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was at the Tavern the Gentleman said, they did not expect me to be such a Man; and the Prosecutor himself said, If I would send for any Body to my Character, he would not only discharge me, but down on his Knees and beg my pardon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Salisbury. I said no such thing.</p>

               <p>Dean. I have heard that he sometimes works upon the Keys as a spare Man.</p>
               <p> Second Indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gain. I was going by when Mr. Salisbury feiz'd the Prisoner, who made a violent Resistance, and cry'd out Murder. I assisted to thrust him into a Coach, and at last we got him into a Tavern, where the Constable searched him for Mr. Salisbury's Watch, but could not find it. At the same time I happened to have Occasion for my Handkerchief, but feeling for it, I 'mist it. The Constable found a Handkerchief upon him. I said, before I saw it, if it is mine it is stained and snuffy; upon which it was produced, and I knew it to be my own - Here it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Salisbury. I saw the Constable take this Handkerchief out of the Prisoner's Pocket, and Mr. Gain sent to his Mother for two or three more of the same sort, and they matcht exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were not the same Size by above an Inch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gain. Here is one of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Then the two Handkerchiefs were compared, and agreed in every particular.</p>
               <p>Mr.Hickman, Constable. Just as I had searched the Prisoner for the Watch, Mr. Gain said, he had lost his Handkerchief, which was stain'd with Snuff. Upon which, I searched the Prisoner again, and found it. Mr. Gain sent for three more which were of the same Size and Colour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gain. The Prisoner at first said, he had had the Handkerchief a Week, and then he said he found it that Night under the Piazza's - I had used it but two Minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040008"/> before he was taken - When I went to him in the Gate-house, he said, I hope you'll bring in a Bill of Ignoramus, and if you do, I'll give you half a Guinea.</p>

I staid there till 7, and then came back with a Piece of Cotton Check which one of my Men had made for me. In the middle Field, where there is a Ditch on one side, and Soil on the other. I was attack'd by two young Fellows with Pistols, they damn'd me, and bid me stand, or I was a dead Man. Then one of them collar'd me, struck me over the Face with a Pistol, and swore again, D - ye, stand still ye Dog, or I'll shoot ye. The other searched my Pockets, and finding but nine Pence, he put it in again, and said, D - him, he has got nothing but Half-pence. Then they took my Piece of Check, and so they left me. It was a Moon-light Night, and I had a full view of their Faces; I verily believe that Casey is the Man who collar'd me; and that he who search'd my Pockets was this Man here, Macdonald. I went back to my Men at King David's Fort, and told 'em how I had been robb'd I likewise went to the Constable at the King's Arms in Sun-Tavern Fields, who told me that he should be out upon Duty that Night, and would look after such Fellows as I had describ'd, and then I went home the Street way - Next Morning I went over the same Fields, and called at the Prince of Orange's Head, which joins to the Field were I was rob'd, and left a Description there of the Men who had rob'd me. In about a Fortnight afterwards, some who were acquainted with my Workmen, calling at the Prince of Orange's Head, heard that the Men who rob'd me were apprehended, and that one of them who had made an Information, was in the New-Goal in Southwark. I went thither, and found Macdonald. He asked me if I knew him. I said, yes, I am pretty sure you are one of the Men that rob'd me. He said, it was true enough; for it was he that took the nine Pence, and a Key out of my Pocket, and put them in again; and that he had made his Information before Sir

Sutton enquired for Macdonald, and said, he heard he was in some Jail, but he did not know in what Jail. I told them, I believed Mr. Atkins could inform them; I gave Atkins a hint that I fancied these were the Men who were in Macdonald's Information. So we kept them drinking till we got sufficient Assistance, and then we apprehended them all Five. D - my Eyes, says Jack Sutton, here's almost two Load of us.</p>

            . I have known the two Prisoners about half a Year. On the King's Birth-day, which was the Day after my Lord Mayor's Day, we all went to the House of Mrs. Dick's in the Back Lane in White-Chappel, going towards Stepney Fields; there we staid drinking till past seven at Night, and then to Tom-Turd-Man's Hole in White-Chappel Fields, where we saw the Prosecutor coming along; upon which I said to Beesly, act out of the Path, and watch who comes t'other way, for here is but one Man, and we can deal with him; so Beesly went behind a Bank, about half a Stone's throw off; and then Casey collar'd the Gentleman, and beat him about the Head with a Pistol; and then I searched his Pockets, and took out a Six Pence, and Three Pennyworth of Half-Pence; which being but a Trifle, I bid him take it again. Then I took up the Piece of Check, and ran with it to Beesly, and gave it him to take care of. Casey and I followed the Prosecutor at a little Distance, as far as Mr. Emery's Garden; then we returned, and meeting Beesly, we all went to Aldgate, where we took Coach, and went to an Ale-house in St. Giles's, which was then kept by one Leadbeater; but he is now run away. There we measured the Check, and found there was 31 Yards; we carried it to Casey's Sister in Covent-Garden, and gave it her to pawn for us; and I likewise gave her a Handkerchief of my own. She brought us 17 s. for the Check, and 2 s. for the Handkerchief. We spent all the Money before we parted, in Victuals, Beer, and Gin; except half a Crown which I paid for a Wig - We lived together three or four Days in a Cellar.</p>

            . I was Nurse to Mrs. Dicks, who lives in the Back Lane against the Blue-Anchor. About Six o'Clock at Night - I don't remember the Day of the Month; but it was some remarkable Day, for there was a Bonfire before the King's Purveyor's Door - It might be five or six Weeks ago - Macdonald, and he in the Red Coat [pointing to Casey] and I believe the other Prisoner, but I can't be so positive to him, came Mrs. Dicks and went into a back Room, and shut the Door. I think they had half a Pint of Gin, and staid about half an Hour, and then they went away together towards the Fields.

            . The 2 Prisoners came into our Shop and asked to see some printed Linnen. I shewed 'em several Pieces, and they were extreme difficult, which made me suspect 'em. I saw Eleanor take hold of one Piece, and draw it gently till it fell off the Counter; upon which I turn'd about to the Shelves on purpose to give her an Opportunity of taking it up. But however I perceived her to stoop down close to the other Prisoner. I turn'd again to the Counter, she bid me 11 d. for half a Yard. I told her I could not take it, and so they both went just without the Door, when I pull'd 'em back, and Eleanor drop'd this Piece of printed Linnen from under her Petticoats.</p>

Last Monday I went with Mr. Greathead to see the Prisoner in the Compter - The Prisoner had made an Information and Confession before Alderman Brocas of a great many Robberies that he had been concerned in with several others; and I think two of them were taken; upon which the Prosecutor said to him, Were those two concerned with you in taking my Watch, The Prisoner answered, Yes. Are you sure of it? says the Prosecutor. Yes; reply'd the Prisoner. And adds the Prosecutor. Do you know where the Watch is? No, says t'other, for I was taken up immediately, and they pawn'd it, and sent me part of the Money.</p>
               <p>Then the Prisoner's Confession was proved, and read in Court.</p>
               <p>He therein says, that he, and others stole a Silver Watch in Leaden-hall-street - a Tuck Sword - a Silver Watch in Queen-street - another Sword - a Gold Watch - a Silver-hilted Sword in Long-Acre - a Silver Watch behind the Exchange - another near Drury Lane - a Gold Watch - a Silver Watch in Fleet-Street - other Watches - and lastly, that on the 21st of October, about 6 at Night, that he, and four more on Snow-Hill, picked the Pocket of Mr. Greathead of a Silver Watch.</p>

So I went to the Tavern where I found the Prosecutor, and very drunk he was, and would needs go home with me to my Lodging. So after we had drunk together, a Coach was called, we drove to Catherine-street where we stopt, and then drove to Mrs. M - We went up Stairs, and here I and Mrs. M - drank 3 three Shilling Bowls of Punch and a Bottle of Wine: After which, he made me a present of half a Guinea, and eight Shillings in Silver, and offered me half a Guinea more to lie with him; but I told him I was not very well; and so he gave Mrs. M - the half Guinea to pay my Surgeon; and promised me that when I was cured, he would buy me a new Gown, and keep me. And as for the Snuff-Box he made me a Present of it, and bid me keep it for his sake.</p>

He would have gone to Bed with her, but she said she was out of Order. And indeed I knew she was very ill - so ill, that she could not well go out about her Business. And I had engaged my self for a Guinea to a Doctor. And so she came down and left the Gentleman, and he would not go to Bed by himself. I desired her not to leave him there alone; upon which, she went up again and brought him down. I told him he might have a Bed at the Bear in Bow street. He Swore and Curst, and called me B - but said nothing of any Loss; and so he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040015"/> went away - I had No-body than up in my House but one Gentlewoman, for my Maid, and my Husband were gone to Bed.</p>

Ye Dog, says I where's my Watch. Presently the Watch was dropp'd and Beck took it up, and said Here is your Watch, I had like to have catch'd it; and so he gave it me all dirty. We carry'd the Prisoner to the Star Alehouse, and afterwards before a Justice, but he would confess nothing.</p>
               <p>W. Beck. As I was standing with my Shop-Mates by the Pastrycook's Shop at the End of Cheapside to see my Lord Mayor's Show, a Crowd of Men came thrusting along. Says my Mate, That tall Fellow there in a Cape-Coat looks like a Pick-Pocket. The Mob turn'd back towards the Old Change, and the Prosecutor turn'd about too and said he had lost his Watch. I went back with him, a great many crouded into the Swan Passage but could not get thro', and so they came out again. The Prisoner was in a Cape Coat. I pointed to him and others and said, There they go by the Joyner's Stand. We follow'd and the Prosecutor took hold of the Prisoner by the Nag's-head Tavern; but the Prisoner was not that Man in the Cape Coat that I saw at first, but there was another Man close by who turn'd about and run, and just as he turn'd I felt something hit against my Foot. I stoop'd down and found it was the Watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the Watch fall from the Prisoner, or the other Man?</p>
               <p>Beck. They had both Cape Coats. The Prisoner stood at my Left Hand. I held him by the Right Shoulder, and the Prosecutor held him on the other Side, and the Watch fell at my Right Foot a Yard from the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. If the other Man had taken the Watch, is it likely that he would follow the Prosecutor with it, stand quietly by him, and then throw it away when he was not in Custody, nor so much as suspected.</p>

The Prisoner in a Cape Coat and red Breeches and two or three more Men husseled me, and my Uncle Mr. Tireman so that they could not go one Way or other for 2 or 3 Minutes, and then they went back and Mr. Tireman miss'd his Watch. The People said those Fellows had been larking about for 2 or 3 Hours, we follow'd them. Beck told us they were at the Swan Door; my Uncle and I passed the Prisoner without minding him, but Beck hipped and said, There goes the Man up the Old Change. The Prisoner then mended his Pace. We pursued, and Mr. Tireman and I collered him; Beck was then a little behind us, and no body else was near us. When Beck came up, I did not indeed see the Prisoner drop the Watch, but I saw his Hand under his Coat, and presently Beck stoop'd and took the Watch up from between the Prisoner's Legs. and said, Here's your Watch, I had like to have taken it before it fell to the Ground.</p>

            , Constable. As I was conducting the Prisoner along. he squeez'd me under the Arm, and said, If you'll let me go I'll make you satisfaction. He deny'd at first that he knew the other Man, but afterwards own'd that he was acquainted with him in Ireland, and said, that he frequented the Black Boy in Newtener's Lane. I and some others went thither to look for him; but there we found about thirty shabby Fellows, who begun to mob us, so that we were glad to get away.</p>

There was more Money in it than I have charged her with. Upon missing it, I called the Drawer to search her, but as soon as he came, she clapt something into his Hand - I suppose it was my Purse - and he went out directly. In a little time he came in again, and stript her, but nothing of mine was then to be found upon her - I would have had a Constable, but they kept me in suspence, and would not send for one - However I know the worst on't.</p>

            , Constable. Going by a suspected House, I listened at the Window, and over-heard this Boy, Will. Bear, tell his Mother that he had got a Shirt, and a Shift.

As I was going with him to Justice Lade, we came to a House where he said the Prisoner lived with a Woman that past for his Wife.

               <p>Will. Bear. On Monday Night I met the Prisoner in Paul's Church-yard, he asked me to go with him, and so we went to this House where we saw some Linnen hanging to dry. There was a half Hatch bolted with 2 Bolts. He unbolted them both, but he was forced to hoist himself up and lean over the Hatch to reach the lower Bolt. Then he went in and brought out 2 Shirts, a Shift, a Sheet, 3 Linnen Handkerchiefs, and a Blue Apron. Then we went over London-Bridge, and thro' Pepper-Alley, and came to a Bench by a great Brew-house, where he gave me one Shirt and one Handkerchief for my Share, and said he'd carry the Rest home to his Wife and have 'em dried - She sells Oysters in Dead-man's Place.</p>

She could not stand, but fell down again, and then George kick'd her and broke her Arm. Some People came out and had like to have taken us, but we got away - About a Fortnight afterward I went before Justice Lade and made a voluntary Confession - resolving to break off all my ill Company - George Sutton is now in the New Goal over the Water - I suppose he could not be removed hither time enough, because the Bill was not found before to Day.</p>

               <p>Goosetry. I was Coachman, but I did not lye in the House.</p>
               <p>Council. Do ye remember where he was on the 13th of May last?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. I can't tell the Day of the Month; but the Day before his House was burnt down, I was out with him at the Temple and other Places all Day and particularly at a House in Queen-Square, Westminster where he supp'd, and set him down at his own Door at ten at Night. He ordered me to come again at 10 o'Clock next Morning, for he said he believed he should go out of Town. But I was call'd out of Bed at four the next Morning, and was told that the House was on Fire. I went thither, and then the House was burnt down.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see any of the Prisoners there at that Time?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. No; I saw none of them then.</p>
               <p>Council. When and where did you first see them after this Misfortune?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040025"/>Goosetrey. I saw them at 8 a-Clock the same Morning at the Red horse in Bond Street, my Master's Horses stood at the Red-horse, and so I suppose they went thither for Shelter.</p>
               <p>Council. What Conversation had you with them there?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. I asked them if my Master was burn'd, and they said they believed so, but they could not tell.</p>
               <p>Council. Did they say they could not tell whether he was burn'd or not?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. I asked them whether it was so or no, and they said it was so, he was burnt; but they could not tell how or which Way.</p>
               <p>Council. How long did you stay with them?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. About a Quarter of an Hour, and then I went away and don't know what came to them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Council. How many Servants had Mr. Cantillon in his Family?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. We had 3 Maids and 2 Men.</p>
               <p>Council. Were the Prisoners at home when you set your Master down at the Door?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. I believe so - One of them let him in - I can't say which.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see the Prisoners when they were in Custody?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Had you any Discourse with them about this Misfortune?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. Nothing in particular that I remember.</p>
               <p>Council. On what account did you go to them?</p>
               <p>Goosetrey. I went on my own Charity to carry them Provisions in Prison.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr. Percival. At half an Hour past 3, hearing the other Servants going up and down, I suspected Fire and got up. We apprehended that it was in Mr. Cantillon's House, because our House-keeper discovered it first in her Chamber, which was next to his House. My Master and I went into the Garden, and the Smoke seemed to come out towards the Top of Mr. Cantillon's House, by the Party-Wall. Then I went into the Street, and Mr. Cantillon's Door being open - I can't tell who opened it, for it was open before I came - I went into the Hall, where I found one of his Men - I can't say which of them it was, but I told him there was a Fire. He went with me into their Garden, and looking up, I saw the other Man-Servant upon the House, and perceived the Smoke coming out of the Crevises of the Window up one Pair of Stairs backward. Upon which, I asked him that was with me, if his Master was in Town. He said yes. Is that his Bed-Chamber, says I, where the Smoke came out? He said yes. And is he a-bed? says I again. I believe so, says he. Then, why the Devil, says I, - or - Damn ye! - I don't know which of the two it was - Why don't you call him up? And upon this we went up Stairs.</p>
               <p>Council. Which of you went first?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. He went foremost, but I went with him - I believe I might have him by the Hand.</p>
               <p>Council. When you came up Stairs did you see any Smoke or Fire?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, not in the least, till we came to the Bed-Chamber-Door.</p>
               <p>Council. Now look at the Prisoners, and see if you can tell which of them it was you went up Stairs with?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I am not sure it was either of them, but it was one of the two Men.</p>
               <p>Council. Was it he that you saw upon the House?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, it was he that I was with in the Garden.</p>
               <p>Council. What was done when you came to the Chamber-Door?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. He turned the Bolt and opened it, and out came the Smoke: upon which he turned back to the Wainscot, and kick'd against it, and said, Master! Master! Fire! Fire! I bid him go and pull him out. So he went in and took him by the Legs, and brought him to the Door, but no Part of the Body without the Door. He held him Knee high by the Legs, and I saw that he was dead, tho' I thought before, that he had been alive. The Deceas'd seem'd to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040027"/> quite naked to the Navel. There was a vast many red Spots on his Belly. Knees and Legs, and down his Thighs - he was all over large Spots.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you observe any Part about him, that appeared to be scorched or sindged?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, I saw no Scorching or Sindging.</p>
               <p>Conncil. How near were you to him?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I was then about 6 Feet from the Chamber-Door.</p>
               <p>Council. You say that he was naked to the Navel: do ye know if any Part of him was cover'd? Had he a Shirt or a Night-Cap on?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I can't say as to that, for I did not see his Head nor his Arms, I saw nothing but the lower Part of his Body, as the Servant had hold of his Legs.</p>
               <p>Council. Then he might have had a Shirt on the Rest of his Body, and a Night-Cap on his Head, tho' you did not see them?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. Yes, he might.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see any Fire in the Room?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, There was Smoke in the Room - a vast Deal of Smoke, but I saw no Fire.</p>
               <p>Court. What, was no Part of the Furniture on Fire?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. Not that I could see, for the Door was not quite open, and I saw nothing in the Room but that Part of the Body.</p>
               <p>Council. By what Light did you see the Body?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. It was Day-Light, as it is now: and the Light that I had, was from the Street-Window.</p>
               <p>Council. Did those red Spots upon the Body appear to be Blood?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I can't say they were Blood, but I thought he was murder'd.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see Elizabeth Pembroke there?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No; When I came to the House I saw one of the Maids in the Entry, but I believe it was the Cook.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you observe the Smoke come out of any Room but that where the Deceas'd lay?</p>
               <p>Kelly. I can't say that I did, but I thought it time to save him.</p>
               <p>Council. Was that <rs id="t17341204-58-deflabel289" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

               <p>M. Kelly. He was in a Cap and Frock, and so I think was he upon the House.</p>
               <p>Council. In what manner did he that was with you, go up Stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. He ran up in a Hurry before me, and immediately after he had knock'd at the Wainscot, he went into the Room and pull'd the Deceas'd out by the Legs; and as soon as ever I saw him, I said to the Servant your Master is murder'd.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did he bring the Deceas'd?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. Almost to the Chamber Door, and then I left him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he holding the Deceas'd when you went away?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. He had him by the Legs; but I believe he might not be holding still; but might be drawing the Body out, when I ran away; for I ran away as soon as I saw it. Then I ran to call the Engines; but I went no further than the Corner of Conduit-street, where I gave the Word, and so it was carried to the Church, and I ran back in five Minutes. Mr. Cantillon 's House was then in a Blaze backwards; Our House was on Fire too, and I went to save our own Things.</p>

            , Mr. Percival's House-keeper. The first thing that I perceived was a great Smoke which waked me; I got up, and awaken'd the Family. I went to Mr. Cautillon's Door; Malachi Kelly was then in the House, and I was going in when I heard the Shriek of Woman's Voices, crying three or four times that their Master was murder'd. They were then up two Pair of Stairs, and came down screaming the same -</p>

               <p>Council. Did you go in?</p>
               <p>A. Shuttleworth. No; I only stood at the Hall Door; for as I was stepping to go in, I heard the shriek of Murder, and the Maids, immediately came down and out at the Door, and stood upon the Flags. I said, I wonder'd they did not go in and try to put the Fire out; and then I went directly into our House, and up Stairs; by which time the Fire was breaking into my Bed Chamber, which was opposite to Mr. Cantillon's Two-pair of Stairs Room.</p>

I ran up one Pair of Stairs, and saw the Corps of the Deceas'd lying at length upon the Landing Place - I saw by his Face that it was the Deceas'd - He was naked to the Stomach.</p>

The Men were in their Frocks; but I am not sure they were button'd.</p>

There was Redness about his Thighs, and Privy Members and Belly; but whether they were burnt, or bloody I can't tell - I could not distinguish - The Man Isaac had him by the Legs, one Legs, in each Hand.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 14th of May last, as I was going by Vine-street to a Brew-house with a Cask in my Hand; there was a Man on the Top of a House cry'd Fire; I ran round to Albemarle-street, and saw Mr. Cantillon's three Maids at his Door. They said, their Master was dead. I ran up Stairs, and saw no Fire then; but the Deceas'd was lying at full length with his Head against his own Door, and his Feet to the Parlor. He had a White Cap on, and his Shirt was turned up to his Navel; his Privities appear'd bruised and blackish; his Linnen was not at all sindged. I stept to the Chamber Door, looked in, and saw the Bed standing, and the Cloths turned up against the side of the Wall. I ran down. The Servants were all in the Entry, crying, and wringing their Hands.</p>
               <p>Council. Did the Men cry?</p>
               <p>C. Woolmer. I did not perceive that they cry'd; but the Maids did - Why, says I, Don't you take care to bring him down?</p>
               <p>Council. Which of them did you speak to to take care of the Body?</p>
               <p>C. Woolmer I think it was to Isaac, but they were all together - I ran up again, but then a Flame burst out of the Chamber Door, and then I said it was too late.</p>
               <p>Council. How long was that after the first time you went up?</p>
               <p>C. Woolmer. It was presently after; for I ran up and down the first and second time as fast as I could; and at the second going up, the Fire burst out and caught hold of the Wainscot, and the Banisters of the Stairs, and crack, crack, crack, they went in a Moment.</p>

In a Quarter of an Hour we went round, and stood over against the Foreside of the House, and then I saw the Flare of the Fire; it seemed to be up one Pair of Stairs. The Street Door was open, and the Servants were coming out; I saw two Maids come out first, one of them was the Kitchen-Maid, and the other was Elizabeth Pembroke: I asked them if they belong'd to the Family; they said, Yes; I asked them if all their Family was out; they answered, No, their Master was burnt, and they saw him dead, and bloody - Then Isaac Berridge, and the other Maid came out. And Mary Mersit asked them several times why they did not bring their Master out. The Man answered, That he brought him to the Top of the Stairs, but having no help, could get him no farther: That he left him at Night reading abed; and that he knew he had 500 l. in the House.</p>

             (who was Mr. Percival's Cook, went to the Red Horse in Bond Street. The two Men, Berridge and Arnold were standing at the Door, and the three Maids were drinking Tea within. We sat down with them, and asked them how the Fire happened. Elizabeth Pembroke answered, My Master is very much given to Reading in his Bed, and he did it himself. What time did he come home? Says I. Between 10 and 11. Says she. Was he in Drink? Says I, No, She said he was sober, she put him to Bed herself, drew the Curtains, and shut the Windows. Then he took his Book, and she said to him, Sir, do ye want any thing else? He answer'd No. I may read these two or three Hours; and as she was going out, he said to her, Bid the Footman take the Key of the Door that I mayn't be disturbed in the Morning, and tell him to take a Side-Box in the Play house; and so she said the Footman took the Key and carry'd it down and laid it upon the Table; and, as luck would have it, they had the Key, or they should all have been burnt - I asked her why they did not bring their Master down Stairs; and she said the Man was bringing him down, but the Fire catch'd hold of his (the Man's) Cap, and he fell down over his Master on the Stairs, and some body came and fetch'd him ( the Man) away, or he had been burnt too.</p>
               <p>Council. Were the Men present when she said this?</p>

               <p>The Examination of Isaac Berridge, taken before me the 14th Day of May, 1734</p>
               <p>' THIS Examinant saith, that he was a Servant to one Mr. Cantillon in Albemarle-street, lately deceased; and had lived with him about four Months. That for about three Weeks last past, his said Master had taken the the Key of the Street-Door up into his Bed-Chamber; and believes his Reason for so doing was upon some Distaste he took to a Servant discharg'd three Weeks ago: but that last Night he left the Key, together with his  Watch below in the Parlour, and believes it was on account of this Examinant's being to go early in the Morning to take a Box for him in the Opera; because that he gave him Directions for that purpose. That he let his Master in last Night about Eleven a Clock, who undrest himself in the Parlour as usual; took his Candle and Book, and went up to Bed soon after; and told this Examinant he would read. That as this Examinant was in Bed with his Fellow-Servant, he heard a knocking at the Door between the Hours of three and four o'Clock, and Fire cry'd out, that he immediately got up, put on his Cloaths, and went down Stairs and opened the Street Door: That he afterwards went into the Yard, and saw the Smoke coming out of the Wall of his Master's Bed-Chamber, and immediately ran up Stairs; and coming to his Master's Chamber- Door, found it open, and attempted once or twice, to pull his Master out of Bed, the Room being full of Smoke and Fire: that at last, he got him by the Legs, and pulled him off the Bed to the Stair-Case, and then swooned away, and was carried off. Says, he does not remember he had his Shirt on, and that his Breast, Face and Bowels, were scorched and burnt; and does not remember his having his Night-Cap on. Says, that his said Master usually locked himself up.</p>

I went with him to a Goldsmith's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040035"/> Door, but the Goldsmith was gone to Bed. Then we went to a Pawn-broker, who weigh'd it, and said it came to 10 s. We went out again. I had 7 s. in my Pocket, and borrowed three more, and bought the Spoon my self; for Richard Carr being very/ well drest, I had no Mistrust that the Spoon was stole.</p>

The Toad has been the Ruin of me. I went after her; I spent a great deal of Time and Money, and offer'd a Reward for taking her. But by good luck, in about a Fortnight, going to a Bawdy-house, not far from my House, on the Backside of Drury-Lane, I met with her. She was lock'd up in a Room, and they denied her to me at first; but when I told them, and stood stifly to it (as well I might, for it was nothing but the Truth) that I had seen her through the Window, I gained Admittance, and there was my Gentlewoman, drest up, I'll warrnt ye, like one of the tip top Madams of the Hundreds.

On the 27th of October my House was broke and robb'd in the Night: I don't know who did it; but we were alarmed by Thursby. She goes first to my Mother, lays her Hand on her Face and wakes her, and tells her there were three Rogues in the House; but desires her not to come out of her Room for fear the Rogues should murder her. Then she goes to the Window and calls out Thieves. The Noise waked me. I got up, and taking the Key of the Door with me, went down Stairs, I found all my Doors and Windows fast, except the Parlor Window, and that was open. The Sash was thrown up, and the two Alarm-Bells were taken and laid down upon the Table. The Drawers were open. The Goods in the Indictment were taken away; besides which, there was a Petticoat dropt, and a Gown half in and half out. Thursby told me that as she was a-bed with Brown she was waked by the Noise of her own Trunk being broke open, and then saw three Men, one in Grey, one in Olive, and one in Black: That two of them had Masks, and the other had a black Crape over his Face, and a long Knife in his Hand, that he threatned to cut their Throats if they did not lye still; that he plunder'd her Trunk, took out her Cloths and a Purse of Money which he chink'd in his Hand, and then they tyed up her Clothes in a Table-Cloth and went away - I called in a Constable: he said. This must be done by your own Servants. I said, I believed my Men to be very honest, and had no suspicion of

At first, she said she had pawn'd no Clothes, but afterwards own'd that those were hers. She was carried before the Justice again the next Day; but as we could prove nothing upon her, he bid her go home again, and not fly from me, for if she did he told her it would be an Argument of Guilt. But notwithstanding this, she left my House and I went next Day to enquire for her at a House in Wapping, where her Mother-in-Law lives: Her Mother-in-Law told me that she had been a Thief to her -</p>

She brought these Men's Shoes and Stockings and desired to get her a Suit of Men's Apparel, and procure her a Passage to Jamaica with some Captain that would take her as his Boy. She seem'd to be under a great Concern; but being so well drest I said to her, Mrs. Collet, (for that was her first Husband's Name) the Times are well mended. She answered, But indifferent. Are ye out of Service says I. Aye says she, I have left my Master these three Weeks, tho' it seems she had then been come away but one Day; And she told me that Captain Towers had given her a Suit of Cloaths, and a Fan and five Guineas.</p>

Whereof I thought I might as well let her do it; and so I goes out, and leaves her to clean this Room: and while I was gone, she pulls open my Drawers, and takes my things, and breaks me as much Crockery as comes to 3 or 4 Shillings - And when I came home, she was gone, and my Child said; Mammy, she has put your Apron in her Pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040039"/> and so set a good while there was no such thing as finding her, high nor low; but at last, I meets with her a going along the Street, and she had got my Pattins on - I can safely swear it, and I have but three Weeks to go. - And having these Pattins on; Mistress, says I, these are my Pattins. Well, says she, and what then? Why then pray give them me, says I: No, says she, I'll give ye none of them - Nap my Cuckold for 'em - And now she pretends truly, that I had lent her the Pattins: but if I had, why did not she bring them home again? Pray tell me that: and then I desire to know what Satisfaction I must have for my Crockery-Ware that she broke; and more than that, she proffer'd this Man Mr. Shaw, to give him a Dram out of my Bottle.</p>

She lent me the Pattins to clean her Room, and as I was cleaning it, I happen'd to throw down her Crockery-Ware: and for that she stopt my Broom and my Child's Frock which I had left behind me. And so when she met me afterwards, and asked me for her Pattins, I told her, if she'd give me my Broom and my Frock, I'd give her the Pattins.</p>
               <p>Pros. It's no such Thing; she said nothing, but, Nap my Cuckold! Nap my Cuckold! But howsomever, when her Cuckold came the next Day, and asked for her Things, I let him have 'em.</p>
