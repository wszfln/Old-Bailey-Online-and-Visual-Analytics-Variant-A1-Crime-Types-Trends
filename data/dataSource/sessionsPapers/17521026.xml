            . I was watchman at the Steel Yard. About the fifth of September, in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner come down a ladder that the bricklayers had been using, which stood against the warehouse. When he came to the bottom of the ladder, I asked him what business he had there? He said he had been employed by Mr. Mails, the bricklayer. Said I, What have you under your arm? He said, Only a little piece of lead. I got a constable and secured him. The lead produced in court, 31 inches long, and 14 wide.</p>

The last evidence gave me charge of the prisoner; I secured him, went up upon the warehouse, and found a place where a piece of lead had been newly taken off from a hip; and according to the measure, the lead fitted the place exactly. It had been nail'd on with nails, which were forced out.</p>

On the 26th of September, I put six 36 s. pieces, two guineas, and some silver, into a bag, and put it into a drawer in the bar. I missed the two guineas the next day. The prisoner was recommended to us as an object of charity; we took him in about three weeks before, and he had done a little fault or two before. He was out of the way, I sent a man after him. He was brought back the Friday following; we searched him and found no money upon him. He owned he had given the money to a chairman who was with him when he was taken, and said he found one of the guineas in the sand; after that he confessed taking both. Part of the money was gone; I had a guinea, half a crown, a shilling, and four halfpence, from the chairman.</p>

             sing in a chamber, when I was cleaning my master's stable. I threw a bit of wood in; she said, Who is that? I said it is I. Where is Poll Merrit, said I? She is here, said she. Bid her look out of the door, said I. She did. I said, I'll come up and give you some beer; but I did not. Then I went to my wife, and told her I believed I should find her cloaths, and said, If I come back again, I don't find them; but if I stay, depend upon it I am there. Then I went to them, and said, I am come to give you a dram; then my wife came up, and said, What must you and I have this discontent for? What do you do here? Poll Merrit had my wife's gown on her back, one of my wife's petticoats on, and my shirt made into an apron; the other had the other petticoat on.

Going up Holbourn, Dallison told me she had been upon the ramble, and saw the watchman talk to some people in Long Lane, she came and saw my door open, and took the things mentioned from the foot of the bed. Merrit said the other gave her the things she had on. They had nothing to cover their nakedness before.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rickards met me and this woman together in Long Lane. He asked me to go and drink a dram; I said no. He asked me what made me go in that manner; if I would come he would give me something; I did not know he was married. He had often attempted to make me be concern'd with him, but I never would; he was in a very bad condition with the soul disease. At last I went and drank with him; then I went home with him; there he bid me take the things. Then he said they were his wife's, and she was one of the drunkenest things in the world; and said, if Poll Merrit or you will come and live with me, I shall be happy.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is a false story. I never kissed her lips, or touched her hand in my life. She did once live over my room, but she had a husband. I have admitted her into my room, she has made my bed, and I have given her a dram, that is all.</p>

            . Coming along Threadneedle-street, this day seven-night, I saw the prisoner in a dirty condition and in liquor. She took a silver spoon out of her bosom to look at and put it in again. I thought by the condition she appeared in it was not honestly come by. Mr. Gardner came by, he saw her, and spoke to Mr. Frost; then I went to her and said, you must give an account how you came by that spoon. She said, she wanted to go to some private place, and taking her by 'Squire Gore's gateway, she said, she must go up there. She went up, I stood at the gateway; there I saw her in such a position that I concluded the spoon was no more in her bosom, and told them where I thought she had concealed it. They took her to the constable's house, I told him his wife or daughter must search her, for it was out of my power to find it. Then he took her by the arms and shook her, and the spoon dropped down on the ground, and she at the same time made use of a very indecent expression.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the spoon dropped from her?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I am sure, and it was in such a condition that it plainly appeared from whence it came. She then said she found it in Newgate-street. After that she told the constable, if he would not ask her name, and would let her go, she would tell whose it was; then she was taken before my Lord Mayor. I advertised the spoon, and the next day coming to Mr. Frost's, there was the prosecutor. This is the spoon that is produced.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Where did you see me?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I first saw her in Threadneedle-street, but took her in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost. Standing at my door last Thursday in the afternoon, in Bishopsgate-street, Mr. Gardner and the last witness came up to my door and told me, they believed a woman was gone by that had stolen a spoon. I said, if you suspect that, it is very proper she should be taken up. Chapman went and stoped her, and desired her to deliver up the spoon, or give an account how she came by it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260006"/> He brought her back. She went into 'Squire Gore's gateway, and he kept by the door way to prevent any people from going in. Then he brought her to my house, and we took her into my back-kitchin. He said, it is in vain for you to look for the spoon, for you will not be able to find it; your wife, maid, or daughter, must search her. Then she wanted to go backwards. I took hold on her and shook her, and this spoon dropped from her in a very indecent condition. I took it up. It fell just between her legs.</p>

On the fifth of August I went home about ten o'clock at night, my landlady told me she had taken in a lodger but did not very well like him, because she had sent for his character, as he directed, and could hear nothing about him. He was then in bed in my room. I had three shirts in a handkerchief, which I brought home from the washerwoman's. I carried them up with me to bed, then unlocked my chest and put them in, and went to look for my night cap but could not find it, so tied a handkerchief about my head. When I got up in the morning

            . I was standing at my father's door. He is an oilman on Ludgate Hill. At this time I saw the prosecutor take hold of the prisoner at the bar, and say. You picked my pocket of my handkerchief. I saw a handkerchief under the prisoner's coat; a good piece of it hung down.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it?</p>
               <p>Hudson. It was a blue one. I saw a fellow at a post. The prisoner slipped the handkerchief on the other side and got near the post, seeming as if he in ended to give it to the man that stood there: it fell down, the prosecutor took it up, and secured him.</p>

Said I, I am sure I have not. He shuffled round me. There was a handkerchief lay on the ground. Then they lugged me away.  <rs id="t17521026-16-verdict90" type="verdictDescription">

I had part of a bowl of punch before me, and said to them. Take and drink it, it is paid for; so I went out at the door, and sat down on a bench to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Grear. I was a little in liquor, but more distracted in mind than drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What about?</p>
               <p>Grear. Because my wife and I had had some words. I was awaked by something busy about my shoes; I got up in a sort of amaze, but saw nobody, and found my silver buckles were taken out of my shoes. I felt in my pockets and found them cut, and a guinea and 5 s. 6 d. in money gone. Then I came into that house again; the landlord and I went to Mr. Newbolt's, and coming back, there was the prisoner drinking a pint of purl with another soldier. I said, That is the man that I believe has robbed me. They search'd him, and found my silver buckles in his bag that he carries his things in. Produced in court, and deposed to. The prisoner delivered a guinea to the constable in the watchhouse, and said it was mine, that he had robbed me, and was sorry for it, but begged that I'd not take his life away. The guinea produced in court. He said he had distributed the 5 s. 6 d. among the rest of his comrades, one of whom got a hundred lashes for it yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he confessed this?</p>
               <p>Grear. It was in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whereabouts was you when these things were taken from you?</p>
               <p>Grear. It was four doors from the alehouse where we had the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What time of the night?</p>
               <p>Grear. It was not half an hour over or under two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What time did you see me first of all?</p>
               <p>Grear. A little after twelve o'clock. I was going from my own house, and met with him just by the corner of the King's Arms alehouse, going up to the parade at Kensington. I gave him one pot of beer then, taking but one draught of it, and left him there.</p>

            . I keep the Six Bells at Kensington. The prosecutor, a watchman, and two soldiers, came together to my house about one o'clock the nineteenth of October, in the morning. They called me up, saying they wanted some liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the soldiers that came in at that time?</p>
               <p>Dale. No, he was not. The prosecutor treated them with a pint of beer and a dram, and had a pint of beer himself; after that he called for a shilling bowl of punch. After that he call'd for another; I had not made that long before in came the prisoner. The prosecutor made him and me drink each a little of that; he sat a little time, considering as it were, seeming very much vex'd; he went out, and gave the remainder of the punch to Simon the prisoner, who, I believe, sat half an hour in my house after the prosecutor was gone out. I remember he asked me, whether the prosecutor had changed a guinea to pay for the punch? I told him he had not. There were some other people came in, and Simon went out about half an hour after two. The Newbury coach stopp'd at three at my house; about half an hour after in came the prosecutor, and said, I have been robbed. I asked him, what company he had been in last night ? He said, he had been with the prisoner and two others at the centry box, and at the King's Arms. Then I desired him to go to the guard, and secure them. I called up my wife rather sooner than ordinary, and went with him to Mr. Newbolt's house, the constable; coming back, who should be in my house but the prisoner and another soldier; then the prosecutor pointed to the prisoner, and said, There is the man. The constable searched him, and I saw him take these silver buckles out of his cartouch box. He said the other man had the guinea; but when he was taken in charge, he himself pulled it out and gave it to the constable, confessing that he himself stole it from the prosecutor, and the buckles too, and desired he'd be merciful to him. This is the guinea produced which he gave to the constable.</p>

I put him into the round house, and went into the guard house to see the faces of the other soldiers, as the prisoner had said there was another man along with him when he robbed the prosecutor, who had part of the money. I brought that man to Mr. Dale's house; then the prisoner began to be sorry, and said, if he'd be merciful he'd give him the guinea again, and pulled it out of the waistband of his breeches; he gave it to me, and owned that he had taken it, and that he had given thirteen pence of the money to the other soldiers.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you it last?</p>
               <p>Brown. I felt it in my fob about two minutes before she picked me up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Brown. I was in liquor; but knew very well what I did. I charged her with picking my pocket of it, and made a great deal of noise.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in a publick room?</p>
               <p>Brown. No; we were in a room by ourselves. The landlord came in, I told him I had been robbed of a gold watch, and desired him to call a watchman. He said he would not; then came in a little woman, who undressed the prisoner quite to her smock; there was nothing found upon her. I was talking to the landlord, and calling, Watchman, very loud; then the prisoner slipped away. I then said to the landlord, You are a very pretty fellow. He took me by the collar, and pushed me out at the door, and shut it to. Then I called, Watch; the watchman came, I told him I had been robbed at that house, and asked him if he could not get it open? He said, he could not. I said, my cane was on the inside. Mr. Black open'd the wicket, and said, You have not paid your reckoning. I said, Let me in, and I'll pay it. He pushed my cane through, I took it, and went home. The next morning I came there again, and saw Mr. Black sweeping his door. He wanted me to come in. I said, No, I am sober now, I will not. I advertised my watch, four guineas reward, and after that at five guineas. Then there came a porter to the place where it was to be brought, who said he knew of the watch. He produces a gold watch. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by it?</p>
               <p>Brown. It was brought before Justice Fielding, by

               <p>Q. What is her employment?</p>
               <p>Murphet. I don't know that.</p>

            . I am servant to my sister-in-law. Her name is Bibby. The prisoner pawned this watch at our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it advertised when you took it in?</p>
               <p>Bibby. There was a watch advertised the day after which was made at Paris; but it did not answer to this, because there was no seal to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this made at Paris?</p>
               <p>Bibby. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she fetch it away, or did you go to her with it, after you read the advertisement?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I went to her, and asked her how she got it; she said, she came by it very honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the advertisement lead you to go to her?</p>
               <p>Bibby. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to send for the person that advertised it, instead of going to the prisoner, that he might give proper descriptions of it?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I did not think it to be the same, upon account of the hour hand not being described. I told her of the advertisement. She said, it was quite a false, and that she had it of a gentleman whom she knew very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think she came honestly by it?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you the money back for it?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I went with her into the city to a gentleman who is here in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with her, to have it replaced from your shop into the hands of another ?</p>
               <p>Bibby. She said, rather than we should be any way fearful, she had a friend in the city would lend her the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what business she was of?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the other watch you speak of back to her for her to redeem it?</p>
               <p>Bibby. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she fetch it in three or four days?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I believe she did.</p>

            . I am clerk to a factory in Ironmonger Lane, at Mr. Shepherd's. The prisoner and Mr. Bibby came on the fourteenth of September, about one o'clock to the Angel, and sent for me; they were up one pair of stairs. I went, the prisoner told me she had an execution against her for a small debt, which she imagined to be done in spite by some of her neighbours, and this person that was with her had passed his word for her safe return, as she told him she could borrow the money. She said the debt was six guineas. She seem'd very much distressed, and said, if I would lend her the money for three or four days, she should be bound to pray for me, and would leave this gold watch for it. She said, the person had not the money himself, or he would advance it for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bibby in company at this time?</p>
               <p>Oakley. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this watch was pawned to him, and he came in order to get his money?</p>
               <p>Oakley. No, not a word of that. I understood this watch was brought to me to be pledged as the first time. I lent her six guineas, and had the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver the money to?</p>
               <p>Oakley. I delivered it to her; Bibby had the watch. She took that from him, and gave it to me, and gave him the money. Then I call'd up the landlord to be a witness, saying to him, upon the payment of so much money, I am to deliver this watch back. This was on Thursday. On the Monday following she came to the same house in the evening, to pay me the money, and but a few hours before that a person had shewed me the paper with the advertisement, and said he was directed by some people to Ironmonger Lane. He said he understood it was, not honestly come by. I ask'd what must be done in the case? He said, your best way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260011"/> will be to deliver it up quietly; then he said he would go to the person that employed him, and come again to me; in the mean time she came, and paid me the money that I had lent her. I told her what had happened, she replied it was only a sudge, adding, if I was in fear, I might keep it till she came again; so I kept it for my own security.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same watch?</p>
               <p>Oakley. It is. Upon finding she was apprehended afterwards, I inquired of an attorney what I must do, and he said my best way would be to deliver it up; so I delivered it to Mr. Hammond, the master of the house, where she sent for me, and the attorney, and desired us to carry it to the justice, and deliver it up.</p>

            , coming to my house on the 15th of September; she came the 14th, and asked for Mr. Oakley, I was called up, and Mr. Oakley said, Look here, I am to return the watch upon receiving six guineas ; afterwards I carried it to Justice Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same that is here produced?</p>
               <p>Hammond. I really believe it is; the hour and minute hands were gold, and Paris was at the bottom of the plate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I don't deny but that I had the watch of the prosecutor; he gave it me. I had broke my leg and arm by a fall from a horse, and having two children, he was so kind, one day, as to call at my lodgings. I was not able to stir out of my bed, and was obliged to sell my bed, and pawn all my clothes. He told me he had no money, but he gave me the watch to pawn for three guineas; I took it, and pawned it for six, at which he was very angry, and would not take it out. I told him I would let him have the three guineas again, when my child's father came to town, but he would not agree to fetch it out. The watch was advertised, and Mr. Bibby brought it to me; then I went to Mr. Oakley, and he lent me the money, and I got the money for it again. That very night the prosecutor brought me from my lodgings up as far as the George; I asked him how far he was going to carry me, and said he might as well go to the Fountain Tavern; and he brought me into the top room. I believe he was a little in liquor. He then said, I miss my watch; I replied, Don't go to take any advantage of one you have known so long, you know you gave me the watch. He insisted upon having the watchman called, I was searched, and nothing found upon me; then he would not pay his reckoning, and the man shoved him and I out of doors; I said, Mr. Brown, you had better go home. I went home, and left him there, and was very uneasy about it, but never saw him after that till before Justice Fielding. In our unhappy way of life, it is very seldom we have witnesses by when we take money, and the like.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Upon my oath I never was with her in any place, or saw her, before that night I lost my watch.  <rs id="t17521026-19-verdict107" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am servant to Drury Otley. Esq; On the 23d of september I was up ironing in the laundry over the kitchen, adjoining to the dwelling-house. I went to bed about twelve, and left the goods, mentioned in the indictment, in the laundry; some hanging up to dry on the horse. The sashes were down, but the shutters not done up. The door opens into a passage. The window that the thief got in at is in the servants hall, then through the kitchen, and through the scullery; then up stairs, and through the passage into the laundry. I came down stairs about eight o' clock, then Margaret Wade went up into the laundry, and missed the things.</p>

On a Sunday morning, the latter end of September, about ten in the morning, I was sent for to 'Squire Otley's, and told of this robbery: in the evening I heard there were two people at Hounslow had some of these aprons and handkerchiefs on; I went there, and found the two prisoners in Hesson cage, with another woman and a man, as also the best part of the things about them. I found one of the handkerchiefs about Little's neck, and one or two in her pocket, and an apron on: Richens had one handkerchief about her neck, and a pair of shoes and stockings. There were two aprons, and a red cloak in the man's pocket. I found also a shift pawned at Hounslow for a shilling. This man swore before Justice Burkhead, he took the things he had in his pocket from Little.</p>

Gore came up, and clapped a pistol, I believe, within half a yard of my head, and swore d - n his blood, if I did not immediately stop, he would blow my brains out. He said so a second time, then I stopt. He went and clapped his left hand on the coach door, presented a pistol with his right into the coach, and demanded their money; they replied they were but poor servants, and had nothing for him. He then demanded it a second time, and they made the same reply. Then he came up to me, presented his pistol, and swore if I did not make off, off, off (for so he expressed himself ) he would blow my brains out. I drove directly to our own door, which was but about thirty yards off.</p>

I picked up a stone going along, and saw the two prisoners attacking a single gentleman at the corner of the Square. When they saw us, they both ran, as did also the gentleman, thinking we had been accomplices. I flung the stone at Gore, but missed him. He ran down Pall-Mall, in the middle of the street, Hughs ran on the flag stones, within the posts. I ran after Gore, I believe, 150 yards; I kicked up his heels in Pall-Mall, and with the force of his fall the pistol flew out of his hand. I secured him immediately, and lay upon him seven or eight minutes before the watch came. I think the footman came first, and I bid him take up the pistol, which he did. When the watchman came, I delivered one hand to the watchman, and I held the other; then we led him to the watch-house. I went to see him when in Newgate, and he told me, the reason that he left us was, because he saw a better mark coming, which he thought to attack.</p>

I saw my tankard when they were in the house, and missed it before they were gone. They called for a tankard of mild beer, I ran down into the cellar with one silver tankard, and left another upon the shelf in the back room; but before I came up, my boy came down for a pint of beer, which he said was for a stranger in the back room; I replied, I am drawing this tankard for one of them. When I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260014"/> came up there was only Welch sitting. I said, where is the other gentleman? He said, he is gone over the way and will come presently. Then I saw Smith standing at the tap-room door, and said, you are the person that came with the other gentleman. He said, no, he was not, he never saw him in his life. Seeing my tankard was gone I challenged them with it. Smith said, he was never in the kitchin, the boy and maid said he was there. We searched about the bench and found nothing where Smith was standing, but under the bench between Welch's legs there I found a base metal tankard, or what is called French plate, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Corral. No, I did not. He called for a pint of beer, and it was brought him in another silver mug. I went down into the cellar and left them in the room; Welch was seated but the other was not. I did not see the mug brought to Smith. When I came up again the maid was making them a welch rabbit. Then they were both seated, and as close together as two men could be, at a little table about two feet six inches long, in a settle near the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them converse together?</p>
               <p>Corrall. I saw them lean their heads together once or twice. Then they had two silver mugs standing before them on the table, and I observed when I came up the candle was removed from the table and put on the mantlepiece aloft, which was not a usual place. Smith's pint being out he ordered the maid to send the boy to fill it again, which was done. Then he desired the maid to drink with him, she refused it, and said, she had drank once out of the other pint. He desired very much she would, and at last she did. They staid some considerable time. I was sitting in a box just by, the maid was just stepped out at the door and gone a cross the way. Welch paid me for one pint of beer, the other for two and a welch rabbit, all in halfpence, and went away about five or ten minutes before eight o'clock both together </p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue in your house after you came out of the cellar?</p>
               <p>Corral. About a quarter of an hour. The pot was missed before the mugs were put out of my sight, or any body moved in the house, which was in about three or four minutes after they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260015"/> gone. My maid,

               <p>Corrall. It was too late to go after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found it again ?</p>
               <p>Corrall. No, I have not. Hearing of the prisoners being taken up about a tankard, I went to see them, and swore they were the men that were drinking in my house at that time. The metal mug was produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this one of the mugs that you had in your house before ?</p>
               <p>Corrall. No, it is not. I am positive both my mugs were silver that were on the table, and there was no soul near the table but the prisoners. The base metal one was very much like that which Smith was drinking out of; having but one of that make, and finding two, we found it out directly. The other that I lost had no belly to it, only a litle rim round it, and it goes straight up.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the twelfth of this month Mr. Welch came into our house about one o'clock and called for a pint of beer, he sat a trifle of time and then went away. He came again about three, and called for another pint of beer, but did not stay then. A little time after that he came again, about seven, and called for another pint, I drew it in a silver pint mug, he had all the times the same mug. He staid there about ten minutes, then Smith came in and called for another pint of beer. which was drawn him in another silver mug. He sat down at the same table with Welch on a settle near the fire. Smith desired me to make him a welch rabbit.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two mugs you set before them silver ones?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I am sure they were, Smith drank his pint of beer and desired me to bid the boy fill it again, I did. Then he desired me to drink with him, so I did, and then I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I went out about four or five minutes before eight o'clock. I had not been out above three or four minutes, and when I came in they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went out?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I left them in the same place where they were drinking near the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they continued in the same place all the time they were in the house?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. They had. I sat facing them about half an hour, and for the rest I was backwards and forwards about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that silver mug which is missing last ?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I had drank out of it the moment before I went out. When I came back again I went into the bar for a mug to draw a pint of beer, and seeing two of the same pattern missed it directly. It was in three or four minutes at most. We had but one mug of that shape which is lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into the bar to look for a mug?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. Because the boy had taken the two mugs from off the table and set them in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Which mug was missing?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. The mug that Smith had was missing, and a base metal one put in its place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the boy here?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. He is not, being wanted at home.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I ordered the boy to take the mugs off the table and wipe out the score as soon as they had paid their reckoning, in both their hearing, and saw him set them in the bar close by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this base metal mug. Is that the mug you found in the bar?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it stand on the table when they were drinking?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. No, I did not at all. When Mr. Smith had eat the welch rabbit he took the news paper to read, but Welch removed the candle from the table to the mantlepiece and the other took it back again three times.</p>

            , On the twelfth of this month I went into the prosecutor's house about seven o'clock in the evening, there were two men, I don't attempt to swear they were the prisoners, for I took but little notice of them. I observed the candle to be removed from the man a reading two or three times. When they had been gone two or three minutes, and the master had bid the boy clear the table, the maid went into the bar and said, what strange silver mug is this, so it was found out.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. In whose possession has this base metal mug been since that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It has been in the possession of the constable.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have been acquainted in the house, and went in to have a pint of beer in the morning. I went into the city, and came again about seven o'clock and had another, and staid there some time. This man that stands here ( pointing to Smith ) I never saw in my life, till I was taken a fortnight ago.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260016"/> I observed a man to come and sit down facing me, he had two pints of beer, but never spoke to me all the time.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>I absolutely deny that of being in the prosecutor's house, or in the court where the house is. I will make it manifest, that I was at St. James's all the afternoon till eight o'clock at night, and after that at my lodgings in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Are you certain Smith was in your house that night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am very sure he was, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. By what did you observe of him to know him again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He has a sort of a mark on his left cheek. I know him perfectly well both by his countenance and speech.</p>

               <p>A. Plea. I don't know that. It is somewhere in Clare-market. I saw him the twelfth of October at our house in the Hay-market, we lived there then. I believe it was between three and four o'clock, he called accidentally and was very urgent to be gone, but staid till between seven and eight. My sister came home to drink tea, I believe it was a full half hour after seven, but then you must allow, as the justice told me, that the clocks vary. I believe there is a good deal in that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>A. Plea. I never enquired into that. He always appeared to me in the character of a gentleman, and I liked his company as a good agreeable man. I did, indeed I did. I came acquainted with him purely by accident.</p>

               <p>Gallant. It was lost from out of a club room up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Gallant. He had used my house before, and behaved well; I never mistrusted him. He was there the night I missed it. When he was taken before Justice Fielding he confessed that it was my tankard ; it is cut in so small pieces I can't swear to it. Produced in court, cut in pieces almost as small as barley corns.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop on the nineteenth instant, and offered me these pieces of silver to sell. He produces a small parcel. I had seen him before, but did not know his name. I knew he was a taylor; I asked him his name, he said it was John Brindal, and that he was a periwigmaker. Then I stopped it, and he said he'd go and fetch the man he had it to sell for, but did not return. I advertised it and described the man; he was taken; that taken out of his pocket, and this which I stopped weighed much about the weight of the tankard, according to the prosecutor's account of the weight. I have sold him goods, but never heard any ill of him before this.</p>

               <p>King Gold. On the first of September, between five and six in the evening, going from Ealing to town, about half a mile from my own house, my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260018"/> coach was stopped by a single highwayman; he had on a brown indifferent great coat, a black piece of silk over his face, and a pistol in his hand; he first demanded that I would deliver my money. I pulled out a purse in which I had only a guinea and half, which he took from me. It was some time before I delivered my watch, he cocked his pistol, and presenting it to my breast, said he'd fire if I did not deliver it immediately; this he repeated several times. He would have my watch, and once attempted to pull it out. I said my hands were very lame, I was a gouty sort of a man, and could not make such haste as he would have me. At last I delivered it; he then presented his pistol to the coachman, and bid him go on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak like an Englishman, or a foreigner?</p>
               <p>Gold. The moment he began to open his mouth I knew him to be a foreigner, and speak as bad English as ever I heard. There were very large holes in the silk for him to look through. He is shewed a pistol. I think I can swear this is the pistol I was robbed with. I believe it is a foreign make, and I thought so then on seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be in committing this robbery?</p>
               <p>Gold. He was a great many minutes in commiting it. I was surprized that there were so many people on the road, and none came up. His coat looked like a coat to disguise him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner. What have you to charge him with ?</p>
               <p>Gold. I verily believe him to be the man. I saw him at Justice Fielding's, and the moment I saw him I thought I knew his eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his own hair, or a wig?</p>
               <p>Gold. I could not tell that, his great coat was put up. I more particularly remarked his voice, if he speaks watch, no man can be mistaken in him. He is certainly the man, I am certain he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you surprized at this time?</p>
               <p>Gold. I can't say I was without fear. or I had not delivered my watch; but it was but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the silk cover his whole face?</p>
               <p>Gold. It did to his breast, but there were large eye-holes, and I perceived long eye-lashes, and a full stare with his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of his eye lashes?</p>
               <p>Gold. I can't tell; they seemed to be dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first word he said to you?</p>
               <p>Gold. It was, stop, stop, stop.</p>
               <p>Q. From these words did you take him to be a foreigner?</p>
               <p>Gold. I did; and from the words, deliver your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any body with you?</p>
               <p>Gold. There was Mr. Sweet in the coach with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he robbed at the same time?</p>
               <p>Gold. He took his money first, then he called upon me for mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he call out?</p>
               <p>Gold. He said, maak hast.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sweet. I was in the coach with Mr. Gold at this time, on the 1st of September, about half an hour after five in the afternoon. I think the prisoner is the man that did the robbery. The person had a black silk on his face. He clapped his pistol close to my breast and demanded my money, and after that my watch. Then he robbed Mr. Gold of his watch and money. I took a great deal of notice of his speech.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the prisoner speak since?</p>
               <p>Sweet. I have before the justice. He talked about the watch, and to the best of my judgment, the voice is exactly the same. I said he was a foreigner as soon as we were robbed; the holes through the silk were about the size of a crown piece, but I did not take particular notice of his eyes. He had a great coat on of a darkish or brownish colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the watch Mr. Gold lost?</p>
               <p>Sweet. I do, I was sent for to Mr. Dunlop's shop to see it, and can swear to that to be the same Mr. Gold lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. That is the prisoner at the bar. His landlord came to me and informed me the prisoner had been out of town, and upon Hounslow Heath he had been robbed, and likewise a Chaise was robbed, and he thought Captain Jasper, who had been robbed some time before, might get intelligence of his watch. On Saturday the 14th, in the evening, the prisoner came in a hackney coach to my door; in one hand he had the advertisement describing the gold watch. I looked upon it and said that was not the watch of Captain Jasper, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260019"/> that of Mr. Gold. Then he put the gold watch into my hand, I looked upon it and found it to be Mr. Gold's. The prisoner sat down, and told me he had been out of town, and upon Hounslow Heath had been robb'd of 2 guineas and a half, and also that a post chaise with two ladies in it had been robbed of eighteen or twenty guineas. That he (the prisoner) came up to their chaise, and asked them if they had been robbed? They said yes, and pointing said, there goes the highwayman. He likewise told me he offered to borrow a horse of a gentleman ; that he pursued, and being come up with the highwayman by the Duke of Argyle's, the highwayman's horse made a plunge, and he cocked a pistol; that he followed him to the side of the Thames; that the highwayman dropped a pistol, and he took it up; that the highwayman took into the Thames, and finding he could not swim over, came back again, and said, if you'll let me escape I'll give you a gold watch; that the prisoner said, you look to be a good-natured gentleman, if you'll go with me to Hounslow I'll give you a glass of wine; that he took the watch, and they rode on together. When they came there he went to collar the highwayman, who pulled out two pistols; he discharged one at him, and with the other shot himself. I asked him what sort of a person he was that shot himself? He answered, a man about five feet ten inches high, almost six feet, and a d - n'd ugly looking fellow. He looks at the gold watch. This is the watch he brought to me to get the reward; my brother made it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gold. Is this the watch you was robbed of on the first of September?</p>
               <p>Gold. It is the same; it had then a fine steel chain, which is not on it now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dunlop. Is it in the same condition it was when the prisoner brought it to you?</p>
               <p>Dunlop. It is; it had nothing but a silk string on it then. The prisoner seemed uneasy to be gone. I told him the gentleman that owned the watch was a man of great honour, and that he need not doubt having the reward. I sent for Mr. Sweet, and Mr.

            . My father's watch and seal having been described in an advertisement, with ten guineas reward, and in case the person was discovered they should have five guineas more, on Saturday was se'nnight, between five and six in the afternoon, a messenger came and told me my father's watch was brought to Mr. Dunlop's. I, not being very well, desired they'd come down to me in Privy Gardens. Mr. Sweet and the prisoner came; the prisoner told me what he was come upon, and produced this watch and seal of my father's which has since been in my custody. He told me he had brought my father's watch and seal, as he supposed by the advertisement. I desired him to give me an account how he came possessed of them, after I had taken them. He told me he was upon Hounslow Heath, and pursued a highwayman till he stopp'd and told him he was an unfortunate tradesman, and desired he'd not ruin him, saying, go about your business, here is a watch and seal for you; that he took it and seemed to be friends with him; they then rode on together. I said at last, what am I to do? He produced the news paper, upon which I understood he meant to receive the reward. He gave me his name and place of abode. I gave him a drought on my banker for ten guineas, which he received. I found when I sent to enquire, that he did live at the place he mentioned, having been there four days. The next morning I went to Hounslow, to see the man that lay dead, whether the description answered to what he had said. I found strong reason for suspicion of the prisoner. I got a warrant and the prisoner was taken at his lodgings the next morning.</p>

            . I am Mr. Gold's coachman. I drove him when he was stopt, which was on the first of September. The man that stopt and robbed him was a well made lusty man, had a silk or crape before his face, with a great coat on, patched under both arms with a different colour, being rather darker. He said, Do, do; I did not understand him; then he cry'd stop in a very great hurry, and said, Maak basi, maak basi, maak basi.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the person be in committing the robbery?</p>
               <p>Flinden. I believe about ten or twelve minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the prisoner speak since he was in custody?</p>
               <p>Flinden. I have before the justice, and his voice is very much like the person's that committed the robbery. He is also much about the size of the person but his great coat was buttoned up.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see the dead man afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Flinden. I have. That man was not at all of the size of the man that robbed my master; he was a good deal less than the thief; there was no comparison in bulk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the horse the highwayman rode on that robbed your master?</p>
               <p>Flinden. I did; it was a black horse, with a star and a grey tail.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that horse since?</p>
               <p>Flinden. Never before, or since, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any part of his face?</p>
               <p>Flinden. No; but the chin appeared black, and I took him to be a man of a darkish beard.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his eyes?</p>
               <p>Flinden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have known him again by his face, had you seen him half an hour after?</p>
               <p>Flinden. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sweet. What did the prisoner say to you, when you first saw him at Mr. Dunlop's?</p>
               <p>Sweet. He had the watch in his hand, and said, Here be the watch the gentleman advertised; I am come for the reward of ten guineas; the man is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he himself had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Sweet. He said he was, of two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man gave him the gold watch, what did he say then?</p>
               <p>Sweet. He said he accepted it; then he said, Give me the money you robbed me of, and he replied, I have thrown it into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say was done after that?</p>
               <p>Sweet. Then he said he asked the man to go to Hounslow, and drink a pint of wine; when they came there, he cried stop highwayman; then the man drew a pistol, and snapt it at him, but it did not go off; then he drew another, put it to his left ear, and shot himself dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him charged with having a great coat on that day?</p>
               <p>Sweet. I did; he answered he had not had a great coat on since he came to England the last time.</p>

            . I am clerk to Judge Burnet.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner at the bar?</p>

               <p>Sackvile. I beg to be excused answering that, lest it should be a prejudice to the prisoner. I know nothing of the robbery, but happened to be at Hounslow when the man shot himself. I saw a crowd of people surrounding two men on horse-back, presently a pistol went off, and I saw a man drop. My postman stopt, and I got out, went to them, and asked what was the reason of this accident; as also who had pursued this man, as they cried out a highwayman. The prisoner was there, and he said, I'll tell you the whole story. Coming along, continued he, there were two ladies in a post-chaise, and seeing a man stop them, I rode up, and asked them if they had been robbed; they answered no, but that that man had attempted to rob us; then I replied, I'll take him for you. I came up with the man in a very little time, he turned about, saying. What do you follow me for? adding, if I did not go off, he'd shoot me through the head. I said I will not hurt you, but if you will go with me, I'll give you a bottle of wine. I asked him how he came to follow this man, as having no arms; to which he replied: In going along upon the heath, the man dropt a pistol out of a leather apron; that he got off his horse, took it up, and rode on to drink a bottle of wine, when this accident happened. Here I left him, and came on towards London.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. He had a loose great coat on; I saw it was patched under the right arm, and that the patch was rather darker than the coat. I thought it looked very extraordinary, that a man, so well dressed as he was, should wear so shabby a great coat. I then asked him if the highwayman had robbed him; he answered, No, he never offered to rob me; but said, after I had had a little conversation with him, he would not be taken, and that if I attempted it, he would shoot himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of the man riding into the Thames?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had given him a gold watch?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. No, he did not</p>
               <p>Q. Did he to any body else at that time?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. Not at Hounslow, at that time, as I know of. I happened to be there three days after, and there was no body talked about it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before Justice Fielding?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. I was; there he told his worship he was robbed of two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed that was shot?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. He had an old great coat on a very bad wig, and a leather apron. He was much about my size, (which was much less than the prisoner) and his brains were shot out of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Gold's coachman say any thing before the justice?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. He there said, he was sure the man that shot himself was not the man that robbed his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing there about his being on horseback ?</p>
               <p>Sackvile. He said he had not been on horseback above once or twice since he has been in England.</p>
               <p>Q. to Charles Gold. What did you hear the prisoner say about his being on horseback ?</p>
               <p>C. Gold. He said before me, and my father, he had been on horseback but three times in the six months he had been in England.</p>

               <p>Jenkins. I cannot justly say! The first time he had no whip, and I lent him a little cane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him make any complaint that night he returned, when the man was shot at Hounslow?</p>

            . I am headborough. I apprehended the prisoner last Monday was se'nnight. I searched his lodgings, and in opening a closet door, I found a pistol loaded: there also I found this hat; [holding one in his hand] and here are the holes where the pins have gone through to pin in crape, or silk, withinside the crown, on the front of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gold. (looking at the hat ). This is very much like the hat the man had on that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he lived ?</p>
               <p>H. Gale. I asked him where he lived, but did not understand him, he speaking very bad English, though I thought he said Brook Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he always one horse?</p>
               <p>H. Gale. He had; it was a black brown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cousseavs. I live in Hanover-Street, Long-Acre. The prisoner lodged at my house at the time of the highwayman's shooting himself at Hounslow. He lodged with me from Tuesday, old Michaelmas-day, to the Monday following. When he came home, after the man was shot, he told me he had been on the other side Hounslow, and coming back he was robbed of two guineas and a half; that afterwards he saw the man rob two ladies in a post-chaise, and seeing some horsemen come up, he desired them to lend him a horse, which they did ; that he pursued him, and seeing a pistol he on the heath, he dismounted, took it up, and mounted again; that presently he came up with him, and desired him to, or he was a dead man; that the other remained he would rather lose his life, or shoot himself; that he answered, Give me then the money you have taken from me, and he said he had thrown it away; that he requested him to put up his pistol, and he would put up his, which being agreed to, they went together towards Hounslow; that there he offered to seize him, but the man turning about, snapt a pistol at him, and with another pistol shot himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you then about a gold watch?</p>
               <p>Scot. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am a foreigner, and cannot speak in the speech way. This day I went out to Windsor, to see the prince, and hired a horse at Kensington. I dined of Hounslow Heath about four o'clock, about two miles from the town. I was stopt by a highwayman on a chesnut horse, with a whitish coloured great coat, and a wig ; he was a strong shouldered man; he robbed me of two guineas and a half. He turned round some trees, and saw me a coming after him, upon which I dismounted my horse, covered myself in a hedge, and he passed by me. There was another man passed by, unto whom I said, I have been robbed by that fellow, will you lend me your horse ? which was a brown one; he did not, but gave me a coat to disguise me. There was a post-chaise with two ladies in it, the highwayman gallopped up to it, and I saw it stop. After that he rode away; I went up to the post-chaise, and asked the ladies if that man had robbed them, but they were affrighted, and could not give me an answer ; I went after him, and pursued him. Meeting a gentleman, I asked him to lend me his horse, or help me to pursue the highwayman; said he, I have no arms. I met other people on the road, and a little farther I found a pistol on the heath, and took it up: this gave me courage to pursue him. I went by the house upon Hounslow-Heath, and he went towards the Thames, but his horse would not go over. I then presented the pistol to the highwayman, and he cried out, Pray don't pursue me, I am an unfortunate tradesman ; said I, If you'll give me my money again, I'll let you go. To this he replied, I have no money, I have flung it into the water; but I have got a gold watch, and if you will shoot your pistol off, I will come to you and give it you. No, I said, I will not, but I will put it into my pocket; adding, as you be a good fellow, I will treat you with a bottle of wine ; he replied, I will go with you. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260024"/> we came to the King's Arms I took him by the right hand, and said, you are my prisoner. He gave his horse a spur and snap'd his pistol, but it did not go off, then he took the other and shot himself dead. I was very sorry that the man should do so, and went to the constable, but he did not understand me. They said, as the man is dead you have no business with it, and asked me no questions, so I said nothing of the watch: When I came home I went to a coffee-house in Long-acre and asked for the Daily Advertiser, there I saw the paragraph about a dead highwayman. I said, I was the man that pursued him, and he gave me a gold watch. I said, if I could not find it I would leave it there to be advertised, but in a little time I found it advertised, and then I said, I would go to the watchmaker, or the gentleman that it belonged to. From thence I went to a perriwig-maker and he dressed my hair. There I shew'd him the watch, and told him I had it of a highwayman. After that I shew'd it in Exeter-street to Mrs. Preston, then I came to Mr. Dunlop's shop, shew'd him the Advertiser and watch, and said, I had it of a highwayman that shot himself dead. He said, the gentleman is in the country. I replied, I will leave it here. Then he sent for the gentleman. I went with him and gave the watch to the gentleman in black clothes, and he gave me a note to go to a gentleman to take the reward. I gave them directions to my landlord, and my name. I thought it was doing justice to your country in pursuing the highwayman.</p>

            . I was attacked in a post-chaise by a single highwayman, which by report was the man that shot himself on the twelfth of this month. There was a gentleman rode up to me, I saw the sleeve of his coat, and was so affrighted when he asked me if I had been robbed that I could not make him an answer. He said he would pursue the villain, or the man.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-house in Long-acre. The prisoner came to my house on the thirteenth of October, about eleven or twelve o'clock. He called for a dish of coffee, then took the papers in his hand and read a paragraph about a highwayman that shot himself. Said he, this man I pursued, he had stopped a post-chaise in which were some ladies. After which he rode up to the post-chaise, and said, he would pursue him. He did, and the highwayman dropped his pistol. Then he picked it up and came up to him, and told him he would have his money again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by that?</p>
               <p>Guy. The money that he had robbed him of. The other told him he had dropped it, but would give him a gold watch to make him amends if he would not pursue him any further. Then he said, put up your pistol, and he put it up. Then the prisoner said, we will go and drink a glass of wine together, thinking to coaks him. When they came into the town he called, stop highwayman ; then the man took a pistol and shot himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask your advice?</p>
               <p>Guy. He shewed the watch, and asked me whether I knew if it was advertised. I told him there had been several, and one something like it, so I gave him some papers to look over. He said, I should be glad to find it, and if I do not. I will leave it here to be advertised. I said, you may do as you please for that. In about a quarter of an hour he found the advertisement and shewed it me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260025"/> it answered to the watch; then he offered me six-pence for the Advertiser. I said, the paper is more to me, because gentlemen will want it. Then he said, I will bring it again, so he took it with him.</p>

On the 17th of September, about nine o'clock, the prisoner was at my house, he called for a pint tankard of beer and a welch rabbit, there was one Mr. West with him, I brought him a silver salt and a pepper caster. There were some other gentlemen wanted a welch rabbit, and my servant carried them. He went to take the things away from the prisoner's table and missed the pepper caster. I made a strict inquiry, the gentlemen said, they would search each other. I stood close by the prisoner, saw him put his hand into his left hand pocket and shove something down; then we searched him and found it put through his pocket into the lining.</p>

He went into a little room by himself, rung the bell, and called for a pint of beer. It was brought him, after that he rung again, and desired paper, pen, and ink; it was brought to him. I went into the room then, and in about a quarter of an hour he rang the bell a third time. Then he asked me if I would carry a letter to Hay's coffee house, and bring an answer. I carried a letter; it was directed on the outside for Mr. Hays. He had been master of the house. I carried the letter, and delivered it to the gentlewoman of the house. She broke it open, and gave it to a gentleman there to read it. He found a bill in it; I was standing in the room, and heard it read. I remember one part of it was to send two guineas by the bearer, and to have a little watch ready for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260027"/> him against the Monday following. The gentlewoman said, she would send none. She did not know the gentleman, and inquired of me what sort of a man he was I told her as far as I could. She bid me tell him to come to her.

             I live at Hays's coffeehouse in Southampton Buildings. On Saturday the 16th the soldier brought a letter directed to Mr. Hays. He came from the alehouse where we fetch our beer. I opened it and gave it to Mr. Gunter to read, it was such small writing I could not. He read it, and asked me if I knew one Werge ? I said no, I did not. Then I put on my spectacles and read it ; I then sent the soldier to bid the gentleman come to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the letter that is produced which the soldier brought?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Bly. I believe it is, but can't be positive; Mr. Gunter took it and shewed it to other gentlemen in our house, and it was out of my hands, I believe, for ten minutes. The prisoner came to me about ten minutes after I sent for him. I told him there was a gentleman in the other room that went to school with Mr. Rivington, and said the indorsement was not his hand writing. The prisoner said, only let me have two guineas till Monday, and I'll come and take it up again; he urged there is Mr. Rivington's hand writing for the acceptance of it, saying he was going into the country. Mr. Gunter sent the letter and bill by a porter to Mr. Rivington; the porter return'd and delivered them to him again, and he kept them till my husband came home. Then he gave them to him, and my husband has had them till he delivered them to Mr. Rivington.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bly. When did you deliver it to Mr. Rivington?</p>
               <p>Bly. I deliver'd it to him on the Monday morning, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Bly. When did the soldier deliver it to you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bly. I believe about eight at night, Sept. the 16th, and I immediately delivered it to Mr. Gunter. I heard the prisoner tell Mr. Rivington in my house, that he saw Mr. Wilson write

On the Monday morning following I came to town, and was advised to go after it; for Mr. Bly had been at my house on the Sunday to desire I would go to his house on Monday. I went, and there Mr. Gunter and he told me what I need not repeat here. I asked where this bill was? Mr. Bly came down stairs and gave me this letter and this bill, which I read. He told me it was brought to Mrs. Bly by a soldier in the neighbourhood; they went and fetched him. I asked him how he came by it? He said he had it of a gentleman at the Two Blue Posts in Southampton Buildings. I called for a constable, but could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260028"/> get one immediately.

I was before my Lord-Mayor; there the prisoner said, he was the very person that had taken the oath he was at Rotterdam in Holland on the first of January, 1747, and was discharged by the Fugitive Act thereupon, and that he would stand by it he was the person that was cleared. I was with Mr. Smith at Montgomery's house, in Fox's Lane in Shadwell, on the 31st of December, 7, where we had three eighteenpenny bowls of punch in his back room. He made it himself, and drank with us. I well remember it from several reasons; one is, that one

            , who is now in Court, had been under misfortunes, and I supplied him with money to carry on a law suit. It was his birthday, he came to me there, and desired I would let him have a little money to keep his birthday. To the best of my knowledge, when I came away, it might be near eleven o'clock at night, and I am sure the prisoner was in the house then. And another circumstance I remember it by is this; I served the prisoner with bread, and I ordered our people not to call any more with bread till I went to ask him for money, which I did that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Mr. Ward there?</p>
               <p>Weymore. No, I do not. I received a summons to appear among the rest of the creditors, but I have had my debt a good while ago; Mrs. Montgomery satisfied me by a note of hand of a sailor's, he came home, and I soon got my money, as I said I knew he was at home, and would oppose his being cleared.</p>

            . I remember in 47, the last day of the year, I happened to go to Mr. Weymore's house to ask for him, and was directed to the Highlander, the house of the prisoner; there he was in a little back room, and in going in I followed Mr. Montgomery up the steps, who had a bowl of punch in his hand, going into the room. This was about seven o'clock at night. I told Mr. Weymore I wanted a little money, and he let me have a shilling. Some time after this I said to Mr. Weymore, They say that Mr. Montgomery is going to be cleared by the Act, and was going to mention this; but he replied, Hold your tongue, I am satisfied.</p>

            . I was in Montgomery's house on the 31st of December (the 27th being on a Sunday) in the evening, and remember there was a young man, with whom I drank slip, and that he and I proposed to fight, but I being in liquor, the people would not let me fight; then I proposed to meet on the Thursday night following, which was December 31, 1747, and I went accordingly. There was Mr. Montgomery, he was pleased to say to me, he never knew I was a fighting man before. I then went backwards, and saw Mr. Weymore, sitting with his back to the partition, drinking of punch; I staid there, and drank the old year out, and the new one in.</p>
               <p>Isabella Hannah. I was servant to Mr. Montgomery in December, 1747, and he was then at home. I do not remember seeing any of these people there, as they mention, but I know the prisoner was at home on Newyear's day and Christmas day. I left them a fortnight after Newyear's day, and he was at home on my leaving the house.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Murrey. I lived in Fox's Lane when Mr. Montgomery did, next door but one to him, and remember he was at home in the year 1747; he did not come much out, but did not mind me as a neighbour. I know I saw him at home on the latter end of December, and the beginning of January; I did not go in very often ; it was said he was abroad by all the neighbours, but I know he was not.</p>

No, answered he. I am forty for that, says I: to which he replied, I do not want to take his life from him, and if he will pay me one half down, and give me good security for the rest, I'll acquit him.</p>

            . I am father to the deceased, and live near the Broad-way, Westminster. I was out on the 26th of September, and when I came home in the evening I was told, my son had received a very bad cut on his head. On the second day he did not appear to be so bad, so that I did not take so much notice of it. In three or four days he began to complain of having a violent pain where he had the cut on his head, and was very bad; he also complained of sickness. I did not see the wound till about five days after it was given.</p>

               <p>T. Davise. He was fourteen years of age. He was dressed in bed on Sunday morning, and never got out of bed afterwards. He died the twelfth of October of that blow he received, I apprehend, being in perfect health before, and as fine a youth as ever stood upon the earth.</p>

            . I am almost sixteen years of age. Lowdey and I were playing at top on the 26th of September, about eleven or twelve o'clock at noon, in the Swish-yard. After he had taken his spin he took up a piece of tyle, and said, which of them can I hit, meaning two or three children with Davise at play in a different company from us. Davise was winding up his top going to spin it, Lowdey threw the tyle directly and it hit Davise on the forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he declare at the time who he threw it at?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he aimed at any particular person ?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No, I did not, but to see which he could hit. As soon as it hit him, Davise put his hand to his forehead and ran home. I saw Davise the day after that looking out at the window, and I saw him the day after out in the street going of an errand. I asked him how his wound did, and he said, he thought a little better. I did not see him after till he was dead. The piece of tyle was produced in court, and was almost with three equal angles, each angle about an inch and a half long.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance was the prisoner from the deceased when he threw the tyle.</p>
               <p>Robertson. About twenty yards, or a little better. As he was a youth and might not well understand how to describe it by yards, he was asked to describe it by directing from the bench to the court-yard, he made choice of a distance seemin gly near the same number of yards.</p>

            . I am fourteen years of age come the fourth of April. I was at play with Lowdey, when he had had his spin he took up a tyle, and said, which of them can I hit, there were Davise and two or three more together. He threw it, as soon as it hit Davise, Lowdey left his half-penny on the ground to Robertson and I, so ran home, and bid us say nothing. We three were playing for a halfpenny a game.

            . I shall be 14 years old in July. I was in company with Lowdey, Robertson, and Wood, I did not see Davise come into the yard, but I saw him in the yard. As soon as Lowdey had had his spin he took up a tyle that lay just by him, and said, which of them can I hit. He flung the tyle, I did not see it hit Davise, but I saw him put his hand to his forehead and run home directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sling it in anger?</p>
               <p>Babby. No, Sir, there were two or three with Davise.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Davise and Lowdey play together?</p>
               <p>Babby. No, never in my life. Lowdey left a halfpenny, and said, don't tell any body and I will leave that for you, meaning Robertson and Wood. I saw Davise the next day in the street, he play'd, but he did not look so well as before. I never saw him after that till he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it thrown in anger ?</p>
               <p>Babby. No, I don't think he went to hurt Davise any more than any body else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hethfield. I think it was on the 26th of September, the deceased came to my house with a small wound, not above half an inch in length, on the left side of his forehead a little above the temples, about twelve o'clock. I searched it with my probe, and at that time I thought there was very little danger in it (but wounds in the head are always in danger). He was at my house the Tuesday was se'nnight after the wound was given, or the Wednesday, to be dressed. I know in which time the wound looked excessive well, and I imagined it would do very well. It was about eight or nine days before I saw any symptoms that was dangerous. I was sent for to him, he was then in bed, but even then the wound looked well, his pulse was a little quick and disordered. I found the membrane that covered the bone had been wounded and putrified, and left some part of the bone bare. I did not perceive the wound on the bone when I first prob'd it, but the ninth day I plainly could perceive the wound had penetrated to the bone, and I could feel a little indention, an unevenness, or roughness, as if the bone had been wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine that was the original wound, or subsequent?</p>
               <p>Hethfield. I am pretty well assured it came from the original blow. The blow did not go oblique but downright. I believe originally all was cut through. I attended him to his death. I was desired before the justice to give my opinion, which I did, that he would do well, but at that time would not take upon me to swear that he would ; upon which the boy was committed to Bridewell. In about four or five days after he took to his bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260032"/> and grew very bad. Then I apprehended him to be in great danger, and called in some assistance in the profession, Mr. Baker and Mr. Westbrook. It was their and my opinion, that the deceased should be trepan'd, and I performed the operation. He produced a piece of the scull, on which appeared a little scratch. This I suppose to be done with the tyle, I perceiv'd it when it was in the head, it was immediately under the wound. He lived about four or five days after this, but afterwards I could see but little hopes of his recovery, for between the scull and the dura mater there was a quantity of matter. Two days after it was thought necessary to trepan him a second time. I took another piece of the scull out, where that matter came from. He produces that. This had received no wound; it was the opinion of us three to cut through the dura mater, and lay the brain bare. We did so, and got a great quantity of matter out. He lived about three days after this, and then died; upon which the coroner's inquest sat on the body. Then I sawed off part of the scull, and opening the head, found immediately under where the wound was. There was a great deal of matter congealed between the brain and the dura mater. The other side of the brain was quite clear, and had no inflammation.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the whole, what is your opinion was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Heathfield. I believe the original wound was the occasion of it; this might occasion a concussion of the brain by the smartness of the blow. I have seen numbers of instances, where, tho' there were no fractures on the head, people have died, and have had no symptoms for three weeks after receiving the blow.</p>

I said to my wife, it is pity to let her go out at this time of night, fearing she should get into bad hands; we'll contrive and make her up a bed to night. We did, with a sack, one blanket , one sheet, some fowl clothes, a pillow, and things that we could spare. We went to bed just about nine o'clock. I saw the prisoner in bed, and wished her a good night. I double lock'd my own room door, but left the key in the door.

I took her up stairs and gave her a breakfast; I was washing. She said she would help me, which she did accordingly. Upon this she dined with me. She then said, she would stay till my husband came home, which he did about eight o'clock. The rest as her husband had before deposed.

On Tuesday the 10th of this month, master, mistress, and all the family, went from our house at Chelsea, in the evening, to London; there was nobody in the house but the prisoner and I, besides a little child about three years and a half or four years old. I went to bed about eleven, and, as near as I can guess, about twelve the prisoner came to bed to me, and with his pulling me I awaked and struggled with him as long as I could. No person could ever struggle more than I did to get away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did you lie?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I lay in the kitchen all the while I lived there. He did me no harm in the kitchin, upon my word. I ran from him about four o'clock, or a little after, in the morning, up a pair of stairs as high as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he naked, or had he his cloaths&gt; on?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. He was naked in bed, and had nothing on but his shirt. He got in while I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he used to lie?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. He usually lay in the hall. He followed me up stairs immediately. There he insisted upon lying with me. I begged it as a favour, with good words, that he'd go away. He said said, he would lie with me; we were both naked at that time. There was a bed in the room; he got me into the bed by violence, under the clothes; I called out. There he had carnal knowledge of my body, without my consent; upon my oath it was not with my consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I was very wet and very bad. My body was penetrated.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in bed before he had knowledge of your body?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I believe not a quarter of an hour; it was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out in the kitchin?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I did, and above stairs too, but there was no help near. I applied to Mr. Brown, a lawyer, the next day in the morning, and told him how I had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not apply that very day?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I could not, because there was nobody to take care of the house but myself. I can't say he beat or abused me that way.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said, she had lived ten months in the family; that during the time till this affair they had lived together as fellow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260034"/> servants in good harmony; that there was one

            , a fellow servant. That she had no regard for either any more than fellow servants. That she had never declared to any person that she had had improper familiarity with either of them. Being asked whether she had not owned she had with Lisk, to Mrs. Johnson, she answered, she never did say so, and if Mrs. Johnson is willing to say that she has said so, she is welcome; be it to her conscience. That Mrs. Johnson's child lay with her that night; that she does not know what the prisoner was left at home for; that Lisk lay at the bottom of a long field; that after the child was in bed, she sat up a little time; that she said she was cold after supper, and the prisoner offered her a dram, and she refused it; that she drank a little rum and water in a silver cup, which he gave her; that this was in the hall, where she unpinned her handkerchief and gown only, then went into the kitchin and went to bed; that he had business to do in the kitchin, and was backwards and forwards after she was in bed; that he was only in his shirt when he came into bed; that he was in bed with her from about twelve to four. He behaved in a very rough manner there, but no harm done. The child slept all the while, for what she knew; that she struggled as much as possible to keep him off; that she cried out above 3 times; that she was a chaste virgin before that night; that there was a lock upon the dining-room door, and the door where she ran to up stairs had only a button on the inside, by which she thought to secure herself, but he was at the top of the stairs as soon as she; that she endeavoured to hinder his putting her into the bed; that he put her in between the sheets; that before the bed was not turned down, as she believes, but said she was in such an agony and fright, she could not tell exactly as to such things; that when she was in bed, it was past her strength to get away from him; that what he did was against her will in any consideration whatsoever; that she could struggle no longer, and did not consent. Being asked if he laid violent hands on her, she replied no more than to get his will of her; that he lay with her but a very little time after he had got his end; that when the gardner and coachman knocked at the window, about six, he went away from her; and she, at the same time, was in a great agony, crying; that she does not know whether, just at that time, he was in the bed with her or no; that she came down into the kitchin quick after him; that not he, but she, opened the door to let them in; that she had put on only one petticoat in the kitchin before she opened the door; that immediately after she went up into the room above stairs, but could not tell for what. Being asked whether it was to put the bed to rights; she replied it was not. That the prisoner came down, and went to his own bed; that the prisoner got up, went to town, and left them together; that she told Lisk of it, soon after which the coachman was brewing; that she went to Mr. Brown, a lawyer, the next day, by Lisk and Mr. Saunderson's advice ; that she made no complaint to master and mistress, and that Mr. Brown told her it was better to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Being asked what she told the justice about marks of lost virginity, she replied: She said there were none, which she said she meant upon the sheets, but she found such on her own linnen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge I have laid with her in common. Here is a witness that has seen me in bed with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. M - . The prisoner has behaved extremely honest ever since I have known him. I have trusted him with large sums of money. I cannot conceive he would force a woman. I once went into the kitchin, about two o'clock in the morning, and called him by name; I saw him get off of the bed, but whether he was in bed or not I know not; she said, as he got off of the bed, Richard, how can you do so? I was before Justice Fielding; there she swore there were no marks of lost virginity. I do not remember whether she said upon the sheet or shift, but in general; and there also I think she said he had his clothes on while in the kitchin, and that he struggled with her between four and five hours. I am certain of this, as I am of any thing in the world. Then she said she got from him, and he undressed himself before he went up stairs to her. This she swore there. She likewise said he was with her a little better than an hour up stairs. The justice asked her how he came to leave her so soon; her expression was, she would not let him stay any longer.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examina tion he said, He had known the prisoner to be in the kitchin, where she lay, frequently at late hours, after she was in bed, for things he has wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. N - . I was before Justice Fielding on the 17th of October, and among other questions, Mr. Fielding asked her if he was naked in the bed in the kitchin; she said he was not, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260035"/> in his clothes; and that after she went up stairs, he went into his own room, undressed himself, and went up stairs naked. She likewise added, he lay with her an hour and a quarter up stairs, and that he would have lain longer, but she would not let him. He also asked her if there were marks of lost virginity, either on the linnen, or sheets; in the alternative, she did declare there were not. This question was asked upon her saying she was a perfect virgin before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Johnson. I have lived twelve months in the family the 30th of July. I had been at Rotherhithe, and when I came home this girl was crying. I asked her what she cried about; she replied she had with John ; I asked her how she came to be so foolish as to pitch upon such a fellow as he; she answered, she had passed many a favourable opportunity before, but could not account for this. I told her that I supposed it was not the first time; to which she replied, I never have lain with any but him, and I would not have my mother know it for the world.</p>
