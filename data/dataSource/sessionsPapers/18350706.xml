St. Luke's is in the peculiar of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, in all cases of practlee—I have no means of judging but by the rules of the Court, in taking out administration—I was employed with my father to take out letters of administration to Henry Roberts, deceased, with the will annexed—I produce the letters of administration, with the will annexed, which were extracted by us—they are issued from the Registry of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, as the peculiar is exempt from the jurisdiction of the diocesan, from the circum<lb/>stance of the deceased being possessed of property both within and without the peculiar—he left bona notabilia, within the province of the Archbishop of Canterbury—the letters of administration are dated 16th of May, 1835.</p>

               <p>the ordinary in the jurisdiction of dioceses in England; but I am not prepared to state whether there are not exceptions to that—the deanery is an exclusive jurisdiction, and I am not aware whether the officer bears the name of ordinary; the ordinary is an official character, which so seldom occurs to us, that I am not prepared to sat who is the ordinary—Doctor Lushington is commissary—I do not believe there is an officer bearing the appellation of ordinary in this case; but there may be.</p>

I saw the pri<lb/>soner on Saturday, the 20th of June in the custody of John Fowler, a constable of Tottenham—I saw Mr. Douglass about an hour after I first, a saw the prisoner—I had heard of his loss, and seen an advertisement in the Times newspaper—when Mr. Douglass came, I took him to the lock-up room, and soon as the prisoner came out of the room, I asked Mr. Douglass if he knee him he said, yes, he did Mr. Douglas asked him if he knew him, he said no he could not recollect him—Mr. Doug<lb/>lass asked him if he remembered being in Claremont square, on the 12th of June; he said, yes, he remebered it Mr. Dougless asked him if he knee any thing of his spectacles he said, when the left Mr. Doug lass's house he had know spectacles in his hand—Mr. Douglass said, "That is very likely but you had them somewhere else"—the prisoner said, he went to an inn, some time after leaving Mr. Douglass's house and he pulled off his hat to take his handkerchief out to wipe his face for he was very hot and a pair of spectacles and a pen dropped from his hat on his feet, on the ground—I then asked the prisoner what he had done with the spectacles—he said he had pawned them—I asked him where the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Chichester-place Gray's-inn-lane. On Friday evening the 12th of June the prisoner pawned these spectacles—no conversation passed between us about them—he gave his name a Mr. Brown, Regent-street—I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—I was not at home when he first came with the officer—he came twice—I delivered the spectacles to the officer.</p>

               <p>The prisoner being called on for his defence made a long and uncon<lb/>nected address the purport of which is as follows:—That on Mr. Douglass entering the room, he (the prisoner) had his hat in his hand—upen Mr. Doug lass asking what was his pleasure, he put his hat on the table; and during part of the conversation, Mr. Douglass, whom he understood to have been affected with palsy, stood shaking something in his hand (he could not tell whether it was the spectacles or not) very near the edge of his hat, ap<lb/>pearing much agitated and angry and treated him very unkindly—the prisoner stood, with his hat on the table and took his handkerchief from his hat (as was his invariable custom when he went into a room) to wipe his face, and either placed his handkerchief on the side of his hat or into it the prosecutor then wiped at his book, and treated him very abruptly—on which the prisoner immediately left and he belived he slammed the door harder than he should have done, feeling displessed at his reception—that he had been calling for two hours and a half on other gentlemen in the neighbourhood for the purpose of soliciting sub<lb/>scriptions; and called at some houses afterwards—In an hour and a half or two hours he called at a public-house for a glass of beer, and on plac<lb/>ing his hat on the table took his handkerchief from it and wiped his face and the spectacles dropped out—whether Mr. Douglas had accidentally placed them there, are whether he (the prisoner)had taken them up with his handkerchief (they having single arms) he could not tell; but he had since tried the experiment, and at the very fast trial they clung to the handker chief that upon finding them, he called and some of the houses in the neighbourhood he had been to, but could not find an owner for the spectacles; being unacquainted with the neighbourhood, he did not know all the places he had been to—he immediately went to the first pawnbro<lb/>ker's shop which was not above One hundred yards and pledged them not because he was in want of money, but knowing he was coming to the neighbourhood again, he thought he should be able to find the owner-that on arriving at home he stated these circumstances to his wife and gave her</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the counting-house when the prisoner came to the shop—I went into the shop—he chose different sorts of biscuits, and begged them to be sent, about six o'clock, to Mr. Cotton's, 8, Stratford-place—while I was packing them up, he went into the parlour, and was speaking to my father—I followed, after finishing the biscuits, and found my father was changing the cheque—I advised him not to do it, in consequence of my suspicions on looking at the cheque, as the date was altered—any father said he thought it was good, and gave him the change—as the prisoner left, he said, "Be sure to send the biscuits by six o'clock"—I wished to go to the banker's immediately with the cheque—I went to Bosanquet's, where it was refused—I returned home, and mentioned it to my father, and went immediately to Stratford-place, to Mr. Cotton, and made inquiry—I met the prisoner accidentally about six weeks afterwards—he was on the opposite side of the way, in Regent-street—I recognised him immediately, but allowed him to pass me—he stopped, and looked in at a shop window—I passed him, then turned round, and found he had turned back—I turned into Castle-street, and saw him drinking a glass of beer at the bar of a public-house—I could not have a distinct view of him there, and let him come out again—he crossed over, and I saw that it was him—I followed him to Prince's-street, Cavendish-square—I touched him on the shoulder, and said I wanted him—he turned round, appeared rather confused, and said, "What for?"—I said, I dare say he knew—he said, "Let me go?"—I said no, I wished him to come to Oxford-street with me—he drew a paper from his pocket, which appeared the same sort of paper as the cheque was written on—I said, "You have got another of them, I suppose?"—he said, "Of what?"—I said, "You know very well"—he then put it into his pocket—a cab came by shortly afterwards—I asked the cabman to come down, as I wanted to speak to him, and in that time he put the paper into his mouth, and swallowed it—several people came round—I begged him to show what he was eating, but he would</p>

I looked at him and said nothing—he said, "Can't you let me go?"—I said, "If I let you go, I shall lose my situation, and then we shall neither of us have a situation"—I asked where he lodged—he would not bear again—I said nothing more to him but took him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29. Cockspur-street. The prisoner lived with my father; his name is John Lambe—we had missed several things—I got a search-warrant—my mother searched the prisoner's box when she was going away, but she had taken away a bundle, and we went to her apartments—I searched that bundle—that was at No. 3, Marketplace—the officer, the evening before, watched her home—she came to our house the morning following—I went with the officer, and found the bundle there—I found a brooch—this locket is mine—It was found in her box at our house—the shirt was found at the pawnbroker's; it is mine—I missed both these articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, reconsider that answer of yours. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might, perhaps, while I was at work—he might have come to me with the pot, and asked me to drink, and that like, but they never asked me to pay any thing—I might have drank out of one or two pots—I swear that I did not drink out of half a dozen—I did not see the prisoner go out or come back, but I missed it as soon as he was gone out, and ten minutes after I had been using it—I did not drink with the prisoner at night, but I might in the course of the day—I was working till four o'clock—I did not drink with him after he came back—nor at all after four o'clock—I might have drank a pint, but I paid for it—I do not know whether Jacob collison was there in the afternoon but I will swear he was not there after four o'clock—It struck me that the prisoner had gone to pawn the saw—I went round to the pawn broker's, to see if he had, and then I came back and had a little more—I cannot say how many pints I had that day—the prisoner was fresh—we paid for the beer we had—I had one pint after we had found about the saw—I then went to the station-house, after eight o'clock—five or six of us went, and had two pots of half—I was not tipsy.</p>

In consequence of information, I took the prisoner into custody on the 19th of June at Graves<lb/>end—I did tell him the charge—I searched him, and found two keys on him—one was the of a carpet-bag, and the other of some drawers I was searching the drawers, and said, "I do not find what I want"—he said, "You will come to it presently. "and the bottom of the drawer I found a carpet-bag—key opened it, and I found 31 soverigns, three £4 notes, and a 1000 franc note—I found a pair of mustachios in a pocket book in the pocket of the coat which hung up in the room, and he had a dark wig on at the time I apprehended him; and I found in the drawers some dye for the hair (<hi rend="italic">cheque read.</hi>)</p>

I am a private in the Royal Marines, I was going into the barracks about one o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of June—there was a row at Deptford Dock-yard gate—the deceased, Howarth Tomason, who was a marine, was in the row—I Saw the prisoner, Carter, strike him with his fist—Tomason was taking his own part as well as he could—they were fighting—I went to take his part, and they struck me—I do not know who struck me—I was knocked down three or four times—I saw Howarth Tomason knocked down once—I made my escape, to get to the gate, to call the sentry—there were seven or eight persons there—I called the sentry and he called the corporal's guard to open the gate—they let me in, and would not let me out again—the corporal's guard went out—Howarth Tomason was fighting; Carter struck him once—there was some woman there, but I do not know who it was—I was not <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> to her—I asked what was the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—they said what was it to me—I do not know who said so—I was sober; I had had a little to drink—I had leave of absence form the barracks that night—Howarth Tomason was brought in about five minutes after I got in—he was just alive, but he died as soon as they got him into the guard-room—that is all I have to tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Wellington-place, Deptford, I passed the Navy Arms at form twenty minutes to a quarter to one o'clock that morning—I did not go in—there were two men and a woman at the door—Fern hailed me, and the other man and woman came down off steps—a soldier was there, who attempted to take liberties with the woman—she said, "I do not want any thing to do with you, I have got my man, and am going home with him"—another soldier then came down King-street, and passed me, and, as far as I could recognise his features, that was the deceased—but before he came up this man, and woman and the soldier were engaged in some way, but I cannot say how, not being at that moment paying attention—the second soldier that came up said, "Do not knock my comrade about, he is drunk, and I am sober; I am a Lanca<lb/>shire man, and will fight his battles"—then there was a general row—some party, I do not know who, made use of indecent expressions, and I retreated, not expecting to see any more—several persons then came out of the Dock-yard—I cannot say that I saw any more, but I heard some falls, and I think blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said the soldier attempted to take liberties with the woman, explain that more fully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was pulling her about, and taking hold of her gown, and then the row began—I did not see any body knocked down, but I heard three distinct falls—I could not see it, there was an im<lb/>perfect</p>

               <p>light. I should think I was twenty yards off—I heard a man sing out "They have got hold of * * *"—the soldiers were close about him at the time—I then saw a soldier get up, or assisted up, and be reeled across the road towards the Griffin, (I believe it is)—It was shut up—he made a circle round and it I had not got out of his way he would have knocked me down—he fell against the curb—he had appeared sober when he passed me in the first place—there was a woman there, but I do not know who she was—I saw her kick the man who fell at my feet—she kicked him in his right side, I believe—he was on his face or nearly so—he might be a little on his left side—I saw blood on the deceased before he fell and before she kicked him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you rightly through the whole transaction there were only two marines engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw only two—the night was dark but I could see soldiers—I did not recognise the wit<lb/>ness, Wilton—I cannot say whether the woman was trying to get the man to come home—I do not know Carter, but by the manner of the man com<lb/>ing down the step, I should say he was drunk—It was not the soldier nor Fern—I should say that the man was not in a condition to have in<lb/>flicted a severe injury on any one—I saw the soldier who had been taking liberties with the woman follow her from the public-house and she remon<lb/>strated with him—I do not know whether she gave him a slap on the face—the deceased then came up—my eyes were then turned off, and when I turned again I saw the man reeling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the deceased came up to the place where the man and woman were did the deceased endeavour to get at that man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the woman was between them I saw the man's arm strike and the soldier's arm strike, each arm met—the man had not given the soldier any offence that I saw—the first soldier who was there was drunk—the woman had not done anything to the deceased—after that I saw the man and the deceased struggle together—the deceased then reeled towards the post—he then reeled a considerable distance and fell on his head the woman then kicked him—he never got up till he was carried into the bar<lb/>racks—his head fell towards my feet—It was in the middle of the road; there were stones there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the victualling-yard. I saw the de<lb/>ceased in the barrack-room; my opinion was that he might die from concussion of the brain, or infusion of blood within the skull or from both these causes conjoined; and the post mortem examination confirmed my opinion—the body was generally healthy and the viscera of the abdomen was healthy; there were two bruises on the legs, but no other external marks—those bruises would not have caused death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think if he had died from a kick on the side, there must have been some marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not say that; a kick might have oc<lb/>casioned could not see it—I think it probable that he died from the effusion of blood within the skull but how that was occasioned I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The effusion of blood was quite distinct and apart from any external injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a severe fall, with his head on the stones, would most certainly have produced such an effusion of blood within the skull—I saw nothing in his appearance or on the post mortem examination, from the appearance of the viscera of the abdomen, which could lead me to the conclusion that the effusion of blood proceeded from a kick.</p>

Burkett—William Rapey, one of my carmen was to bring them home—on the 16th he was sent with the ori<lb/>gineal order for six quarters, and one the 22nd he brought six quarters more home—he brought no more of them—eight were left behind—this attracted my attention, and I asked Charles Mann why the remainder of the beans lying at Burkett's were not fetched home el—they had been deposited at Bur ges's Wharf, at Horsely down—Charles Mann replied, "We have had them home, Sir"—I said, "Then why is not the book filled up, in which they should have been entered?—he said, "I do not know, Sir nut I will see to it"—I had the book at the time in the counting house—I asked him who brought them home—he said, "Castles, Sir, "who is one of my carmen—I sent Castles to Burgess 'next day; and, in consequence of what passe, Owen Carty came to me—he is a servant of Burgess', and I sent him to william Manu's house, in White cross street, in company with Rapey—this was on</p>

               <p>I preferred this indictment—I should have prosecuted the prisoners inde<lb/>pendent of such a letter—I had about 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which stood to the credit of Charles in my books, when I prosecuted him—I was paying him interest for it—that money is still in my hands—about four weeks' salary was due to him, amounting to abut 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he has not had it—he robbed me of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that month—I did dot owe him 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—there was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the cash box when he left—I presume it is mine—I t was remitted from his cousin from Huntington, about four days before his apprehension—I have ascertained that—I knew that at the last trial, but not before—the notes were traced—I knew it at the Mansion house s—I have see the letter which brought the money—he must have robbed me of it to lend it to his cousin—he has been in my service about eleven year—when he first came to me. I 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and gave him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1831, and from tha t time, he received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition, I belive, at the end of each year. because I thought then he was a good servant—there was a hors e and gig of his on my premises when he was taken into custody—the gig is still there—I ordered the horse to be sold—I have got the money—the gig has never been used—he had no hay or straw on my premises, that I know of—all the hay and straw on my premises were my own—I charged him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the keep of his horse—I always deducted that when we settled—the 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was an accumulation of his income which he requested I would oblige him y keeping a t interest—I think I have a right to state that in 1827 I lent him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to redeem the mortgage of his wife's annuity; he gradually discharged that half yearly, and finished it in 1830; and from that time to the present—he has been gradually accumulating at about the same rate—he told me his wife's annuity was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but I believe it has never exceeded 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for several years—there were eight loads of hay and clover in Nottage's yard, opposite my stable, that was mine; for my men, employed by the pri<lb/>soner to unload it, will prove they saw him pay for it out of my iron chest—Nottage has since given it me, and I have sold it—I did not know this at the time I took him in custody—I learnt it within two or three days after<lb/>wards—I have not prosecuted him for that—I have never been officially applied to by the trustees for the money deposited in my hands—about the 12th of March, his brother, Edward Mann, Called on me, and told me, for the first that his brother wiliam ands himself were trustees for all Charles property; an he at that time acknowledge his brother had robbed me to a large extent—he did not demand the 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he wanted to know if I could settle the matter r with him—as his brother was prosecuted, whether I could not give up a portion of the property for the benefit of the family—I Said decidedly not—I said, "Edward Mann, expect you as a branch of the family, as a respectable man, to make me restitution to a large amount—all in your power"—I preferred my indictment it must be on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th of May—the first letter written to my solicitor I believe was not a demand for the money.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has William Mann dealt with your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About there years—I should think he has had dealing with us to the amount of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I never knew but one instance of selling for cash to him—It is difficult to say whether he always had a receipt for it was his invariable practice to bring his money to his brother on Monday or Tuesday, when I was at market—I have seen money paid by him without a receipt being given, in one in<lb/>stance—I may have seen more—It is a very common practice to enter the payment in the cash-book before the party, and there is an end of the busi<lb/>ness—It is very likely I may have received 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; from William, without giving him a receipt for it—I very seldom received money from him myself—this was after Charles was in custody—I believe, on the 14th of February, I sold William Mann beans to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—It was three quarters, of small beans; and either I or my clerk sold him peas and other, things to the amount of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the same day—they were sold at my house; and it was when these goods were sent, that Carty was sent with them—on the 16th I sold him goods to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,; and on the 19th, to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—none of these bills of parcels are receipted—I have no doubt they have been paid—on the 12th of March he paid me 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of goods sold—this receipt corresponds with my ledger—that sum, I believe, balance the ledger, as it stands open; I having at that time refused to serve him any longer—I believe it pays for all the goods charged in my ledger, but not for those which are not charged—I had not heard of any application from the solicitor about the trust-deed at the time I refused to deal with him—I had heard nothing about the trustees, except from Edward Mann—they had not claimed the horse and gig—Edward had told me they were trustees; but he made no claim—he acted as a man ought to act—I thing the first letter from the solicitor was early in April—the conversation with Edward was about the 12th of March—I had refused to serve William any more, some time pre<lb/>vious to the payment—I indicted him about six weeks after the last pay<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said that the reason why you did not indict William at the time, was because you wanted to get your money from him, which he owed you, (the 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance)? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said, decidedly that I should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183507060080"/>
               <p>not do it till after I received his account as it stood in my ledger; stating., as a reason, that I had already been plundered of enough, without losing that; and I waited full two months after I took his brother up, as some of the depredations were committed a few days previously—I indicted him at the next sessions, after, the time had expired—I believe the goods in ques<lb/>tion were delivered on the 23d of January; but there were transactions subsequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between your receiving the 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the time in May when you in<lb/>dicted, had you not been threatened with an action from the trustees to give up the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. my solicitors had a letter, but I think was not threatened with an action—they had a letter stating that proceeding would he taken to recover the money, or something of that kind—It was after I re<lb/>ceived that intimation that I preferred this indictment—It is justice to my<lb/>self to state, that I believe I never read the last letter—this bill is Charles Mann's writing—here is on quarter of beans, which I spoke about; the price is small beans—this was on the 6th of February—I received the money for that—I believe it was 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>)—there are two items of beans; one quarter of large, and one small—these were sold to William it is dated the 6th of January—Charles Mann had full authority to write an order to Burgess's wharf for the goods—an order for eight quarters was produced before Sir John Key, at the Town-hall—It was in Charles Mann's writing if it had not been, he would have had nothing to do with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked at preferring indictments, and so on; in all you did, did you confine yourself to the advice of your solicitors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Entirely so as to the mode of proceeding—when Charles Mann entered my service, I belive he was in destitute circumstances—he presented himself to me—he was married at that time, and had three chil<lb/>dren; she has now four—I advanced his salary his gradually, up to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>and the last four years I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>as a present—he paid rent for his resi<lb/>dence at my stable—I know of no other means he had of gaining money, except his wife's annuity of from 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—when I came to examine my accounts I found a deficiency far beyond 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—full double that amount in the last year—It is not from the slightest fear of what any body can do to me, by virtue of the assignment, that I come here to-day—the bills produced to day on the prisoner's behalf, are entered in my accounts and form part of the 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he paid.</p>
