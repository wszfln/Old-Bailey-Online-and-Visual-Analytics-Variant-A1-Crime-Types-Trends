               <p>I came from Gloucester to do a job of work for the Margrave of Anspach; I went to him at Hammersmith, and I met my master the Reverend Mr. Fearon; he took me to town to the Old White Horse Cellar, the 16th of last June; I asked for some victuals and a pint of beer, and went out of the Old White Horse Cellar about a quarter before five; coming out at the door I met the prisoner; I never saw him before; I asked him the road to Albemarle-street, he said he was a stranger just come into town, but knew Albemarle-street very well, and in walking down he asked me what countryman I was; he said he was going down there, and we walked together; I told him I was a Gloucestershire man; he asked me if I knew Stroudwater, in Gloucestershire, I told him I did very well; he asked about several other village places which I did not know; he asked me about one Hickman of Gloucester: in walking 200 yards, or not so much, he was on the left hand side of me, there was a fine lady's purse on a step of a gentleman's door; he whipped round me; at that time I saw the purse; he got hold of the purse in his right hand, and slapped it into his waistcoat pocket; then he took me athwart the road, and said, as we are strangers just come into town, God, we have met with a fine prize; he took me to a publick house to have one pint of beer; I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179210310006"/>know that landlord's name; a stout lusty man in a blue coat came in, and then the prisoner pulled out the purse, and a note that was in the purse, and mentioned in the note that it was bought of a Mrs. Smith, a jeweller, a locket valued at 135 l. there was a locket in the purse, in a tortoise shell case; he said he had a friend living up higher in the street, and he asked me if I had picked it up would I have given him half? I said I should; he said he would go to his friend and fetch 20 l. and give it to me for my share, and he would take the locket; then we three went to Mr. News, the Crown in Silver-street, there he called for a quart of porter, and went into the parlour, and then he said he would step and fetch the money; the other man said he was a stranger to both of us, he thought he had a right to leave this locket, with him; then the prisoner pulled the purse out of his pocket and gave it to his companion, and went out of the room for the valuation of ten minutes, then returned, saying his friend was not at home; and he asked me what money I had in my pocket, I said I had five or six guineas, I did not know which; I pulled out my purse; I had but five guineas and three shillings; he asked me what sort of a watch I had, I told him it was almost a new one, I had just bought him, and given four guineas and a half for him; I put down the watch on the table with the five guineas, in the mean time the other man spoke to me, and the prisoner took my watch and five guineas off the table and walked off, and I never saw him any more till I came to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Before he took up the watch and the five guineas had you agreed that he was to take the watch and five guineas as part of the bargain? - No, I had no thoughts of his having my watch and money when he when out; the other man then pulled the purse out of his pocket and gave me the locket, and said he would be with me at nine o'clock, at the White Horse Cellar; he walked off, and I never saw him since; I took the locket after the prisoner was gone; nothing was said about his having my watch and money; I did not observe him take it, the other man was on the other side of the table; I saw the prisoner's hand upon the watch and money while I was talking to the other man: I went into the country and was sent for; I never saw him till he was in custody in Bow-street, about three weeks ago, since the 16th of June; I know him again; I never saw my watch and money; I have no doubt but the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you not the locket from me? - No, I had it not till after he was gone off with my watch and money.</p>
               <p>Did you say the locket was left with you as a security? - No, the other man gave me the locket to meet me again at nine o'clock (the locket produced); I did not know what it was till afterwards they said it was a diamond stone.</p>

I said yes I know you; says he, tell me where; yes, says I, I will tell you; says he, why do you not tell me; I got him out of the narrow part of the ally into Coleman-street, and laid hold of him by the collar, and I said to him you are the man that left me for dead in Stepney-fields, and robbed me; there were two draymen standing, and I charged them in the king's name to assist me; one of them collared him, and asked a boy to fetch a constable; in the course of five minutes he said, d - n you, let me go, I will go to a justice; I took him before Justice Clerk; he denied seeing me; he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, considering the distance of time ten months, and that this man's life is at stake, can you venture to swear that the prisoner is the man? - Yes, I am perfectly sure; if his head was cut off I should know it.</p>

               <p>Jury to Smallwood. Did you see a certain piece of timber of three inches broad in the hands of the prisoner? - The piece of quartering, of floor joist, he carried it away with him; I asked him to give it me to light the fire; and he said he would give it me when he came back: I never saw it again.</p>

I asked him how he came by them; he said they were made for him when he came home from sea; I thought the coat was not his size; he offered to try them on; I said, there is no occasion if they are your own.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of October I lost two hams; about a quarter before eight in the evening, the prisoner and another came and asked me for a quarter of a pound of cheese; the man threw down a shilling hard on the counter, and it fell down behind the counter; in picking up the shilling, I saw Newman was reaching something out at the door, and I could not think what it was; they were the only two hams in the shop; then Newman laid hold of another ham; as soon as I saw that, I ran round the counter, and cried stop thief! Newman ran out of the shop; they got one ham clear off, the other they dropped; I never recovered the ham again; the hams were both together in the shop, in one place; when the prisoner ran away, he ran about thirty yards; I lost sight of him; when he was brought back, I knew him to be the same man; he offered me two guineas to let him go.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for on Sunday the 12th of August, to Tattarsall's; I went and found the prisoner in the custody of Bush; the charge was that he had robbed him of eighteen guineas and a half; he said he picked his pocket in the passage of the palace, by the chapel; he said that he was hustled and that his thumb was on his purse in his pocket; that the man who picked his pocket threw it away, and another man took it; the prosecutor and another man went with me in the coach to bridewell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you any conversation with the prosecutor, at any time, respecting the reward? - Not at all to my recollection.</p>

I said not the least; I never saw him before in my life, to the best of my knowledge; on Monday he was taken before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Would you have parted with this money if it had not been through fear? - I am not subject to fear; if he had stopped me on the highway I should not have thought any thing of it; but to attack my character!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come past me three or four times and look in my face? he says never mind, you are not a native of England; what countryman are you? I said of Holland; I said I am going to Holland next Monday; he said what kind of country is that; he asked me many questions; he asked me to have some Burton and a bowl of bunch. - Not a word of the sort.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said you are rather low spirited, is there any thing in my power that I can serve you? - Never a word passed between us but what I have related.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then he laid hold of my arm, as we were walking along. - By no means, he attempted several times to take hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I should not be afraid of him, he was a true Englishman and could afford to spend a thousand guineas. - I, thinking the man was drunk, said I wish you good night, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you gave me the guinea and a half, did not you appoint me to call upon you on Monday? - By no means; before the Lord Mayor he said it was Sunday, but that was false.</p>

               <p>Lord Kenyon. I wish those pawnbrokers would bear in mind that they go on extreme slippery ground; it is expected that they take in nothing to pawn but from persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179210310037"/>whom they know, or who come recommended; I do not know how a jury would deal with such pawnbrokers if they were to be indicted for receiving stolen goods; it would be for the good sense and discretion of a jury; I should be very much inclined to think they would be convicted; it would be better for the public if the whole trade was abolished; it is high time for the legislature to bestir themselves, and do something in it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. The nature of the business you do for them is to pass their papers through the custom house? - I believe it was forty-four; I have seen their debentures in the hands of Mr. Mills, and I know this to be one of them; I cannot tell the amount of the whole forty-four; but it was a considerable sum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you known Bonus any time? - I should believe he had been about a year and a half clerk to Mr. Payne.</p>

               <p>Did you examine them? - I did, and marked them, and delivered them to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation at that time respecting them? - Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Had they any receipt on them? - They had not.</p>
               <p>Did he apply to you for payment of them? - No sir, the application was made to the treasurer.</p>
               <p>Did you recommend to him to do any thing with them? - The person who brings them to me to be marked for payment of course carries them afterwards to the treasurer of the customs for payment; this is one of them that I marked.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect whether you made any order on the teller for the payment of a debenture on the 2d of June last? - I did, in consequence of Mr. Mills having marked it; this is one of those that I made the order for; I am clerk under the receiver general.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You seeing what Mr. Mills had done, that was the foundation upon which you made the order? - I could make it no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was the debenture in the condition it is now when you made the order? - I cannot say that, I looked only at what Mr. Mills had done, and I examined it to see that the commissioners names were to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had it the acquittance of the merchant? - Yes, it had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You looked principally to Mills having done right? - No, I looked to several parts; I looked to the commissioners hands, and whether the indorsement corresponded to the commissioners order, seeing that I deemed it all right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But do you pay upon it without an acquittance purporting to be the acquittance of the person receiving the draw-back?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You ask no questions about that, you look at the instrument, if the instrument appears to be regular you then make your order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you take it to be perfect, or ever pay it unless there is an acquittance? - I always ask them to witness it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you, at the time when these debentures were tendered to you for your order, enter into any conversation with the person that produced it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Smith's receipt upon it before you made the order yourself? - Certainly, the acquittance was upon it or else I should never make an order; I make the person who brings it witness it; I was certainly satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you a recollection whether you did or did not more particularly inspect this than the other forty-three? - I looked at them all to see whether they were properly indorsed by the merchant.</p>

               <p>What time did the prisoner go away? - He was not there after the 30th of July; I did not see him till he was taken, that was in the New Prison; I believe it was about the beginning of September.</p>

               <p>He was not called upon to account particularly for this money? - It was always customary that that very day he should come down and make his receipts in our cask books; it is generally known the day he goes there for that purpose, there is no entry in the book; these debentures were in his custody, and he took them himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He was till the end of July in the constant habit of making his appearance? - Yes, there was no particular absence.</p>
               <p>A large sum of money appears to have been paid on these debentures together; does not the house look out for it? - It is a custom to leave it to the settling clerk to get up these debentures, and he applies to Mr. Costin; it is Mr. Bonus's business to look out for the first day in which they might be paid.</p>
               <p>Is it not likewise the custom of the partners to see when the day arrives to receive 1000 l? - No, Sir, the prisoner was the person; it was altogether intrusted to him to do.</p>
               <p>From the commencement of June to the end of July was no enquiry made about these debentures? - That was entirely out of my department; I do not know that any application was made to me.</p>

               <p>Will you be so good to look at that and tell us whether, in your judgment, that is the hand writing of Mr. Bonus? - I do not believe it is, from his general method of signing his name, it was much smaller, and the letters more regular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Not like what you have seen written on paper for honest purposes? - All his purposes were honest that I was concerned with him in.</p>
               <p>Did he use to write the Christian name at length? - Yes, but here it is not at length.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four more witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; on the 19th of October I remember seeing the prisoner at the bar, and served her one shawl, she did not pay for it; I had seen the prisoner at the bar once before only; she was in the shop about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; Mr. James attended her before me; during the time I was separating the shawl that she had agreed for from the rest, she drew these three shawls from off the counter on her lap; I saw her; she sat side ways, with her elbow on the counter, and she made use of her other hand to draw them off; she did it in the manner as I conceived to be concealing them, I said nothing to her on observing this; after I had cut her the shawl, she went away, and bid me good morning; I went and spoke to Mr. James; I went after her and asked her to walk back, Mr. James wanted to speak to her; I took her into the back shop, Mr. James followed, and observed to her that she had got some property that was not her own; I took the shawls from her, from underneath the cloak; I really cannot say she said any thing.

               <p>I am a poor working man, had been at the harvest at Kent, and was going down to Sussex, and as I passed through London I thought I would go to the fair and buy some wearing apparel; I had been bargaining for a pair of breeches, and pulled my purse out to pay for them, the prisoner asked me if I wanted a coat, I said I believe I should buy one before I left the fair; she said she would take me to her brother, where I should get a good one; I went, but did not like any one; I went out, and at another place was bargaining for a waistcoat, and she took the waistcoat out of my hand, and said she would double it up; I said she had no business with it, it belonged to me, so I took out my purse to pay for it, and took out the silver and put the purse into my waistcoat, and while I was feeling for three-penny-worth of halfpence, to make up the money for the waistcoat, she took the purse out of my pocket; I took hold of her hand to stop it, and a man ran between us, and I took hold of her immediately again, but the purse was gone.</p>

I am a poor girl; I have lost all the use of my limbs on one side; my business is to stop at the shop door to bring in customers; I took this man to the Ship alehouse, and he did not deal, and when he came out he bought a waistcoat, and the people were jostling him about, and I went to him to double it up and to advise him to take care of it; no, says he; you b - h, I will put it in my bag; and presently he cries out, where is the woman; that woman, says he, you b - h, you have robbed me; they took every thing off me and left me as naked as I came from my mother, to search me, and found nothing; now, gentlemen, guilty or not guilty use, your own pleasure.</p>
