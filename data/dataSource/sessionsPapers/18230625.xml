The hole was not in the roof the evening before; it was two or three yards from where the coats are kept. I missed ten coats - the bundles appeared to have been undone, and some taken from each; they were intermixed.

The scrutoire stands in the back parlour - I locked the drawer, and put the key in the bookcase, where I usually kept it, and left the book-case unlocked. Next morning about half-past seven o'clock, my son called me down - I went down into the back parlour, where the prisoner sat in a chair; my son was picking three sovereigns and a shilling off the floor - the prisoner had put his foot over them, and endeavoured to hide them under the carpet; he got up and came to me, and begged me to forgive him - I said nothing to him. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, that he would never do it any more, and would serve me night and day if I would not prosecute him. My son laid the sovereigns and the shilling on the table - I took them up, and produce them - they are three of those I put there the night before.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. I remember my father marking the money, and putting it in the scruetoire, and the key in the book-case. Next morning about half-past six o'clock, I concealed myself on the stairs, and heard the prisoner go to the workshop behind the house, then heard him go to the back parlour, and unlock the door - the key had been left in; he went in; I heard the scrutoire drawer unlocked and opened; I waited a moment, and heard it shut again, and heard the book-case door shut - I came down, and found him coming out of the parlour; I asked him what he did there - he said he was going to open the shutters; I said as he was there he might as well open them; he went and opened them. I said I was afraid he had been doing something wrong, that he had been taking money; he said, "What money?" I said I must open the drawer and see; I did so, and missed three sovereigns and a shilling - he said he knew nothing of them, that he had never taken any money. He sat on a chair; I saw him stoop, and endeavour to put something under the carpet - I stooped down, and found the three sovereigns and a shilling laying on the floor; I picked them up, laid them on the table, and charged him with taking them, which he voluntarily confessed. I had seen my father mark them, and knew them to be three of those he put there the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this - A. About half-past seven o'clock. I watched him from the moment he got up - he could not have taken them at different times.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no Defence, but one witness gave him a good Character.</p>

She took the purse out; I saw it in her hand - she ran from me into a crowd of persons, who were in the room; I kept my eye fixed on her, and followed her. I seized her, and drew her out of the crowd; she told me to let her go, and denied robbing me. I made towards the street door, and gave her in charge. She entreated me not to expose her, but if I would go to the next street she would return the purse; I followed her there, keeping hold of her; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250005"/>gave me the purse; I examined it, and found two of the sovereigns were taken out of it; she had turned round before she gave it me; she might have taken it out then, or when she ran into the crowd. I told her she had robbed me of two sovereigns, and if she did not return them I would charge the watch with her - she denied it. I met a watchman, and gave her to him - she appeared agitated at the watch-house, and kept moving her mouth about - the watchman seized her by neck, and one sovereign fell from her mouth. She appeared from the motion of her throat to have swallowed the other. I found a farthing put into my purse instead of the sovereign. I was perfectly sober.</p>

He came out in about two minutes, and said, "My master is not at home, if you will bring the bill about ten o'clock in the morning, you will get paid;" I said I would bring the hat up next morning - he said there was no occasion for that, for he had spoken to the shopman, and told him he was not sure he should pay him that night, and if not he would send it in the morning - he said he was going further. I watched him into Sommerset-street; he knocked at several doors, but went in at none, and then turned towards Seymour-street again; I lost him, and knocked at the door where I had left the hat, and asked for it.

The two half-crowns were marked. She ran from me - I caught her. I had twenty shillings in my pocket, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250006"/>only missed 10 s. I told her she had robbed me of two half-crowns, and after some time she returned them, and said it was only fun - I said she had 5 s. more; she said it did not belong to me - I gave charge of her. She gave 4 s. to Mr. Munday, the watch-house keeper. I was quite sober.</p>

I felt in my pocket, and found three farthings, and gave it him, and told him he was welcome to it if he would go away - he said he wanted a comb; I said I had not one. On taking the three farthings out of my pocket, the silver in my waistcoat pocket jerked. I put the waistcoat under my legs; he snatched it from me, and took it away across the road, and took the silver out, and threw the waistcoat back - I put it on. I knew him by the name of Hacket. I told him he had taken a shilling and four sixpences - he swore, and said it was untrue, that there was nothing in it but a few buttons - there were some buttons, but I am certain the silver was there too. I put my things on, and pursued, but lost sight of him. I saw him on the Thursday night at a public-house in Orchard-street, and charged him with it; he denied knowing me.</p>

On the 16th of May, from information I received, I found eleven pair and a half of shoe ramps, and two pair of boot fronts concealed under the stairs, leading to the cellar. On the following day I ordered Whitehorn, the porter, to conceal himself and watch. I sent Brenan into the cellar to fetch some oil, and the last time he went Whitehorn returned before him, and from what he said I called Brenan several times from the cellar; I was obliged to send my son to fetch him before he came - I then told him his conduct was very plain, and he had better disclose all he knew of the robbery. I sent my son with him to the leather room, which is below stairs; they brought up the shoe vamps and fronts, which were the same I had marked the evening before. I had them taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many people have you about your premises - A. About twenty generally. Brenan has been about a year and a half with me - they were both in my service. The coarse leather was kept down stairs, but not this. All the people have access to the cellar.</p>

            . I found these things under the cellar stairs, on Friday evening, the 16th of May, about eight o'clock. I watched next day by my master's order, and saw Brenan go down to them, and put his hand on them, and go away without taking them - he saw me concealed, and asked what brought me there, and I asked what brought him there - he made no answer. I informed my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you concealed - A. Opposite the stairs. He took none of the leather away.</p>

            , JUN. I live with my father. I went to the cellar stairs, and called Brenan up twice; he came up at the second call. I accused him of robbing my father before my father spoke to him, and said if he expected mercy, he must confess the whole - he took me down stairs, and gave me the Wellington fronts from under the stairs, and the vamps from another cellar; it was altogether when I first saw it.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 22d of May, a few minutes before seven o'clock, the prisoner came to our house, No. 2, Winchelsea-court, Monkwell-street, and asked if he might leave his coat there; he lodged at No. 9, in the court; we knew that he worked at Boswood's, and gave him leave, and about twelve o'clock he came and said he wanted something out of his coat pocket; he took his coat off the chair and pulled something out of his pocket, but what I do not know; he threw his coat down in the passage and went away, and in the course of the day I was sweeping the passage, and under the mat I found three duplicates wrapped in paper close to where he stood to take something out of his pocket; I could not make out what they were for, but saw something was pawned for 25 s., and took them to Boswood, having then heard that the watch was stolen.</p>

I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250008"/>obliged to handcuff him - he tried to throw me down as we went along. I found the property at the pawnbroker's; then went to the Compter, and asked him what he had robbed Boswood of; he declared his innocence. I shewed him the duplicate of the handkerchief - he immediately put his hand to his forehead, and said, "I am a guilty man;" he called God to witness that he knew nothing about the watch, except being told at Stepney fair that it was lost. I produced the duplicate of it, he then said he was a guilty man.</p>

I felt their hands about my person, and called watch many times. I shifted my money from my breeches to my coat pocket; but M'Donald snatched it out, and ran away with it.

            . I am a constable. Dyer was brought to the watch-house. I afterwards took M'Donald, from the prosecutor's description, on the 14th of June, at her lodgings in Crown-court, Golden-lane - I had seen her the night before, and told her of it - she said she was not guilty, and should not go out of the way. I said I would bring the prosecutor to-morrrow to see her, and told her to be at home; she said she would, and I found her at home. I took the prosecutor there, and asked if she was the woman; he said, "Let me look," and asked if her name was M'Donald or Smith - she said, No; he said, "Well, you are the woman, I'll swear to you;" I found 6 s. 7 d. on her. He was rather intoxicated, and I think a little insensible when he brought Dyer in, and told me he could not swear to the woman who had escaped.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court, Little Poultney-street, and dealt with Ward. I paid the prisoner 4 s. 3 d. the week before Good Friday - he wrote a receipt on a paper, which I have lost in removing. I afterwards paid him a bill of 5 s. and odd. He called afterwards and said he had received my money, but there was a dispute between him and Ward, and I was not to say that I had paid him; but I went and told Ward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you paid him 4 s. 3 d., you still owed money - A. No; I had more bread afterwards. I paid him four shilling pieces.</p>

On the 26th of May, I lost 40 l. and upwards; there were twenty-four sovereigns, and a great number of crowns, shillings, and sixpences; it was kept in a small drawer in my bed-room on the first floor, part in a tin box with the letter T on it, part in a bag, and part in an old stocking, and twelve shillings were loose - it was all in one drawer. I went up stairs at a quarter to one o'clock in the day; the room door was then locked, the drawer shut, and the keys in them. I sent my little girl, who is five years and a half old, up stairs to see if the infant who laid in that room was awake; she called, but being busy I did not hear her, and the prisoner answered, "I will take him down;" she was upon the first floor, and brought me the child down, my little girl came first, and gave me the key of the bed-room; they both came together, and supposing the door to be locked, I put it in my pocket; she could not then have been in the room, but a short time; she left the child with me, and went out of the house, and returned in about five minutes; my little girl offered to go up stairs with her, but she said, "I am only going for my bonnet" - she went up alone, and in about two minutes I had occasion to go up to the room for a paper of copper, and when I came to the door, and took out the key, supposing it to be locked - I found it shut, but not locked; I went in, and found the two top small drawers open; the one nearest the door had my caps and frills thrown out upon the floor, but nothing taken; my husband's shirts and handkerchiefs were thrown from the other, and the box, bag, stocking, and money, taken; 9 s. were taken from the loose 12 s., and a shilling from a shilling and two sixpences, which were in the corner of the drawer. I instantly came down stairs, and ran to the next house, No. 18, to fetch the prisoner as my friend; (I had not seen her go out) I did not see her there, but I called out, "Mrs. Hazlewood, I am robbed of all my money;" I heard her make some answer. I ran back directly, and went up to the bed-room - she followed, and one of the lodgers fetched Adams, the officer, who searched the second floor lodger, whom I suspected; he then searched the prisoner, and found 18 s. 6 d. on her - she said she was going to the Court-house to pay 8 s. for her son or daughter, and that the 10 s. 6 d. was her own. She left my house immediately after the search, offering to fetch my husband from Marylebone, where he worked; she came back, and sat down; I scarcely saw her before her mother fetched her, and she was out all night. She had slept at home every night but one, for the last nine months.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's son-in-law, and lived at No. 18, Wheeler-street, next door to the prosecutor's. On Monday, the 26th of May, I went home to dinner, about one o'clock, and found the prisoner in my room; she said, "Ben, you must not go to work, but take this money to my mother" - she gave me some sovereigns out of a tin box, I cannot say how many, but suppose about twenty; and some silver out of a stocking - there were crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; she gave me the box, bag, and stocking, and told me to throw them away; she did not say why. I threw them over the pailings, into a stone-yard, opposite the Vinegar-yard, in Old-street, as I went to my grandmother's, who lived in Newington-buildings, City-road; my grandmother was not at home - I found her at Mr. Moore's, Stoke Newington, and gave her the money, which I received from the prisoner. She did not tell me where she got it. My grandmother went and fetched her while I waited in Shoreditch; we then all went on together, and as we went up Shoreditch, she asked what I had done with the money - I said grandmother had got it. I do not know whether my grandmother heard this. We went into a coffee-shop in the City-road; the prisoner had then got the money; I had not seen it returned to her - she counted it, but how much there was I cannot say. There were sovereigns, crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; the same kind of money as she had given me, and after counting it, she said she had got all Mrs. Winsbury's money. We came out. She said she had promised to buy me something a long while, and gave me three sovereigns and some silver to buy a watch with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did neither of you make any observation when she said she had all Winsbury's money - A. My grandmother<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250011"/>was out of the room. She told me that when she went up for her bonnet and shawl, the door was not locked, and she went in and took the money. I do not recollect saying anything to her. I bought a watch at Latter's, in the City-road, I have seen the box and stocking since. Mance and Vann apprehended me in the afternoon of the 29th of May, and next morning I gave information about it when I was examined, but not before.</p>

On the 29th of May, I and Vann went to Matthew's apartments, and found a watch, which I have produced. Next day I went to Smith's stone-yard, nearly opposite the Vinegar-yard, and found part of a stocking, three or four yards from the pailing. On the Monday following I went with Matthews to his master's workshop, near London-wall, and he took from between the bricks and floor a bill of sundry articles, bought at Pearson's, upon which 9 l. had been left in part payment.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 18th, about one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's, and coming in a direction from there, with this cloth in his arms, without any paper on it. I followed and seized him near Hounsditch - he went at a sort of jog trot, and called out John or Jack, but I saw no one with him. I seized him and asked how he came by the cloth; he said he had brought it from the new market, and was going to Still-alley - I said I would go with him to the new market. He said if I would go to Still-alley, the gentleman would satisfy me about it; but I took him to the Mansion House, and marked the cloth before I parted with it, and know this, which I produce to be it.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 22d of December, I went out at half-past five o'clock, to go to chapel, and left the house in care of Kenaley and Griffiths - Griffiths had to go to Duke-street, to feed the horse, and would then go home. When I went out my doors and windows were safe. I gave the boys leave to sit in the middle parlour to tea; but the inner parlour, where this property was, was locked, and the key in my pocket. I had twenty sovereigns and two cheques in a drawer, with the key of the iron chest. The iron chest was enclosed in a cupboard by the fire place in the same room, and had a vast quantity of silver, crown pieces, and guineas in it; some of them light - also a great many sovereigns, seven shilling pieces, half-guineas, and Bank notes; all the money together amounted to above 600 l., cheques and all. I was fetched from my brother's about nine o'clock, went home immediately, and found my daughter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250012"/>and Mrs. Broadfield, the lodger. The inner room door was open; a piece of a picklock key was afterwards found in the lock - the drawer was wrenched open, and the lock hanging to it; the cheques and money were gone - they amounted to 70 l. together. The cheques were for 18 l. and 30 l. odd. The key of the iron chest was in the drawer. I unlocked the chest, and every farthing was gone and my market clothes which laid on the top of it were thrown into the middle of the room - the drawer had a patent lock upon it. An enquiry took place at Marlborough-street; I charged Kenaley with it, and about the 11th of February published bills, offering a reward for the apprehension of Chandler, and

I found out on the Monday following that he lived at No. 28, Bett-street, New-road, Commercial-road - I went there with two officers, and saw them find a tool which appeared to have been made out of a shoemaker's rasp (a piece of which was broken off,) and a rent book. I afterwards saw the tool tried to my drawer, which I have here; the marks appear exactly to fit the tool. I am positive the prisoner is the man who called himself Jenkins.

On the Sunday before Christmas-day, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came home in a great hustle with two or three more; they came up to his room together, and afterwards went down together, and about half past eight o'clock the prisoner came in again with two young men: I heard them very merry, and thought they were going to cards; I heard money jingling, and curiosity led me to get on the top of my bedstead and look through a hole in the wainscoat; I could see into his room, and saw money on the table as if they were paying the money down; I saw a good bit of gold and a quantity of silver, but cannot say how much; the silver was five shilling pieces; there seemed a good many.

On the Monday morning after the Sunday, his wife gave my daughter a sovereign, to fetch things out of pawn - she gave me two sovereigns to buy a bed tick with, and they lived in the greatest splendour. On the Christmas day, they had turkey, and on the Sunday following a goose. He left on the Sunday morning after the bills were posted; one was posted opposite the door, and that morning, some things were moved away, and next morning all the furniture was moved. The bills appeared on Wednesday or Thursday. I never saw him after that. His wife also gave my daughter a light guinea to redeem some things.</p>

On the 20th of May, in consequence of information, I sent for Jefferson; my brother Robert told the prisoner he suspected he had robbed us, he made no answer; the officer searched his boxes, which were in a large closet on our premises, he pointed them out himself; they were not locked. Jefferson found two spoons, a small piece of silver, a pearl ring, six silver coins, a light half guinea, a gold pin, a watch key, a silver seal, a pepper castor, an ear ring, three dessert spoons, four nuts, a bundle of burnt lace, and other things, which I know to be ours.

Mr. Garrard's account is correct; he said he was very sorry for what he had done, when the property was found, and said he lodged at No. 13, Burton-street, Walworth, and that there was a spoon or two there in the bed-room drawer; I went there and found eighteen spoons, a pepper castor, a pair of ear rings, an amethyst, and cornelian, three boxes, twelve knives and forks, some shop bills, a mustard pot, some rouge and plate powder.</p>

I saw the prisoner's by the City-road turnpike, walking towards Islington, in a direction from Shoreditch; they passed me. Evans had a bag in his hand; I called to Sheen to stop them, he called to them and they stopped. I asked Evans what he had got, he said a fowl, that it was his own, and he brought it from his mother's, and was taking it to Islington, to sell to Bolger's master. I took them to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Alexander called me. Evans had the bag first, and I saw him give it to Bolger. Evans said he was going to take it to Bolger's master to sell; that he brought it from his mother, who lived in Petticoat-lane. Bolger said his master lived at Islington, opposite the Peacock, and was a wire-drawer. I could find no such person there.</p>

I collared him, and said you have been robbing the cellar, and found a bottle of wine laying horizontally in each of his pockets, which appeared to have been made for that purpose. I found two more bottles of wine in the beer cellar, between the water closet and wine cellar. A man who came in with him jumped out at the back window when the alarm was given.</p>

I said "Not you, you have put something in your pocket," he said I might search him if I thought proper. I declined, but told him there was something I knew of; he said if he had known I was so mean as to watch him, he would have been more on his guard; I said I would have the shop shut up, and he might come and set with me or the servants, till my son came home; he staid till half past ten o'clock.</p>

I believe it to be my writing, it is my business to cut the lengths for the garment, and then the prisoner cuts the shape. I had cut off cloth for a coat for Tole, (Looking at it.) I cannot undertake to say it is my writing, as it is a good deal rubbed, but I believe it to be mine; it corresponds with the rest of the cloth in make. I can trace the letters T. and 1 s.</p>

On the 13th of June, we were at needle work together in the back parlour; she said she would work by time. I saw her go and take the watch off the nail, in the front parlour, but cannot tell what she did with it. I remained therein quarter of an hour, and about half past eight o'clock, we went into the front parlour to breakfast; she came in to me in two minutes, and after breakfast went into the back room, to put her things on to go out to work - she went out in about five minutes, and my nephew went into the back room to see the time, and the watch was gone - she told us she worked in Addle-street. I went there after her, but could not find her. I met her in Goswell-street, and said "What have you done with my mother's watch?" she said she had not seen it, since she took it off the nail in the front room, and hung it on the nail in the back room. I said I was sure she had it, and she should go home with us, which she did, and we sent for an officer, but nothing was found on her. We have not found it. Nobody went into the back room before my nephew - we have lodgers up stairs, but the door between the two rooms was open all the time. I never saw it hung in the back parlour myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. She told you she was going to fetch it - A. Yes. The nail in the back parlour is near the window; it could be reached from the yard had the window been open, but it was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where does the window look to - A. The yard. We have two lodgers, who have children.</p>

I went to see what time it was after breakfast, and it was gone - the prisoner had gone out about five minutes. Nobody had been in the room but my aunt and her.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about hanging it so near the window - A. No. I said nothing to her about the window being open, for it was fastened with two gimblets. I spoke to her once before about hanging it there when the window was open. I sat opposite the window and saw her with her bonnet in her hand, leaning over the table towards the window - the looking glass stands in the window. I did not see her put her hand up. She said she should not be home to dinner.</p>

I was in Chequer-alley, White Cross-street, and met the prisoner with this basket under his arm, the tin case was in it covered with three large live lobsters and two cabbages. I asked what he had got there, he said he had been to market. I put my hand into the basket, and said "Why here is this on box, where did you get this, and where are you going with it?" he said "I am going to my father's, pray come with me." I took him into a shop - my son came in and searched him. The case contained the articles stated in the indictment, he said he was paid to carry it.</p>

            . I am a green grocer, and live in Fetter-lane. Last Saturday morning about five minutes past nine o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked if I had got any potatoes, I said No; he then asked for two cabbages, and while I was looking them out, he picked out three live lobsters, and took from under his coat a red bundle, containing something which from its appearance, I believe to be this box; he asked if I could lend him a basket, saying that he lived at a pawnbrokers in Fleet-market, and wished to carry them down there, and offered to leave me a deposit for it, but I said there was no occasion; he put the bundle in the basket, the lobsters and cabbages over it, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he with you - A. Four or five minutes. White Cross-street, is about a mile from my place, and beyond Fleet-market. I have no doubt whatever of him.</p>

On Saturday morning about five minutes past nine o'clock, I was in Long-lane, a gentleman who alighted from a chaise cart in Long-lane, gave me two shillings and sixpence to carry it to the flower pot, in Bishopsgate-street, and leave them in the name of Mason. I was going to my father's first.</p>

               <p>ELIZAAETH DAVIS. I am seven years old, (the witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath) and live with my parents, in Tarling-street. One day in May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the morning, I had leave to go to Stepney-fair with my brother and sister, who are five and six years old - these two girls followed me and asked me to go into a swing; I said I had no money, they said they would treat me. I would not go, they followed me round the fair. I was coming home - but walked about thinking to miss them, but they followed me, and at last, Shaw took hold of the top of my hat, took it off, and both ran away with it together. Shaw said a wicked word to Powell, and told her to run - they had bonnets on. I saw their faces, and am sure of them. I saw Shaw at the watch-house two or three hours after, and am sure of her. I should have known her if I had met her. It was an old seal skin hat.</p>

The officers took her to the watch-house, where Shaw was, about three o'clock that day - she said directly, that that was the girl who took her hat, and that the other was a thin girl. Powell was taken on the Monday following - she knew them both the moment she saw them.</p>

I sat down on a bed, and in a about five minutes fell asleep, I cannot say whether he was then in the room or not; he said he was going to stop. I took off my gown, but nothing else, I had eaten or drank nothing since ten o'clock, and was perfectly collected. I awoke about seven, and my watch was gone from my pocket, where I had put it, when I pulled my gown off. I went to the watch-house about eight o'clock - he was brought to me about six that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take me to a public-house, when I came off duty - A. We went into one, he had a glass of gin and I drank a little. I did not ask him for a lodging; he said he would take me to his own house, where I could have a comfortable breakfast. I told him to ask the landlady of the house for some water, to wash the tail of my gown, and he hung it up to dry; he saw that I had a watch.</p>

I took her to a shelter and when I left duty, she asked me to get her a lodging, and said she was not married, but afterwards that she was. I got her this lodging, and told her I lived next door to a public-house - she fell asleep, leaving the watch on the bed - a third person came into the room, and finding no lock on the door, and I took the watch to take care of it.

On the 10th of June, about one o'clock in the day, I discovered that my cellar window was forced open, that some one had then got in, and forced the cellar door open, and stolen this cask of rum. The officer came in a few minutes. I found the prisoner in custody with it at Guildhall. It must have been done in the night.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Castle-street. On the 10th of June, about three o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Castle-street, with this cask in a bag, and asked how he came by it; he said he got it from a public-house facing the Old Bailey - I asked if it was a watering house; he said he did not know, but would shew it to me. I put him in the watch-house, then went and enquired at the different public-houses, but could hear nothing of it. He afterwards said it was smuggled liquor, and he had brought it from Wapping, that a man was to give him 2 s. to carry it to the corner of Oxford-street. Jervis's name was on a label on it. I found the bolt of his cellar door wrenched off.</p>

I was in the Old Change on the day the children went to St. Paul's, and saw the prisoner with six or eight others, whom I suspected, and saw them attempt person's pockets - I kept my eye on them, and knocked down one of them. Mr. Barber just passed at the time, and I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from his pocket - I seized him, and immediately saw him drop it; he said he would not go with me. I took him to the Compter, and afterwards took him to a public-house for refreshment - he was handcuffed to another prisoner, who had some friends with him, and I took the handcuffs off - the prisoner immediately said "Now I should like to floor you," and immediately struck at me. I had great difficulty to secure him, and as I brought him to Newgate he threatened to stick a knife into me. I found another handkerchief on him, marked T. W., and a card of buttons.</p>

On the 20th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was called down from tea, and found the prisoners in the shop, and as they were going out, I said I suspected they had something which did not belong to them; Hutchins denied it - Williams desired her to give it up if she had anything; she still persisted that she had nothing. I sent for a constable, and before he came Hutchins took the poplin from under her clothes, and gave it to me - it measured thirty-two yards, and is worth exactly 40 s., it cost us 1 s. 4 d. a yard - we should sell it for 5 s. or 6 s. more. Williams begged hard to be let go, and said she would take the print away, and pay the money if we would let them go; she said nothing about the poplin. Hutchins said she had never seen it after she had given it up - she could not account how it got under her petticoats. They at first said they had not enough to pay for the print, which came to 8 s. 3 d., but 14 s. was found on one of them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Metcalf; the prisoners came to the shop, and both asked to see a printed cotton; I saw Bow the shopman who is not here, shew them a great many. I was behind the counter opposite to them, about a yard from them; they were about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250022"/>minutes looking at them, and did not like any of them. I saw Hutchins convey a piece of figured poplin under her petticoat; she rather stooped to do it; Williams was close to bet, she did not put it on the side Williams stood, but Williams came on the other side of her at the time, and held up a printed cotton, while she was doing it, and asked me the price of it. I immediately ran up stairs and told Wilson, who came down with me, they were than paying 1 s. deposit for a print - they were going out, and he said, he thought they had something which did not belong to them, Hutchins denied it. I left them with Wilson, while I fetched Collins, the officer.</p>

We followed and overtook the prisoner; the prosecutor said, "Cousin George, you have robbed me of a 5 l. note." He said he had not gone one about him. We went into a public house; I searched him with the prosecutor's assistance, and found a 5 l. note in the lining of his hat; he said, "Well, I must abide by the consequence;" that he only took it in a joke, and was going to tell his brother of it. He was knocking at his brother's door when we took him. He said his cousin owed him 2 l. 10 s. for rent and 2 l. for going to Greenwich.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About half past nine o'clock at night, I met a gentleman in the road, who gave me information. I met the prisoner near the waggon with the brooms on his back; he said he picked them up; they could not have fallen out; there was a man asleep in the waggon; he was following the waggon, and called to the man to stop after I asked about them; he was rather in liquor.</p>

I saw him in the shop when I went; it was not then open for business, a bill was in the window, stating that the upper part was to let, the prisoner shewed me all over it, except the kitchen and cellar; he took me to the first floor, the back room of which belonged to him, and the front room was entirely empty - he said that was not to let; he took me to the second floor, and said that was to let, and shewed me the rooms above. I said they would be too large; he said that he would let me the second floor, at a dollar a week, and we might have the use of the rooms above, for he should never use them. I said my husband must see them, that he was in the cabinet business, and asked if he might work on the premises, he said Yes, up stairs; and in two or three days, I took my husband up and found the prisoner at home - we were to take possession, on Saturday the 7th of the month at 5 s. 6 d. a week, and he was to be paid every week - we went in on the 7th, and slept there, and for the first two or three days, I observed there was nothing in the place, and asked how he came to take such a large place, and have no furniture; he said, he had been very unfortunate, that he had been burnt out at Bermondsey. I said "God help you and I will lend you every thing you want." He slept in the one pair back room; the doors were always open, and in that room, there was only a new<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250023"/>tent bedstead, a new bed, a pair of new blankets, and a pillow; but no sheets, and a leather trunk by the side of the bed, but neither table or chair, there was no female servant, only a boy, there were no candlesticks, but a bottle was used for one. I offered to lend him crockery, seeing there was nothing but a bason in the place; he had a parlour behind the shop, and in it was a set of old fire irons, two or three old chairs, and an old deal table; a water barrel in the yard - counters in the shop, and a stove in every room as fixtures. I have mentioned every thing that I ever saw in the house. I had a great deal of furniture, and offered to sell him some, when I had been in the house about a week, he said he was going to furnish the first floor front room for a gentleman whom I had seen. I had seen a respectable gentleman setting on the counter, and he said that was the gentleman, (I offered to sell him furniture, he said No; he had a German who would sell him some.) I made tea for them, and said "I hope there is going to be a rational being in the house, for you are none." Two or three days after this, I came down stairs, and found the first floor front room shut, which before was always left open, the stair case was very dark, unless it was open. I said "Gotte, what induced you to shut that door? I cannot see the way down;" he said "I have got some beautiful chairs in the room," I said "When did they come in, I must have seen them;" he said "Last night, and I am going to have a beautiful table in to day." This was Thursday, the fire happened on the Monday following. On Friday, in my curiosity, I peeped through the key hole, but could see nothing - the shutters were never shut, and I could see all through the room. On the Saturday my husband went out of town; he came down stairs, and paid the prisoner 5 s. 6 d., and said he was going to St. Alban's; he said "Is your wife going;" my husband said No; he said "She ought to go, it would do her good." Gibbs said I could not and went out, and soon after I was bringing down a pail of dirty water, and slipped on the stairs, and came in contact with the door of this room - the pail went against the door as well as myself and forced it open - I fell into the room, and there was nothing whatever to be seen, but the stove - the pail rolled into the shop. I went down and said "Gotte, your boy must go and wipe this dirty water up, for I have fallen into your room, and how could you tell me such stories, that you had such beautiful chairs, and there is not a thing in the room?" he merely laughed and said, there would be bye and bye. On the same afternoon, he asked me to lend him a hammer and chisel. I went up to the garret (where my husband kept his tools) for it, and to my surprise, in the front garret were two sacks full of shavings. I took the hammer and chissel down, and asked how he came to take shavings up stairs; he said he bought them so cheap, and bye and bye he could not get them.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, had you remarked his going to the garret - A. Repeatedly, I said to him, "What makes you go up stairs after we go to bed?" he said he went up to see the comet; we generally went to bed at eleven o'clock, and I had observed him go up stairs, five or six times after that - the boy always slept with him. He had no furniture whatever in the garret. On Sunday morning I came down stairs, and saw him in the shop about nine o'clock, as I was going out to breakfast, with the mother of a young woman who slept with me. I said I was going out to dinner; he said so was he, and asked where I was going. I said to Shadwell; he seemed rather alarmed as I thought, and said "Shadwell, Shadwell, who do you know at Shadwell;" I said two or three people and named them, and asked if he knew them, he said "No; where do they live?" I said near the church, and what was his motive for asking; he said he had no reason, only a friend of his was burnt out at Shadwell; I said "Good God you deal in fires. you burnt out, and your friend burnt out! God help us" - before I left, I said "If you go out, how am I to get in?" he said he would leave the key at Stones, the Rum Puncheon, public-house over the way. I went out and returned, to the best of my recollection, about half-past two or three o'clock, as I changed my mind and went home, instead of dressing for dinner; I went over to Stones for the key, it was not there, and I came to the door, and found the door shutter up, which had never been the case during the fortnight I was there. I turned the handle of the door and it opened, it had been locked but the bolt had not gone into the hasp. I stopped for a moment fearful of going in, as I thought he was out, and somebody might have gone in. I threw the street-door wide open, and thought I would not go up, but walked through the parlour into the back yard, when I came to the parlour, I saw the hearth stone taken up and standing on its edge, against the side of the fire place, and Gotte on his knees; a sack of shavings laying on his left side, with the mouth towards him, on the right-hand side a tin can, what had been in it I cannot say, it was like an oil can with a spout to it - there was a lighted candle on the hob; he had some shavings in his left-hand, and was pushing them in between the boards with my chissel, where the hearth had been - he did not see me. I stood for a moment there; tapped him on the shoulder, and said "For God's sake what are you at, put that hearth down" - he did not answer me. I said "For God's sake put it down, for Gibbs will break his legs;" (as he had to cross that hearth in the morning, to the yard to wash his hands;) he seemed alarmed, and and raising himself on his arm, said "It shall be put down. It shall be put down." I said, "What are you doing?' he said "The shavings are wet, and I put them here at the top of the oven to dry, because they shan't smoke, when I light the oven." I said "I dont care what you are doing, only whatever you do, I will have that hearth put down," - he said it should. I think this place was over the oven. I went out immediately, (without going up stairs,) to a friend's house where my husband came - we went home together, between eight and nine o'clock, and slept at home; nothing particular occurred that night - we brought two friends home with us, who went home. On Monday morning I took some meat down to the bake-house, to ask him to bake it for me; he said No; he should not light the oven that day, as he had plenty of pastry left. I had never been in the bake-house before - a day or two previous to that, I had observed to him that he only had a sack; or part of a sack of flour in the shop; he said, "Oh dear, I have plenty in the cellar below." On the Monday, I saw three sacks of shavings in the cellar, and a quantity of coals strewed along the place, with shavings and chips of wood in a careless kind of way, but saw no flour. I said, "I thought you told me you had so much flour here;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250024"/>more lies; it is like the chairs, you have nothing but shavings;" he laughed and said they would come bye and bye.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was there any place below where he could have flour besides where the oven was - A. No place whatever. On the Monday evening a friend supped with us, and went away about half-past ten o'clock - I lit my friend down stairs, and then the leather trunk, which was always at his bed side stood on the right hand counter with the lid up; I asked if he meant to fill it with money, as copper money was in it - he laughed, and made no answer. I said "This is not the way to get rich, you are selling two-penny cheese cakes for a half-penny," and I bought one; he said they were very stale, and he should bake fresh ones next day. I went up, sat down with my husband, and in quarter of an hour heard our dog growl; I said, "There is that wretch coming up stairs again" - our door was open, and he came into the room; Gibbs offered him some beer, he drank and looked round our room, and said what beautiful paintings we had - I said, "What makes you go up stairs in this manner of a night;" he said to see the comet, and went up. We went to bed about eleven o'clock, and were awoke by the screaming of the dog, and found the room in a black smother - I said, "Oh! God, what is the matter." Gibbs jumped out of bed, opened the door, and the flames came into the room; he shut the door immediately, sat down on the bed, and said, "Oh! dear we are lost." I heard the cracking of the fire all about me - we had a small bench in the room; he wrenched out one of the iron bars from the window, took me by the neck and shoulders, and dropped me on the tilings. The flames were then in the room. I went along the tilings, clung to the chimney, and with the help of my husband and the fireman got away by the back of the building, and with a ladder we got down.</p>
               <p>Q. When Gotte came to your room had he a candle - A. Yes, and carried it up to the garret a light. I took refuge at Pye's, in Shrewsbury-court. The gentlemen of the fire office came to me next day, and I gave them every particular. I saw no more of Gotte for six or seven years after, when I was walking in Holborn, and cast my eye on him just as I came to Dean-street - he saw me, and got among the people at a caricature shop, turned from me, and looked at the pictures in the window - Miss Ryder, (who is now dead,) was with me. I let go her arm, went up to him, and said, "You wretch, you are the wretch that set me on fire;" he turned round, and with his left elbow struck me on the breast, and said, "Bl - t you, you b - h," and got away - I fell down from the fright, was taken into a shop, and sent home in a coach. I did not see him again till Sunday morning, the 14th of May last, the day after a fire had happened in New-street, Covent-garden - he came into a public-house opposite to where the fire was, with a man, and asked for a box which he had left there the night before. I immediately caught hold of him, and said, "What Gotte, what another fire! what burnt out again!" he did not answer, but asked again in an agitated manner for his box; the people gave him a tin cannister, such as sweetmeats and nuts are kept in. I then turned him completely round, and said, "Do you know me? what another fire! what burnt out again!" he said, "Yes, Yes, I know you, Yes, I have lost every thing now." I got to the door, and as he came out, collared him, and said, "You once escaped from me, but now you shall not" - he said not a sentence till be got into the street, and then said, "You b - h, what do you hold me for?" I said, "I will let you know, for God's sake somebody come and help me; send for an officer, for he shall not go from me." I was surrounded by firemen, who said, "This is the man who was burnt out over the way." I said, "Get me an officer;" one came at last, and I gave him in charge of Davis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you live then - A. In Brick-lane, Whitechapel. Gibbs belongs to the East India Company's service, as he did then, but since January, 1812, till now he has been a Bow-street patrol. I believe I have always given the same account. I was examined two or three times at Bow-street, and believe all I said was taken down. I mentioned about the beautiful chairs to Mr. Richmond, the clerk of Bow-street, who was taking down my deposition, and also that he borrowed a hammer and chisel of me. It was between twelve and one o'clock in the day when I was down in his bake-house. I suppose we were awoke by the fire from a quarter past eleven to a quarter past twelve o'clock; he was in our room about a quarter to eleven. I went to lodge there quite by accident, and had no acquaintance with him before; he shewed me all the premises when I went to look at the lodging. I did not expect a fire, but thought he was a rogue, and was going to cheat the landlord of the rent and taxes. I know he had nothing in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the fire place in the back room stand in the road to the yard - A. Directly opposite it. The pail of water my husband had up stairs was to wash his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there in the back room on the Sunday - A. A window looks into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the front door, a great deal of light would come in - A. It might; I walked in gently, being fearful, nothing disturbed him - he was too intent on his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at that time Mrs. Gibbs - A. No; I have lived with Gibbs twelve years - I have been his wife eleven years. I was divorced from Mr. Atkinson by the Ecclesiastical Court, when I was about seventeen years of age; he died in December, 1811. I married Gibbs in August, 1812, having lived with him for twelve years before. I had not lived with Mr. Atkinson for fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met the prisoner in Holborn, the persons assembled heard you called a b - h, and saw you knocked down, but yet he got away - A. I do not know that they heard it. I fainted and saw nothing of him. I was examined in Pape's room the day after the trial. I do not know whether they took down what I said. I believe Sir

            . I am the husband of the last witness, and am a Bow-street patrol. In 1811, I was a labourer at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250025"/>East India warehouse, and worked as a cabinet-maker. On Saturday the 7th of September. I went to lodge at the prisoner's house, in White-cross-street, the parlour behind the shop, had two or three old chairs and a table in it, the whole not worth above seven or eight shillings. I never saw his bed-room that I recollect. On the Saturday previous to Monday the 23d, I went to St. Alban's, returned on Sunday evening, and slept with my wife. I was absent all the next day, and came home between five and six o'clock - a friend supped with us, and left five or six minutes before eleven o'clock; Mrs. Gibbs let him out, and came up stairs; the prisoner came up in quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, our door was open, he came in, I asked him to drink with me, which he did, and went up saying he was going to see the comet. I went to bed directly, and about twelve o'clock, as I suppose, my wife awoke me, the dog was making a noise; I got up, opened the door, and the whole place was in flames, they were rushing from down stairs, and also descending from the garret. I shut the door directly and made my mind up to be burnt in the room, for I was almost suffocated in opening the door, but I had got a work-bench with only two legs to it, I put a leg between the bars, but it broke. I pulled out the other, and broke the bar down from the window; put Mrs. Gibbs out on some tiles; told her to keep to the left, which led to the brewery wall; followed her to a stack of chimneys; got on the wall, and escaped - no alarm was give to me from below. I heard no cry of fire, or anything till I found it myself. All my furniture was burnt. I saw the prisoner two or three mornings afterwards at the Eagle Office, but had no conversation with him. I heard him say he came for his money, the clerk told him, if he came any more about it, he should be taken up - he went out and I saw no more of him. The gentlemen had been and examined me and Mrs. Gibbs about it, before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did the clerk take down what you said - A. No; when we were at Pape's house, Mr. Rawlings was present and other gentlemen. I did not see them take anything down, my wife told them the man had nothing in the place, and there was no doubt but he had set it on fire, and told what she had seen. I was appointed a patrol about six months afterwards. I passed the house he lived in, in New-street, almost every night, but never saw him there, and did not know that he lived there. I never observed his name over the door. I looked about for him, but did not know where to find him - his shop in New-street has been often open till one o'clock at night, when I have passed.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSHALL. Q. You did not know that he resided in New-street, till after the fire there - A. No.</p>

            . I was in the Eagle Insurance Office in 1811. The gentlemen signing this policy were directors at that time - two of them are now dead. I witnessed it as being executed by them, but cannot swear that I saw it signed, as many are probably signed without my seeing it done; but they were invariably delivered to me by the directors, as their act and deed before I attest them, and as their seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I dare say a great many are executed in the course in the day - A. Yes. I am generally present, but I may occasionally be called out of the room.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you often seen him write - A. Yes. I do not swear that it is his writing, but believe it to be.</p>
               <p>The documents referred to were here read - the policy was dated the 9th of September, 1811. Total amount insured 700. The schedule stated the loss and damage to be as under: -</p>
               <p>s. d.</p>
               <p>Household Furniture, Apparel, Watch, Trinkets, and Books, which were enumerated</p>

               <p>392 16 11</p>
               <p>To this schedule was affixed an affidavit stating the schedule to be a correct statement of the property damaged and destroyed, and that 242 3 s. 3 d. was the just value of the same.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to MR. BEETHAM. Q. Is not the premium charged on the goods doubly hazardous - A. Yes. The affidavit was filled up at the office. The sum of 242 l. 3 s. 3 d. is a mistake since discovered. It is common for persons to insure to the amount they expect to have on their premises. They must prove the actual loss.</p>

            . I am a broker and butcher. In 1811. I lived at No. 197, White-cross-street. I did not know my next door neighbour. After the fire happened, I went to the Eagle Office, and saw a man there making a claim about the fire - I do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. I went to look at the ruins the day after it happened - the back of the house was down; part of the floor was left in the first floor, and in the shop; I saw no remains of furniture. When the house was re-built I saw the oven, my belief is that it was not injured the least in the world - I could not see that either the oven or brick work were damaged. I claimed 40 l. of the office for damages, and received 30 l., and had the goods returned, which made up the demand.</p>

            . I am a baker and pastry-cook, and live in Little Russell-street, Drury-lane. I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years - he lived with me as journeyman in 1812 and 1813. I had several conversations with him about this fire; he told me it happened in consequence of the falling in of the oven; that he was awoke in the night by a noise like thieves breaking in, and when he opened the door, the fire was on the stairs; that he shut the door directly, and pulled his bedstead to pieces, took the post, and broke the iron bars from the window with it, and escaped.

            . I am a fancy biscuit baker. I first knew the prisoner in 1808, and lived three years with him at Shadwell, and left him early in 1811 - he still lived at Shadwell. I then went to live with a different master in the same line. I saw him afterwards in a shop in Whitecross-street, and found he lived there; I called two or three times, and the fourth time that I called he shewed me his first floor back room, the parlour behind the shop, and the bake-house - this was two or three days before the fire. Seeing iron bars to his bed-room window, I said, "Gotte, your bed-room looks like a prison with these iron bars;" he said it did, that he intended to take out the two irons bars in case of fire, or an accident, for while a person was striving to take out those two iron bars he might be burnt to death. He shewed me the bake-house - the iron work of the oven was much superior to anything I had seen of the kind before, but not since. I do not recollect observing his furniture or property. His boy came to my lodging on the evening of the fire, in consequence of which I went to Gotte's, and believe I got there about ten o'clock he wanted me to sleep there all night, to help him complete an order to make biscuits and cakes. I said my health was indifferent, but agreed to stay - he got salmon for supper. We both went to bed together in about half an hour from the time I got there. I was awoke by a dog barking, and awoke him, and said, "Gotte, here are thieves, or something in the house?" he made no answer. I immediately heard something fall very heavy, and a dreadful cracking; I thought it was fire. I shook him again, and said, "Gotte, for God's sake get up, for the house is all on fire;" he made no answer. I immediately jumped out of bed, and he after me - he immediately opened the bedroom door, and said it was impossible for us to escape down stairs; the fire was raging up the stair-case. I was dreadfully alarmed, and asked him where the window was; he said it was close to me. I turned round, and perceived it, felt about, and found two iron bars on the left hand side, but on the right there were two missing - he said the casement would open, but in my fright I burst through the casement, and fell out on the wash-house, and got into the yard. I had scarcely recovered myself when he threw a trunk out of that window - he came out the same way as I did; he did not appear hurt. I saw an old door which lead into a court - I forced it open, and he made his appearance just then, and asked me to take hold of the end of the trunk, which I did, and we carried it somewhere, which I suppose to be Pape's. I never saw the trunk afterwards. I remained at the house about a quarter of an hour - I had nothing on but my shirt. Pape lent me shoes and a great coat. Gotte had something slightly about him, but what he had on I cannot say. I went back to the place about ten o'clock next morning, and saw him sitting at Pape's, talking to a fireman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you left the bed-room did you observe whether he did anything with the bedstead - A. He did not; he followed me almost directly. Nobody broke any of the bars out before I got out. I saw him in Whitecross-street a day or two afterwards; he said he had applied at the office for his insurance, but did not state any amount.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not live with him after the fire - A. I worked with him for three weeks in Round-court; I could have found him at any time if I had wanted. Shavings give a better heat to bake biscuits, particularly if the oven has been heated before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is September, when carpenters are at work, a better time to lay in shavings than Christmas - A. Yes; I was articled to him at Stepney, it was Gotte and Lambol. We eat our salmon on a table. I cannot say whether it was deal or mahogany. I do not recollect seeing above two or three chairs in that room, or any being in the bedroom - we both went to bed at the same time; from the difficulty I had to awake him, I have no doubt of his being really asleep. When he opened the door I saw flames coming up from below, but there were none coming down; a few minutes more would have been our certain destruction. I made a spring and got through the window easily, without squeezing; he came and staid at my father's for five or six weeks afterwards, and went to the ruins every day - we lived about three hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived with him in Round-court afterwards, was his name on the door - A. Yes, in a shabby manner; he went to New-street, nearly four years ago, the last time I saw the house, there was "Gotte pastry cook and confectioner," in large letters up, that was about twelve months ago; he had a good business there. I worked there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250027"/>at times, and slept there; he had me and another man, and two apprentices. I was with him in New-street, about four months. I remember his employing one Gaskin an attorney to recover his claim. I lost my clothes at the fire, and never got a farthing allowed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ask him for any compensation for them - A. No; he said if he got his insurance he would make me a little. Gaskin called on me to ask a few questions about the fire. I do not know that any thing was done after that.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the trunk in the chamber, where you slept - A. I believe it was; the bars were all up when I observed to him that he was living in a prison, they must have been removed afterwards - the trunk was not large. I think it was more than one man could carry - we were to get up at three o'clock in the morning to work - no preparation was necessary over night.</p>

            . I am a tin-plate worker, and live in Baldwin-street, City-road. I lived at the corner of Henry-street., and Old-street, in 1811, had dealings with the prisoner; he came to me soon after the fire, to say he had been to the office, and should soon get his money, and if any of the people applied to me from the office, to know what amount of goods he had had of me, I was to say to the amount of 50 l. I had not sold him goods to near that amount; the last time I sold him goods was in 1810, when he lived at Shadwell, and they were under 10 l., and that was all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did he never pay money for things, which you do not book - A. I never recollect it. I supplied him with 10 l. worth of goods in the course of two years - he generally paid by instalments - the utmost amount in my books against him is 6 l. or 7 l.; he had paid it at the time of the fire, they were utensils in trade. I told him, I would say no such thing, that I would examine my books and say what he had had.</p>

            . In 1811 I lived in Shrewsbury-court, White-cross-street. On the morning of the fire, Gotte came to my house with a young man, they were in the shirts, and had a leather trunk. Gotte stopped about five minutes, and then said he would go and fetch his small clothes, and returned with them; he went through the back yard for them. I followed him out, and observed his house on fire at the top; there was a great body of smoke at the top, I did not stop to look further - when he returned, he said to the young man, we must take up the trunk and go - they did so.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner on liking as an apprentice, at Shadwell, in the early part of the summer of 1811, I remained with him five or six weeks - the premises were burnt down, and he went to live in a private house, near the Commercial-road. I also went to live with him in Whitecross-street. On the night of the fire, he told me he wished to see Saberton. I fetched him to the house that night, and I went home, being very young then, I wanted to get to my playmates, and he said "Well if you go home, Saberton shall sleep with me." I knew of no preparation for any order. I left between eight and ten o'clock; nothing had then been done to the oven. I returned next morning, and the house was burnt down. I saw Gotte in Shrewsbury-court, and asked how he escaped, he said he got out of his bed-room window. I asked if he was hurt, and I think he said not much. I asked how Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs escaped; he said he believed they were safe There was not much furniture in the house. There was a bed, bedstead, box and trunk, in the sleeping-room, as near as I recollect, and in the parlour, there might be six oldish chairs, with I think hair bottoms, there might be a little crockery. I never remember above one or two sacks of flour coming in; there might be a sack or two that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know when the window bars were altered - A. No, my Lord. I remember seeing them all up. I slept with him a very few nights before, but cannot say whether they were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The box was in the bedroom - A. I believe so; there was no bason stand there. I think there might be, 18 l. of furniture altogether, including stock, and every thing; 40 l. would cover the furniture, stock, coals, flour, and all the moveables. I was only fourteen years old at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Before he sent you for Saberton. had you told him you must go home - A. I think so.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant. In 1811, I lived in White-cross-street. My attention was directed to the fire about eleven o'clock, when the alarm was given. I came out and could see nothing of it, I ran into Shrewsbury-court, went up, Pump-court, and met Mr. Gotte, coming out of his house by the back door, which led into Shrewsbury-court; he was then dressed, the same as I am now, and had a trunk about eighteen inches long in his hand. I said "For God's sake what is the matter, where is the fire, he said "Hush, hush." I stopped a moment or two, and saw the flames breaking out backwards, and Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs making there way out of the second floor window. I saw Gotte again in about a quarter of an hour, on the other side of White-cross-street, looking at the fire, with the same trunk in his hand, and dressed the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him full dressed about eleven o'clock walking into the court, with the trunk, and nobody with him - A. Yes; he was not agitated but seemed as unconcerned as I am now.</p>

            . I live in Shrewsbury-court, and did so when this fire happened, and was awoke by Mrs. Gibbs, calling for assistance. I dressed as fast as I could; ran down and found Gibbs not quite descended from the ladder; there was a strong thick black smoke. in the lower part of the house, I thought it was in flames, both at top and bottom, but did not think there was any burning in the centre. I saw the premises next day. Gibbs was collecting a few things that were partly burnt - the front part of the second floor was still standing, and the back burnt. I did not notice the first floor - the dog lay down dead in the shop. I afterwards saw the things dug out of the ruins. The iron bar which Gibbs wrenched off, was brought to me with several planes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You saw that the back was burnt - A. Yes. the back part of the first floor being built of wood was consumed. The brick work was standing.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to SABERTON. Q. You and the prisoner were in your shirts that night - A. Yes. I recollect going into no house but Pape's. I did not see Mrs. Brooks that night.</p>

               <p>The prisoner in a long written address, stated that he was utterly at a loss to account how the fire happened, unless occasioned by the oven - that he escaped in his shirt, with only a trifling article of dress and a box - that he certainly took up a plank by the side of the hearth, which was broken, but denied placing shavings there. Having no means of prosecuting his claim, he entered into Carmichael's service, and was arrested for the charges of erecting the oven - that for the last nine years he had lived in public situations, carrying on business with his name over the door. He denied telling Carmichael that he had forced the window bars away with the bed-post, and concluded by protesting his innocence.</p>

            . I keep the White Lion, public-house, Edgware; before I went there I kept the Marquis of Granby, public-house, in Bow-street. I know Mrs. Gibbs, and would not believe her on her oath.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Be kind enough to tell us why - A. She was at my house once when Randall stated that a person had come in for change for a sovereign. I looked into my till, and missed a crown piece and some silver, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why Randall, I have just taken a crown piece and some silver, and it is all gone." It was said that my wife (as they supposed, but meaning her) had taken it out of the till - Randall said, "That woman has got it, and is putting it into her right hand pocket;" I said, "Mrs. Gibbs, you have got it. Randall saw you put it in your pocket;" she said, "No, I have not got above a shilling." I insisted on seeing what she had - she pulled out a crown, a half-crown, some shillings, and sixpences, and the man who paid me the crown said, "I will take my oath that is the crown I paid you." Q. Why not prosecute her - A. Knowing her to be an officer's wife, and my house being dependant on the officers, I thought it best to tell her to leave my house, and not come there again - she said she was sure she had not done it, but I turned her out. I met her husband some time after, and told him of it, but he treated it very lightly indeed. I never saw the prisoner before to day.</p>

On the 9th of June, about ten or half past ten o'clock in the evening; the prisoner came to my shop; he was dressed in a kind of midshipman's jacket, with yellow buttons at the sleeves, and asked if I had got a seaman's chest; I said No - he asked if I had any kind of chest - I said I had; he asked to see it. I took him in and shewed him one, which he agreed to give 12 s. for, but afterwards changed his mind, and asked if I had got a trunk; I then shewed him another trunk - he said he wanted two; the first I shewed him would not do, and the next I sold him for 30 s.; I took him into my little parlour; he said "You know my father very well". I said very probably - he said "You know Miles, my father, very well," I said "Yes; very well." - he then said he had been to the East Indies, that he had a large sum (150 l.) to receive next day, and also shewed me a letter purporting to be for 173 l., and said it was an order, he had from the ship-broker, or merchant's to receive for a brother seaman of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that distinct from the 150 l. - A. Most assuredly - he then pulled a 5 l. note out of his pocket book, and asked me to give him change. I gave him three sovereigns and ten shillings. (Looks at a note,) this is it; I saw him write upon it, "Mr. S. Miles, Clyde, East Indiaman, East India Docks." - he said he should want the trunk taken down to the docks, and could I get him a porter. I got

Stevens came to me and said he had got him. I went there, expecting to see the same man. I think I had some recollection of him before he brought the note - but I am not positive. I did not know that I had ever seen him before, till he mentioned about his father. I had but one candle in the shop, and cannot say whether he wore his hat all the time - he was with me about quarter of an hour - no person come into the shop while he was there - but he had a man with him.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Kirkman's-place, Tottenham Court-road. On the 9th of June Davis sent for me to carry the trunk - the person who bought it went with me. I cannot swear that the prisoner was the young man; but believe him to be - he was in Davis's parlour. I first saw him by the door. I was to go with him, and followed him with the trunk below St. Giles's church, opposite the Waterloo public-house; as we went along, he said; I am not going far, and when he came there, he called a coach. I put the trunk in, he gave me 6 d., and said master would pay me the rest, and I came away.</p>

            . My father keeps a law-stationer's shop, at No. 12, Chancery-lane. I believe the prisoner to be the man (but cannot speak positively) who came at nine o'clock in the evening, of the 31st of May, and said he wanted a warrant of attorney, to secure money - he was dressed like a sailor with naval buttons, and said he wanted to leave some money he had got in a friend's hands, who was to give him a warrant of attorney as security, as he did not wish to spend it. I said he had better go to an attorney with the warrant, he said he was going to one in Red Lion-square; that he was going to sea; he mentioned a sum, which I think was 300 l. I looked at the list and saw the stamp duty was 3 l., gave him a stamp and told him the charge was 3 l. 1 s. 6 s. - he put down a 3 d. note. I asked his address, which he wrote on it that if, (looking at a note,) this is it, here is "Captain Blaye, Clide frigate;" this was written at the time, by the person to whom I gave 1 l. 18 s. 6 d. change. I did not mark it myself till the 5th of June, when I took it to the Bank, to show my father's name upon it, "Mr. T. Steel, No. 12, Chancery-lane, 5th June, 1823," and knew it to be the note the person gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are speaking of what happened three weeks ago - A. Yes. I had no particular reason for taking notice of him - only he gave me a history of what business he wanted it for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at him, and say what you believe - A. I believe him to be the man, but cannot swear to him.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Collins, law-stationer, of Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. On Wednesday, the 4th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a warrant of attorney stamp, to receive 170 l., and told me he was second lieutenant on board the Clyde frigate, a 74 - he was dressed in uniform; I took him for a midshipman. We had not got a stamp, but said I would get one for him. I took him to several shops which were shut up - I at last took him to Mr. Houghton's, Chancery-lane; Washington served him. I staid there, and introduced him as coming from the trade; he bought a stamp, which came to 2 l. 0 s. 1 d., with the trade deduction - he paid for it by a note. I accompanied him into Fleet-street, and conversed with him, and am sure he is the man. I knew him six or seven years ago when we were at school together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far does Washington live from your shop - A. About three minutes walk, He was about a quarter of an hour with me. I never had the note - he took it out of his pocket-book, and gave it to Washington. He wore a short jacket without flaps, and had his hat on all the time. I knew then that he was a school-fellow of mine. I asked how he did.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long were you at school together - A. About a year and a half. When he came in I said, "How do you do Sam?" and he said.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jack, how do you do?" he said he had been to Bombay, and had just returned. I asked him about the situation he was in, but said nothing about school. I have no doubt of having been at school with him.</p>

I took off 1 s., which he agreed to. I then told him the baskets were not complete, they wanted another coat of paint, and if he would leave his name and address they should be sent home in the evening; he asked for paper, and wrote "Mr. Knight, No. 6, Euston-place, New-road;" this is the paper (looking at it.) I said, "Why I know Mr. Knight, I have done business for him;" "Oh! have you" he said - he then said, "Shall I pay you for them now, or when they are delivered;" I said it was immaterial to me, it would be just as well when they were sent home; he paused for a moment, and at last said, "I may as well pay you now, and then it is done with;" he took out his pocket-book, and took a 5 l. note out. I had no change, and said I would go, and get it, and just as I was going out, he said, "Stop, let me write on it" - he took it, and wrote on it</p>
               <p>"Thompson, ship owner, Rotherhitbe;" this is it (looking at it) - he wrote this before I took it out, and I wrote "Knight, 6, Euston-place, "on it myself. I went to the Adam and Eve, public-house, and got change, and am sure this is the note.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live at No. 5, Charlton-place, Islington. I have known the prisoner some years; he came to my house last Friday week, which I think was the 13th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, to purchase a watch; he said he had come from India about a fortnight, in the Clyde Indiaman, and had made a very prosperous voyage; that he had made about 170 l. and was going to Brighton next morning to see his father; that he had booked his place, and wanted a watch. I had none complete; he said he wanted one that evening, and should like to have one of my make, for I had made one for his brother. I said I would endeavour to get him one from some of my friends in Clerkenwell; I went, but did not succeed; I returned, and told him I could not get him one till the morning; that did not seem to suit, and I shewed him some I had in an imperfect state, and said I could complete one in twelve days; he agreed to have it, and took out his pocket book and asked if I could change a note; I asked if it was a large one; he said 5 l.; he took one out; there was a piece torn, but it hung to the end of it; he asked for a pen and ink, and said if I would give him change he would give me 1 l. deposit; he wrote something on the note, and I wrote under it - (looks at the note) - here is my name on this, by which I know it, and I have no doubt of its being the one he gave me; there is a piece torn off the same corner where the piece hung. I do not know what he wrote on it, but he wrote very near the word Bank, and here is "Clyde ship, S. M.," written there. I think I sent my boy to the public-house; he brought me five sovereigns; I gave them to the prisoner, who gave me a sovereigns; I said, "Mr. Miles, you may as well let me have two as I am in a little way, it will be of service." He said he could spare but one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he came you did not know his name - A. Yes; he asked for a pen and ink himself - my boy is not here, he wrote on it before the boy took it, and I wrote on it at the same time, I had no other 5 l. note that day.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told he was in custody at the time you mention - A. I am sure he came on the 13th of June; but may be mistaken, in saying it was Friday week - his brother lived with me nine years ago.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 14th of June, about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner at the Yorkshire Grey, public-house, Brydges-street, Covent-garden, he had gone in there to drink with a young woman. I took him to the watch-house, and returned with the young woman to her lodging, No. 10, Phoenix-alley, Long-acre, and found a trunk, which I brought away afterwards, and shewed it to Davis, there was nothing in it. I saw a sailor's uniform in the room, and various articles of the girls.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, at the Bank, and have been so between twenty-four and twenty-five years, (looking at the note uttered to Davis;) this is forged in every respect - paper, plate, and signature - it is signed</p>
               <p>"J. Robinson;" he was a signer of small notes, but not of 5 l., (the witness examined the other four notes produced, all of which he declared to be forged in every respect. Two were signed "Robinson," and two "H. Whiting," and declared all five to be impressed from the same plate)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen many forged notes of late - A. Not a great many. Those I have seen have not all been from one plate. There is a mark in these resembling a water-mark, but it is not one, it is impressed afterwards.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Have you ever known forged notes to be paid at the Bank, and not discovered till the good one was brought in - A. That has happened.</p>

               <p>The prisoner read a long Defence, contending that there was no convincing proof of his knowing the notes to be forged - that sailors often involve themselves in difficulties, which they could not satisfactorily explain, and protesting his innocence.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to MR. WONTNER. Q. Was the prisoner tried here - A. He was tried here once and acquitted. Mr. Recorder particularly expressed that he ought not to have been charged with the offence. He came afterwards to me stating that he had got a ship.</p>

Next day about two o'clock, I saw Savage with two or three more coming out of the field, and a little after three o'clock, I saw the fight - they threw their hats up, went into the ring and shook hands; the deceased had the advantage at first; it lasted nearly an hour. The deceased got weaker, and before the last round sat down on Foot's knee, apparently weak, but in as good spirits as ever. I do not think Marsh assisted as a second; he only gave him a drop of water out of a bottle. At the last round but one, Saunders went to Savage, and said that the deceased was done.

            . I live at Hornsey. I was passing, and saw them shake hands - Savage appeared strongest; there was a good deal of science displayed. At the last round but one the deceased appeared in such a state that he ought not to have been allowed to fight any longer; I wished them not to fight, telling the seconds that murder would ensue; the reply was, "He will stand another round;" I believe it was Saunders who said so, and cannot say whether all the parties heard it - the consequence of another round was that the deceased made an effort to strike Savage, but was too weak, and Savage struck him three times. When I interfered I did not observe that any of the parties attempted to stop them. The blow that knocked him down was on the jugular vein - he dropped immediately. Savage did not wish to fight any more, but the deceased with the assistance of his seconds did fight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FOOT. Q. You say the deceased's seconds wished him to continue the fight, was that not Saunders - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, and live in Rosamond-street. I was present; it appeared a fair fight - the deceased was in so weak a state at the last round but one, that he certainly should have been taken off the ground - he had no chance at all. I was on the opposite side of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250032"/>the ring to Sharp, and did not hear him interfere. I saw the last blow; the deceased was hit as he fell. Savage cut him under the ear; his eye fixed directly. I saw none of them endeavour to binder the fight. Saunders is the only man I recollect.</p>

            . Q. Before the last round but one, did I not go and shake hands with the deceased - Yes; they shook hands together; the deceased was afterwards taken into the ring by the two seconds, one holding each arm; he did not appear able to support himself; a handkerchief was thrown into the air, but who by I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- RUSSELL. I saw the three last rounds; the deceased was knocked down at the last round but one, the seconds said it was all over and threw up a handkerchief. Savage came round, and offered to shake hands with the deceased; he would not; he was very weak, and I thought not able to stand against it. I heard his seconds say he was done, and could not fight any more, and then George Savage threw up his handkerchief - he seemed to get up full of spirits, to the last round, but was very weak; he rose from his second's knee. I did not see them conduct him into the ring.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Handley, solicitor, of Pentonville. I saw this fight - the deceased was in an extremely exhausted state before the last round, and appeared incapable of fighting longer. I did not hear Sharp interfere; I was about five yards off. I saw the last round - he came with his seconds, but I do not believe that he was led by them; it was given out before that that the battle was decided, and

I was passing, and saw a ring forming for a fight; when I came up I saw my brother and the deceased stripped; he had no seconds, and said, "George, come and pick me up, as I have nobody to take my part," so I went - Foot said the deceased should fight no more. I threw up my handkerchief to signify that it was over, ran for my brother's clothes, and when I returned they were fighting again.</p>
               <p>FOOT's Defence. I and three more were passing, and ran to see the fight - we stood arm in arm. Saunders was the only person I knew; he said, "Come Tom, strip, I want you," and thinking he was going to fight, I stripped. When I saw Cousins getting the worst of it, I told him not to fight any more; but he would not hear me, and always arose as the time was called; we persuaded him not to fight; but he said he would have another round.</p>

            . I live in St. George's-place, Walworth. I left my shop about three o'clock in the afternoon, of Saturday, the 21st of June, another person remained there till eleven o'clock, I did not return myself till seven o'clock of the morning of the 23d, and found the door had been opened without the key - the tea cannisters scattered about the shop and all empty; three loaves of sugar, 12 lbs. of coffee, a basket and bag were also stolen, and on Wednesday, in consequence of an advertisement, I saw this property, and knew the bag and basket - the tea is green and black mixed, and is about the quantity I lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not sleep at this house - A. No.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Fleet-market, about six o'clock on Sunday morning, and found it by the side of some baskets, and took it home, thinking it might be advertized.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years, and was with him when he found this basket on Sunday morning; he was going over the water with me at the time, and in Fleet-market I saw him pick it up. I said "Take it home, you will get something, it will be owned."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you walking with him in Skinner-street - A. No; we opened it in Fleet-market; it was about seven o'clock, there were a good many people about. I had called on him to go to the Borough with me; he was to introduce me to a lawyer. I went on and left him, as he told me where to find the person I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send for you when he was taken before the Magistrate - A. No.; I knew nothing of it till Friday, about two o'clock. I went to Canterbury on the Monday morning by the Gravesend boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more baskets at the place - A. There were market baskets there; this stood on the top of one or two of them, opposite the prison, and being different from market baskets, it caught his eye I suppose. It was on the ground at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Why take up that more than another - A. There was no other of value - we moved the sack and saw it was tea.</p>

I said No; he called the next day for his things, and asked why he could not have the lodging. I said it was let; he took his things which came to four-pence; he gave me a sixpence. I gave him two-pence. I shewed the sixpence to somebody, and being bad, I went after him, as I saw he had a good many more. I met him coming out of Dale's house, and told him it was bad; he said "Come in, I'll change it," and produced another, which Dale said was bad; he then produced a shilling; Dale gave him two sixpence for it, and then said "That is bad, return me the six-pence," which he did. Dale said "Why don't you give the women a good one"; he said he had no more money. Dale seat for an officer, who found four half crowns, and some sixpences on him. I gave the sixpences to Smith.</p>

I saw him three times in the course of that night in the Poultry, and saw him again on the Wednesday morning between twelve and two o'clock, as I was coming up the Poultry, round Mr. Deputy Brook's house, I saw him there, and am quite sure of his person - there is a strong gas-light there.

I sleep over the stable, the wall of which joins the house, and it is all within one fence. On Sunday morning the 22d of June, at nine o'clock, I went in to breakfast; I came up from breakfast, about twenty minutes after nine, and saw the prisoner coming out of the stable yard; he said, "Where is the privy;" gave me a push and ran away. I called the watchman, and opened a little door which he pushed too, and in the stable yard I found a great bundle; he must have thrown it there, for the things in it were in the stable, at nine o'clock, hanging on pegs. I went into the stable, and missed my box, my watch, and some things which laid on the ground; my box was found in a field, it had contained the articles stated in the indictment, as mine, (enumerating them) a watch was taken which I have not found, my grandfather gave it to me - I also lost two pair of gloves, and Johnson's things were gone. The value of what I lost is 16 l. or 18 l. The coachman and I went up and missed all these things, I afterwards went to the prisoner's lodging, with Limbrick and Lee, and found a few handkerchiefs, an old shirt and a night cap - they had been in the box, that was left in the field, they were all locked up safe just before I went to breakfast, When the prisoner rushed by me, I looked at him very hard, and am certain of him; he was dressed as he is now; I saw him in custody the next day but one, about eleven o'clock in the morning, in a room, with about thirty others, and pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him before - A. No; he stopped at the door first, and then pushed by me; he was in my sight two or three minutes; he turned back and then ran again. I went to shut the door to hold him in, and am quite sure of him; if I had met him in the street I should have said, he was the man, and called somebody to take him - all the servants were at breakfast, and nobody left in the stable.</p>

I did not see the thief; he pointed to a bundle in the yard, with his clothes, a pair of stockings of mine, a new pair of boots and a cap. It had been moved down stairs into the yard - he could not have gone out of the gate, without tumbling over it. I had been in the stable from five to nine o'clock, and left Jewell there, my things then hung up safe - a waistcoat, pair of drawers, breeches, a coat, a box coat, and a gold band, were taken quite away. The yard is completely enclosed by a wall and gates, which communicates with the house. The prisoner is a perfect stranger.</p>

The prisoner did not sleep in the house, but used always to go and <rs id="t18230625-75-deflabel433" type="occupation">milk the cows</rs>

I returned about half-past six o'clock, and found him in the front room, on the ground floor - the door being forced open, and he had the articles stated in the indictment in his hand, tied up in a table cloth. I laid hold of him, and asked what he had there? he said nothing. I have lodgers up stairs. The clothes are worth about 8 l. together, and were taken from my drawers; two of the coats had been worn some time; the other is nearly new. The staple of the door had been forced off. I gave him in charge; he was only a fortnight in my service. I did not enquire his character.</p>

On the 17th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, the prisoners came into the shop together, and asked to see some shawls - Hands looked at them, and offered 2 s. 6 d. for a 3 s. 3 d. one - a woman coming in accidently knocked down a pile of stuffs. Adamson said I need not trouble, she would pick them up and did so, replaced them, and returned to the counter. I suspected she had something under her clothes. They heard me send for a watchman, and Adamson tried to push by me to get out, and in so doing the stuff dropped from under her clothes, and caught by the selvige of her gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. It fell near the door - A. It fell from her I am positive; this shop is in Whitecross-street. My master lives in Holborn.</p>

I stood at the door, and directly he saw me, he asked for a penny worth of figs, and as he passed me at the door I asked where he got the penny pieces, which laid all along his arms - he said they were his own, and I let him go.

            , assignees - many creditors proved under the commission.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINGS. Q. Were the defendants examined before the commissioners - A. Several times, as appears by the proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the assignees go down to Worth, at any time and seize the goods in question - A. I have no knowledge of that, except as communicated to me as a solicitor. I was present at a trial at Horsliam, between Thatcher, against the assignees and the messenger's man, and was a witness. I gave directions after the trial for the goods to be delivered up, in pursuance of an agreement, between Mr. Lee, the defendant's attorney and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not on the trial agree, on the part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250039"/>assignees, that if the verdict was in favour of Thatcher, you would deliver up the goods to him - A. I have no recollection that I did, and do not believe that I did, for it was left as a question for the Jury to say, whether the goods were to be given up, independant of the trespass; I do not believe, that I made any arrangement at the time of trial. Mr. Lee's clerk called on me at the inn, after the trial, and stated that as the Jury had found a verdict for the plaintiff; he presumed I should not detain the goods. I said I should not subject my clients to another action for trespass, but intended to move for a new trial, and instructed a man who had possession of them, to demand them the moment he gave them up. Mr. Baley passed his last examination, on the 1st of March, 1823.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If Mr. Lee's clerk had come to you before the trial, would you have directed that the goods should be delivered up - A. Certainly not. I did so after the trial with a protest,</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that no arrangement took place previous to the verdict - A. I will not swear it, it might; but I do not believe that it did. A broker named Piper was employed to take an inventory of the goods, and he was afterwards employed by Baley, to make up his accounts. I was present at a meeting, when Piper gave some explanation to the accounts, but believe it was not on oath; I was only present part of the time. I asked Baley some questions relating to these goods; the Commissioners said they were not satisfied, but the question of property must be tried elsewhere. I believe my partner paid Thatcher's expences for attending the examination.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you call a witness to attend before the Commissioners, are you not obliged to pay his expenses - A. Certainly. The goods in question were at Worth, at the time of the trial, the messenger under the commission, was in the house with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Are you Mr. Stratton's brother - A. Yes. Mr. Groom the assignee, lives nearly opposite Gerrard's Hall tavern, Basing-lane, which Baley kept. I was at the inn repeatedly doing business on my own account. I went down to Worth one morning by coach. I was not present when any of these goods were packed. I saw a waggon at Worth, on Monday night and assisted in unloading them. I apprehend that some of it was wine by hearing bottles shake. I told my brother of this a week or a fortnight after. Worth is twenty-nine miles from town. Thatcher came down with the caravan, and said he had bought the goods of Baley. I told him to let me know when he paid Baley, because he owed me money; he said he had paid him, and could not help it - the goods were not concealed from me. I said I wanted to get the money paid, which was borrowed of my brother William. I went there to take dimensions for goods at the inn at Worth, of which Thatcher appeared the landlord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you sleep at Worth that night - A. Yes; Baley was a debtor of mine at the time. I went there to measure for goods, and merely lent a hand to unload - the waiter of Worth and the waiter of Gerrard's Hall, were there; it was about eleven o'clock at night. I told Thatcher at the time, that I was a creditor of Baley's, and he said he had got a few articles for his opening dinner. It was a newly established inn. I have signed Baley's certificate - my debt was 107 l. there was no piano-forte in the caravan.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The caravan arrived at eleven o'clock at night - A. Yes; it contained a good many hampers and boxes.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Baley, at Gerrard's Hall inn, before, and after his bankruptcy; he was a tavern keeper, wine and brandy merchant, and traded in wine and brandy. On Friday, the 18th of October last, about eleven o'clock in the morning, he desired me, if any person called, to say he was not within. Mr. Stratton and Mr. Walter called that morning; I knew they were creditors, and denied him to them; he was at home at the time. I informed him I had denied him; he did not blame me; he had told me to deny him, saying, he was ashamed to see so many people enquiring for money. The first time I saw Mr. Thatcher was in September last, when he came to Gerrard's Hall to enquire the character of a bar maid who had lived with Mr. Baley. They appeared then not the least acquainted; he called again in a few days, and resided at the house a night or two, and then went into the country again. When he first came he told me he had taken a new inn at Worth on the Brighton road, and shewed me a plan of the road; he staid at the house two or three days, at first as a guest, and had his meals in the coffee room; he afterwards had his meals in the bar; guests did sometimes dine in the bar. On Sunday evening, the 11th of October, I came home after eleven o'clock; Mr. Baley and Mr. Thatcher were sitting in the bar; the servants went to bed shortly after; I was called into the bar almost as soon as I came in; they seemed glad that I had come; Baley said they had a job they wished me to do for them; I went into the kitchen to supper; the servants went to bed, and Baley called me into the bar about twelve o'clock; they desired me to stay there, for they should want me bye and bye. They went up stairs for an hour or more, then called me up, and desired me to pack some china; there were things packed up before and after I went up; three or four dozen knives and forks, and a great many plated spoons and forks, dishes and covers, sheets, table cloths, crockery, and a silver punch ladle; they were all marked "Gerrard's Hall." The linen was marked with permanent ink. The packing continued till near three o'clock; the things were brought down into the passage leading to the coach office, which was the common passage of the inn. Baley said to Thatcher, "Here's a punch ladle, you may as well have that." Some writing paper was packed up among other things. A van was hired to convey them all to Worth; it was at the house by nine or half past nine o'clock. I and Thatcher went down to Croydon in a return chaise, and joined the van there about two o'clock, and went on with it to Worth; I saw the van call at Mr. Green's, in Bread-street, and know that it called at another place for goods which were never in Mr. Baley's possession. I assisted in taking the goods out of the van at Worth. Mr. Stratton and I returned to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250040"/>town together next day. The piano-forte and wine did not go down with these things.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday morning did any money pass between the defendants - A. Not at that time. I saw money pass between them once - I believe it was on the Wednesday following, or about that time. When I came to town on the Tuesday, two men were packing wine; there were several hampers, and it was sent off in a caravan to Worth. The piano-forte was taken away in Messrs. Clementi's caravan. I do not know where it was going; it was after I came from Worth, that I saw money pass between them - I saw twenty sovereigns at a time, on the bar table, and Thatcher had some more in a bag by his side. On the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday after I came from Worth, I was desired to send for some stamps; a printed pattern was given me to get some like it, but I think plain ones were got. I sent for them - two or three were got I think, but cannot say how many. I took them into the bar - (looking at some stamped receipts,) one like these was shewn to me as a pattern. I know these to be in Mr. Baley's hand writing. (Looking at a letter) this is also his writing. (Looks at a tin cash box;) Mr. Baley had a box like this in pattern and form.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Thatcher first came to enquire about a bar-maid for the inn he was going to start at Worth - A. Yes. I went out at eight o'clock on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not said that Thatcher wanted crockery, wine, and linen to open his inn with - A. Yes. When I first came in Baley was writing in the bar; they ordered more paper twice. They appeared to be taking an account of what things they were packing.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it not be very inconvenient at an inn, to be packing in the day time - A. Yes. The things were all taken up into the room on Saturday - the servants assisted in taking them up. The defendants might have packed them themselves if they chose. The hampers were placed in the passage, which was the most public part of the tavern. The servants and guests must have seen them, and persons in the street might have seen them. Mr. Groom lives nearly opposite. I saw Thatcher pass money to Baley. I was at the trial at Horsham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever ask Thatcher to buy wine - A. When he came about the bar-maid, he waited an hour before Mr. Baley came in; I asked him to take a glass of sherry - he said it was very good; I said I knew my master had a great quantity, and as he was going into business, he could serve him well - at that time my master had not seen him. Mr. Dibbin, the landlord was a creditor; the passage the goods were in leads to the coach office. I dare say the caravan stood before the door two hours being loaded; it might have been done in half an hour if they liked - it was in sight of Mr. Groom's house; two strange men packed the wine. Mr. Baley was at the London coffee-house six years with me; his general reputation was as an honest upright man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The goods were carried up on Saturday - A. I helped to carry some crockery up myself, and put them in the private dining-rooms. Nobody could tell what was in the hampers by seeing them; they were tied with strings. Baley kept a wine book; he merely kept the accounts of tavern dinners in it; it was intended for a wine book, but was not used as one. If I received orders for wine I entered them in it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not a permit book kept - A. Yes. Wine going out would be entered there by Baley.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever know a caravan hired to convey goods away before - A. No, my Lord. I have known wine sent out two or three hampers at a time. The wine was directed to Thatcher - I cannot say how many hampers there were; there should have been permits for all of it, or it is liable to be seized. The Excise officer comes once a fortnight. Some wine was sent to the West end of the town about the same time as this. I have seen wine sent in a cart to Mr. Clark, beyond Croydon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Baley leave himself materials to carry on his business without these - A. Yes; there was a large quantity of things. I have carried it on for the last seven months with what was left.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is not Mr. Dibbin ill - A. He has been ill along time, but was about when this happened; he always slept at Gerrard's Hall; the van was loaded in the street, not in the yard. It was common to load things in the street, but this was a private spring van - nothing is ever loaded from the waggon yard through the passage, except on Sundays, and after dark - the inn gates were open at the time.</p>

            . I am an ironmonger, and a creditor of Baley's; my brother managed the business with him. After the commission was issued, I went to his premises, and found the stock of wine materially reduced. I went down to Worth on the 7th of June, to the tavern, by the coach, with Mr. Groom and Clisby the messenger; we went into the parlour, took some refreshment and stopped there, and found Mrs. Thatcher, there - we called her in, in the evening and made a search, and found several dozens of wine in the cellar - we also found some table cloths marked. "Gerrard's Hall," at full length in indelible ink - the marks on the knives had been ground out - a double branch plated candlestick, and some spoons were all thrown together in a cupboard in the bar, some of them papered up and others not - they were not locked up. Mrs. Thatcher did not like to give up the keys, while Thatcher was out; the sheets we had on at night, were marked in the same way, and the pillow cases; some of the sheets had holes picked in them, as if there had been an attempt to pick the marks out - we found some French wine, and some soy and Noyeau, in a room at the top of the house. Mr. Groom brought a trunk which was opened in my presence, and in it was the tin box produced, these receipts, and this letter (looking at them) were also in it - we left the messenger in possession of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINS. Q, Your brother had informed you, of these goods going down to Worth, a long time before - A. He might say something about it, but I do not think he knew what they were - he did not tell me of it till just before I went down, not till after the commission was issued. The waiter took us into the cellar by Mrs. Thatcher's order; she would not let us go into her own bed-room - I think she said somebody was in bed there, and was very reluctant in admitting us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250041"/>to the room where the French wine was. I saw different goods in different rooms, marked "Gerrard's Hall." There might be twenty bottles altogether of French wine, Noyeau, and some soy. The house was furnished with new furniture - some linen in a washing-tub was marked "Gerrard's Hall;" there were two or three dozen knives in the room where we were; some of the marks were quite effaced - they all appeared to be rough ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Mrs. Thatcher knew perfectly well what you came about - A. Yes. The sheets we slept on were marked; we told her our business about seven or eight o'clock, and went to bed about nine or ten. The pillow I slept on had the mark picked out.</p>

            . I am a creditor of Baley's, and went to Worth with Mr. Stratton and Clisby, on the 7th of January, to the King's Arms, inn, kept by Thatcher; he was not at home. Clisby and I went to the house of one Whitehead, and found the tin box produced, in a box there - we brought it to the inn; Mr. Stratton forced the lock, and found these papers in it. We dined at the inn. The knives and table cloths were marked "Gerrard's Hall;" there appeared to have been an attempt to grind the name off the knives. In the evening we told Mrs. Thatcher our business, and searched the house, and found some plated goods and linen in the bar. We slept in a two bedded room; the bed linen was marked "Gerrard's Hall," and on other beds we found linen marked the same - some marks appeared as if an attempt had been made to take them out. I saw a grand piano there, which I had frequently seen at Gerrard's Hall. We left Clisby in possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Did Mr. Stratton remark the table cloth being marked - A. I dare say we talked about it. Some people who came in the coach lunched in the same room, and went on with the coach. I do not recollect seeing any linen not marked Gerrard's Hall; some of the marks were picked out, but part of the letters left left; several appeared torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the trial at Horsham, was it not agreed on both sides, that in the event of a verdict for the plaintiff the goods should be delivered up - A. I believe there was something of the kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your house is nearly opposite Gerrard's Hall - A. Yes. I was a creditor at the time the goods were moved.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You was only a creditor a few months before - A. No; he only commenced business in March, and never paid me any money.

            . I am messenger under the commission. On the 7th of January, I went to Worth, and found the principal part of the linen marked "Gerrard's Hall," and about ten dozen knives and forks, the marks in which had been ground down, but were visible. Some of the table linen appeared to be scraped. I found a quantity of plated candlesticks and branches thrown in the corner of the cupboard, like rubbish; I found a vast quantity of wine in the cellar, principally port; some wine and sauces in the top-room. I was left in possession a short time. Thatcher came down on the 9th, and on the 11th I was succeeded by another messenger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINS. Q. Did you take an inventory of the goods - A. No. I had no authority to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you know Gerrard's Hall goods - A. By the marks. There were no marks on the sheets or pillow I slept on.</p>

            . I was waiter at the Kings Arms at Worth from the time it opened. I remember goods coming down in the van early in October. Thatcher was not at home when they were opened; they contained crockery, plated goods, knives, forks, hard-ware, and a basket of linen was taken up stairs. "Gerrard's Hall" was stamped on the knives - there were some plated dessert forks; a very handsome castor stand, egg stands, two dozen tea spoons, ten candlesticks and branches, four plated dishes and covers, a dozen and a half of cups and saucers, a breakfast service, articles of china, and five or six dozen plates and dishes. I saw the linen afterwards - it was marked "Gerrard's Hall." I saw some of the table linen afterwards, smeared, so that I could not discover the mark as before. Thatcher saw them unpacked, and told me that they came from Gerrard's Hall. On the Thursday after that fifteen hampers of wine came down in the same van - I should think there were three or four dozen in each hamper; there was no wine in the house besides that, either before or after. Thatcher told me it came from Gerrard's Hall. A piano-forte afterwards came down in Messrs. Clementi's caravan. There were two or three pair of very coarse sheets, which did not come from Gerrard's Hall. There were no plated articles but what came from there. An opening dinner was proposed, but it did not take place; at the time it was to have been a quantity of knives were sent to a blacksmith, to erase the marks. Mr. Baley was at the King's Arms, inn before and at the time the piano came, he appeared at first as a guest, but afterward had intercourse with Mr. Thatcher, and did not at times conduct himself as a guest, particularly on the 9th of November, when he assisted in getting up the dinner - he used the piano-forte himself, and nobody else. I believe he kept the key; he was in town when the assignees came down. I saw a trunk brought from Whitbread's, who was Baley's servant; he lived a little below the King's Arms, inn. I directed the assignees to his house. I have seen the trunk they brought away in Baley's possession, at the King's Arms, (looking at a letter,) I have seen Thatcher write, and am sure this is his writing. I had known him about a fortnight before I went to live there; he wished me to deposit 150 l. in his hands, and take a share in the posting business. I had not the money, but deposited 20 l. as security for glass and my good conduct about three weeks after I entered his service, which was in September. I never saw any large sum in his hands; he was not an opulent man - quite the reverse. I was with him nearly five months, and got my 20 l. back, by three or four different payments, the last of which was 6 s.; I have lent him a pair of small clothes and a handkerchief at times, and particularly to wear when he went to take out his licence; application was frequently made for small sums of money, and not paid. Baley was at the house for two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250042"/>days together - a bill was made out for him, the first or second time of his coming, but was never paid. I received all bills, and never heard of this being paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. He dined in the bar - A. Sometimes. I never recollect customers dining in the bar, they have had bread and cheese there, and paid Thatcher for it; the goods were all used publicly at the inn - when I went into the house, there was nothing there but what was mine; some upholstery afterwards came down, and furniture from different people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Gerrard's Hall, was a well furnished inn - A. What rooms I have seen were; no furniture came from there except the piano. I only saw eight or twelve dozen of knives, all of which had the name erased. I frequently asked him for money before the assignees came, as I wanted to leave, as his situation did not suit me. I only waited to get my deposit. I never quarreled with him particularly. He once set Whitbread to carry a tub, and having hurt himself, I said he did not treat him like a christian.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether you quarreled or not, did he produce you as a witness at Horsham - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith, and live at Worth, at the latter end of the last year, I ground the marks out of about a hundred and fifty-six knives, for Thatcher; the marks were "Gerrard's Hall Tavern." I was told to grind it out; it was so deep in some, I could not, my charge was 3 s. 6 d.; I applied for it two or three times, but could not get it.</p>

            . I was formerly proprietor of the King's Arms-inn, at Worth. Thatcher took it of me without a premium. I saw Baley there when the piano arrived. I helped to carry it up; Baley said it was a fine piece of music and cost him 150 l.; he took the key from the man who brought it. I saw him about the house three or four times, and thought him a guest at first, but afterwards he appeared more like a master; he had fowls there, and bought corn of me which he paid for himself. Thatcher appeared to have no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You gave the place up to him - A. Yes; he had tap and all, and I became hostler. Thatcher was not present when Baley took the key of the piano.</p>

            . I know Thatcher; he had a farm in Berkshire, which he left at Lady-day, 1822; he told me his stock was taken for the rent; and when he took this inn, he said if somebody would lend him 500 l., he thought he should do better than at farming.</p>
               <p>The documents found in the defendant Baley's box were here read. There were three receipts to J. Thatcher, signed T. W. Baley, for the sums of 46 l. 11 s., 61 l. 4 s., and 30 l., for the various articles mentioned in the evidence, and another for 106 l. 10 s. for wines, with the bills annexed; also the following letter, proved to be in the band writing of the defendant Thatcher, the post mark of which was 11th of October, 1822, addressed to Mr. Baley, Gerrard's Hall, Basing-lane:-</p>
               <p>"White Horse Cellar.</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir - Not having the pleasure of seeing you before I left, I shall feel obliged to you or John to send thirty cards by Pearson's man, he will call for them, for the Gloster Coffee-house. I hope to see you by Monday morning, and hope you will, in the interval, get what cash you possibly can together, as every day is a great loss to us, as on Monday next I wish to have some refreshment ready for the coach, and if you have any thing you can send, Steadman calls on Tuesdays and Fridays: but whatever you do, for God's sake, keep it to yourself, and not let John or any one know our concerns, as it is for your own good hereafter, as you will always find I do every thing for the best interest of both parties, for if one do bad the other does the same, for it is like man and wife. I think I should tell John's wife, when you have done with her, she may go and see her friends for a few weeks, for the more strangers about us at first the better; they know nothing, and then there is no talking, and so you will find it.</p>
               <p>Yours, amp;c.</p>
               <p>"J. THATCHER.</p>
               <p>"P.S. I wrote this last night for the waiter to put in the post to-morrow, and destroy it as soon as read. Excuse haste: the ladies I shall employ are steady, middle-aged, and most respectable."</p>

             re-examined. My wife lived at Mr. Baley's in town; she is now lying in.</p>
               <p>MR. CUMMINS to MR. STRATTON. Q. When you went to Worth did you take possession of these goods on the supposition that Baley was in partnership with Thatcher - A. Not exactly so; we took possession of them because we found not only the bills, but the receipts in Baley's cash box, and therefore concluded if he had been paid for them he would not be in possession of the bills and receipts. I told the messenger to seize only those things marked "Gerrard's Hall," but he said he knew his business better than I did.</p>

Isaac said Holiday gave it him to take to Mitre-street; Holiday said he found them on a dung hill in the yard, and sent Isaac with them to Mitre-street, to the person who they belonged to. He is lame, and said he could not go after the thief.</p>

I could not re-place it for less than 1 l. Williams was three weeks in my service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Styles keeps a general tool mart - A. Yes; it is a very extensive warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it in the open warehouse - A. No; I went in, and asked for a rest - this was placed on another; several were shewn to me. I said I wanted one of great power; this one was not with the others, but stood on a lathe in the shop; there was nothing to conceal it, but it was not were the others were kept; it was shewn to me at last.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not bound over as a witness against Williams - A. He was bound over in bail to appear if a bill should be preferred against him, and if not, to give evidence. I told him I must indict him - he called me all the d - d rascals in the world, and said he had got out of my hands.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Levy. I saw the rest safe about a fortnight before it was lost. I went with him to Styles's; Williams was then in custody - I waited on the opposite side of the way, with the constable, and afterwards went over - my master asked to look at several tools; I saw the rest on a lathe in the middle of the shop, and knew it. Styles said he bought it of Williams (mentioning his name,) for 2 s.; my master could not get one under 1 l. They are often sold without a lathe. It stood by itself; the others were another lathe or two off. He asked my master 12 s. for this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Without a lathe it is of no use for general purposes - A. It cannot be used without a lathe, and is of little use without one, but is valuable as it is difficult to get one to fit; he might have it on hand for years. The foreman attended to us, but Styles was just by; the foreman said to him, "This has been stolen;" he said, "I am sorry for it, I know who I bought it of" - he crossed the shop then, and came and told me the name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You allowed him to go up stairs to dress - A. Yes. The Magistrate permitted him to go at large from time to time. He said Williams told him it was his father's property, and Williams did not deny it.</p>

               <p>STYLES'S Defence. This is a wicked and unfounded charge. I have been thirty years in business, and conducted it in an upright manner. The prisoner came and said he had an old iron rest which belonged to his father, who was dead, and he had had it twelve years. I said he might bring it, which he did in quarter of an hour. I have people to prove it can be manufactured new for 5 s. I told the prosecutor I was an honester man than ever stood in his shoes - he said, "I'll work you for that, I'll stick to you."</p>

            . I am foreman to Styles. I was present when Williams brought this rest into the shop, and asked Styles 2 s. 6 d. for it. Styles asked if he was sure it was his own; he said it was, that he had it before he was apprenticed, and had it twelve years, and it was his father's, before he died. Styles gave him 2 s. for it; it is old cast iron and not complete without the lathe, and is incomplete as a rest; there is no tye screw to it, which would cost three or four shillings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did it cost to make it - A. About 4 s. 6 d. He brought it between three and four o'clock in the day - it was put on a lathe in the middle of the warehouse, every body must see it; it was the first one I shewed to Levy when he came. I produced the book in where I entered it; when we bought it we did not enter the persons name, as we did not know it till Levi told us. I shewed him several rests, at 8 s. and 10 s. each, they were complete. I asked him 12 s. for this, but then we were to make it complete. I should not have asked him so much but he was a Jew, and has bought things of us before, and I have lost the sale of goods, because I did not ask him a price that would allow beating down. I cannot say what articles he has been for; there is the entry of it in the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you buy nothing but on Monday, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250044"/>no article is entered on any other day - A. He entered the whole week's purchases under Monday - we bought these on Monday.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched on Sunday the 18th, before seven o'clock in the morning, and traced the blood all the way from the out-house to Enfield; within a hundred yards of Rainbird's house, which is about two miles from Mr. Nash's. Mead was with me; we found Rainbird at home, and a quantity of blood all over his clothes, and a quantity of liver and lights on the table, and some frying on the fire, which I knew to be deer's flesh - we handcuffed him. Mead opened the cupboard door and found three deer's legs; two of a buck and one of a doe. Mead brought down two long quarters of venison - we found one skin and a head hanging up in the back wash-house, and the entrails in a washing tub, and on a dung-hill near his house, we found six shanks. Lawrance claimed the skin and head directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you mean to say, there was a tract of blood for two miles - A. Yes; there were intermissions of two or three yards, and then blood again. I found part of the deer's pluck at his father's.</p>

I saw the prisoner close behind me, and another behind him. I seized and charged him with picking my pocket; he denied it, but I saw my handkerchief in his left hand, while I was turning round; he was passing it to his companion, but dropped it. I picked it up, and recognized him, as having attempted my pocket a few hours before - the other went off.</p>

I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him, and went to Hatfield's lodging - we found him coming out, and in the room in which his brother lodged, found some gold sweepings tied in a blue handkerchief. I sifted it, and found 1 oz. 2 dwts. of gold among it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where are the sweepings put - A. They are put in the forge, and burnt before they are washed; this had been burnt. He knew the value of it.</p>
               <p>ANN EAST. My husband is a porter. About half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw Cummings let Hatfield into his master's premises - I was in care of the next house; one of them spread a handkerchief on the passage floor. I pushed the door open, and saw them put the sweep washings into the handkerchief; Hatfield called me an old b - h, and told me to go and mind my own business. Cummings staid in the house, and I followed Hatfield with the bundle some distance - he dared me to go and see where he took it. I left him in Clerkenwell, and told Mr. Marsh about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see where it was taken from - A. There was a tub, pestal, and mortar in the passage; nobody is allowed to go through the passage while the sweepings are being fined. He said if I followed him much further I should get myself into a scrape.</p>

I observed him for quarter of an hour, followed him out of the mob, seized him, and told him I had seen him take a pocket-book out of a gentleman's pocket, which I had; but cannot say who the gentleman was. I found this pocket-book in his left hand pocket, with Mr. Butt's address in it - he said he picked it up.</p>
