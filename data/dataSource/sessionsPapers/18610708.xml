On Saturday-night, 18th May, I was with my wife and some other persons in a pie-shop in Fleet-street—I was quite sober—the prisoner was in the shop, and two other persons—I and my wife were seated on on one side of a table, and the prisoner and his companions on the other—I believe the prisoner was quite sober—some vulgar word was used which was offensive to my wife—I told the prisoner he ought to know better than to use such language to a female; whereupon he got up and struck me in the mouth—upon that a police-constable was called in, and I gave him in charge; but the policeman would not take him, as he was not there to witness the assault—I and my wife then went out of the shop, leaving the others there, and when we had nearly got home I heard a run and a whistle behind me—I turned round and saw the prisoner—he said, "One at a time," and knocked me down—he struck me on the shoulder—there were several other persons round at the time; but he is the man that struck me—I got up again—he had his coat off—he struck me in the mouth, and knocked me down—it was a hard blow with his fist—whilst I was on the ground he kicked me in the ancle—I saw him raise his leg and kick me—I saw that distinctly—my leg was broken by it—I was not sure at the time that it was broken, but I felt very ill—I could not get up—I called out to my wife, "He has kicked me," and we gave him in charge—I was taken to the hospital, and there found that my leg was broken—I remained there three weeks and three days, and am now an out-patient—my leg is now going on very favourably—I had known nothing of the prisoner until that night.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I was with my husband on Saturday-night, 18th May, in the pie-shop in Fleet-street—something was said to me by some person, and my husband interfered—the man struck my husband in the pie-shop—the shopman said he would not have any fighting there; they could go outside if they liked, and fight it out—as we were going home we heard a whistling, as of two or three parties, and when we got two or three doors from Bouverie-street the parties ran behind us—one of them said, "One at a time"—my husband turned round, and the prisoner struck him and knocked him down—I assisted my husband to rise to his feet, and the prisoner struck him and knocked him down again—Evans made an attitude to strike him in the face—I took hold of him, and held him off from striking my husband's face, but I do not know what he did with his feet—I was behind him, and did not see his feet—my husband commenced groaning, and saying he had been kicked, and said, "Oh, my leg!"—he was quite sober—I am quite sure he did not touch Evans before he was struck.</p>

On 17th June, about half-past 9 in the morning, I was in Fore-street, and met a procession with three banners and a band—I stood to look at it, and felt somebody near me pressing against me—I found the prisoner with my watch in one hand and my chain in the other, separating them—he took my watch and made off—I followed him, over-took him, and he threw me down—I caught him by the trousers' leg, and held him tight till he was taken in custody—my watch was picked up in the road—I did not see him throw it away.</p>

I was on duty in Cheapside, on Saturday afternoon, 29th June—I did not hear the cry—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling with each other, the prisoner trying to get away from the prosecutor—I crossed over and caught hold of the prisoner immediately—the prosecutor said, "He has got my watch, policeman"—I asked him if he saw him take the watch from his pocket—he said, "No; but I saw the hand of the one that had taken it, pass it to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "I have not taken it"—I took the prisoner in custody—a person in the crowd said, so that the prisoner could hoar it, "It is all</p>

I am a miller, carrying on business at Denham, near Uxbridge—I have been in the habit of dealing with the defendant for some years—I am in the habit of attending Uxbridge-market on Thursdays—on 11th June last, I purchased 200 quarters of wheat from the defendant in Mark-lane, at 68<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—I bought it by sample—in the first instance I bought 200 quarters in the bulk, and on 11th June he offered me 200 quarters of very fine wheat, which I purchased—at that moment, he said it was in the farmer's barn—I was full of wheat at that time, and told him so—I said I did not want it at present, I could not take it, and would he keep it for me—he said it would suit him better; he was in no hurry to deliver it—none of it was delivered up to 10th September—I then saw the defendant again in Mark-lane, and he asked me to give him 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of it—I gave him a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he had the wheat; that it was all right, all safe; that it was in his possession quite safe—I cannot say the precise words he used; but he said it was quite safe, because I objected to give him so much money on account, he owing me a considerable sum besides; and he said it was quite safe in his possession, that it would be all right, and in good condition—he used the words "in his possession"—perhaps "possession" might not have been the word he used—I think he said it was in his warehouse—I consider that the same—I believed at that time that it was in his warehouse, or in his possession—I gave him the cheque because he said he had the wheat—I told him to deliver 50 quarters of it—he said he would—he did not do so; he only delivered 25, and that he did not deliver till several days after I requested him to do so—he said he was very busy at the time, delivering wheat—I heard of his difficulties on 8th November, and on the 9th I went and saw him at his own house at Uxbridge—I told him I had heard that he was in difficulties, and I wanted to know where my wheat was—he said it was gone, he had not got it—I asked him if he had any wheat of his own that he could substitute for that—he told me he had 41 1/2 quarters which he could let me have—I sent for it to his warehouse at Uxbridge, but did not get it—I got no other than the 25 quarters I have spoken of.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe it is the duty of all the clerks to honour cheques over the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two—there are two cashiers, and when one was away it was the duty either of Mr. Holl or myself, before the discovery of the fraud, to take the cashier's place—generally speaking, there were only two clerks who honoured cheques: but if one was out of the way, another clerk might assist—a clerk honouring a cheque over the counter, has the means of referring to the calendars or the ledger, to see whether the account is over<lb/>drawn; he would there see whether the person who had drawn a cheque, had a balance to his credit, unless it was not cleared; but if the amount had been paid in bank notes or gold, the cheque would be paid at once—each clerk as he pays a cheque makes an entry, in the paying-book, of the details—he enters the name, the amount, and how he paid it—it would not invariably happen that the same person who paid the cheque made the entry, because on Saturday, when the bank is very full, another person might assist; but the usual course is for the same hand which pays the money to make the entry—accounts are occasionally overdrawn by the authority of the manager—I know of instances of clerks paying cheques for which there are no effects in the bank—the usual course in that instance is to write to the party to rectify the error as soon as possible—I do not remember any instance where the error has been unable to be rectified.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a memorandum</hi>)—he owed 4,147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his deficiency was 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the result of that would be, that he must have lost and paid 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of profits and out of assets—if his bad debts were 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his deficiencies 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. supposing he had started with nothing and had got nothing left, he must, in that case, have made 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of profits in the interim, or had 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent him, or something of that kind—I do not know how that was, as I did not prepare a profit and loss account showing the profits on the sales.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The evidence of this witness, given on the former trial, was read over, to which he assented, and added</hi>)—The first item of cash paid and exclusive of transfers from Durdin's account, and bills discounted, was on 20th May, 1852, the account being opened on 2d December, 1851, with 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Currie's—after that time, on 27th December, the next cash was Durdin's cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the next a short bill of Durdin's on 12th April—on 15th April here is a transfer from Holcroft put down as cash for that short bill which had been in the first instance returned on 5th May; cash from Currie's to Durdin's account 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that is the first money paid to the account—allthese items on the right hand margin are the sums; mo. means money—without going through all the accounts, I find that from time to time Durdin's account is credited for cheques, from Holcroft, and Holcroft for cheques by Durdin—here are no fictitious entries; not what are called so—I show that entries are fictitious by their passing through his cash-book, in<lb/>stead of their paying them as they would if they had been money—there are many fictitious entries about this period—I have a list of them for each year from 1851—in 1851 the false credits were 1,316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he has abstracted sums to the extent of 4,730<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as for cheques drawn by Joel, Richards, and others—in the year 1852, 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether was the amount of frauds; in 1853, 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1854, 5,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1855, 5,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1856, 2,350; in 1857, 8,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1858, 12,243<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1859, 10,109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1860, 9,951<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1861, 1,047<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—from the closing of Durdin's ac<lb/>count these amounts were carried through Holcroft's account—all this was done by means of Holcroft's account from the closing of Durdin's account in 1853—I have also traced from time to time cheques by Holcroft placed at the Deposit Bank to Durdin's account—we have only the pass-books for a short time, so that I cannot say to what extent; but in a number of instances, some hundreds in the year 1860, and there are some cases of Holcroft's account credited by cheques drawn by Durdin on his own account at the Deposit Bank—during 1860 there are 185 items of return cheques of Holcroft's for bills entered in this book, amounting to 11,030<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But that balancing, I apprehend, does not consist of counting the money actually in the drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the balancing of the money is quite a separate thing altogether—the balancing the money is the balancing of the cashier's money which is carried into the balance quite in a separate manner—the notes and gold we balance every night to a penny—we do that by comparing what we have paid out with what we have received—that is the result we arrive at by comparison of certain figures in certain books.</p>
               <p>

My husband is an artist's colourman, and keeps a shop at 49, Dorset-street, Marylebone—on 8th June, the female prisoner came about a quarter to 5 o'clock, and asked for sixpenny worth of moulding wax—I told her I had it, but my husband was out, and I did not know where it was—she said she would call on Monday for it—she asked for threepennyworth of burnt umber, dry—we had none dry—I told her we had it in oil colours and in tubes—she said, "You have threepenny sticks of Indian ink?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I will take one"—I gave her one—she tendered a half-crown—I thought it looked very bad when she put it down; I tried it, and it bent—I told her it was bad, and she said, "I suppose I have taken it in change at Epsom"—I asked her if she was the person that gave Mr. Eatwell a bad two shilling piece three weeks before—she said she had not been in the shop for five months—I said, "Very well, a person has been passing bad money, and I shall send for a policeman"—I knocked, and in the course of a few minutes one of our men came to the door, and I sent him for a policeman—the prisoner said, would not my neighbours fetch me a policeman; should she fetch one herself—I told her to be so good as to keep her seat—she said yes, she would walk into my parlour—by that time the policeman came—I told him I had served her with a threepenny stick, and that she had given a bad half-crown, and if he thought she was guilty I would give her in charge—he said he could not tell without trying—he asked her where she lived—she said in Berwick-street, Soho—I told her it was a long way for her to come for a threepenny stick of Indian ink—she said she had friends living by—I gave her in charge, and gave the policeman the half-crown and the two shilling piece that was given to my husband on 10th May—I was not present on 10th May—it was the two shilling piece that was marked by Sergeant White on 10th May.</p>

Early in the month of May I saw the two prisoners in High-street, Marylebone, standing together in con<lb/>versation—I saw Palmer take a packet from his pocket, break it open, and give the female prisoner a coin—after that he left her, and went to Mr. Ensoll's shop, a draper, in High-street, and was looking in at the window—the woman followed, and went into the shop—I watched until she came out—she was there about eight or nine minutes—when she came out she returned the same way that she had come; down High-street, towards South-street—the man stopped at the window for about a minute and a half after she came out, and then followed her and joined her at the corner of South-street and High-street—I kept them in sight till they got to Win<lb/>chester-street—they stopped in the middle of the street in conversation, and I passed them, and saw the man give the woman another coin in her hand—they parted, and when at the corner of Dorset-street and East-street the male prisoner made a nod with his head, and the female prisoner went into Mr. Eat well's shop—she was there about five minutes—upon her coming out I went in and saw this counterfeit florin, which I marked—when I came out of there I looked for the two prisoners, but could not find them—I believe that was about 10th May—on 8th June I saw them together in High-street, Marylebone, about half-past 4 o'clock—I was not able to follow them then—about a quarter to 6 o'clock, that same afternoon, I was going to the station-house, and saw the male prisoner smoking a pipe about fifty yards from the station—I had heard of a woman being in custody, and a descri<lb/>ption was given—on nearing the station I saw the male prisoner walking up and down smoking a pipe in Wigmore-street, about fifty yards from the station door—I went across to him, took hold of both his hands, which were in his pockets, told him I was a police-sergeant, and was going to take him in custody—he asked me what for—I said for being concerned with a woman who was at the station, whom he knew, with uttering counterfeit coin—he said, "I will not go, I am a respectable man, and I will make you pay for it"—he resisted greatly—after some trouble I got him into the station-house—upon searching him, I found thirteen sovereigns, one crown piece, nine half-crowns, one florin, one shilling, one sixpence, threepence farthing in copper, good money, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—that was found in sundry pockets—ten sovereigns in one pocket, three sovereigns in a pocket-book, and the silver and coppers in another pocket—I searched his coat pockets, where I found a railway guide, two handkerchiefs, a boy's leather belt, a piece of calico, a piece of black net, a cotton stay lace, a stay hook, two skeins of cotton, a small new piece of Turkey sponge, six steel pens, a knife, tobacco and pouch, three pencils, a mackerel, some fennel, two mutton chops in separate papers, a rasher of him, three papers of gooseberries, and a quantity of memorandums—all his pockets were full of the things—I asked</p>

I was called to this house in Northampton-street, on Tuesday 25th, about half-past 6—I went into the prisoner's room—Mrs. Faulkner was against the door-way—I saw the prisoner lying on the bed, and the children in the bed—Mr. Sutherin came just after I arrived—I shook the prisoner by his direction, but I could not make her speak; some remedies were administered to the deceased child, but he did not revive—I heard Mr. Sutherin put to the prisoner, "What you given the children?" he put the question a second time, and she said, "Laudanum"—I then searched the room—I saw Mr. Sutherin pick up this bottle off the mantel-piece; the other one I found in the cupboard—the one Mr. Sutherin picked up was marked "laudanum"—the label on the other bottle was torn off—after I had conveyed them to the workhouse, I searched the room again, and between the sheet and the bed I found this letter—I do not know the prisoner's handwriting—I never saw her before that evening, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeon, and reside at Aldenham-terrace, St. Pancras-road—I had seen the prisoner about a fortnight prior to this transaction—I went to her house because her child was ill—I believe that was the child who is the subject of the present inquiry—I prescribed for it then—the prisoner was under the impression that it had the measles, but there was no rash whatever—I saw the child twice on the following day, but there was nothing much the matter with it—I was sent for to see the child on Tuesday evening, 25th June, a little after half-past 6—I found it lying on the bed insensible—there were three others on the bed, the prisoner and two other children—the two other children were sitting up—the younger child was quite drowsy, and nodding its head apparently in a sleepy state, and more or less suffering from some</p>

               <p>narcotic poison; at least, I was under that impression—the three children presented appearances which led me to believe they had had something administered to them—the prisoner was insensible at that time—I had the deceased child taken out of bed and placed on the lap of Mrs. Dawes, or Mrs. Faulkner, I cannot say which—I endeavoured to restore it by stimu<lb/>lants, and by slapping it, and the application of cold water, and other means, the usual remedies—the pupils were contracted to a point at the time, and its breathing scarcely perceptible, and the pulse could scarcely be detected at the wrist—I infer from those symptoms that the child was labouring under some narcotic poison—it died on the same evening, about half an hour afterwards—I subsequently made a post mortem examination, and from its appearance then I was confirmed in my opinion—the stomach was secured and sent to Dr. Letheby—in the mean time it was in the custody of another medical man who assisted me at the post mortem, and also at 15, Northampton-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say you had attended this child before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; about a fortnight before the 25th June, the mother came to me for medicine for the child, and seemed exceedingly anxious about it—she seemed to be a very solicitous and affectionate mother—I cannot answer whether the poor people in that neighbourhood are in the habit of using laudanum when their children are affected—I don't know that from my own experience—I have seen children under the influence of laudanum—I know what Dalby's carminative and Godfrey's cordial is—that is used by mothers occasionally to soothe their children and prevent their crying—I do not think it is so much used as it was formerly—they know better—in in my own experience, I have found laudanum operate differently on different children of the same age—some children may take with impunity a very large dose, and another child would be killed with a quarter of it; but it is a dangerous thing—it would depend a great deal upon whether the stomach was empty or full, that would make a great deal of difference—I have known instances of persons using a preparation of laudanum to soothe their children, I mean Godfrey's Cordial—I keep a druggist's shop—I sell laudanum, but not to children for that purpose—grown-up people frequently come and purchase it—it is a popular medicine for coughs, mixed with vinegar—a good deal of laudanum is sold ordinarily to people—the little girl, two years of age, recovered; she vomited—the eldest boy was sitting on the bed when I went in—he was not long in coming to; he had vomited.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 28th June, I received a parcel from Mr. Sutherin, in which was the stomach of a child—I also received the smaller intestines—I examined the contents and found that the stomach and intes<lb/>tines were both quite healthy, and in a sound condition as regards their structure; but on analysis they both yielded the constituents of opium, which are found in laudanum—I could not say anything about the quantity—there were no traces of any other poison—I am not able to say anything about the cause of death, without reference to the symptoms and the post mortem appearances; having heard those, I then can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose if a child took a sufficient quantity to kill it, it would probably die of that complaint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined. Q.</hi> You found no solid food in the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—laudanum varies in its effect on persons according to their constitu<lb/>tions and a variety of circumstances—some persons may take it with perfect impunity, and others would sink under it; it depends on various circum<lb/>stances—with regard to organic poisons, that which is found in the stomach is over and above the quantity that has killed, if death has arisen from it—therefore, that has no reference to the quantity taken, or that has caused death, because that which has causeddeath is absorbed into the system, and has got out of the stomach into the general circulation, and has passed beyond our reach—morphia is given by medical men in some cases to counteract disease—it requires extreme caution in administering to children anything that has morphia in it, or opiate of any kind—ten or fifteen drops of laudanum would perhaps be sufficient to kill a child of that age, with an empty stomach, prostrated or weakened by want of food—ten drops I should look upon as a fatal quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would it take to absorb that into the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half or three quarters of an hour, upon an empty stomach—if a person took a dose quite insufficient to kill, and died a violent death from some other cause in the course of twenty minutes or half an hour, I could not say positively whether or not you would find traces of it in the stomach or intestines; you might or might not—what I said, was that when you find poison in the stomach, that which you find there has perhaps had nothing to do with the death; but that which has killed has gone out of the stomach into the circulation, and is beyond our reach—that is always the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming that the death was caused by laudanum, are in you, from the quantity you found in the stomach, able to form an opinion as to the quantity that was administered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the action of a poison is upon the brain, and it must reach the brain before it produces its effect, and when it gets into the brain we can no longer find it; that, therefore, which is in the stomach is not that which has killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether it kills or not, I suppose at some time or other it gets to the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it is absorbed—absorption may take place in half an hour; that would be the case if a dose were taken insufficient to kill, and a person died from some other cause—it may or may not be all absorbed—that which was aborbed certainly would not be in the stomach; if there was any not absorbed, that would be found in the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Morris, and live at 5, James-gardens, Chapel-street—on Sunday evening, 21st April, at twenty-five minutes to 9, I was passing Mr. Higgins' shop—I observed the door wide open—I did not see any person inside—I saw Mary Ann go in at the door—I went about seven houses past and then returned and heard a very great scuffling in the shop—I did not know whether it was in play or earnest—I listened and walked up and down the shop, and I heard her say, "Fred, Fred, pray don't hurt me; pray don't hurt me!" at least twenty times—I then heard two heavy blows given with what I thought was a chopper—I heard the chopper thrown, and at that time there was a light burning, but when the chopper was thrown the light was lowered—that was a gaslight—</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn-road—Mary Ann Redkisson was brought there on the night of 21st April, about 9 o'clock—she has remained in the hospital from that time to the present—she had a very extensive wound on the nose; it was a lacerated wound, cutting through all the structures of the nose—there was a wound on the right side of the temple, cutting through the bone in an oblique direction, and penetrating the skull—there was another wound on the back of the head, cutting through what we call the outer table of the skull—that only cut through the outer surface of the skull—the other two wounds cut through the bone itself—the one on the side of the temple cut through the whole structure of the bone—there was also a wound on the left wrist and another on the fore-finger of the right hand—the wound on the skull exposed the membranes of the Drain—the wounds on the nose and head I should say would be likely to be produced by a chopper; and those on the finger and wrist by a knife—her life was in danger, and continued so for some time—I am afraid the use of the fore-finger is permanently impaired.</p>

               <p>said he had nit her a broad face—I hardly know how to describe the face to you; if I may be allowed the expression I used to the policeman, it was a three cornered face, wide across the eyes, and coming down rather narrow at the chin—the great peculiarity was the three-cornered face and the hair—I was not above two feet from the men as I followed them—I did not speak to them when they stopped; I stepped up to them, and it was then that I saw what they had grot—I stood for a moment, when Quilter turned his head over his shoulder and looked me full in the face—I thought he was about to strike me, and I stepped back—it appears that they were about to change hand—that did not occupy more than a minute, perhaps not so much—the gas was lighted, and they stopped immediately opposite the lamp-post, in the road, rather near the lamp-post—there were plenty of people passing and repassing—I did not speak to any one, or draw any one's attention to this—I did not see a policeman; if I had seen one, I should have told him that I had suspicion—I did not look for one—it was about half-past 8 on the Monday night following that I communicated to the police what I had seen—that was the first time I mentioned it to those two men; or, rather, the policemen came to me about it—I had previously mentioned it to the police man at the prosecutor's shop-door on the Sunday night—he asked my address, and I gave it—I did not give any description of the men to him; that was on the Monday night—I was not asked for it on the Sunday; I was on the Monday—I recognized Liney as a man who had worked for Mr. Higgins—I recognized him at the time I saw them put the box down, and then I concluded in my own mind that it was all right, he worked there—I had no we him working at Mr. Higgins's; I can't say for how long—I have been in the habit of passing by there twice a day, and I had seen him there—I will not say that I knew he worked there at that time; I knew that he had at one time—I did not know his name—I know Mr. Higgins—I was not in the habit of going to his house—I told the policeman that the man had worked at Mr. Higgins's at some time, if he did not then, for I had seen him there so frequently—I mean to swear that I told the policeman that one of the men had worked at Mr. Higgins's—I have always said so—I told that on the Monday night to the policeman to whom I gave the description.</p>

               <p>one came and told him to knock three times—he knocked three times, and the party he asked for was not at home—he then got inside the cab, and they told me to drive to the Crown public-house on Pentonville-hill—I drove there, and we had a pot of half and half, which Liney fetched—I drank some—we stayed there about five or six minutes, and Strugnell then wished them "good-night," and went off—I never saw him from that day till I saw him down at Clerkenwell—after he left, the other prisoners told me to go to Camden-town—I went there—they pulled me up at a public-house—we had a pot of half-and-half there, and we all had a smoke together—we were there about a quarter-of-an-hour—they then ordered me to drive back to South ampton-street, to the corner, to South-street, where I had previously called—they said the party was not at home—they stopped there, and smoked a pipe, and waited till they did come—they paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my fare—each gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and they took the box put, and took it to the comer of South-street.</p>

               <p>at a quarter to 8 in the evening, the prisoners came to my surgery—Williams asked for a pennyworth of sal volatile—I asked for a bottle, and he said, "We will drink it here"—I gave it him and he drank it—the prisoner Stone then tendered me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in payment—I immediately tried it, and found it was bad—I went round, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket—as I turned round from locking the door, I saw Stone withdraw his hand from a shelf or small frame which is in my surgery—they both asked for change—I said, "I will send for a policeman, he will give you the proper change"—I then sent for a constable and gave him the bad florin—when they had been taken away, I looked behind this frame where Stone's hand went, and found five other florins in a paper parcel—I took them down to the station when I charged the prisoners, marked them all, and gave them to the same policeman who had the first piece.</p>

               <p>one, and I think the lame man was the other, but I would not be quite positive—I was obliged to keep a little way from them because they are a dangerous lot—I followed to see what became of her, knowing the con<lb/>sequences—I followed them to another beer shop at the corner of Hastings, street, looking all the time each way to see if I could meet a constable to inform him—in going from the one house to the other, Hawkins wag carrying the parasol; he took it from her again outside the door and carried it under his arm—they stayed a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes in the beer shop—I remained outside at the further corner—before they came out, Hawkins put the parasol down his trousers and buttoned his coat over it, and then he and the lame man assisted her, and Flaherty and Batchelor followed—while they were in the beer-shop a female with red hair came and called Hawkins and gave him a bottle, it was a very short thick-necked bottle, not like a phial, it was very short and stumpy, more like a pomatum pot in shape—I could not see the contents of the bottle—Hawkins put his cap between his knees, put his hand on the top of the bottle and wiped it on his head, but I saw nothing wet; he then took a comb out, and appeared to be combing his hair, he looked about and I drew further back fearing I should be seen—he then went to where the men were having some beer, and moved his arm as if he was putting something into it, and then handed it to the female to drink, and the rest, all she did not drink, they threw out of the pot into the road—Batchelor and Flaherty were outside the house at this time, the lame man was inside—the girl then drank out of the quart pot, and then slipped back quite helpless into the street; they threw the remainder of the beer into the street, and had a fresh pint for themselves—she was so helpless that Hawkins and the lame man had to lead her, with her legs or feet dragging upon the ground—they took her down to the middle of the first court—Flaherty said, "It is all right, come on," and in the court Flaherty took off her cloak and gave it to another female, and then the four went into a room with her, the three prisoners and the lame man, and the blinds were drawn down—there were screams of murder, and I went for the police immediately—I went to the police station direct when I heard her call murder—this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is very similar to the one I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I reside at Clapham, and am a merchant's clerk. About 11 o'clock, on 2d July, I was walking near the Bank—the prisoner came very close to me, and asked me where I was going—I replied that I wished to go home—she then asked me if she could go with me—I replied, "I do not believe they will allow a young lady in the hotel I am stopping at—she then asked me if I would not go with her—I said, "No; I am going home"—she then asked me if I would give her something to drink—I replied, "I have had sufficient to drink to-day"—during that time she managed to get me up a small turning—she made some other observation' to me which I do not like to express—she then asked me how much. I would give her: I did not make any reply—she wished me to take liberties with her, which I refused—I then felt some<lb/>thing at my waistcoat pocket—I immediately felt, and missed my watch—I had seen it there a couple of minutes previously, I bad it in my hand to see what time it was—as soon as I missed it I caught the prisoner by the arm, and accused her of robbing me of my watch—she said, "Silly man, I have not got your watch"—I said, "You have"—a young man then came towards us, and begged of me to let go of her—he wanted to push himself between us—he said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "This girl has robbed me of my watch"—he said, "That cannot be possible"—I said that it was the case—the man said, "If that is true I will go and fetch a policeman"—I then distinctly saw the prisoner hand over something to him, and he ran off—the prisoner then begged of me and tried all her exertions to get out of my grasp—I dragged her into the open street, and gave her in charge.</p>

Henry Waithman and another, of Gresham-street—they have a warehouse on the ground floor and on the basement—on Saturday afternoon, 8th June, I left about 3 o'clock, and locked the outer door—there are safes in the lower warehouse, where property is kept—I then went to Alderman's-walk, Bishopsgate, and purchased a book—I then went back to the office to get an envelope to send it in—I found the key go very stiff, and had to kick the door to make it open—there was a kind of stiffness in the lock which was not there before—on opening the outer door I observed a parcel lying on a hale of goods in the counting-house leading to the warehouse—I thought it was not there when I went out, and unfastened the side of it—it was what I supposed to be the tops of new boots—I knew it did not belong to anybody in our place—it was afterwards found to contain some large black sheets of oil-cloth, three leather straps, and some string—I heard footsteps, and retired backwards till I came in view of the private room, and there were the two prisoners in a stooping position—I walked up to them, and asked what business they had there; they said, "We saw the door open, and we walked in"—I said, "Then you had better stop in, for I shall lock the door"—I retired backwards towards the inner door, and on opening it, Williams led the way down to the basement warehouse—I thought he had been there before, seeing the way he went down; so I went and gave the alarm, fearing that the area door had been opened, to secure the front—I got assistance, returned to the office, and saw them come up from below, finding that they could not escape—I then walked round to the inner room and turned the key.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did they do coming from the basement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They rushed to the private door—there was a key inside that door; they turned that to open the door, and escaped into the passage, when I secured them both; but McGuire got away from me, and Chaplin and Homes man being in the passage I told him to secure him—they were afterwards given into the custody of the police, who came up—I was present when the policeman discovered the keys and the parcel—I am sure they are the two men.</p>

               <p>when you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I locked the outer door leading when I left, the door to the passage—an iron gate leads into the area in Old Broad-street—the door leading to Old Broad-street was left open—no one could get into the office that way—that is the door into the corridor; it is a free passage; hundreds go through that way—they cannot get access into the premises that way unless they have keys—the door I locked is the only door into the premises—the windows were closed—I did not close them—there are bars before them inside, and the shutters are iron-bound; nobody could get in—I do not know whether the other clerks have a key to the place—there are six clerks; one of them is here—I was away about half an hour—I will swear it was not an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me the situation of Waithman's. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is an outer door that is locked in the evening at 6 or 7 o'clock, that leads into a small passage which leads into Waithman's office—it is in Broad-street, on the right-hand side coming down from the Royal Exchange—the entrance is in Gresham-house, the first passage to the right—there is no other entrance—the corridor is the centre passage of Gresham-house, which leads from Bishopsgate-street to Old Broad-street—the entrance door of the office is in that corridor, in the passage to the right—by the outer door I mean the entrance to the office; the inner door is a glass door close to the outer door; in fact, there are double doors to the premises, inner and outer—there is another-door leading to the area, but you cannot enter it from the outside—the area is in front of Old Broad-street, on the basement—the private door leads to Mr. Waithman's private room, into which they went to secrete themselves when they heard the noise—they rushed to the private door, which was locked, turned the key, opened it, and went in—the private door differs from the outer door; one is inside and the other outside; it leads to the passage, and the passage leads to the corridor—it opens into the passage from the inside—when I left I locked the outer door—I did not lock the inner glass door; there is no lock to it—I locked the private door imme-diately before I left; I turned the handle—it could not be left open, because it closes with a spring.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been confidential clerk for fifteen years to Messrs. Waithman—I know the premises well—there is a corridor which leads from Broad-street right through to Bishopsgate-street—there is one entrance to the premises from Broad-street—there is another door on the right-hand side, which leads to offices up stairs and areas on the ground floor—if you come out of the street, there is a door on the right hand side; then go in there, and there is a small hall or warehouse with two doors to it, one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080083"/>
               <p>right and one left—that on the right leads to the counting-house, and the left into Mr. Waithman's private room—the left hand door is secured by a key, which is left inside, and the right hand door leads into the warehouse—I have counterpart keys of the two doors, the one which locks inside and the one which locks outside—when the porter went away the outer door would be open if the parties up stairs had not gone—whenever the porter goes away it is his duty to secure the outer door into the warehouse—these chambers are kept by different merchants, and we have rooms there—there would be two doors to open when the porter came in in the morning; the outer door which secured our premises, and the premises up stairs—if our men came first they would open that door—the porter has the key of the warehouse door—I have also a key of that door; no other clerk has—the keys are left at my private residence, and have been there ever since I first put them there—I have counterpart keys of all the doors, the safe doors and all—I left the offices that day before the porter—I left about half-past 2—some of the other clerks had left then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Norris—on 13th June, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I had come up from Somersetshire, and got into an omnibus at the Great Western Railway Station—I had my little girl with me, and various parcels and flannels—I went to the further end of the omnibus, on the right hand side—my little girl Bat next to me on my left—my left hand was nearest to the door—a Mrs. Harding, a lady from Sydenham, came in—she came to the extreme end, and placed her bonnet-box on my parcels—the prisoner then came in—Taylor sat next to Mrs. Harding and opposite me—Easthope sat next to my little girl—the omnibus stopped at the Bank, and I took my purse from my pocket, took out a half-crown, and found I had only one small silver coin, either a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, two sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, to the best of my knowledge—I replaced my purse in my pocket in my dress—Taylor then said to Easthope, "We will get out here, dear"—Easthope immediately got out, and Taylor pushed herself very violently against me—I remonstrated with her—I had a parcel in each hand, which rendered me powerless with respect to my pocket—I felt a distinct tug at my pocket—I said, "Don't push against me in that way, there is plenty of time"—it was as though a person was abstracting something—she passed out, and I immediately found I had been robbed—my purse was gone—I said some-thing to the conductor—the omnibus was stopped and I got out—the prisoners had then got across the road to the Mansion-house, and were together in conversation—I caught hold of them and said, "You have robbed me of my purse"—I think they both said that it was a mistake—two con-stables came up, and I gave them in charge—there was also in my purse, a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp, a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one, and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one.</p>

I reside at 2, Creed-lane, Ludgate-street, and am the wife of William Carter, a timekeeper—I was in Fleet-street on 20th June, about twenty minutes to 4 o'clock, with my husband's mother—she was just on ahead—I had my purse in my left hand—I took it from my left, put it into my right, and put it into my pocket—I had my hand in my pocket, with the purse in my hand, and still had it so, when the prisoner was by my side, and his hand came into contact with mine in my pocket—I caught hold of his wrist and asked him for my purse, which I missed at that instant—he said he had not got it; and he gave my hand a tug in this manner, and my hand went back—I turned and looked, and saw another one about his own size, take something from the prisoner—I had his wrist, and my hand went with his hand, and when I turned behind, there was another young man about his own size behind me that received my purse—I was holding the prisoner's right hand, the same hand that took something from my pocket—the young man came up to the hand I was holding, and appeared to take something from that hand—I got hold of that man directly, and held him a minute or so, but he got away—he had a parcel under his arm—I retained the prisoner—I have not got my purse—there was no other person by my side at first when the prisoner was there—I kept him till the officer came up, and gave him into custody.</p>

"he was close by and threw himself down, saying that I was done for at last—he was taken in custody by the other two policemen—I bled most fearfully and went to Dr. Muggleston, who dressed my wound—the prisoner was sober, but had been drinking a little—he was very noisy and used very bad language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny the last statement. Nelson-street is my home, No. 7; I had been out and went to see if I could get in to get my things; I was excited by not getting in, and kicked up a piece of work, but there was not a soul in the street. When I got to the top of the street, two policemen knocked me down, and I have got seven wounds. I do not say that I did not strike with the knife; in the excitement I do not know what I did. My wife died, and I sold a room full of goods, and that person was my housekeeper; she got many of the police to knock me about and I had my ribs broken, and when I was laid up they stole my goods.</p>

I am a surgeon of Maryland-point, Stratford—about a quarter past 3 o'clock yesterday morning, Sharpe came to my house—I found a wound on his forehead, above the inner angle of the left eye, rather more than an inch long—all injuries to the forehead are not so severe, unless erysipelas supervenes; but being a clean out, there is less likelihood of that—an inch in a different direction would have sent it into the eye. and into the brain if struck with any force—it seemed to be struck with force—this knife would be likely to produce a wound of that kind.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness here made an examination of the prisoner, and stated as follows</hi>:)—There is a contused wound on the back of his head, which is recent—it might have been done by a blunt instrument, such as a truncheon, or by falling on the ground—he has several small recent bruises about his shoulders and elbows—a blunt instrument would produce them—he does not look as if he had been severely beaten—he looks as if he had had several blows with some instrument, or fallen on some hard substance—if he had been belaboured with truncheons, I think he would look worse than that, because it would have been more diffused over the body, and there would be echymosed spots under the cuticle—that is what I call a bruise—the elbows may strike the ground when a man falls—there are bruises on the blade bones—the small of the back is not bruised, nothing that would be curved—they are on the prominent parts of the body.</p>

               <p>June, at half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, after midnight, I was coming down Wellington-street, Woolwich, alone—I met the prisoner, she asked me to go home with her—she came in front of me—I told her I was a married man with a large family, and would not have anything at all to say to her—she came in front of me, at the side of me, and I felt a tug at my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—she ran away, and I followed her—I kept her in sight but did not come up close to her to catch her—I cried out, "You have got my watch"—she cried out, "Police, murder"—she did not still keep running, she walked pretty quickly—she went through Bedford-street, where I met Elvey—I told him to keep her in chat until I could get a police constable, and I went on for a policeman, and fetched one, and she was given into custody—when I got back to her, Elvey was with her, and she was also in company with three women that she knew—I have never seen my watch since—it was passed when she came up to her companions—that was after leaving her with Elvey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather dresser, and live at 55, Hunter-street, Dover-road. On the morning of 11th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was with the prosecutrix at the Black Prince, in a side box, and saw the prisoner on the other side—he came round while we were standing there, had something to drink, and went out again—he did not speak to us—while he was there the prosecutrix took out her purse and was about to pay for a lobster, but she did not, and put it into her bosom again—we stopped some time and then came out—I might have been about ten yards in advance of her—I received a blow in the jaw, and when I turned I received another in the face, and was knocked in the mud—it was the prisoner who gave me the first blow—I saw him—when I was getting up I saw the prosecutrix on her knees, in the act of rising, and having hold of the prisoner—they struggled together, and I heard her say "Give me my money, you scoundrel,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080095"/>
               <p>and with that he made off—a policeman came up—I afterwards went with him and the prosecutrix to a public-house, and there found the prisoner and took him into custody—he said to me, "Don't let her do it, <hi rend="italic">Cockey</hi>; don't let her do it"—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that struck me, and that I saw struggling with the prosecutrix—I have seen him about before; nothing further—I have no ill-feeling towards him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have known him by sight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him about for some time—I joined McCarthy about 11, coming along by the Elephant, and we walked down the Walworth-road to the public-house—we stopped there for some time—we went in a little after 11, and did not come out till close upon a quarter to 1—I believe I paid for a couple of pints of stout during that time—I had nothing else, nor had McCarthy in my presence—it was about a quarter of an hour before we left the house that the prisoner came into the compartment where we were—he did not speak to us—there were a great many other persons there—when we came out into the street there were several persons about, and also at the time I was knocked down—the prisoner came behind mo and hit me in the jaw—I saw him as I turned round, and then I received another blow and was knocked down—I was about twenty yards from the Black Prince at that time—I was not able to attend before the Magistrate upon the first examination—when the prisoner was taken he did not say he was not guilty, or that he did not do it—all he said was, "<hi rend="italic">Cockey</hi>, don't let her do it"—McCarthy took out her purse in the public-house to buy a lobster, but she did not buy it—there was a man in there selling lobsters—I was quite sober—I was not turned out of the station-house because I was not sober—I was told to go out while they were taking the evidence of McCarthy.</p>

I am a wholesale fish dealer, residing at 7, Mill-lane, Lambeth-walk, Surrey, and have a shop in Hercules-buildings, Lambeth, On Tuesday, 18th June, I locked up my shop at 2 o'clock in the morning and went home—the policeman came and called me up at 4 o'clock—I re-turned, and found the place broken open—I missed a watch and clock, abutter pot, two coats, a hat and black bag, and two knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are the fragments of the butter pot—these things are all mine—I found the door broken open—I had securely fastened it before I left—I know nothing about the prisoners; I think I saw them in my shop that night, but I will not be sure.</p>

About 2 o'clock in the afternoon of 18th June, I was passing up Smithfield with another officer—I saw the prisoners Jennings and Mayes—Mayes was carrying a parcel under his arm, consisting of a workbox wrapped up in this dirty towel, which is identified by another person—the clock was inside the workbox—I followed them to the corner of Smithfield pens and caught hold of them—Jennings immediately said, "Oh, don't take me Mr. Fawke"—he knew my name—I said, "What have you got there?"—I did not perceive him carrying any-thing—he said, "We have got a workbox and a little clock which we have tried to sell"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said he was induced last night by two other persons, whom he would show me, to go with them, and they went to the other side of the water and broke into two places while they watched, and also into a fish shop in the City, where they stole the workbox—he said, "Do you know Love-lane; I will show you the two, lying in the pens, and you will find a watch that was stolen"—it was Jennings that said all this—I went there with them and another officer, and they pointed out the other two prisoners, and said, "Those are the two men that broke into the fish shop"—Mahoney and Jones both denied it—we then, with the assistance of McLeod, took the whole four to the police-station—I did not notice anything on the ground then—I saw the mackin<lb/>tosh, but there was such a mob round at the time, and Mahoney was violent—it was laying down by the side of Mahoney and Jones—this is not the one—it was taken away by the crowd—we found these remnants of a dish</p>

I told him I had no postage stamps at all. I told him to look on the window; I told him I had put everything I had on the window; he (McLeod) turned back again and said there was no postage stamps on the window—I said it was only a spite Jennings had against me to say so." <hi rend="italic">Mayes says</hi>: "Two men gave me the box to sell for them, and I went to see whether I could sell them; no one would buy them of me—as we were turning back from Smithfield-pens I was going to look for the men to tell them, and the officer laid hold of me and said, 'Where did you get those things from?" and I told him two men gave them to me, who were in the pens—he said, 'Do you know the men?' and I said, 'I don't know,' I was going to see where I could find them in the pens, and I saw Jones standing, and I thought they were the two, but they were not, and then Jennings made answer, and said they were the two, and the officer went to them.

I am living with my mother, Margaret Bray, in Maypole-alley, Southwark—on the night of 17th June last, I met Mrs. Frazier's son at her door, and went in there with him—I had been there a few times before—my father had lived there, and I used to go to see him—Mrs. Frazier was in the house when I went in—it was about 11 o'clock at night—there were four young men there besides Mrs. Frazier—Gillard and Waring are two of them, and the other two were called "<hi rend="italic">Rollicky</hi>" and "<hi rend="italic">The sailor</hi>"—there was no one else besides those four men, Mrs. Frazier, the boy, and myself—the four men went out at the back door, and after that Mrs. Frazier bolted the door and then went out at the front door—she was absent about twenty minutes, and then returned by the front do r—she said to the boy, who is her son, "Are they come yet?" and he replied "No"—before she went out at the front door, she said, "I will go and keep them in tow"—after she had asked the boy whether they had come in, and he had said, "No," she went and opened the back yard door and looked out—she did not say anything then—she bolted the door again—she did not say anything then—in about a couple of minutes after that she was going to the front door again, and a kick came to the back yard door—she opened that door, and Henry Waring came in first—Mrs. Frazier said, "Have you got it?"—he replied, "<hi rend="italic">Fish eye has</hi>"—Charlotte Smith went by that name—I saw William Gillard come off the wall about five minutes after Waring had come in, and in about five minutes after Gillard had come in, Charlotte Smith came to the front door and came in—she had on a light pink skirt and a cloak, and had her apron up, holding it up in front, and her cloak over it—I saw Jane Reynolds about that time going through the passage—Smith placed the money on the table—she took it out of her apron—there was some silver, and copper, and some gold, wrapped up in newspaper—Mrs. Frazier said to Waring, "You share it," and Waring replied, "No, you're best"—he then counted out 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table to Mrs. Frazier, and</p>

I was formerly an inspector of the V division, and am now employed by the Mint authorities—in consequence of information I received from them, I marked five sixpences and two fourpenny pieces on 21st June last—I gave four sixpences to a man named Girling, and three fourpenny pieces and one sixpence to Yeomans at a coffee-house in the Westminster-bridge-road, about a quarter before 6 in the evening—I sent them to the Rochester Castle beer shop; in about seven minutes Yeomans returned and gave me four counterfeit half-crowns, which I produce—in consequence of that I went to the Rochester Castle, accompanied by other officers—I saw the prisoner France there—Yeomans said to me in his hearing, "This is the man I bought the half-crowns of; I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—Girling was in the tap-room at that time, and he came out and said to me, "And I bought seven two-shilling pieces of him, Mr. Brannan, here they are"—he gave me those pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then seized France, and said to him, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Turfy</hi>" (he is known by that name) "I received instruct<lb/>tions from the solicitor of the Mint to mark some pieces of coin in cones<lb/>quence of your large dealings in counterfeit coin"—he made no answer—he was then seized by Inspector Bryant and I—he resisted, and we pulled him into the tap-room and searched him—I saw Bryant take out of one of his pockets two half-sovereigns, nineteen shillings, two sixpences, and a three-penny piece, and from the other pocket, five pennyworth of coppers—among that money was the marked money which I had sent in before—all the rest of the money was good—he said his name was William France, but he refused his address—I then took him to the station—he there refused his address again, and speaking to the witness Girling; he said, "I shall plead guilty to this at the Old Bailey; I shall shake hands with you when I come out, and soon stop your wind"—when I first went into the beer-shop I looked through the tap-room window, which looks into the yard, and saw the prisoner Brennan run from the door into a shed in the yard, followed by Sergeant Leather—this is the marked money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I gave to Girling and Yeomans on the evening of 21st; they were taken from France's pocket by Inspector Bryant.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arbour-street, Stepney—I was in the prosecutor's employ for two or three weeks, up to 5th June—I saw a box brought to the house—the prisoner took it in—I assisted him in taking it to his own room on the first floor—two or three hours after it had arrived he asked me to help him up-stairs with it, and I assisted him with it up to the second-floor back room—it was heavier then—when I took it up to the first floor it was empty and unlocked; when I took it up to the second-floor it was locked—I believe the box was paid for before it arrived, except a few half-pence, and those the prisoner paid—I saw Mrs. Powter give the money to the prisoner before the box was fetched—first of all she gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go and buy a box—I could not get one, and I came back, and gave the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner, and the mistress gave him some more to go out and buy one—she said, "Go and see if you can get one"—he went out, and after that the box was brought as I have mentioned—this is very much like the box—I pointed out the box to Mr. Powter in the second-floor back-room where I had left it.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Sell, of Canrobert-street, Bethnal-green—the prisoner came to live at our house about a month last Saturday—he came with Mrs. Powter—they took the apartments together, and lived there a fortnight and two days—they occupied the same room, and lived together as man and wife—they lived there until the prisoner was taken away by the constable on 24th June—I did not know at the time that it was Mrs. Powter, I have ascertained that since.</p>

I once met the prisoner in the street, and asked him if he was not ashamed of himself, hanging about Mr. Powter's house, and taking his wife away from her children—he said he could do as he liked about that, and I could do the same, why could not I go and get a married man, as well as he get a married woman—he used rather rough language—that was about three weeks before Mrs. Powter had left her husband—from the time Mrs. Powter went to the Waterloo-road, and up to that time, I had seen the prisoner going there from time to time, and in the house.</p>
