I am porter to Mr. Barnes—I came in and saw Williams in the shop about 8.30—the prisoner was then on the other side of the street—Mr. Strickland was testing coin when I went in—Williams left shortly afterwards—I followed him, and the prisoner walked on the opposite side, in the same direction, and when they got to Layton Road, Williams crossed and joined the prisoner, and they went on to Leverton Road together—I went to the station, got a constable, and gave Williams in custody—I then went with the constable, found the prisoner in Kentish Town Road, and gave him in custody—the constable caught him by the right arm, and with his left hand he put something into his mouth which nearly choked him—I seized him—we had a struggle, and I got him to the station with assistance—some capsules were taken from him in a box.</p>

I live at 2, Suffolk Street, Mile End—the prisoner lived there on Wednesday, 14th June—he came to me, and said he had a friend with him, and he wanted to know if I had another room to spare—he had this portmanteau with him—it was locked—it was put in my parlour—the prosecutor afterwards came with the policeman, and opened it—I did not see it open before that—I saw no thaler notes, or socks.</p>

I am an engineer, of 122, Drury Lane—on 26th June I had been to Margate, and arrived at Charing Cross Station about 11.15 At night—I was proceeding towards Drury Lane, and when near George's Court, which leads to the Adelphi, I made way for two ladies, and the prisoner Welsh rushed at me, and laid hold of my watch-chain and the strap of a sea-side glass, which I had under my coat—I had a stick, having been lame since I was three years old—I had a guinea on my chain with two split gold rings—Welsh shook me very much indeed, and I held him—he got on my left side and struck me on my left cheek, near the temple, with his right hand, and knocked me against the wall, making a wrench with his left with my guinea—the chain broke in my pocket, through having the strap, and the guinea slipped into his hand, leaving my watch in my pocket—I let go of him when he struck me, and he me down the steps towards the Adelphi—I was about to follow him when Williams laid hold of me and enquired if I had been robbed, and said "Have you lost anything?'—I thought my watch was gone, and said "I have lost my watch—I followed him towards the steps, in search of a policeman—a policeman came up, and I gave Williams in charge for stopping me in my progress, he did not attempt to run away—I described Welsh when the charge was taken, but he was in custody at that time—on 26th, two days after, I saw six or seven men in a room at the police station—I put my hand on Welsh, and told him he was my man; I recognized him directly—my head was bad, and I suffer from it very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Cowes, Isle of Wight, and am a solicitor—I have an office in London, at 22, Ely Place—Machin was in my service for seven months—she disappeared on 23rd June—I go down from London always on Friday night, and arrive there by the last boat, and return to London on Monday morning—I found she had left on 23rd June, shortly before I got there—I missed account books, a bag containing about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed some receipts for money, a jar of gin which I had from Smith and Co., about 4 gallons; and nearly a <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> of groceries, and all the pork—I had a great number of pigs—I missed all my provisions, two silver forks, and a great quantity of sugar; I should think a cwt. altogether—I missed account books—I have seen nothing since, except the account books and a box which had been sent to George Clarke—it was found on his premises, and I identified it—it was a peculiar box, with curious nails—I received this letter from Machin on the Wednesday after she left on the Friday—"Tuesday. Dear sir. I was so ill yesterday I could not go for you, but, with your kind permission, I will be at 22, Ely Place, at 7 o'clock precisely to-night. I trust you will not be too angry with me. I have suffered enough for my imprudence. Your lost Lizzy. I am staying with a young woman I used to work with in Oxford Street"—I wrote this letter, dated 27th June, in reply, telling her to come to Ely Place at once—I also received this letter from her on Tuesday, 26th June—"I am quite ashamed to write to you after my bad conduct, and I suppose you don't care to see me, do you?

On Saturday morning I would have given worlds to have been back with you. I came across by the 8 o'clock boat, and stopped at the Temperance Hotel. I am miserable. Will you write to me at New North Street, and I will call for the letter. I will be sure to come on Tuesday next and settle accounts; if you will allow me, I will come and make up my accounts with you. I am sorry I made myself so wickedly foolish. I had no idea of it at 4 o'clock p.m. "She came to the office on Wednesday, at 7 o'clock—I asked her where she had been living—she said at a coffee-shop—I asked what she had done with the boxes she had taken away—she said they were at 29, New North Street—I gave her in custody—the detective told her what it was for, in my presence—I don't think she made any reply—we went down; the detective and the prisoner got' into a cab, and I got on the box to go with them to make the charge—the detective, who is employed in Ely Place, communicated some<lb/>thing to me—Clarke came up as the detective spoke—I, riding outside the cab, saw that he followed to the station-house—the inspector was not there to take the charge, and I went with Detective Wakefield to 29, New North Street; to try to find the boxes; we found that they had been taken away in a truck by a person answering the description of Clarke—we then went back to the station, and saw him still outside—he was called in and asked his name, and he said "George Clarke"—he refused to say where he lived, where he worked, what he had been doing for the last six months, and most positively denied that he had touched the boxes, or moved them away in a truck—he was also asked whether he lived at 7, Holy well Lane, Shoreditch, and he most positively said he did net—he afterwards admitted that he had taken the boxes and moved them away in a truck from New North Street, where she told me they were taken to, and he refused to state where he had taken them to—the female prisoner wished to give up the boxes, and he said "Recollect, if you do they will find the letters"—she did not do so, and we have not been able to discover the letters—I learnt afterwards that the boxes had been sent to 7, Holy well Lane, and I went there and found this box only, and a letter to a Mrs. Spranklin, signed "Lizzie"—nothing was found on the female prisoner but the two account books, and the letters that I had written to her—the books were account books of fruit sold, and the other is an account of milk—she was housekeeper in my service—I keep a great many gardeners—I have a cottage residence, and a very considerable quantity of land—she had no right to take those account books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bailey, of 8, Wicklow Street, King's Cross Road, next door to the prisoner and the deceased—I have known them about ten years; they lived together as man and wife, and she passed as Mrs. Nunney—she was a laundress, and he is a painter—I saw them both on Wednesday, the 26th, the day before this, about 2 o'clock, the deccased was sitting in a chair, and the prisoner was lying on the floor asleep—she had been crying—I was not with them five minutes, and nothing took place between them while I was there—next morning, Thursday, some person brought a message to me, between 10 and 10.30, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's house—I first went to the front door and knocked three times with the knocker, at intervals of five or six minutes, but getting no answer I went through the next door neighbour's house, and got over the pailings, and went to the prisoner's back door—I found it fastened inside—I rattled the latch, not more than two minutes, and pushed it to and fro—I then saw through the window the prisoner coming down, he opened the door, he had a rope round his neck—I know enough of the arrangements of the house to say that he came down from the room where the female lay—the staircase leads to the bed room—there is only one room up stairs—his face was blue—the rope was tied with a knot, but in my flurry I could not see on which side the knot was—his manner was excited as if he was a little drunk—he had his clothes on—I spoke first—I asked him whatever he was doing—he said "Why?"—I said "Where is your Mrs.?"—he said "She is up stairs dead, she has hung herself'—I made no reply—a knock then came to the front door—the rope was not round his neck then, I lifted it over his head directly I saw him—it was not tight, it was rather loose, but there was a knot which could slip—there was a mark just under his throat—he opened the front door and it was Mr. Hill, who came for some washing and asked for Mrs. Nunney—the prisoner told him that she had hung herself—I asked Hill to go up and see if it were true—he went up first and I followed—when we got into the room we saw a large tent turn-up bedstead with a canopy, turned over, the bed stood against a wall and turned into a recess; the canopy was not fixed to the wall, it came down and went up with the bed—I can't tell whether it was fixed to the wall, but it did not go up and down with the bed, it had come a foot down, and one part was resting on the table, which was almost in the middle of the room—the bedstead seemed as if it had fallen down on the woman—I could not see her—I came down stairs and went fur a doctor</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100039"/>
               <p>and a policeman—Mr. Hill came down with me—I had not been inside the door—the prisoner was in the front parlour, he stayed there till Dr. Purcell came—I went up with the doctor—Mr. Hill had then gone—the doctor and I lifted the bedstead off the body; one part of it was resting across the cheek, when we moved it; the woman was lying on her back in her usual dress, her hands lying beside her, and her feet straight out—she had a rope round her neck—she was dead—a policeman then came, and after that the prisoner came up stairs—the doctor asked him how it happened—he said she had hung herself through difficulties, as they were both going to do it the night before—he was rather boisterous and used bad words—I can't tell you what he said, but I believe the doctor can—I remained till they took me to the station with the doctor—when I took the rope from the prisoner's neck, I threw it in the yard—I afterwards picked it up and gave it to the sergeant.</p>

I have lived four years next door to these people; they had the whole house—the front door was only closed in the usual way—at ordinary times you could not get in at the front door without knocking—when I got into the house the front door was closed in the usual way, with the latch—I should say the prisoner had been drinking—he was incoherent in his manner—the bad words did not apply to any<lb/>thing in particular—I called him Philip, as I knew him very well—he has been living with her ten years—her age was about thirty-five—I had not heard of their quarrelling, or his threatening her—I supposed she was married—no one else lived in the house.</p>

               <p>—on Thursday morning, 27th April, I was sent for to 9, Wicklow Street, about 10.45—I am pretty accurate about the time—I saw Mrs. Bailey—I went up stairs into the room, nobody was there but myself—the bed and bedstead were lying on the deccased—it was a four-post bedstead, with a canopy, or cornice, supported by the four posts—when it is put up in the day time the cornice would go between the four posts; they are at the head only—the whole thing had come down, and the woman was lying under it, on her back; her arms were by her side, and her legs extended—she was dead—there was a rope round her neck which had a slip knot, or noose, so that it could be made tighter, or looser; it was relaxed, and the further end of it had been cut—it was about 4ft. long—there was also a rope tied to the cornice which had a free end of 41/2ft.—it was the same material and pattern as the other—to the best of my judgment the woman had been dead an hour and a half or more—she was warm—her neck was marked by the rope, and the mark fitted the rope accurately—there was a mark on her cheek-bone, where the cornice was lying on her—there were some fuselages on the stocking of the right foot, as if they had fallen there, not as if anything had been done to it—I lifted the bed off her—the prisoner was then in the room, and I asked him "How did this occur?"—he said, in consequence of baring made away with some property, and in order to prevent an ex<lb/>posure they had mutually agreed to destroy themselves; that he had been out to the Pander public-house that morning, at 7.20, to fetch some rum and gin, and when he came back he found she had forestalled him—he said "fetch," or "bring"—I understood him to say he took something home in a bottle, and that he was away five minutes—I did not notice his neck at all—he went down stairs, and brought up a portion of another bedstead, which he fixed up over the cornice, and said that was how he intended to destroy himself at one end, and his wife at the other—though the bedstead was down upon the woman, the whole of it was there—I could see that what he brought up was part of another bedstead—when the bedstead was done up in the day time, it went between those four posts—I made this sketch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is what I call the canopy, or cornice—he put what he brought up across the cornice—there was a resting place for it—there he said he intended to hang from one end, and his old woman from the other—this portion went to the wall—there was room on either side of the bed for anyone to stand—a person could go between it and the wall on each side—the constables then took him—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion of the deceased, about fifty-six hours after the occurrence—the body was well nourished, and, except on the neck, there were no marks of violence—there was an ecchymosed mark on the neck; not all round, but in front, and on the left side, it was interrupted, and across the front of the windpipe, there was a larger one where the knot pressed—in my judgment the cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation, produced by hanging—I examined the bedstead on the following Monday, or Tuesday, and observed a depressed mark on the cornice, such as a rope would make, on the right hand side, not in front—no rope was tied there then, but a piece of rope was hanging on the posterior part—there was no top to the cornice, it was a mere frame, and was 6ft. 5in. high from the floor—the bedstead would not stand very firm when folded up, but it would keep up—the bed was about 19 in, from the floor when let down.</p>

On 27th April, about 10.45, I was called to 9, Wicklow Street, and saw Mrs. Bailey and Dr. Purcell—the prisoner was there; he smelt very strong of drink, and appeared very much excited—I saw the deceased lying on the floor, on her back, with her hands and feet quite straight—while the doctor was examining her neck, the prisoner said to him "I will tell you just how it was, Sir. This was a mutual arrangement between ourselves; last night we were both going to hang ourselves, but Mrs. Bailey came in, so we went to bed and agreed to get up and do it in the morning; about 7.30 I went to the Pindar of Wake<lb/>field, to get some rum, because we were going to have something to drink before we did it, and when I came back I found she had forestalled me; and seeing my wife dead, I then tried to make away with myself, but I found I could not do it in the bed room, so I went down in the washhouse and tried to do it there; but Mrs. Bailey came in and prevented me, and I am very sorry for it, because we both meant to die together, because we had been making away with other people's things; and, to avoid an exposure, we made up our minds to hang ourselves"—I took him down stairs, and be tried to force his way up stairs again several times, while the doctor was examining the woman—I asked him what he wanted to go up stairs for, and he said to see what they were doing, because the witness and the doctor might make any tale against him—in the first part of the conversa<lb/>tion, he said "If you will follow me, I will tell you how we were going to</p>

I am a doctor of laws, a barrister, and a member of the Inner Temple—I rent chambers of Mr. Wright, at 5, Fig Tree Court—the prisoner was my clerk—I went to Italy in December, 1870—I left a Christmas box for the prisoner and his brother, with their father, five shillings each—I sent word from time to time that I might return—I came back in May, suddenly—got to my chambers between 11 and 12 o'clock—I found the prisoner and his brother there—I said "Good morning"—I went into the large room—I observed there were not the same number of books that I had left—I went out of the room to go into the back-room, the door of which I found locked—I asked the prisoner's brother how it was the door was locked—he was in Mr. Wright's room, but near enough to hear me—I told his brother to fetch the key—I found they had both left the chambers—the prisoner's brother came back with the key—I was trying to open the door—I stooped down to put the key in—just when the door was unlocked, when I was still stooping, I received, on the side of my head, a heavy blow—I believed I received a very strong electric shock—I put my hands to feel where it came from, and was looking up, I received another blow from behind with the sharp end of a hammer, which rendered me insensible—while on the ground, the prisoner was standing on my left side, and he gave me another blow on my right ear, the pain of that blow restored me to consciousness—I then saw the prisoner standing over me with the hammer; I started up, went to the window and called for the police—I saw Mr. Bristowe standing at the hall-door, he said "My gracious, me, what is the matter?"—Dr. Brooks came in and attended to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The boy's conduct was always good—he was not in my service at this time, nor responsible for the custody of my property—I was not paying his wages—I generally paid in advance—two weeks were due when I returned, I think—when I was first knocked down, I was nearly insensible—I was not conscious of being struck—the second blow rendered me insensible, and the third restored me to consciousness—he might have struck me again if he had liked—I can't say he was excited this morning—I never ill-treated the boy in my life, or any other boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 168, Fleet Street—on 25th May, I was called into the prosecutor's chambers, and found a wound over his right eye 21/4 in. long, through the integuments to the bone; another wound over the temple, which went simply through the integuments; and another bruise on the neck, below the right ear—the wound on the posterior portion of the temple bone was a large circumscribed swelling, about 2in. in circumference—there were three wounds on the head—the injury in the front of the head was dangerous—he has not recovered from the effects yet—the bone is still denuded—I question whether he will ever really recover from it—all the wounds would be occasioned by such an instrument as that produced—very considerable force would be required to make those blows.</p>

On the morning of 25th May, about 12.30, I was in Westbourne Park—Rowe had made a communication to me about 12.15 that night, and I went with him to 23, Newton Road—I was met at the kitchen door by Mr. Phillips, senior, who said something to me, and I followed him up stairs into the dining-room, where I saw the deceased lying near the fire-place; a round table, with several bottles on it, was in the room; a bowl of bloody water was on the floor by the body; there were two chairs at the table, as if people had been sitting there; no white cloth was on the table, and I am not sure there was any cloth—the drawing-room is on the same floor, just opposite, separated by a small hall—I found the prisoner sitting on the sofa behind the door, in the act of pulling off her jacket, the inside of which was lined with white, and was saturated with blood—the upper part of her clothing under the jacket was saturated with blood, and her hair was very much disarranged—Mr. Phillips, jun., was in the room with her—I said to her "You must consider yourself in my custody; you will have to go to the police-station"—she made no reply, but Mr. Phillips, jun., said "Policeman, you had better leave the room"—I said "I must see that the room is secure before I leave"—Mr. Phillips said "I will be answerable for her"—she sat on a sofa behind the door during that conversation—I went outside the door, and it was closed after me—Mr. Phillips, sen., was standing in the hall—I went with him into the dining-room again, and found this knife in the fender, with a small trifle of blood on the side of the blade—I took charge of it—shortly afterwards a person came to the house, who gave the name of Captain Davey—Sergeant Woonton afterwards came—the fender was oval, rather enclosing the grate, and the knife was in it, but I could not see it till I got close to the fire-place—no fire was in the grate—there was a basket on the table with some knives in it—they were all in the basket except this one—I noticed it on the table when I first went into the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I was parlour maid to the prisoner sixteen months, at 23, Newton Road—I knew her as Mrs. Davey—I knew the deceased gentleman, Mr. Moon; he was in the habit of coming there two or three times a week, and used to dine there—on Wednesday, 24th May, he came about 5 o'clock—I let him in, the prisoner was then in the billiard room—he went either into the drawing or dining room—he afterwards went into the billiard room, and I took a bottle of champagne there, by Mrs. Davey's order—they dined about 7 o'clock, and I waited at table, very little of the champagne was drank in the billiard room, and I took the bottle into the dining room—Mr. Moon walked round the garden before dinner—besides the champagne, this pint decanter of sherry was on the dinner table—very little of it has been taken out—there was also this claret bottle, I do not know whether it was full—the claret bottle was in the side board drawer—I do not know anything about how it came on the table—I was the only attendant who waited on them—I placed the brandy bottle on the table after the dinner was cleared, it was not on the table at dinner time at all—Mrs. Davey drank a small quantity of ale at dinner—I brought up no other drink after dinner, but I placed the sherry bottle and the champagne on the table after dinner, and Miss Pook brought up a bottle of Burgundy—dinner was over about 8.30, and I cleared away the things; the knife basket was then on the shelf, which is a raised part of the sideboard—I do not mean a drawer, but the part upon which things go—the sideboard consists of two pedestals, and there is a shelf under the top of the sideboard, which is visible, open to the eye—there was a plate basket by the side of the knife basket, I had put them there, they were always kept there—the poultry carver was in the basket, it had not been used during dinner—after the things had been cleared, Miss Dulin and Miss Pook were sent for from the billiard room—they were on a visit to Mrs. Davey—they were sent for to dessert, or to wine after dinner—I brought up this bottle of olives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) while the ladies were there—about 9.30 o'clock, Mr. George Phillips, jun., came, I opened the door and showed him into the drawing-room—I went into the dining-room to announce him, Mr. Moon was then sitting in the same place he occupied at dinner, on a chair with hte back to the door, facing the window—the prisoner was sitting in an easy chair between the fire place act the window—I thought she looked as if she had been crying; she told me to show Mr. Phillips into the drawing-room, and then went into the drawing room to see him—she was only there a few minutes, and then he went away—a little more than half an hour after, I heard the dining-room bell ring very loud, and then the call bell at the top of the house, in the servant's bedroom—it is a very small house, only two storeys—I then heard Mrs. Davey scream "Run for a doctor"—I rushed out of the house with</p>

During the sixteen months I have been in the prisoner's service I knew Mr. Moon as coming to visit her two or three times a week, but not so often at first as lately—during her illness he came oftener than before—she had been seriously ill, and only got out of bed, I think, on the Sunday week before—Mr. Phillips says it was the Sunday before; whether I am right or not, I am not positive—she had been ill altogether about seven weeks—she was in bed about four weeks before the Sunday when she got up, but she had been up a time or two—she was so ill as to require rest for so long a time—they used to dine much in the same fashion, having their wine and champagne—they always treated each other affectionately; she was kind and affectionate to him, and he to her—the young ladies had been visiting there about a week—Mr. Moon enjoyed their society—they used to play on the piano to him—the prisoner used to sing before her illness—their society was pleasant to Mr. Moon—they were lively and agreeable—the prisoner had been out riding that day, and she left a message with Mrs. Toynbee for Mr. Moon if he called—Mr. Moon called the prisoner Flo, she called him Fred, and they always seemed very much attached to each other—when Mr. Moon was in the garden on this day, I noticed he appeared despondent and depressed—he was only there a short time, looking at the flowers—I did not go into the room when the prisoner re<lb/>turned from seeing Mr. Phillips—they dined alone—I do not think Mr. Moon was expected to dinner that day—there was an arrangement for the prisoner and the two young ladies and Mrs. Toynbee to dine together, but when Mr. Moon came, that waft altered, and extra dinner ordered—there was some broiled fowl for dinner, but the poultry knife was not used for that—I am certain of that, because I always take the dirty knives down stairs when I clear the dinner—I have a separate basket for the purpose, and if it had been used I should have taken it away—I remember the young ladies going in after dinner—I believe that was done for the purpose of amusing Mr. Moon, and keeping up his spirits—I noticed he was gloomy, but when the young ladies went in he appeared in better spirits, and laughed and joked with them—I do not know of his throwing a bottle into the lap of one of them as a joke, but he was joking when I took the olive bottle into the room—that was a little before 9 o'clock, I left the young ladies in the room, they remained there some little time, but they were playing the piano in the drawing-room when Mr. Phillips came—the drawing and dining-rooms are on the same floor—there is a passage between them—the prisoner seemed to have been crying when I announced Mr. Phillips, her eyes looked very red, but I do not know whether she had sent for him—I showed him into the drawing-room where the ladies were—I do not know whether they then left the drawing room, and went to the billiard-room—I went to announce him to the prisoner—Mr. Moon remained in the dining-room when the young ladies went into the drawing-room—the drawing-room door was open, but the dining-room door was shut—they might have been playing to amuse themselves then—after I heard the cry, she was crying out to send for a doctor, and wringing her hands—she appeared in a state of very great distress—almost everybody in the house was sent for a doctor, and three or</p>

I had been same weeks in the prisoner's service as housemaid, and on 24th May, between 9.30 and 10 o'clock at night, I was in the kitchen, which is immediately below the dining-room—I thought I heard a fall—I heard screams a few minutes afterwards, perhaps five or ten minutes—it did not seem instantly after—I was reading the paper at the time, and when I heard the screams I got up, went into the dining-room, found the door open, and saw Mr. Moon lying on the floor by the fire-place, with his head towards the sofa, very near the coal scuttle, which was in its usual position—Mrs. Davey was kneeling down by his side trying to help him, and to undo his clothes—she said "Try and save him"—she asked me to unfasten his things, and I said I could not—I saw blood at that time by the side of the body—there was no hearth rug on the carpet—Mr. Moon was lying on the carpet—you get from the kitchen to the dining-room, up six or seven stairs—the kitchen door was open and the dining-room door—I heard no struggling or loud talking before the fall, or anything to attract my attention.</p>

               <p>Burlington Street—Miss Laura Pook is my cousin—on 24th May we were staying with Mrs. Davey; that is, we were taking our meals at her house and sleeping at Mrs. Toynbee's, as there was no room at the prisoner's house for us to sleep—we were, I believe, to have dined with the prisoner on Wednesday, 24th May, but Mr. Moon arrived in the afternoon—I and Miss Pook were at home at that time—we had been for a ride on horse<lb/>back with the prisoner—we did not dine with the prisoner and Mr. Moon, but about 8.30 we went into the dining-room where they were—we were sent for—Miss Pook then, I believe, went down and fetched a bottle of Burgundy—I don't know whether it was put into the decanter—I had some claret—I remained in the room about half an hour—Mr. Moon was sitting in a chair opposite the window during that time, and the prisoner was by the side of the window—Miss Pook sat at the table, we were engaged in conversation—Mr. Moon and the prisoner appeared on good terms—I offered to play the piano, and Miss Pook and I crossed into the drawing-room, and I played—Miss Pook remained with me—we left the drawing-room door open—I did not close the dining-room door, but I came out first—I continued playing till Mr. Phillips came—he came into the drawing-room—the prisoner came to him there, and Miss Pook and I left them there, and went down stairs to the billiard-room, where we remained about a quarter of an hour—I then went up stairs with Mrs. Toynbee to the dressing-room, with some linen—that room ia one floor above the dining-room, over it—in about five minutes I heard a woman's scream—that was about 9 o'clock, as near as I can remember—the scream was repeated—I had heard no loud talking or scuffling before that—I ran down stairs into the dining-room—the door was open—it had been shut when I went up, and I observed no loud talking or quarrelling—when I got into the dining-room I saw Mr. Moon lying on the floor, and the prisoner on her knees, bending over him—she said "Fetch a doctor I fetch a doctor!" several times—I went out to fetch one, and was absent about twenty minutes—I rushed immediately from the room, so that I was not long there—when I came back I found Mrs. Davey in the drawing-room—I don't remember whether she was sitting down—she said "Oh save him, save him! pray for him, pray for him! I fear I did it!"—that was all repeated several times—she was in a very agitated state—the dining-room door was shut at that time—I only remained a minute or two with her—I then went down stairs, and saw nothing more of her till she was taken to the station.</p>

Mr. Moon has known her the whole of the twelve years that I have known her—they have been affectionate during the whole of those twelve years—it may have been two or three months before 24th May that I heard Mr. Moon use irritating language—I have never Been him throw anything at her—I heard him apologize for having thrown a bottle at her; I came soon after it was done, and saw a broken decanter in the room, a small one like this, similar in size, but not so good—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped she would overlook it—this was four months before 24th May—I saw that the decanter was broken, and that the wine was spilt—the frag<lb/>ments were on the floor, and the sherry had splashed on the clock, which was on the mantelpiece—from what I saw, I could judge that a bottle had been thrown and wine splashed out of it—she had been out riding on this afternoon, as it was not a certainty that Mr. Moon would come—she said if he came I was to see him, and she left a message with me to tell him that she would not be long—I have independent means of my own, about 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, under my father's will—I have been on friendly terms with the prisoner and Mr. Moon—I stayed with them, and was treated by them as an equal—when I first went into the room, Mr. Moon appeared rather depressed—the prisoner did everything she could to rally his spirits, and put him into a good humor, and for that purpose the young ladies were asked to play and sing—it is an eight-roomed house, very small, and the room where this tragic incident occurred is very small—the ladies were in the habit of playing at billiards, as well as Mr. Moon—I was not in the billiard-room when the champagne was ordered—I did not see them in the billiard-room—I followed the young ladies ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after they went in to dessert—I had a glass of claret—Mr. Moon and the prisoner appeared on very friendly and affectionate terms—I saw the prisoner coming into the dining-room about 9.30, but did not notice her much—I remember this knife basket—I remember a bottle of olives being brought in, and a two-pronged fork was taken out of the knife basket for the purpose of lifting the cork of the bottle and taking the olives out—I</p>

               <p>think it was a poultry carving fork—I don't remember taking the knife out at the same time—the prisoner was going to Homburg next day, with the sanction of Mr. Moon, and at his expense—that was generally under<lb/>stood in the house, and it was mentioned in Mr. Moon's presence—she said during dessert, "Oh don't let us be melancholy the last day we shall be together," and she tried to do everything to rally him, and make him in good spirits—a courier had been engaged to meet her—I don't know whether Mr. Moon was to meet her at Homburg after a short time—when I first went into the room he was just saying that it was the anniversary of his mother's death—I was examined by Mr. Humphreys, the attorney, before the Coroner—as far as I know, in regard to money matters, Mr. Moon always behaved very kindly towards the prisoner, except on one par<lb/>ticular occasion, and she to him—I heard the scream; I was then up stairs in the bed-room, with Miss Dulin—she was helping me in some little domestic matters—I confirm the statement of all the witnesses" that the prisoner appeared to be in a paroxysm of grief and distress—when Mr. Phillips came, she went to the drawing-room—he was sent for that night, and came about 9.30—several persons were sent for a doctor—at the time the prisoner said "Save him! pray for him!"Mr. Moon was on the dining-room floor—she was trying to disentangle his neckcloth while he was on the floor—I saw water brought, and I sprinkled him, at her instance—she appeared to be in dreadful grief—there is a Turkey carpet on the dining-room floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I call it a Turkey carpet—there may be different styles—I never knew a Turkey carpet made in England—Mr. Moon has visited the prisoner for twelve years—I am not prepared to state what the intimacy was that existed during the whole time—I have been living with the prisoner, except when I was away on some visits—I first knew them living together as husband and wife, about a year ago—he gave her 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday before this happened on Wednesday—I know that because I went to cash the cheque—I paid 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the prisoner's bank, and took out a diamond and emerald ring <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the pawn-shop—I heard Mr. Moon say that he was going to engage a courier to travel with her on the continent, and I know that he had an interview with the courier, because I saw them together in the little room at No. 23—I was told that the bottle had been thrown—the fragments were on the floor, and part of the neck was on the table—the table was about half a yard from the fragments on the floor—there was a splash of wine on the face of the clock on the chimney<lb/>piece, and Mr. Moon said "Flo, I am very sorry I have committed such an act, and I hope you will overlook it"—she was very indignant, and he entreated her to forgive him—she said she would not, at first, but at last she did—they had a few words—she said she was indignant at such an insult, and she would not allow it, but when Mr. Moon entreated her to overlook it, the did—that was about four months before Mr. Moon's death—I am very in<lb/>accurate about dates—I have never travelled with the prisoner for remu<lb/>neration—I have been with her when Mr. Moon has paid her expenses and mine—she tried to put him in good spirits on the 24th—she coaxed him, and went up to him, and kissed him in my presence—that was after dinner—he expressed great regret that she was obliged to go to Homburg—he said he should be very unhappy when she went, but that he ought not to</p>

               <p>be so selfish to ask her to remain at home in the delicate state of health she was in—he kept repeating "I wish you were not going; I shall be so unhappy when you are away"—that was all that passed, that I remember, except common ordinary topics, in which he joined very little—the persons who were discussing the ordinary topics were Miss Dulin and myself.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 37, Princes Square, Bays<lb/>water—I have known the prisoner some time—she was originally my father's patient—he is also a medical man—I attended her at his request—I saw her on the morning of 24th May, and had some conversation with her—I saw her again at 9.30 at night—she came into the drawing-room to me, and said "Oh, doctor, can you call again in an hour; <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> is going on so" I knew who <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> was; I had seen Mr. Moon—I always thought he was her step-brother—after seeing her for a few minutes, I left her—I went back again, in consequence of a message, about 10.20—I think I saw Mrs. Toynbee—I went into the dining-room—the prisoner was there—she said nothing—Mr. Moon was lying on his back, rather inclined towards the left side, and in a dying condition—the prisoner was lying on the ground, with half her body on the deceased, trying to open his neck-tie and shirt—I was under the impression that he was in a fit, in consequence of the message I had—I ultimately found a wound—I asked for some brandy, and this brandy bottle was produced—he was not quite dead when I arrived, but in a dying condition—he lived, I should say, about six minutes—I passed ray finger into the wound soon after his death, and was able to feel that the heart had been penetrated—I found out before he died that it was not a fit—I searched the room after his death, and found this poultry carver in the fender—Dr. Royston came before he actually died—he was perfectly insensible from the first—some time after his death, I went into the drawing-room, and saw the prisoner—as far as I remember, I said "Good God! how did this happen?"—her answer was, "I don't know how it was; I fear I must have done it in the scuffle"—she said they had had some words about her daughter—the wound must have been inflicted a very few minutes before I arrived—I put my finger in its whole length; I got down to the opening between the ribs, which was at the end of my finger, and I knew then that the heart must have been penetrated—life could not have been existing after that—on Friday morning, the 26th, about thirty-five hours after death, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, in the presence of Dr. Savory, Dr. Westmacott, Dr. Royston, and my father—I made notes of the result of the examination—nothing appeared on the external part of the body, but a wound on the left side, under the arm, commencing a little bit forward to the side, I should think an inch forward—it was situated 71/2 inches from the middle line of the chest bone; that would bring you to one extremity of the wound; and 91/2 inches from the middle bone of the spine would bring you to the other—I did not take the measure of the body at that part—the direction of the wound was downwards, inwards, and forwards—the entire length of it was about 6 inches—it eventually passed between the ribs, but first of all, it passed between the flesh and the ribs, parallel with the ribs, one might almost say, and then dipped in between the sixth and seventh ribs—it had passed through the anterior border of the upper lobe of the left lung, through the pericardium, into the left ventricle of the heart—the end of the wound was in the apex of the heart, the ventricle—that was what I ascertained on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the other organs of the body were healthy—there was not the least doubt of the cause of death—death must have been instantaneous, or nearly so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I noticed when I went into the room that the coal scuttle was overturned—there was some coal grit in the deceased's hands, when he was lying on his back—there was a Turkey carpet in the dining-room, a particularly thick one—I noticed that the arm chair was pushed back, and the table was out of its place, pushed further back towards the window—that' was all I noticed about the dis<lb/>arrangement of the room—I can't speak about the chairs—I was there some time before the policemen—I was not there in the afternoon, I was there at 9.30 in the evening—I got to the house before my father, after the occurrence, because the message came to me at my father's house—they first went to my house, I was not at home, and then they came on to my father's, where I was, and I ran directly—when I was there at 9.30, the prisoner was sobbing and crying violently when she came into the room, and she said "Can you come again in an hour?"—that was for the purpose of seeing her—she also said "<hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> is going on so"—I think she was not three minutes with me at that time—that was all the conversation that took place—she repeatedly begged and implored that she might go and kiss the body again; that was that same night—so far as my observation went Mr. Moon and she appeared to be on the most affectionate terms—the blade of the knife is about three-quarters of an inch in width—the orifice of the wound was an inch and a half—I can't tell how much nearer the seventh rib than the sixth the knife entered—the space between the two ribs was not quite an inch; I should think just enough to admit the knife—the apex of the left cavity or venticle was penetrated—if the knife went in between the seventh and sixth ribs, it would certainly have taken an inward direction—I am not clear about its being upwards, I can't speak positively—I could not undertake to swear it would not—it would be so near the point of the heart that I could not say whether it would be obliged to take an upward direction 'or not; it was going in an inward direction, and down<lb/>wards from the very beginning—it did not go inwards till it came to the ribs—from the nature of the wound I could not say that it did take an upward direction; I could not say that it did not—the apex of the heart is between the fifth and sixth ribs—with a body perfectly at rest, a knife passing in between the fifth and sixth ribs, would be the most natural place for the heart to be wounded—I think, by the motion of the body, the heart would be brought down rather lower, but it is impossible to sty; it would not be much—the lower part of the sixth rib is the lowest place one usually finds it at—the apex of the heart would be just at the sixth rib—there is a movement of the heart and ribs at the same time by inspiration—I do not pledge my surgical opinion that the wound in the heart was caused by one blow or stab; I would not say so—I would not pledge my experience and knowledge to that as a fact—I use the term "inwards" at something different from "downwards," it does not mean "upwards"—the downward wound was nearly 3 in. in length—the whole wound was about 6 in.—there was a downward wound for 3 in., and then the tendency was inwards, it was not also upwards—there might be an upward tendency afterwards, of course; I could not say—I do not say that it might take an upward direction; what I mean is, that it took a turn inwards, between the two ribs—if it went between the ribs, and got to the pericardium, it must be downwards—apparently the ribs were not touched or grazed at all—I am not positive as to the seventh and sixth ribs—until I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I had a doubt about it—when I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100066"/>
               <p>examined before the Magistrate, I had not made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I had traced the wound by putting my finger in, and from what I then observed I gave my evidence—I said before the Magistrate, "I examined him, and found a wound on the left side, about an inch and a half in diameter, it took rather an upward direction, and inwards"—when I found the body in the position in which it then was, the direction was upwards first of all, it then took a turn down—the wound in the skin I am speaking of, the first part of the wound, not the last part where it reached the apex of the heart—it did take an upward direction in the position in which the arm was—it was upwards, under the skin first—I did not think that the blade of the knife had gone upwards—I don't think it extraordinary that I should have made that observation, because by changing the position of the arm, you change the position of the flesh and the direction of the wound—the arm coming down would bring the outer flesh over the inward part of the wound—if had not made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I should have always been convinced that the wound had had an upward direction, the first part of it; the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> rectified that opinion—of course keeping the arm back it would not be in the same lobe—I did pass my finger upwards, I should think perhaps an inch or half an inch, between half an inch and one inch—I put my finger between the ribs, and found that the heart had been pene<lb/>trated, but that was the external part of the wound—in order to reach it, I had to pass my finger up—the whole of a wound is internal when it breaks the skin—I put my finger between the ribs, and convinced myself from that, and also from the great hemorrhage, that the heart had been penetrated—did all that, and yet seemed of opinion that the wound took an upward direction from the opening—I was not of opinion that it took an upward direction of two or three inches, only about an inch—I would not under<lb/>take to say positively that the wound could not have been inflicted in a scuffle—the body, falling on the blade of the knife, might give the same sort of wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the wound at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and could trace it from its entrance into the body till it reached the apex of the heart—it was bared for the express purpose of the examination, and from the result of that examination, I say that the wound was downwards, inwards, and forwards—there was a decided turn inwards, at the latter part of it, towards the centre of the body I saw no upward tendency—there would be a difference if the wound was inflicted with the arm up, or the arm down, a difference in the situation of the muscles between the ribs at the moment of puncturing—I should think, from that, that it is more probable that the arm was up at the time the blow was inflicted—I say that, from what I observed at first, and afterwards; I mean, of course, the left arm—a person standing in front, and inflicting a blow of that description, the direction of the wound would not be the same; the wound would not have taken the forward direction; I account for the forward direction, from the wound being given from the side, and somewhat at the back; whether it was inflicted by any person or by accident—supposing him to have fallen on the knife, such a wound could only have happened if it struck some article of furniture, or some resisting body—the handle of the knife must have been fixed against some point—there must have been a certain power of resistance, whatever given by—if the knife were placed over the wound, in the direction that the wound took, and he fell backwards and struck an article of furniture or the wall, so as to offer resistance to the handle of the knife, the wound might have been pro<lb/>duced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100067"/>
               <p>—the backward action of the man would develope the forward action of the knife—any impetus given to the knife, from whatever cause, might produce the wound—a fall against any body sufficient to resist it, would be enough to produce the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say what amount of force would be necessary to produce a wound of that length? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not tell the amount of pounds or hundredweights; a fall must have been a very violent one to have done it—I could not tell the amount of pounds' pressure that would be necessary to project the knife into the body—I think it is possible that the appearance of the wound on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, might have been caused by the deceased falling on the knife, supposing a struggle to have existed, and the deceased to have taken the knife from the hands of the prisoner, and fallen backward, and the handle of the knife to have rested against some solid substance, such as the sofa or the floor, I quite think that possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Or even without that, if there was any action by which the knife entered the body, would his falling backwards account for the forward action of the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would orignally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIPPARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that what you really mean to say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.—I think it is possible—there must have been some fixture behind the weapon, or a sufficient momentum given to the handle by falling against some fixed body, or something sufficiently heavy to do it—the mere fall would not do it—it is difficult to say what is impossible; any fall which would, by striking against furniture or anything else, give the necessary weight to the handle, would be sufficient to produce the wound—I do not think the fall or inclination backwards would do it, without an impetus given to the knife—ray difficulty is in saying that anything is impossible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and am surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Mr. Moon—I found an external wound on the left side of the chest, between the sixth and seventh ribs—the wound passed in an oblique direction, forwards, in wards, and downwards, so that the end of the wound in front was 2 inches lower than the end of the wound behind; that represents the dip; the angle was 2 inches, in a little over 5—the wound was perfectly straight in direction from end to end—such an instrument as this knife would produce it—I can give no accurate estimate of the force required to produce the wound—it must have been considerable—I can't use a more exact term than that—I saw the clothes through which it had penetrated; a coat, waistcoat, and shirt—the wound was above the band of the trowsers—the lower end of the wound reached the apex of the heart—there was not the slightest tendency of an upward character in the wound, that I could make out—there is not the slightest difficulty, that I can see, in a weapon going in between the sixth and seventh ribs, taking a downward direction, and reaching the apex of the heart—the ribs are very obliquely placed, so that what would be between the sixth and seventh ribs, at the spot where this wound occurred, still digging downwards, would appear between the fifth and sixth, or behind the sixth rib, where the point of the heart beats—the ribs are all inclined downwards—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph from a male subject, the only one at my command, taken in the dissecting room of St. Bartholomew's—this white rod, or arrow, shows the direction of the wound, and how it would go between the sixth and seventh ribs—it was suggested that there might be some difficulty in understanding</p>

               <p>the anatomy of the parts, and that this might assist—I am as certain as I can be of anything, because I saw it, that this wound was downwards through its whole course—this arrow shows the wound pretty accurately—the weapon must have gone between the ribs very obliquely, and then through a portion of the left lung, then through the sac of the heart, and then through the heart itself—looking at the situation of the wound, and the direction it took, my opinion is that it must have been inflicted by a stab from another person, and by one single blow—I am not able to suggest any theory by which a fall could, to my mind, satisfactorily account for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I was requested by Mr. Moon's brother to attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have been acquainted with the family for a long time, I hope I may say on friendly and intimate terms—I knew the deceased—I have known the family upwards of twenty years—the nature of the intimacy has been chiefly professional; not purely so; mostly—the deceased I had not seen for many years, except professionally—my intimacy with the family has been both that of friendship and pro<lb/>fessional—I believe it began professionally—I intended by this photograph to represent, as nearly as I could, the course of the wound in question—this represents where the knife entered, between the sixth and seventh ribs; you will see a little pin there, showing the situation of the external wound through the skin—the skin is removed there, of course, to show the ribs—the external wound would be as near as possible at the lower border of the sixth rib—I did not take this photograph—I tried the experiments myself, and in company also with Mr. Baker—he was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—he is a gentleman attached to our hospital as one of the surgical staff, and lecturer on physiology and anatomy—Mr. Phillips was not present—the suggestion came to me, from someone or other, that it would be as well to have it done—it was done al out a week ago—I can't say that I had heard at that time that medical evidence was likely to be called on behalf of the prisoner—I think the attorney for the prosecution mentioned to me in conversation, that someone had suggested to him it would be as well to have a photograph of the parts involved, the ribs—he suggested that I should get as accurate a representation as I could of the direction the wound took—he did not tell me that surgical witnesses were likely to be called on the prisoner's behalf—I had not heard of it—I hope you will not cross-examine me upon Mr. Phillips' evidence; I have not the slightest objection to be cross-examined on my own—I heard Mr. Phillips state that the wound took a downward direction for 3 inches, and afterwards an inward course—this photograph does not represent such a course, because the wound was straight—I differ from Mr. Phillips' description of it to-ay materially—I did not request that this diagram should not be shown to Mr. Phillips when he appeared here, or that he should not be asked about it—I gave no sort of opinion at all—I do not speak at all in a disparaging tone of Mr. Phillips; on the contrary, I say I have expressed no opinion about it at all; anyone might see it—he has not seen it, nor was he consulted—his was the hand that made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; I and Mr. Baker were looking on—it is right to say that when I wished to verify an observation, I did it with my own hand—I took the direction of the wound and measured it—the evidence given by Mr. Phillips to-day does not convey a fair impression of the wound; I mean not a correct one—it was not because I had no confidence in his judgment that I did not consult him—I should have done this quite alone, if Mr. Baker had not been in the hospital—he lives there—I had not</p>

               <p>the slightest reason for not showing this to Mr. Phillips—when I made it, I did not know that I differed from him—from the description he has given to-day, I do—I understand him to describe the direction of the wound as changing in its course; that it went first in one direction and then in another—I gathered that from his description of the wound—I refer to that part of his evidence in which he implied that the direction of the wound changed—I say there was no upward tendency at all—I suppose it is possible that in a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of this kind, two gentlemen of equal professional eminence may honestly come to a different conclusion as to the course which such a wound took—it is what you look at, and see; it is a matter of fact—I was present before the Coroner, and heard Mr. Phillips examined—I beg pardon, I did not hear him examined, nor at the Police Court; I was present at both examinations, but my evidence was taken as soon as I got there, and I was allowed to go as soon as it was over; stop, let me correct myself; I may have been in the place at the time he gave evidence before the Coroner, but I did not hear it given; I was there waiting to be examined—I don't know that he was examined in my presence—I have read his evidence—I did not read it before I had this photograph done; that had no sort of reference to his evidence—I had read the news<lb/>papers; I had not read the deposition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the blade of the knife had entered lower down than the sixth and seventh ribs than you have placed it, would that have rendered it difficult for the apex of the left venticle of the heart to be reached, except by an upward movement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not at all, because the point of the heart moves, it is not a fixed thing; the point of the heart is usually found after death behind the cartilage of the sixth rib, and at the end of a very deep inspiration the point beats below the cartilage of the sixth rib; the whole of the ribs rise and the heart sinks—it is my judgment that the wound was a single uninterrupted wound, delivered by some one making a stab—I cannot account for it by the deceased falling on the knife, I believe it to be impossible—I have not stated that I did not think it impossible—I will not swear, neither do I, that it is impossible, but I believe it to be impossible—I will not swear it is impossible, because my judgment may err—I said before the Coroner, "If the knife were fixed, a man by falling on it might have produced such a wound," that was with reference to his weight—assuming that the whole weight of the body could have been brought to bear upon the knife, it might have produced such a wound, but I don't see how that could have happened—I will not swear that even that is absolutely impossible—the heart is not represented in this photograph—the ribs were painted white, that they might catch the light—this shows directly the direction the wound took when it went in—I should like to add that I am sorry if in any way I implied indirectly the least reflection on Mr. Phillips.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not intend to disparage him—I do not agree with him in the description he has given of the wound—when I said before the Coroner that, if the knife was fixed a man by falling upon it might have produced such a wound, I was then being examined as to how much force it would take to inflict a wound of that sort—if the knife were fixed and the man's whole weight came upon it, it would go to that extent, only a man's weight could not come upon it—to the best of my judgment it is impossible that such a wound could be produced by a fall—I really can have no shadow of doubt as to what was the direction of the wound, or whether it was one straight course; I saw it, it was a matter of visual observation—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100070"/>
               <p>I think the force must have been from without, inward, from behind forwards, and from above, downwards; in other words, in the direction of the knife—the difficulty of reconciling it with any fall is, that the wound should be from above downwards—if the body was falling, it must have been from below upwards—the weight of the body would give force enough to cause such a wound, if it could be applied—that would presume that the body must be in an inverted position—it could not be standing in a natural position.</p>

                  </hi>. I had attended Mrs. Davey for some months pre<lb/>vious to this—it was through me that my son was introduced to her, and also attended her—on the night of 24th May, I was sent for by my son to 23, Newton Street—I went there and found the doors all open, so that I was able to walk in—I found Mr. Moon lying on the rug in front of the fire-place, dead—I afterwards went into the drawing-room, and there found Mrs. Davey—her first words were "Oh, doctor, how is he?"—I said "He is dead, Mrs. Davey"—she said "Dead! dead! impossible!"—I said "Yes, it is really so, Mrs. Davey"—she then fell into a swoon in the chair, and when she recovered she said "Oh, doctor, I am afraid it is I that have done it! oh, doctor, I am afraid it is I that have done it!"—I said "Impossible, Mrs. Davey, you could not have done it"—she said "I really think it was so"—I had examined the wound before I said that—her words were "I really think it must be so, but I don't know how it happened"—I said "For God's sake, explain yourself, Mrs. Davey"—she then said "We were both sitting after dinner, <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> said something which annoyed me excessively"—I don't remember that she said of whom he was speaking; that she then said to him "Don't repeat it, I can't bear it;" that he said "I will repeat it, and if you are not silent, I will fling a bottle at your head"—she then said "I jumped up with the knife in my hand, we struggled and fell, I saw the blood pouring out, and I did not know how"—I said "Then I must send for your husband; where is he?"—she said "I believe he is at his club, my servant shall go for him directly"—that was the whole of the conversation—she asked me to go and see the deceased again, and begged to be allowed to go and kiss his face—I told her she must keep still till her husband came home—I then went out and made a communication to the police—when I first entered the room I noticed that the knife basket was lying on the table opposite the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My impression is that the blow was received whilst the deceased's arm was being uplifted—I should like to give my reasons for that—I think I was the first that explored the wound; I tried to pass my finger in the direction that the wound appeared to me externally—I failed to do so, my finger would not go through—I then attempted to pass my finger downwards, it would not go in that direction—I then passed it upwards, and I found that it would go in that direction, and then the finger passed between the ribs directly under the heart—that leads me to the conclusion that the arm was up, because when the arm is uplifted the skin is lifted, therefore, what appeared a direct wound at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> may still have</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am assistant surgeon, and lecturer on physiology, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Mr. Moon—I heard Mr. Savory give the description of the result of that examination, and I entirely agree with him—the wound was downwards, forwards, and inwards—I believe it to have gone in a uniform direction—I was present at the arrangement of the cheat of a patient at the hospital for the purpose of showing that a weapon might go through the ribs in a slanting direction, and yet reach the apex of the heart—there is no difficulty in a weapon going between the sixth and seventh ribs, and reaching the apex of the heart—that arises from what Mr. Savory describes as the obliquity of the ribs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. The wound went downwards, forwards, and inwards, those three words express the same direction—I mean that neither of them is incompatible with the other—each of those terries means something different, but they are all perfectly consistent, and exclude the opinion of an upward direction—the orifice of the wound was about an inch and a half—supposing it was a stab, the orifice would be larger than the width of the instrument stabbing—I see no difficulty in that—you have a knife, one side of which is a cutting one, it would be in the highest degree probable if you stick it into a body, that the edge would divide the integuments through which it passes—it would be im<lb/>possible that the line taken by the knife, should be mathematically straight—the wound is nearly twice the width of the instrument that makes it, because if you pass a knife through the skin, one end of which is a cutting one, the chances are you will make a wound larger than the diameter of the knife—I cannot tell, from the appearance of the wound, which part was nearer to the shoulder—those three definitions exclude the notion that the wound may have taken an oblique direction upwards—with those three-elements in the course of the wound, it still may be direct—the orifice of the wound being somewhat larger than the width of the knife that made it, would depend upon whether the sharp part was upwards or down wards. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here made a sketch of the position of the wound.</hi>) I did not take notice at the time of the width of the wound, but Dr. Westmacott took notes in writing—Mr. Savory is a coadjutor of mine at the hospital—I approve of this diagram (<hi rend="italic">the photograph</hi>) except that the entrance was a little larger than this—the knife went between the sixth and seventh ribs—I did not make any drawing of the course of the wound at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">W. W. BAKER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>) I did this rough drawing of the course of the wound according to the best of my judgment and belief of what I saw at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—it is not physically impossible that the wound arose from an accident—I have examined wounds from stabs in the course of my practice, but I have no special experience—my experience is founded on my general knowledge of anatomy and surgery—I don't know an instance of a struggle for a knife with an innocent intention, and a party falling on it and being wounded to death; but I think such a case far from impossible—the weight of Mr. Moon's body falling on a knife, would be quite sufficient to produce such a wound, if the knife was fixed—it is not physically impossible that if Mr. Moon, in a struggle, had seized hold of this knife, or of the arm which held it, and in the struggle had fallen on the prisoner, or the prisoner on him, that it might have produced such a wound: or if the prisoner caught hold of his arm, or he of hers—I use the word physically in con<lb/>tradiction to what is called morally impossible; I mean that it is not contrary to natural laws—I do not wish to qualify the words "physically, impossible" in any way—in my judgment it would not probably happen by an accident—though I say that it is not physically impossible, I have not formed the opinion that it occurred in that way—I have formed the opinion that Mr. Savory has formed, that it was produced by a stab—I consider it in the highest degree impossible that the wound was caused accidentally—I should hardly think it likely that gentlemen in my pro<lb/>fession, of equal position with myself, might, with the same facts before them, form a totally different opinion, but I am not prepared to say—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and was introduced into this case at Mr. Savory's instance—I attended with him on behalf of the family—I was not ac<lb/>quainted with the family at all—I have been two years lecturer on physic<lb/>ology at St. Bartholomew's and six or seven years at the college.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I think everybody would be able to form a very good judgment as to the wound going downwards, forwards, and inwards; common sense might dictate part, but a medical man might form an opinion better—by downwards I mean, from the head towards the feet; by inwards, in a direction from the side of the body to the middle line—I don't think I could give a diagram inwards on a piece of flat paper, I could give the direction alone—I could represent a breast-bone, and the upper surface, but by a mere line without shading, I could not represent it on a flat surface.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked what you mean by physically impossible, and you say, not contrary to any natural law, if you find a man with a hole on the top of his head, it would not be physically impossible that he should have turned a somersault and done it, and that is what you mean by not physically impossible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I agree perfectly with Mr. Savory, that the angular direction of the wound was 2 inches in 5 inches—when I speak of the wound being produced by Mr. Moon's weight, I speak of the amount of penetration into the body, irrespective of other circumstances—it is far from impossible for a person to fall on a knife and produce a wound which would cause death—that answer does not assume any particular position of the wound, or any particular position of the body—in forming a judg<lb/>ment in this case, I have viewed all the circumstances, the situation, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100073"/>
               <p>direction of the wound, and so forth, and I believe it not to have been accidental.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Taking the view of the knife entering, we will not suggest any cause, but the elements involved mere direction and force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a mathematical diagram would represent it—the diagonal of a cube would undoubtedly be downwards, forwards, and inwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you can discover no ground for supposing this was an accidental wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—a blow from another person might be accidental or wilful, but an accidental puncturing would hardly be a blow—a person falling in a fit of delirium, or intoxication, would not be likely to produce such a wound, but it could not be impossible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a knife struck into the body enters the skin and punctures the flesh, would not the orifice be enlarged by withdrawing the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely, indeed that would be a good way of accounting for the difference between the width of the orifice and the width of the blade—it is very likely that the act of withdrawing might enlarge the wound without reference to the direction the knife took when in the body—if the man fell on the knife, it would remain in the wound, unless someone else withdrew it, to do which the body must be turned over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The apex of the heart had been punctured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that would produce very speedy death—I believe it is in the highest degree im<lb/>probable that the deceased could have withdrawn the knife himself—I can-not say that death would be so speedy as to make that certain, but I have the firmest belief that that could not have been done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, and knew the deceased very intimately—he was the greatest friend I had—I have known him about twenty years—I have also known the prisoner for some time—about a month before this I was present at a quarrel at 23, Newton Road—it was in the middle of dinner—Mr. Moon asked her if she had paid certain bills, she said "Yes"—a threat was used in the course of the quarrel—she said "By heavens! I will have your life some day!"—I knew the prisoner first about twelve years ago, but I only renewed the acquaintance fifteen months ago—about six weeks previous to this, one day after luncheon, at St. James's Street, I heard her say "By Jove! I will stab you some day i"—on the day after the catastrophe, about 1.50 in the afternoon, I went to her house in consequence of this telegram which I received—(I found that it had been sent by Mrs. Toynbee)—she said "Have not you heard the news?"—I said "No, what news?"—she said "What, have not you heard yet?"—I said "No, what is it?"—she said "Not about poor <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> Moon?"—I said "No"—she said "<hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> Moon is dead"—I said "Good God! when did he die?"—she said "Last night"—I said "Where, in Portman Squaret" that id his father's house—she said "No, here"—I asked "What did he die of?"—she said "He got into one of his violent fits of passion, burst a blood vessel, and dropped down dead"—I wanted to see the body; she said "You can't go in, the door is locked"—I said "What a fool you were to send for the police, <hi rend="italic">Flo.</hi>"—there was a policeman in the hall when I went in—she said "There is going to be an inquest, you will see it in the papers"—she told me she expected his brother John and his brother-in-law there directly—I said I had rather not see them, and would not wait, and I left.</p>

Mr. Moon became acquainted with the prisoner about twelve years ago—there were occasional interruptions in their acquaintance; twice, I think—I first knew her under very different circumstances, and when I renewed my acquaintance, I was aware that she was living with Mr. Moon—I am assistant-surgeon in the Guards, and have been so thirteen and a half years—during the whole of that time I have known Mr. Moon—I have been in the habit of visiting constantly at 23, Newton Road, during the last twelve months, and sometimes meeting Mr. Moon, and sometimes not—I was not more than five or six minutes in her presence when she made the statement about his having burst a blood vesssel—I was on very friendly terms with her—I used to call her "<hi rend="italic">Flo</hi>"—I frequently dined there—sometimes there were young ladies there—Miss</p>

               <p>Dulin used to be there—I do not know her intimately, on my oath—I say "on my oath," because you used the word "intimately," and it was my impression that you meant criminally—if I am asked if I know a lady intimately, I consider that it means criminally, in some cases—I travelled with Mr. Moon on several occasions—I went as his guest; he paid my hotel bills—someone else travelled with us, whom he paid for also—a companion; not my companion—we travelled abroad—he used to pay my railway fare; I went as his guest entirely—he paid all my expenses—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter I wrote to the prisoner the day before the occurrence—I was constantly at the house, playing and singing, and joining in the entertainment, both when Mr. Mooon was there and when he was not—not almost every day, but very frequently, and taking my meals there—I was in the habit of writing to her as "My dear River"—I have written to her frequently in that way.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am surgeon to Charing Cross Hospital, and have been twenty-five years a lecturer on anatomy and surgery—I have heard the whole of the medical evidence, and the whole of the material evidence in this case, and I have read the evidence before the Coroner—I have seen the photographic diagram Mr. Savory produced—this drawing produced by Mr. Westmacott does not differ materially from Mr. Savory's—I believe that the wound on the deceased penetrating through the left side to the heart, might have been done accidentally, from the evidence I have heard—I did not attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and never examined the deceased—my evidence is founded on what I have heard in Court during the last two days, and what would happen under the circumstances—I have heard Mr. Savory's evidence, and assuming it is correct, I believe the wound might have been purely accidental—it is equally probable that it was caused by a stab or accidentally, and I think it is more probable, from the evidence, that it took place by pure accident than from an intentional stab—assuming it to have occurred as I believe it to have been done, purely as a matter of accident, the knife being held by Mrs. Davey dagger<lb/>ways, if she held it in her right hand so as to have a firm hold of it, and at the same moment her hand was instinctively upraised, it would be momentarily done under the aggravation of it being said that something would be thrown at her: Mr. Moon, I suppose, passed from where he was to her, and suddenly approached her with a view of wresting the instrument from her hand, he would come quickly to her with his left side, raise his left hand and arm, and grasp her hand or wrist, or the handle of the in<lb/>strument; her hand with the instrument would be suddenly drawn down by a natural instinct, and with his body close to it, it would go down into his chest; he would then have fallen, I believe, to the position in which he was found—if the wound had been inflicted that way, I believe it would have taken the course it did, which Mr. Savory explains—it went downwards, forwards, and inwards, between the skin and muscle, and through the space between the sixth and seventh ribs, injuring the front edge of the left lung, entering the back of the heart, and piercing its apex—I assume that Mr. Moon, either had his hand on the wrist or the handle of the knife, or grasping the hand; or if he first seized the wrist, that would make no matter; if I were to seize this knife, and take if from the table, I should assume an attitude of defence; a per<lb/>son coming to me from this side would have his left side towards me; he raises his hand, and as a matter of course exposes the left side of his body, and in trying to take the knife away, he draws down the hand, and also lessens the power of the muscles, which are in an upraised position, and obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, it passes into his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BY THE COURT</hi>. I have adopted this view from very deep consideration of all the circumstances, and among them is one I have not alluded to, as showing that Mr. Moon did upraise his hand beyond a distinctive move<lb/>ment, the arm must have been upraised and the wound inflicted; when the</p>

               <p>arm falls the muscles fall, and so it was that Mr. Phillips felt it to go a little upward—I assume the hand to be upraised with the knife in its grasp; how it came to be upraised, whether by the owner or not I cannot say, but I suppose it may have been the instinct to grasp the instrument—the view I entertain is, that Mr. Moon in seizing the hand, or the wrist, or the handle, drew it down—I do not suppose he raised it up first, I think he pushed it downwards from the beginning, and as his body was so near, it had just gone in; he drew it down suddenly, and the knife was made to enter his body.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would the wrist be drawn down I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the movement that he would make; if I were about to take a knife from the hand of a person, I should certainly and instinctively draw the hand down, because the higher the arm is raised the greater my danger—I think the prisoner's arm must have been raised some distance, fully this (<hi rend="italic">imitating</hi>), so as to give it the necessary impetus to drive it into the chest, which would require a great deal of force, and if I went to seize a knife in that way I should draw it downwards with all my force—I have never said the prisoner's arm was raised, I have said that it was depressed by Mr. Moon's left arm—I do not think a person could pull it down with the left hand with such force that it should be forwards, inwards, and downwards, there was no back action—this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Phillips</hi>) represents Mrs. Davey, he takes the knife and he raises his arm, I as Mr. Moon, with my coat buttoned, come from this side and draw the arm, and I take this hand and draw it right down into my chest; if the coat had not been buttoned, some little irregularity would occur, but being buttoned, the knife goes instantly down, I may or may not use my right hand, but I draw it down with force enough to draw it into my chest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not impute to you anything but what is right and con<lb/>scientions, but you supposed the shoulder raised upwards before, now you have given a theory that her hand was raised up and he pulls it down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I most fully intended to say that from the first, I mean that he raised his hand to that of Mrs. Davey—I believe the knife if kept at a distance would have far less chance of being withdrawn from the grasp than if it was drawn near.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might this in any way be accomplished in a fall, in a struggle between two parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it might; if an effort were made by Mr. Moon to obtain the knife, he might have fallen on it; there is double resistance, the resistance of the hand that held it on one side and the weight of his body on the other—there must be some resistance; if I grasp a hand of another person there is force, there is power of resistance, and if I fall, the two together would do what has occurred, but I believe my view to be the case, though I cannot deny the possibility of the other—an accidental wound would tally in every way with the supposition I have made.</p>

I understand the wound to be 61/2 inches from the breast bone here—supposing the wound to be between the sixth and seventh ribs, and taking the middle line, and one inch forward, that would be a good deal under the left arm, but quite consistent with my theory—when I was giving the illustration on Mr. Phillips, I made the knife come down at no particular point, I merely wanted to show the way the accident occurred—I was not present at any of the examinations—I was first applied to, to be a witness, a fortnight or three weeks ago—in the illus<lb/>tration</p>

               <p>I gave, my mind was not applied to the wound being more forward or backward—I don't know whether I used both hands to bring the assailant down—I stated, in connection with that, that the left hand certainly was used, but whether the right was used I cannot say—if I approach a person with a dagger, I raise my left hand, and expose this side of my body, the very part that has been penetrated—I use my hand thus, and draw the hand downwards, and drawing it to me, it enters my body—I don't see where I strike my own body—I assume that the dagger is in the hand of a woman, in an upraised condition—I can say no more than that I believe the attitude was just that which would immediately and instinctively follow on taking up a knife, held dagger ways—I believe the higher the hand is raised the greater would be the force necessary to draw it down—I don't know why I should make use of the phrase that the knife was raised in a striking or threatening attitude—I suppose her to have held the knife in an attitude of self-defence, judging from the collateral circumstances, by which I mean, the great fondness that was shown by the two to one another, and the sum of money that had been given—I am referring not to the medical question, or to the appearance of the wound, but to the effect of the evidence—I think the prisoner's attitude was just as much one of protection as of threatening—if any person were to tell me he was about to throw a bottle at my head, and I seized this, I should place myself in an attitude of pro<lb/>tection—I do not believe it follows that she was about to use the dagger—if a person were intending to make a blow, they would certainly use the attitude she assumed; that is the attitude I believe that Mrs. Davey was in—from the position of the wound, I think there is no doubt that Mr. Moon approached her with his left side towards her; I mean that she was to the right of him—the table was close here, which prevented him coming full face to her—I consider he approached her with his front partly towards her, but more inclined to the left—I do not think there is anything to favour the view that she approached him from the right—I have said it was more probable that he approached her, while she kept her position, but it is possible she approached him—I might just as well have said one way as the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said "From the evidence I have heard in the case, my judg<lb/>ment is that it is more probable that it was the result of an accident than intentional; "I ask you to justify that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I justify it by saying that I take my data from the surroundings of the case, and upon those I have my views—judging from the medical facts above, there is certainly nothing which renders it more likely that it was an accident than an intentional blow—I assume the weapon to be grasped by the prisoner in my hypothesis—I don't think it necessary that it should be still grasped by her at the moment it entered the deceased's body, but my hypothesis is, that it was so—I think the fact of the body being found on its back, inclining to one side, favours that hypothesis, that being the position in which he is, he receives the wound, and falls powerless—I see the arm-chair marked in this plan, and a chair with its back towards the wall in which the door is, not the one to the fire-place—if Mrs. Davey went from the arm chair to the sideboard, and then approached Mr. Moon, sitting in this chair with its back towards the wall, she would be approaching him from his left—pre<lb/>suming she had the instrument in her right hand, his left would be just from that.</p>

               <p>in which he was sitting with its back to the door of the couch wall, she approaches in a threatening attitude, and he raises up his left arm, would a blow administered suddenly, give the direction in which the wound was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whatever their relative positions were, it would do so; that is the way in which I believe it happened—that would be almost instantaneous, and in<lb/>volve no struggle and disturbance at all—I am speaking of this chair (<hi rend="italic">Point<lb/>ing it out in the plan</hi>), and if that was the relative position of the two persons meeting, the same result would ensue as I have stated—if the chair was moved out of the way, and he was nearer the fire-place, so that the fatal blow had taken place there, that would make no difference, provided she came from the sideboard—I do not think that upon my hypothesis the wound would have commenced more in front, and gone more backwards, nor laterally—I think the forward movement of the right arm is always more in an inclination forwards, or the left arm—my hypothesis assumed the left arm, and it is not altered; taking the left arm to be seizing the wrist, or handle of the knife, or arm, the wound would be far more likely to be from back to front than in an opposite direction—I have heard the wound de<lb/>scribed—it does not point out a wound coming somewhat more from behind than from the front.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital, and was late teacher of anatomy at St. Mary's Medical School—I have been in Court during the two days of this trial, and have listened attentively to the evidence of the surgeons called on the part of the prosecution—I have heard from them the position of the wound, and have carefully listened to the evidence of the last witness, and, in my opinion, it is not at all necessary to establish that the wound must have been inflicted by the blow of a second person; it may have been inflicted in the way Mr. Canton describes; he suggests that Mr. Moon went to her, but she may have gone to him—he puts either alternative, and I put both; he might have approached her; I rather gathered that he concluded that she approached him—if either party came in contact with the other, the same result would follow; if he walked to her and she to him, it might have occurred in the way mentioned—no two witnesses have agreed about the position of the wound; but taking it at 701/2 inches from the middle of the breast, and 91/2 from the middle of the spine, and entering between the sixth and seventh ribs, there is nothing inconsistent with it happening in the way Mr. Canton has represented—it might have been occasioned in that manner by accident—I agree in Mr. Canton's</p>

               <p>opinion that the hand might be brought down in the struggle—it might have occurred by two parties struggling for the knife, and the deceased falling on the knife—a parallel case occurred to me at St. Mary's Hospital—a party falling on the knife would not be a blow, it would be the reception of a wound—I can suggest another mode, the deceased and Mrs. Davey might be struggling for the knife and they might have fallen—the knife might be in a fixed position, and she might have fallen upon him, or he upon her, but the knife must have been fixed, or held, so as to cause resistance—there would be resistance enough in the hand—I have had practical expe<lb/>rience upon which I base that opinion, in the Spring of 1844, at St. Mary's Hospital, in the accident ward—I am prepared, if Mr. Giffard asks me, to give the details of that case <hi rend="italic">in to to</hi>—if there is a knife which presents resis<lb/>tance, anybody falling on it might receive such a wound—I express that opinion as to the power to enter between the sixth and seventh ribs into the heart and cause death, that is the result of my practical observation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Must the degree of force with which the knife pene<lb/>trated have been considerable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> According to the experiments I made, it requires enormous force—I am certain that the blow must have been inflicted with considerable force—according to Mr. Savory's diagram, it did not touch either of the ribs, it passed between them—a little bit of rib is chipped out in this diagram. (<hi rend="italic">This was not the photograph taken from Mr. Moon.</hi>) I have assumed the account of the wound as given to be correct—I did not see it—if I take this diagram, I must come to a conclusion that the knife did not go clean between the ribs, as a portion is chipped out—it was not I who suggested the difficulty about touching the apex of the heart, and yet going downwards, but we have had several conversations—we have evidence in the examinations before us that the knife entered between the sixth and seventh rib, and yet touched the apex of the heart—I did not come here to prove that it could not, because the heart was wounded—I never questioned that for a moment—I accept Mr. Savory's evidence—I say that no two witnesses are agreed—the wound went down<lb/>wards, forwards, and inwards—I did not bear it given in evidence, that inasmuch as the wound passed between the sixth and seventh ribs, the direction of it must have been upwards—I always assumed the direction of the wound to be downwards, because the upper part was above the internal aperture—it always had preserved one uniform line—my impression was that it had turned more, but that might be the position of the heart in inspiration—that had occurred to me before Mr. Savory said it—the con<lb/>clusion I came to was, that it was forwards and downwards—Mr. Savory's suggestion about the descent of the heart during inspiration, was not a new fact to me—my chief reason for receiving what Mr. Savory has said, is because there was not that difference between the external and the internal wound as was stated—if I had received what Mr. Phillips, jun., stated, that the knife traversed between the ribs and the skin nearly 3 inches, and then went in, that would have been different, but it went obliquely in—I must have accepted the fact of it rising a little, but Mr. Savory said that that was all wrong—I adopt Mr. Savory's statement, and reject the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard Mr. Savory's explanation of the descent of the heart in respiration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I retract that; it was answered rather hurriedly—of course, I know that the heart descends a little in respiration—I say still that I had accepted Mr. Phillips jun.'s view of the course of the wound, and was prepared to show that the wound must have had an upward tendency—the first day I heard Mr. Phillips' evidence, the theory was that the knife went upwards, and in that way suggesting the possibility of a fall upon the knife, and I accepted that theory—I came here as a witness the first day, and was prepared to show to all possibility or probability this happened by a fall, and I base that upon Mr. Phillips' evidence that the wound would have taken an upward tendency—there is very little downward action in it at all—there is an angle of 2 inches in 5, downwards—still that does not do away with my belief as to the fall—I was prepared to My that a fall might have produced that wound upward, and I adhere to that now that I find the direction of the wound was 2 inches downward—it might have done so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I mean that the body must fall from the force of the blow backwards, if delivered with sufficient force; you could not stick a knife in a leg of mutton without moving it on the table—it is a question of degree—I have not seen the cut—having seen Mr. Canton's demonstration, I think it is reasonably probable that that wound could be made in the way suggested, under the arm—the cut in this coat is fully 3 inches below the left armpit—it is in conformity with the direct stab—I do not believe it possible to construct a theory to explain it outside the struggle—you may have people engaged in a struggle moving in fifty different directions in that number of seconds, and it is only sufficient to show that the knife would encounter a sufficient force to account for that theory—after considering Dr. Canton's theory, I say that it is reasonably probable—in my own mind I have discarded all theory of how this sort of thing could have been done—it is not reasonable that it was done by a stab—the appearances presented by a stab would be such as those that have been described by Mr. Savory in his report—the appearance described are equally consistent with the theory suggested by the knife drawn down by the man's own hand and stabbing himself—Mr. Canton has assumed that a person was advancing towards him with a knife and the arm uplifted—I account for the knife getting to that place by his seizing with his left hand the uplifted arm of the other person—everything is in such obscurity, I cannot suggest any theory by which that wound could have happened—I was first consulted three weeks ago—we consulted this morning—I have declined to entertain any theory up to this time—I mean to say I formed no decided opinion as to the reasons that led me to those conclusions—I am quite certain I never said I could not support Dr. Canton's theory—it is as consistent that she stabbed the deceased as that she did not—there is nothing unreasonable or improbable, so far as the medical evidence goes, that the prisoner stabbed him.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am chief surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital, and a Member of the College of Surgeons—about three weeks ago I directed my attention to this case—I think this wound was more probably the result of accident, and more easily explainable as such than an intended stab—I speak from the medical evidence only—I think there is great diffi<lb/>culty in accounting for the kind of wound, if it had been produced by a stab—if produced in that way, I think you must assume the person stabbed must have been in a fixed position—it would have been exceedingly difficult, in my opinion, the person being a free agent, to have driven a knife of that kind through the integuments beneath the sixth rib into the heart, and made such a wound as has been described—I assume that the deceased was in a fixed position, and that as far as any voluntary movement is concerned, he must have been fixed—there was no jagging or notching of the edges of the wound where it penetrated the chest, and that must have been, I believe, necessarily the case, had a person been in the condition to have been a voluntary agent—in puncturing the chest of a patient, it is essential that he should be kept most quiet and still in order to drive the instrument into the chest—the slightest movement would almost frustrate the act—I think these diagrams are very at indeed to mislead persons with regard to the facility with which an instrument could be driven into the chest—they are manifestly wrong here, the ribs are represented separated from each other, much larger than they usually are—in almost every man the space between the ribs is the same—I have no intention of imputing anything to Mr. Baker or Mr. Savory, but these photographs do not represent the state of things in a human being when alive—I agree with Dr. Canton's theory, that it was caused by the deceased falling.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The immediate cause of death was the penetration of the pericardium? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the heart—I think when the body fell it had no control over itself, and by that means it forced the knife, I think, into the heart, causing its insertion into the apex of the heart—in my judgment it must have been caused by accident—I am quite sure if it had been other<lb/>wise there would have been some sign about the wound, showing it was jagged and notched, and not such a clean wound—if this had been a deli<lb/>berate blow, the deceased must have fallen in the direction the force was given—he would have fallen backwards—I think it consistent that he might have taken the knife out of the wound himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I have not had much experience of wounds to the heart—I think it possible that the deceased raised his left arm to protect himself, and that she stabbed him with one clear blow—I have considered that hypothesis—it has not been discussed, but I have turned it over in my mind—there is a surgical fact which renders it un<lb/>reasonable or improbable that the prisoner stabbed the deceased with one clean stab, in one continuous direction, and withdrew the weapon; the moment the wound was felt he would have shrunk or moved, and under those circumstances there would have been great difficulty in carrying the thrust on so as to make a clean thrust—as far as volition is concerned, it must have been a fixed position—the difficulty of getting an instrument through such a small space is impossible—if a person was taken off his</p>

               <p>guard, you might stab him in the way described—the walls of the chest of a thin person are easier penetrated than a powerful person's, because you would not have so much tissue to go through—a good deal would depend upon the thinness or thickness of the weapon—I think if I wanted to stab a man between the sixth and seventh ribs, there would be a difficulty—the man would move involuntarily, and that would get rid of the blow—it would be oblique to pass between those ribs—the difficulty of hitting the <hi rend="italic">inter-costal</hi> space is very great—from the commencement of the orifice of the wound, to the apex of the heart, is one uniform line; that leads my mind to the conclusion as to the probability of the fall having completed what Mr. Canton's theory suggests in a struggle begun—in falling against some fixed body, it might have been done; by giving some impetus to the knife in the fall against some fixed body—supposing the knife had gone through the first two inches of its course, it would have been very difficult to have altered its direction; the ribs would have confined the blade—that would not have made the wound jagged, if it had been forced against some other body in falling—the wound is from 2 in. to 3 in. under the arm pit, and that has been the mistake throughout the inquiry—the perforation of the clothes would not give the precise point of the wound—the evidence of the wound does not correspond with the clothing—how the knife entered is difficult to say; I would leave that to Mr. Canton's theory—I think it possible the knife might be in the hands of two persons, and that they might have accidentally fallen.</p>

It is purely conjecture how the knife entered—it is the most difficult question I ever had to deal with—the size of the wound, between the ribs, would be enlarged as a matter of course; not by the cut itself, but by the muscular structures—the wound is quite smooth—if it had been inflicted by the man falling upon the knife, it would have been as it is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner.</hi> "I have only to say that I am innocent, and that if I had been guilty, in my own mind no punishment could be too great for me, if I did that to him who for so many years has been all in all to me. I left my husband for him. Mr. Moon knew me when I was in society, and in my own family. Upon my husband leaving me, he wished me to get a divorce. I returned to my husband at Boulogne to save him from a divorce. I returned turned to this country again, and my husband followed and broke up every<lb/>thing in the house, saying that all I wanted was a divorce, and that he would not have it. Mr. Turquand wrote letters to my husband at the dictation of Mr. Moon. After that his family persuaded him to leave me. He did leave me. I went to John Moon and asked him to give Frederick Moon a letter for me, and I would never see him again. He said 'No,' and that Sir Francis had determined that no letters should be sent. In the meantime Frederick Moon returned, and it was agreed that I should belong to him; not to live together, but to belong to him; and I have all these years belonged to him. This last year or eighteen months he was always unhappy. He thought he did not see enough of me. He then proposed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100087"/>
               <p>that I should live with him altogether. He was very unhappy. He then settled that he would be with me. We have been most happy. He was most kind. His whole consideration was my happiness, and I could not have done him an injury. He tried to take the knife from me. I am not sure whether he got it or not. We struggled and fell. I thought at first that I must be the one injured. I found blood on me; warm blood. I said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Fred., Fred.,</hi> what have you done?"Then I found, of course, that it was him, and not myself. I tried all I could to do something to stop it. First of all I applied cold water. Then I remembered that cold water produced blood instead of stopping it. Then I sent for ice and tried that, and then the doctors came. Then, my Lord, you spoke to the Jury that the servants heard a scream, and that there were only so many steps dividing the kitchen from the dining-room. There are two nights of steps; I should think the first one about twelve, the other one about six. Mr. Eccles can answer that. You spoke of the scream. The fact is, the bell rung violently, and the servant, Mary Hale, rang the call-bell. That has been in dispute; as to Mr. Pickford's evidence, you must know I could not say he had broken a blood-vessel. I have nothing more to say, my Lord."</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 295), On Tuesday night, 25th April, I was on duty in the Woolwich Road—Kidbrook Lane is attached to my beat—I went on duty at 10 o'clock, and remained on duty till 6 a.m.—on Wednesday morning, 26th April, I was in Kidbrook Lane between 1.50 and 1.45—I passed through the lane (I had not passed through it previously from the time I came on duty)—nothing attracted my attention at that time—Mortimer was the policeman that I succeeded on that beat—I don't think he was on duty up to 10 o'clock; he was in the fore part of the evening—I passed through the lane again at 4.15—nothing attracted my attention then—it was as I came back again in the lane—I did not come back the same way—I passed up on the foot-path, outside the lane—there is a hedge between the foot-path and the lane, so that I should not be able to see any<lb/>thing that was in the lane unless I walked in the lane—when I went down I went on the foot-path beside the lane—when I returned I came back in the lane, and I then found a young woman on her hands and knees, on the side of the lane next Eltham—the lane runs from Eltham towards Morden College—I came up on the right-hand side of the lane; the foot-path is on the side next Eltham—the lane is about 7 yards wide between the hedges—when I got up to the woman, she was on her hands and knees, moaning very faintly, "Oh, my poor head, my poor head!"—I asked her what was the matter with her, and she made no answer—I noticed that her right cheek was covered with blood—I put my hand on her left shoulder and gave her a slight shake, and asked her what was the matter, and how she came by the injuries—she raised her left hand, and said "Take hold of my hand," at the same time turning her head a little to the left, which enabled me to see her face, and I noticed a cut on her left cheek and a lump of blood on her forehead, which appeared to me to be her brain protruding; I should say it was just in the centre of the forehead—when I saw such a fearful sight, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100094"/>
               <p>hesitated a moment to give her my hand; and as I stretched forth my hand she fell flat on her face, and said "Let me die!"—she never spoke after that—when I could not get her to answer any questions I turned round, and found there was blood just exactly behind where I was standing—I should say it would cover nearly a foot square, it was a large clot of blood, clear blood; there were spots of blood about a foot square, but there was one large clot, a lump of blood as it were in the middle of it—I saw some footmarks about, a good many, close by where the blood was—the ground was very soft and sloppy—her gloves were lying within 2 feet of her, one in the other, and her hat within 2 feet of her gloves—I looked about, but could not see anyone, and I ran down to Well Hall Farm, knowing that the ostler would be in the stables at that time, and I sent for a stretcher—as I went down to Well Hall, one of the men told me that Sergeant Haynes was outside—I told him what I had found in the lane—he went up to where the woman was lying, and I went to Eltham after a stretcher—she was then taken on the stretcher to Dr. King's surgery, and then to Guy's Hospital—when I found her, her head was lying close by the hedge, towards Eltham; her head was bobbing up and down from the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. I went on duty at 10 o'clock—I did not go down Kidbrook Lane before 2 o'clock—I was down the lane twice during the night, once at 2.15, and again at 4 o'clock—I heard no<lb/>thing when I went down the first time—I went as far as the brook then, I was coming from Eltham; I went to the brook, along the footpath—I passed the place where I afterwards found the woman—I came from Eltham the first time—my beat extends up the lane to the rivulet—that is the end of my beat—I then returned back again—I passed the place where I after<lb/>wards found the body, twice on that occasion, going up and coming down—I heard nothing on either of those occasions—that was at 1.45—I passed, going up, on the footpath outside the hedge, where the body was lying—there is a hedge between; the hedge was on my right, as I went up from Eltham the first time—I returned back down the lane, in the lane, and past this very spot—the width of the lane is 7ft. between the hedges—I measured it with a 2ft. rule, and made it 21ft. between the two banks, including the ditches—there is one little ditch on the left hand side—I was walking close to that as I was going back towards Eltham—when I found the body, at 4 o'clock, it was on my right hand side, between the place where I went when I went up the lane to the rivulet, and the place I passed when I came down at 1.45—at that time I saw nothing, and heard nothing—I found the body on the right hand side, as I was going back to Eltham, into the Woolwich Road, which leads from Eltham to Shooter's Hill, past the Greenwich Cemetery—at 4.15 I went on the path up to the brook, the same path I had done the first time—I did not go into the lane at all before I got to the brook—when I got to the brook at the end of my beat, I turned to come back, and came down the lane, and found the poor girl in the lane, on the right hand side; I walking on the left, near the ditch—she was in a spot between the place I had passed going up, and the place I passed in coming down—I bad a lantern with me—I did not turn on my light at all that night; it was getting rather light at the time I found her, so that I did not want my light; there were footmarks about, near the blood—the reason I did not use my lantern was because it was not so dark as I have seen it there; it was light enough for me to see—I did</p>

               <p>not use my lantern when I went up at 1.45, nor when I came back, it was light enough without—there seemed to be a good many footmarks about, but they seemed to be defaced, as if there had been dew falling on them during the night—they appeared to be going all ways—I did not see any blood besides the pool, except under her head; there was not much—it seemed to be clotted up in the mud—there was a little; I should say I might cover it with my hand—the pool was about 4ft. from her—the ground was trampled about where the footmarks were—she was at Guy's Hospital until the Sunday, when she died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The height of the hedge would be, I should My, about 10 ft.—from 10 to 11ft. opposite where the girl was lying; it was a high, thick hedge—it was not very dark, nor yet very light, before morning broke—I don't think there was any moon—by 4.15 the morning was breaking—I use my lantern to look at particular things—when it is a very dark night we use it sometimes in finding our way, especially in a place like that; it is a very lonely place—I could not tell from the marks on the grass whether she had moved or crawled along from one place to another, I did not notice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi>) On Wednesday morn<lb/>ing, 26th April, about 4.10, Gunn came to me, in the gardens of a gentle<lb/>man named Langley, in the Woolwich Road—he made some communication to me in consequence of which I went into Kidbrook Lane—I went through the field by the side of the lane till I came to the spot where I found the woman lying on her back, with her head in the direction of Kidbrook from Eltham—she was taken away on a stretcher to Dr. King's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. I saw that the grass was trampled down round about the spot—it appeared as if there had been a struggle; that was near where the body was—I did not notice footsteps then, I did after<lb/>wards; about noon in the day; I traced them for some little distance towards the brook or rivulet—I was examined before the Magistrate, and Mid I found some spots of blood—there were three spots at the edge of the rivulet, on one stone, I believe, as if they were dropped there—I believe that was over 300 yards from where the body was found, on the Kidbrook tide of the rivulet; I mean the other side of it, as you go up from Elthem—there is a plank that goes over the rivulet in the lane—the blood was to the right of the plank, going from Eltham, and very likely four yards from it, in the lane—the brook goes right across the lane—going from Eltham, the plank would be on the left—it was where the brook ran through the lane that I found the spots of blood—I saw some long sliding footsteps going in the direction from the body towards the brook—I found a locket among the girl's clothing—I took that locket to Randall, a silversmith, in London Street, Greenwich—I took with me a man named Humphreys—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. In April last, I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—about 7 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, the deceased was brought there—she came at once under my examination—I have my notes of it—she was quite unconscious, and very cold—the injuries were very severe which she had received, and were chiefly confined to the anterior half of the head; they were all of an incised character, clean cuts—there was one slight abrasion on the left cheek; with that exception they were in<lb/>cised—there were altogether about a dozen wounds on the face and head—there was one over the left ear—there was a wound down to the left temporal bone, and it was smashed in; the bone itself was fractured and depressed—on the bone being raised, the brain was discovered to be lacerated—the injury was external and internal—there were two other wounds which were more severe than the others on the face—one above the right eye, about 3 inches in length; the bone was completely smashed up, so much so that several fragments were lying quite loose, and the brain was protruding; that was a cut—the other was a transverse wound on the upper lip, which extended down to the upper jaw bone, which was broken, and a piece was removed; that was also a cut—those were the most severe of the injuries—there were altogether twelve or fourteen, the others were less serious, but they were quite separate, distinct wounds—there were several cuts on the arms and hands, at the back of the hands; they also appeared to have been produced by a sharp, cutting instrument—they were such wounds as might have been produced in a struggle, if she had been defending herself against violence—there were two cuts on her arms, just as they would be if she had put up her arms in front to defend herself; those were clean cuts, they were quite superficial, not deep—there was one very slight bruise on the right thigh—I think those were all the injuries I observed—the bruise on the thigh was recent, I should say a few hours—she remained under my care at Guy's till she died, on the 30th, about 9 o'clock in the evening—she died from the direct effect of the wounds—such an instrument as this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would produce the wounds I saw—it must have been a sharp and heavy instrument, and this is so—I think it might produce the wounds I saw—I think if that instrument had been used with violence, the wounds I saw would be the natural and probable result—I examined her after death, she was pregnant—I think she had been so about two months—the embryo was dead, and decomposed—it would be impossible to say how long it had been dead, I should say a week or two—I could not tell whether she had ever had a child before—I was shown certain articles of clothing by Superintendent Mulvany—I did not</p>

               <p>examine them, I only saw them—that was on the morning of the first police examination, on the Tuesday following her death, the 2nd May—there were some spots upon them, I thought they were spots of blood, they looked like blood; of course I could not say, I merely saw them, that was all—on the day I examined the girl, after her death, I cut off a portion of her hair; the length of it was, I should think, 5 in. or 6 in.—I did not measure it—I was directed by the Coroner to cut it off—I wrapped it up in brown paper and gave it to Mulvany—(<hi rend="italic">Dr. Letheby here produced it, stating that he had received it from Mulvany</hi>)—It was a lock resembling this, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cut on the forehead was just above the eyebrow, on the right side—there is an artery there; that was divided—there must have been other arteries severed by other wounds—generally speaking, when an artery is severed, blood spurts forth; sometimes when it is completely divided, it will not bleed at all, but at other times it would spurt forth—ordinarily speaking, where there are such serious wounds as these, I should expect blood to spurt forth—when I was examined before, I expressed an opinion that it was quite consistent that the wounds I saw might have been inflicted as late as within a couple of hours—I gave that as a minimum, and I give as a maximum, ten or twelve.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you speak of the clean cuts on the arms and other places, was there any appearance of bruising about those cuts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, none at all; they were quite clean cuts—there was no appearance of bruising about the sides of the cuts—I think an instrument like this might, if it was sharp, produce a clean cut, without any bruising, supposing a person to be lifting up her arm; I have not felt the edge*; may I do so?—some parts of it are very rough—I say ifr might, if it caught this part of the edge, which is sharp, but other parts of the edge are turned aside, and could not cut at all—I think the sharpest part of this instrument might do it; I think it would—I think it would produce a clean cut, without any bruise; if it came in contact with the roughened edge, I think it would bruise, but the sharpest part would produce a clean cut, such as I saw on the arm, without any bruising—the character of the cut must depend upon the force of the blow—there were two cuts on the sleeve of the dress that she had on—I don't know whether the material was cut through—I don't know what the material was; I suppose some kind of stuff; I did not notice it very much—(<hi rend="italic">The dress was here produced</hi>)—I believe this to be the dress she had on—I don't see the cuts here; I certainly saw them at the time she was brought in—I don't see any cuts on either arm here—it may have been on the mantle (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the mantle</hi>)—I was confusing the mantle with the dress; there are two cuts here—I believe this to be the mantle she had on—there is one cut on each arm—there is a jagged cut—the larger cut is about an inch long, the other about a quarter—the larger one is on the left sleeve, about 3 inches from the wrist or end of the cuff; the other is a three cornered hole; it is almost a cut—that is on the right arm, about the same distance from the cuff—it is a cloth mantle, worn over the dress—there is no doubt about the cuts on the arms being clean cuts—I am quite sure of that—each wound was about half an inch in length, just about the middle of the arm, in both having a direction downwards and inwards, about the middle of the arm, between the wrist and the elbow—she was plump altogether—I don't remember the arms especially—the sleeve seems to be confined at the wrist—it is a small wrist—the right wrist is torn—I did not notice whether it</p>

Have you the letter? If it is in my handwriting that will prove it"—he also said "I know nothing about her; she was a dirty young woman, and left here in consequence; I can account for all my nights," or "time, last week"—I said "Very well, do so"—he said "I did not leave work till 7 o'clock on Monday evening, I was about the town all the evening; on the Tuesday I went to Lewisham, came back, and was indoors by 9.15"—I asked him whom he went to see at Lewisham—he said "A lady," and was it necessary to mention her name—I said "Oh no"—he said he did not see her—I asked him if he went into any house—he said "No," and nobody saw him that he knew, and he came back by way of Royal Hill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. I have been nine years a detective, before that I was a police officer—Griffin was with me when I went to Mr. Pook's, we were there twenty minutes or half an hour before the prisoner was called in, or it might be more—I examined the whole of his clothes—everything I asked for was shown to me, nothing I asked for was kept back, that lam aware of—I told the father, people said that his son was on terms of intimacy with the girl, and had corresponded with her, and that there was a letter to her in his writing—I did not say "There is a letter to her in his handwriting"—he said "It is absurd, I am positive it is not the case, Edmund is a different sort of boy altogether, it is almost impossible anything of that sort could have been going on without some of us dis<lb/>overing it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say that Jane was very slovenly in her work, that she had warning to leave on two or three occasions, and that on the last occasion she had not asked to stay, but had left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said she was very slovenly, but I do not remember his saying the rest—he said "As to Edmund, I am quite certain of his innocence, because being subject to fits we were con<lb/>tantly watching him about the house"—I do not remember his saying that for the last three weeks, on account of his daughter-in-law being in the country on a visit, his eldest son-in-law had been living in the house and sleeping with Edmund every night; but I will not say he did not—we asked to see his bedroom, Mr. Pook took us up stairs, and we inspected the things that were there—I lifted the lid of a portmanteau and looked into it; it contained some window curtains, I believe, and articles of clothing—I asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100101"/>
               <p>the father if that was his son's portmanteau, he said he really did not know—I asked if it was open, and he said "Look and see"—I examined two coats hanging behind the door, an overcoat and a frock coat, two pain of trowsers, and one or two waistcoats—we then went down into the drawing-room—it was the prisoner's father who suggested that he should be called up, and I began to ask him questions—I asked him where he had seen her last, and he said "On the Thursday that she left," and he had not seen her since—some time afterwards he recalled those words and said "Yes I did though, I saw her in the town, talking to a young gentleman, and I came home and mentioned it"—he did not directly recall his words and say "Yes, I did though, I saw her in the town, talking to a young <hi rend="italic">gent,</hi> and I came home and mentioned it"—I know that Griffin has said so, and it is the truth, but it was in a later period of the conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Listen to this, "He directly recalled his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he did say so, it is a mistake—when the prisoner said he could account for his time, I don't remember his saying that he was about the town, on Monday night, with his brother—he said he could account for his time of an evening; I said "Well, do so," and he said "Where shall I begin f—I don't remember his saying anything about his brother; but I won't say he did not—it was a long conversation, and I repeated it, to the best of my belief, from memory—I don't remember whether he said "Principally with my brother"—he may have—I won't say he did not—if he did, I have forgotten it—I don't re<lb/>member it, or else I would have repeated it—he said that on the Tuesday he went to Lewisham to see a young lady—I asked him whether he saw her, and he said "No"—he did not say he waited near the railway bridge nearly forty minutes, but did not see her—I don't remember his using those words—if I remembered it, I would say so, and if I don't remember it I won't—I will not undertake to say he did not—I said "No," because I did not remem<lb/>ber it—I believe he said he went to Lewisham, his usual way, up the side of the Park, out by Mrs. Sainsbury's gate, and across the heath by the guns—I did not tell you that, because I did not know the place, and I had forgotten it—I remember his saying "Across the heath by the guns," but the other part I do not remember—I have not been there—you might go through Mrs. Sainsbury's gate, and across the heath by the guns—there are two guns on the heath—Pook's house is No. 2, London Street—the Stock-well Street end, near the Church, which is marked red on the plan—his house is very near Stockwell Street—it is close to Skelton Street, but it is the second or third house from Stockwell Street, on the heath side, on the opposite side to the Thames—if a person went by Groom's Hill, leaving Sainsbury's gate 'on the left, and leaving the guns on the left, they would get that way under Lewisham Bridge and the railway bridge—I think it was the father who called the prisoner's brother up and asked him questions, and he said to the prisoner, "On the Monday night you were about the town with me"—I don't remember the prisoner saying "Where was I on Tuesday night?" and the brother saying "On Tuesday night you went to Lewisham"—I will not say it was not said by the father or the brother—they were all joining in conversation, and the prisoner repeated it several times—the prisoner was asked where he was on Tuesday night, and either the father or the brother said that he went to Lewisham—when he was asked whether he had seen anybody, and if he went into any house, he said he had seen their boy delivering a parcel, but the boy had not seen him—that was either going to Lewisham or coming back—he said that he came back by</p>

               <p>Royal Hill—if I was returning from Lewisham Bridge, and instead of going by the guns, were to go straight along by Dartmouth Road, that would take me into Royal Hill, past Mrs. Playne's shop—Royal Hill must pass Mrs. Playne's shop—I don't know that they close the Park gates at dusk—the most direct road on the map is Dartmouth Hill, Royal Hill, and so to London Street—the direct road is the steepest—about 100 yards on the Greenwich side of the hill it is very steep—the round about road is less steep than the direct road—another way would be up the Lewisham Road, round by Blissett Street, and then into Royal Hill—that would not be so steep, that is what I meant when I said he could go another way—a person going from London Street to Lewisham, if he went round the Park by the guns would have a less steep walk than if he went by the direct road—Lewisham Road is not so steep as the way round by Blackheath—a person going to London or to Royal Hill, might take the Lewisham Road still more to the left, and turn into Blisset Street—that brings them on to the Royal Hill, and that would avoid the steepness of the road—you could come round then at the back of Blackheath Hill, instead of mounting the higher ground—I did not hear him say that his shirt had gone to the wash, I was sitting at the opposite side of the room—I did not say that he said the stains on the shirt were caused by a small scratch, but it was small—there was a scratch on his arm—I was not at the Police Court when an observation was made about his standing with one hand over the other—the dabbling of the wristbands was in reference to their being crumpled—I handed the shirt to Griffin—I think he made a remark about expecting to find more blood on it—when I said I should have to take the prisoner in custody, be asked if he might take a book with him, and he took up a copy of "Pickwick"—I don't know whether he had been reading it—he took it with him to read—when he said he had seen the girl, he said "I remember I did see her in the street, on Saturday, with a man"—I said "Do you know him?'—he said "No, but I came home, and told my brother"—the brother was then called up, and I think his father asked him "Did your brother tell you he had seen Jane with anybody?—the brother said "Yes, I remember his coming home, and saying he had seen her with a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi>"—I did not take the prisoner's boots off when I took him—I believe they were taken off afterwards, by Griffin, I believe—I did not take them to Kidbrook Lane—I got this brush from Superintendent Griffin, with which the prisoner is supposed to have brushed his clothes, at Mr. Plane's—it is a dark brush, the centre is lighter than the outside—it was taken to Dr. Letheby, and submitted to him—the prisoner's trowsers were not taken off till half or three quarters of an hour after I took him—he did not sleep in them that night—they were not taken off the next day, because I brought them to London—he was put into a small room first, which is used by the Inspector as a reserve room; not into a cell—it was there his trowsers were taken off—the Inspector's private room would be the proper term for it—that was Monday, May 1st—I have been principally engaged in looking after this case—I issued two hand-bills—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On the evening of Saturday, the 22nd of April, a man purchased a lathing hammer at the shop of Mr. Thomas, tool dealer, 186, High Street, Deptford.

               <p>had them—there only appears to have been one piece out from this leg—they have been in Mulvany's possession—these four spaces are cut from the left leg, and one from the bottom of the right—they were cut by Dr. Letheby—I believe no mark was found on the coat—Mulvany then asked for the shirt which he wore that night—he left the room, and said he could not find it, he thought it had been sent to the wash—Mulvany then asked him to go again and endeavour to find it—he left the room, and on the stairs, just outside the door, he called a female, and after the lapse of a minute and a half or two minutes, he returned and produced a shirt, which was handed to Mulvany, who examined it—I believe this to be it—a portion was cut out of it, and there is no mark remaining, except dirt on the left wristband—the mark was on the right wristband—it was a stain apparently of blood, rather more than an inch long, and I think, perhaps, extending three-quarters of an inch in breadth; at one portion it has gone through both folds, in fact there appeared to be three folds, it was through the thickness of the wristband—Mulvany said "There is some blood here, can you account for that?"—I rose up to look at it—Mulvany passed the shirt to me, and I said "Yes, there is blood"—the prisoner said "I can only account for it by this scratch on my wrist,'* showing me a scratch about an inch in length, on the inside of his left wrist—I had the shirt in my hand at the time, and said "But the scratch is on the left wrist, and the blood is on the right wristband"—he made no reply to that—Mulvany looked at me and said he thought there was sufficient to take him in custody—I said "Yes, there is blood on his things"—Mulvany said "I must take you in custody on the suspicion of causing the death, or being the murderer of, this young woman"—he said "Very well, I shall go anywhere you like with you"—Mulvany took possession of the coat and shirt—the father kept asserting his son's innocence, and the son asserted his innocence, and said he knew nothing of the girl, that she was nothing to him, and it was ridiculous to assert such a thing; be never thought a bit of her, and never sweet hearted with her or anyone like her—the articles were packed up in a parcel—Mulvany took him to the station, and I followed a short distance behind—I booked the charge at the station, and after it was entered, he was placed in a room till trowsers were brought from his house—these were taken off about an hour or more afterwards—the father's house is a quarter of an hour's walk, and a messenger had to be sent there and return with them, it would be about an hour before he reached the station—the prisoner asked me, that afternoon, if he might write a letter—I said that he might, but it would be read before it was sent away—he made no objection to that—he was furnished with pen and paper, and he wrote this letter—I read it—I after<lb/>wards saw him searched, and this other letter was found in his purse—he asked that the letter he wrote might be posted, so as to go out by the last post at night, about 9 or a little before—I handed it to the inspector, and asked him to comply with his request, which was done—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "Sunny bridge, March 20, 1871. My dear Edmund. I scarcely know what to say to you, it is such a difficult matter to get at the interior of a lady's heart; and, in Louisa's case, still more so. She is not, as you know, ex<lb/>tremely demonstrative upon any subject, and when you question her, she seems inclined, to use very refined language, "to shut up." The only advice I can give you now is to wait until you see her, and ask for yourself. If she should say no, I daresay you would survive the shook; because you must feel as I do, that she is uncertain. If she were left to herself, perhaps</p>

               <p>she would say yes; but while Alithea is single, they seem to cling together. I don't think she would like Louisa to be married before her. You are young, and can afford to wait until another opportunity offers. I told her if she was not inclined, there were others who would be if asked; so she was prepared, and will have time to think it over; she can please herself. As to your having a rival, no such thing at present at Lyonshall. Make your mind easy, therefore; it is no great matter which way it turns. Gentlemen can always get a wife, it is a very difficult thing with a woman. Mr. Norris, for instance. Alithea refused him; he is now married to a pretty, lady-like wife, and very happy. So, as I before said, wait your opportunity and take courage. Believe me, as ever, dear Edmund, your affectionate aunt. How is poor mother's health. Uncle's love. No more time.") This is the letter he wrote: (" Dear Alice. I am sorry I could not meet you last night as I wished; but I have been arrested on the charge of the murder of that girl at Eltham. Now it is almost too ridiculous, but still they have some circumstantial evidence, I presume, or they would not have taken so serious a step; but, of course, I shall come out all right, at least I believe so. I am writing from the police-station in Blackheath Road, and, between you and I, the idea is not pleasant, as I am not used to have the key turned on me. I shall be able to prove a complete <hi rend="italic">alibi,</hi> so that I have no fear for the future. You will see the report of the case in the papers on Wednesday morning; and if I am discharged, as I expect I shall be, I will keep the appointment I have made for Wednesday night; but if remanded, of course I must grin and bear it. Believe me, yours as ever, E. W. Pook. P.S.—Do not talk to many persons about this affair, as there is no honor attached to it. You must excuse the writing, as I am rather flurried.")—On the day after he was taken to the station his boots were taken off—they had been polished and cleaned—he said he had worn them all the week—on 16th May, after leaving the inquest room, I purchased two hammers at Mrs. Thomas's—the last two they had in stock, as they said at the Inquest—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one is a No. 2 and the other a No. 3—they have no strings—I particularly asked for the strings, and Mrs. Thomas reached a string out of the window and gave it to me, which she said had fallen off one of the hammers—I marked them in pencil at the time, and put a paper on afterwards.</p>

I was not in Court when Mulvany was Cross-examined—it is true that the prisoner repeatedly denied, in Mulvany's presence, that Jane Clousen was anything to him, or that there was any intimacy whatever between them; but the father denied it more—the prisoner repeatedly denied that she was anything to him, or that there was any intimacy between them—when I put that expression upon him, that he was to meet her at Groom's Hill, I do not remember his saying "It is not true"—I will not swear he did not, because his father, and he, and me, and Mulvany, five or six of us, were all talking—he may have done so—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at his deposition</hi>) it is evident that I said, before the Magistrate, that he said "It is not true," but I have forgotten it now—I have no doubt he did say it, now that I see it on my deposition.</p>

               <p>to it, but he stood with his right wrist crossed over his left, and not his left over the right, and it could not in that case—the wound was on his left wrist, and the blood was on the right wristband; but if it had been reversed, it would have been correct; that is all the difference—I made the remark that he would have bad to put the wound on the right wrist, but he happened accidentally in the Court to do the reverse, and I answered too quickly, without noticing how he stood; but it comes to the same thing, if the wrist which was scratched had been put over the other wrist, it might have produced the blood on the sleeve—the question was put to me very impulsively, and I answered as impulsively—there is a locket in the posses<lb/>sion of the police—I did not get it myself—I did not go to Randall's; Sergeant Haynes went there—I did not go to Humphreys'—Humphreys told me he had bought the locket at Randall's, and given it to the deceased—I sent Sergeant Haynes with him to Randall's.</p>

Price &amp; Dunn's traveller, Mr. Warr, called on the next day, which was Tuesday—he calls every alternate Tuesday, and he came the next day—my wife is here—my son was in the shop at the time the prisoner was there, and my errand boy, Renneson, was at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Thomas, who keeps a shop of tools and cutlery, at 168, High Street, Deptford—it is on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Sparshott's shop-shortly before the end of April we had kept a shop on the other side of the railway bridge, and had removed to this one—amongst other tools and cutlery, we kept in stock plasterer's lath hammers—I have seen the article produced, in this case—I sold several dozens of them—we had such hammers as this in stock on 24th April—this would be a number 2 hammer—I have got my books here—up to the 15th April, I find we had three number 2, and three number 3 in stock—I had not sold any from November till April—one of the number 3 was sold on 15th April—there is an entry of it in my own handwriting—I have since found out that that was sold to a person of the name of Whitter—at the time of the Inquest I had two remaining of the No. 3—I have sold one since, and have given one up to the police—as to the No. 2 hammers, I find that one was sold on Saturday, 22nd April; that entry is also in my handwriting—I have since found that it was sold to a young boy of the name of Elliot—one of the remaining "No. 2 has been given up to the police since these proceedings, and the other was sold on the 24th, according to my books—I don't recollect anything particular about the 24th—I am more often in the shop than my husband—Miss Cavell was in the shop that night, and I sold her a pair of scissors—that is entered in the book in my writing; this is the entry: "One pair of scissors, Miss Cavell, unpaid, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the "un" was scratched out after the account was settled—you will find other entries the same—the last entries are "Lath hammer, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; turning for table leg, 2; one pair of scissors, Miss Cavell; nails, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and so on—I have no doubt, looking at that entry, that I sold a lath hammer to some<lb/>one, or that day, but I can't tell who to—I am certain I sold it to some<lb/>one, or else it would not be in ray book—I have not the slightest recollection to whom I sold it; we have sold eleven hammers since that date, and only two we can account for, and those are two that Superintendent Griffin had—we have had a fresh stock since then—the hammers were kept in the left-hand side window going in; the right-hand side window is kept for cutlery—sometimes the hammers have a string, and sometimes not—if they are hung up in the window they have a string—the string is used for hang<lb/>ing them up.</p>

I think I gave the hammers up to the police the day we came from the Inquest—it was on a Monday—that was before we got the eleven hammers in stock—we were out of hammers, and had been asked for them, and we got a fresh supply in—I could not tell when I sold this spokeshave iron, how long before the hammer—it was sold some time during that day, when I could not tell—I could not tell when I sold the nails—I could not say that they are put down in order as they</p>

               <p>are sold, because my attention is called various ways very often—I put them down at a convenient time, after I sell them—the nails is the fourth entry on that day, and then there is a lot—that is the handle of a jack plane—Griffin showed me some nails—I told him they were not nails that we had ever kept in stock, and that was true—he laid four on the counter, and I told him they were not nails we had in stock—it was a flat pointed nail, not a nail that we sold—I was taken to see if I could identify young Pook—I went carefully through several persons that were shown me, and I could not identify anyone—that was on Monday, 1st May, the day he was taken into custody—I did not identify anyone as the person who had bought the hammer—I should not have known the hammer had been sold if I had not booked it—I did not recognize anyone of the persons who were shown to me as the person who had bought the hammer, or who had been in my shop, or as anybody I had seen before—we gave every information we could give on 28th, 29th, and 30th, and the 1st May—we went to the Police Court to try and identify him, and we could not do so—there are hundreds of people come into the shop that I can't account for at the time—I make the entries as near the time that the things are sold as I can.</p>

I had been down to my father's, at 2, Straightsmouth, Greenwich, at the back of the church, which is at the back of London Street—I was not near Royal Hill, or anywhere in that direction, nor at Lewisham—I said before the Coroner, that the woman was calling out "Let me go," or "Let us go," and I did not catch the other word, but thought it was <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—I thought she addressed the man by the Christain name of <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> and I think so now—I picked the man out by his back—I did not see his face—I did not speak to Norton or Putnam—I passed close to them—I did not know them—they were not in the footpath, but in the lane; that I am sure of—I swear it—I saw them between the brook and Walker's cottage—I walked on; nobody overtook me—I was walking at about three miles and a half an hour—I heard no screams—I was alone—I had come from Pope Street, Eltham—I went up Millhall Lane, and across the fields into Kidbrook—I saw the back of the young man some 200 yards or 300 yards from the brook, towards Eltham—as you go from Millhall Lane, you come into Eltham Lane, either across the fields or through the lanes—I went through the lanes; I did not go by the footpath—I went up Kidbrook Lane a little way, and then came out and walked on the footpath, not right across the fields—when I saw them first, as far as I can say, the young woman had got her back towards the hedge, and he was in front of her—they were on the side of the lane nearest to me—his back was towards me—I did not see his hands, because the hedge would prevent that—when I got to the gap, I could see his hands—he had nothing in them—this was about 8.45; I feel certain—I have the means of fixing it—I picked out the prisoner—I never saw his features.</p>

I was stationed at Eltham at this time—on 26th April, about 9 a.m., I went to Kidbrook Lane with a stretcher, with others, having heard of the murder at the station—I returned again at 9 o'clock, and found a whistle about 15 yards from where I had seen the woman lying when I was there before—it was nearer to Morden College than where the woman was—it was not exactly in the lane—it was lying by the mud, or rather in the mud—the point of it was sticking down<lb/>wards and the mouth upwards—I kept it till 11.30, and then gave it to Sergeant Wells.</p>

On Wednesday, 26th April, I was in charge of the Eltham police-station part of the day—Sergeant Wills belongs to that district, but not to that station—he gave over a whistle to me on the morning after the murder was committed, and in the course of that day I gave it to Sergeant Haynes—there is no entry of the whistle in the book at Eltham—I was in charge of the station, but I made no entry, as I considered it of no importance at the time—I handed it to Haynes, who is my superior—I was in charge—he was on night duty—I generally enter anything found, if it is of value—it is printed at Scotland Yard, and circulated amongst the whole of the Metropolitan Police, and if anything is lost, it is generally reported at the station, and we refer to the informations at each station—as far as I know, that is the object of the entries—it is to show that we have reported it—there is a regular system, orders from Scotland Yard.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 25th April, I was walking with Mr. Barnes—we went through Burney Street, about 8.50, and as we walked up Royal Hill we met the prisoner coming down—I knew him by sight, but not to speak to—he passed us, running in the road—he looked rather red in the face—soon after that I heard 9 o'clock strike—I did not see him again that night.</p>

I am the wife of George Playne, and keep a confectioner's shop, at 11, Royal Hill, opposite the Institution—I have known the prisoner, it may be a year and a half—he came to our shop about the middle of April, I think—I don't recollect the dates—Miss Billington, and Mr. Ben. Dixon, were in the shop—that is another Miss Billington—I don't know the day of the week, but I know it was not Monday or Wednesday—it was about 8.30 or 8.45, or it might have been later—I saw him come in—he was rather hot and excited—asked him what was the matter—he told me he had run from Lewisham Road, and asked me for the loan of a brush—I lent him one, and he brushed his trowsers—I was behind the counter, and he was in front—he then returned the brush with thanks, and then I think he wished me good-night, and left the shop—he might have been ten minutes, or a minute or two longer, in the shop—I was aware that he had had fits, and when he told me he had run all the way from Lewisham Road, I thought he had either had a fit, or was just about having one—he did not say why he had run from there, but simply what I have stated—my shop is about five minutes' walk from his father's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sussex Place, Regent's Park—I am a bachelor of medicine and professor of chemistry—I have made the subject of blood and blood stains a matter of special inquiry—on Wednesday, 3rd May, I received from Inspector Mulvany a paper parcel, containing a pair of dark-coloured trowsers, nearly or quite black, a shirt, and a wide-awake hat—on the following evening Mr. Mulvany came again to me, and on that occasion I received from him a lock of hair in brown paper, a pair of men's boots, and a plasterer's hammer wrapped in brown paper, the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> of a woman, and a clothes-brush—I kept the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> and the lock of hair, and the other matters I returned to Mulvany the following evening, after I had made an investigation—I found on the trowsers, a little above the left knee, on the inner side, a human hair 71/2 inches long, and there it is (<hi rend="italic">produc<lb/>ing it</hi>)—I have put it between glass—it was on the outside of the trowsers, on the cloth—I compared that hair with the lock of hair that I received from Mulvany—I am certain that it could not have got from the parcel to the trowsers after I had them, because the parcel was opened afterwards—I did certainly open it on the evening Mulvany brought it, but I don't think it likely that anything could have fallen out of it then, because it was on a different occasion; one evening the trowsers were brought, and next even<lb/>ing the lock of hair was brought: they were not together until I took the hair off, and then I examined it in comparison with the other—the hair was very closely attached to the trowsers, as it were felted into it—it was exactly the same colour as the lock of hair, and under the microscope exactly the same structure; there is a little difference in the structure of hair—I examined the trowsers carefully, and I found at the bottom, and on the front part of the left leg, several spots; I think I cut out seven, and here they are—there are some remains here of spots, even at the parts where I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100142"/>
               <p>cut them; there is enough remaining about the spots, if there is any necessity for further examination—I cannot express any opinion about them—anything I thought it worth while to experiment upon I cut out, but we make it a rule in all our investigations not to destroy the material in such a way that no one else could have a further investigation if necessary—here is nearly half-an-inch remaining of this spot—here are two large spots, pointed out by the Jury, I don't think I could speak to that till I examined it—that one on the right leg I did not find to be blood—the larger spots on the back of the left leg, pointed out by the Jury, are the remnants of another spot which I found not to be blood; I could not recognize that as blood; one can hardly discover a negative; I did not recognize it as blood—when I test things, I ascertain whether they are blood or not—from the test I applied I did not find them to be blood, then you conclude, I suppose, that they are not blood, but I don't go quite so for as that, for the stain was so slight that I don't speak positively about it; but I don't think it was blood—there are seven spots which I have pointed out; I think on careful scrutiny you will find more, quite enough to test my investigations, if anybody is so disposed—I submitted the seven spots that I cut out to microscopical examination, and chemical experi<lb/>ments, and in my judgment they were blood stains—it is not safe to swear to the distinction between human and animal blood; I should not like to do so; I do not know any distinction, when we have small quantities like that to experiment with—I can't say whether it is animal or human, all I can say is, that it is blood—old blood gradually gets less and less soluble in water, until after exposure for some week or fortnight or so, it becomes insoluble in water; this was soluble in water; from which I judge that it was not Tery old blood.</p>

I am the prisoner's father, and carry on the business of a stationer, in London Street, Greenwich—the prisoner is twenty years of age—before I took my business as a stationer, I was employed upon the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper for twenty-three years—I have been in business as a stationer in Greenwich ten years—my son lived at home as a member of the family—he was always a very quiet, well-conducted young man—there is no truth whatever that there was any intimacy between him and my late servant, the deceased girl—she had left my service on 11th April—we had given her notice on two or three occasions, and she had asked to stay—on the last occasion she seemed doubtful whether she should go or stay, but at last she left—she was very untidy—she left in consequence of the com<lb/>plaints—she was not fit to be seen, and I used to complain about her to my wife repeatedly—she would never clean herself, so much so that I would go to the door in order that she should not be seen, but we believed her to be strictly honest—I remember Mr. Mulvany and Superintendent Griffin calling on me on 1st May—the conversation with them lasted one hour and five minutes altogether, from first to last—they had full opportunity of examining all the clothes, and the prisoner's bedroom; every facility was given—my son was called up, and he came—I had been acquainted with Superintendent Griffin some time—when my son came into the room, he said "Good morning, Mr. Griffin, I know you," with a smile—it was said in a joking manner—he was laughing, in fact, he had just left the dinner table, where they were laughing and talking; I could hear them up stairs—he was not aware of why he was sent for, that I know of—I did not leave the room, I only called him—at that time no one knew what Mulvany and Griffin came for but me—I won't be certain whether he shook hands with Griffin, at all events he nodded to him—yes, I remember he did shake hands—my younger son, Thomas Pook, was sent for at the instance of the prisoner—Mulvany said "I am told that your son has been on terms of intimacy with this girl, he has corresponded with her and he said, tapping his hand, "There is a letter in her handwriting, and he has also given her a locket; and a servant of a near neighbour of yours was intimate with your servant, your son was intimate with both of them, and did as he liked with them;" all of which is totally false, and I told Mulvany so—I told him it was ridiculous and false, and that he was a different sort of boy altogether—I also said that, being subject to fits, we constantly watched him about the house, and in fact, if he was in his bedroom a minute longer than we thought he should be, we always went to see if anything was the matter or not, on every occasion—at that time my eldest son was staying with me, and had been two or three weeks—he is a married man, and his wife was absent in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Kensington, of the Royal Artillery—on Wednesday morning, 21st June, I put a cap and jacket in my master's cupboard—this is the cap, and the jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to the cap by the lining—it is rather a fancy lining—I don't know whether there is any other cap like it—I can swear to the coat by the tabs on the collar—they are official tabs—I don't know that every officer has them; no one but my master, that I know of—I brushed it on the Wed<lb/>nesday morning, and put it in the cupboard about 8 o'clock—the next morn<lb/>ing I went to fetch the coat and cap, at my master's request—that was about 7 o'clock—he was going on duty at 8 o'clock—they were both gone—I also missed a set of studs, which were in the cupboard—I missed a pocket-handkerchief; it was in the coat pocket—this is the one—it was in the coat pocket—I felt it when I folded the coat up—the handkerchief has my master's name upon it, "No. 12, E. Kensington, 69"—I have seen them by sending them to the wash—the prisoner was apprehended on Thursday, 22nd, and the things were shown to me on the following Wednesday, at the Police Court.</p>

I lived at 58, Newington Butts, at the time of this occurrence—I am a dealer in jewellery—on 4th of April, 1870, the prisoner came into my service as a general servant, to look after my children—I had three children, Arthur Samuel, aged six years; Alfred James, three years, and the deceased, fifteen months the day she was buried—the prisoner was in my service one week—on 7th April I and my wife went out at about 2.45 in the afternoon, leaving the prisoner in charge of my children—she was the only servant—they were in perfect good health, the deceased as well—she never had any illness in her life—we returned at 11.45 at night—we went together into the sitting-room, where the prisoner was apparently asleep—there was a very large fire—she sat close to the fire, in the arm chair—she woke up by our entering the room—none of the children were in the room with her—I believe my wife spoke to her about the children—she said they were quite well—after I had been in the room a few minutes I heard a screaming from one of my children up stairs—it was usual for the children's bedroom to be locked after they had gone to bed—I had several lodgers in the house—the key was kept in the sitting-room—the bedroom was over the sitting-room—we occupied the shop, sitting-room, and bedroom over it—the bed-room was five or six steps from the ground—the sitting-room and shop were on the ground-floor—my wife, I, and the children occupy the bedroom—the servant had another—I got the key; I don't know who handed it to me—I went up to the bedroom, and found the door locked—my lodgers have nothing to do with my apartments—when I got in I found my boy, Alfred James, lying on the floor; he had fallen out of bed—I picked him up, and placed him in bed with his brother, in the bed from which he had fallen—</p>

               <p>they had their bed together in my room—there was no light in the room, but a lamp outside gave a glimmering light, sufficient to see anyone in the room—I turned round to see the deceased, wondering she had not woke up by the noise—she was in the bed I and my wife occupy—I found her close to the wall, lying on her back, with her clothes thrown off her—the bed was close to the wall—her head was near the pillow—I reached over and caught hold of her legs—her head was about three inches from the wall—it did not touch it—the bed was on the mattress, it was narrower, and did not completely cover the mattress—her head was a little higher than the remainder of her body—the mattress was nearly touching the wall—there was not room for her head to get between—the bed sloped off—there was no crevice in which her head could get fixed—she had her night-gown on—the bed-clothes looked as if they had been kicked off—she was in the habit of kicking off the bed-clothes—she was very strong in her limbs and her bodily powers, and able to deal with any complication of the bed-clothes over her—I caught hold of her by the leg, and pulled her towards me, and said, "My poor child is dead;" she was perfectly cold—I could tell by the dead weight that she was dead—my wife came up, and took her down stairs, from my arm into the sitting-room—I followed her; the prisoner came down, and stood very unconcerned, as if nothing had occurred—I sent, and Dr. Williams came—he pronounced her dead—I asked the prisoner when she last saw it alive; she said "Half-past ten, in the middle of the bed;" I said "I don't believe it;" she made no reply—there was an Inquest on 13th April—the bed-clothes consisted of a sheet, a single blanket, and a Macella counterpane, very light—the child was never subject to fits—it had recovered about six weeks from a slight hooping cough—Mr. Cottrell, his wife, and one child, and Mrs. Brands were my lodgers—Mr. Cottrelf's child was six or seven years old—they occupied a first floor above my room—Mr. Broster, his wife, and three grown-up daughters occupied the second floor—the third floor was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Grains, and a grown-up daughter—their occupations were distinct from each other, and my part of the house—six steps led up to my bedroom, and were part of the general flight up stairs—everybody would have to pass my bedroom—there is only one key to my bedroom—I always desired to have the door looked, and the key brought down after the children went to bed.</p>

Before Good Friday, the day this happened, the prisoner had been with me three days—her wages were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and food, and lodging—when we left home the children were in her sole charge for nine hours—she is as much a woman as my wife—I can't say she was feigning sleep when we went in—she got up about 8.30 in the morning—I remember saying before the Coroner, in speaking of how I found the deceased: "I cannot say positively, not having a light, her actual position; as I raised her, she appeared to be on her back or body on the bed, with her head between that and the wall"—it was a full-sized iron bedstead—the mattress touched the wall, the bed did not—there was a space between the bed and the wall, of three or four inches, making a slight hollow space—her head was lying partly on the bed and partly on the mattress—the iron part of the bedstead would be uncovered near the wall—her head was lower than her legs—the verdict before the Coroner was "Accidental Death"—I said at the Inquest "I have not seen any want of feeling on Norman's part towards the deceased or any other of the children"—I never did see any, and should probably say so now—Dr. Williams said</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—the prisoner entered my service on 4th April—a person next door, Rosina Lloyd, recommended her to me—the prisoner said she had been in Mrs. Gardner's service, Stock-well Park Road, twelve months ago, and since then she had been working at Army work—she said Mrs. Gardner had gone to Scotland—I thought it no use applying for a character—I was rather prepossessed with the prisoner, she seemed so very clean and respectable—I had three children, all well—the deceased never had any illness; only slight hooping cough—I wanted no doctor for that—she at this time had been well six, seven, or eight weeks—she was a lively child—on Good Friday, at 2 o'clock, she was playing with the kitten—she did not eat her dinner—it was salt fish, and she gave it to the kitten, and fell over the plate, but did not hurt herself—we went out about 2.45—I said "Be sure and take charge of the children," and she asked if she might have needlework, and I said "Yes, I don't want you to do any work, but take care of the children"—we returned about 11.45 or 11.50—we went into the sitting-room—the prisoner was there, in front of the fire; she appeared to be dozing—my going into the room probably roused her—I said "How are the children, Agnes?"—she said "Oh, very well, ma'am, Jessy was rather cross in the park, and I could not keep her from going to sleep"—I had told her never to let them sleep out of doors, in case of accidents—I said "Perhaps she is not very well," but I knew nothing serious could be the matter with her—she said "The man has not brought the beer"—I said "You had better make me some tea, I am so thirsty"—while she was making tea, we heard the second little boy scream out—I said to ray husband, "Run up stairs, there's one of the children fallen out"—he got the key, and went up stairs—she was getting a light when he called out "My girl is dead"—I rushed up, and he had her quite dead in his arms—the child was brought down stairs, and I put her feet in hot water, and went for a doctor—the prisoner seemed reluctant to go up stairs with the light—she went up when she heard that the child was dead—she passed no remarks whatever—she was not agitated, she never offered to look at the child afterwards—she said she last saw it alive at 10.30, lying on its left side, the same as when she put it to bed—Dr. Williams showed me marks on the lower part of the child's lower lip, about the width of two or three teeth—the gums were perfectly white, as if blood<lb/>less—the child had all its front teeth—there were teeth top and bottom, opposite the mark on the lip—the castor would prevent the bedstead coming close to the wall—she was a big girl—there was not sufficient room for her head to have got between the bed and the wall—her feet were towards the middle of the bed—a quantity of wet had run down on to the palliasse and then on to the floor—it was not dry by the morning—it had come from the child's mouth—it made a pool about 6 in. on the surface of the floor—this was between 2 and 3 o'clock the same morning—the child was never subject to fits.</p>

               <p>it at times in all sorts of shapes and positions in the bed—I have known it fall off the bed—I have known it to get off the bed of itself—it could not get on to the bed again, not if it had tumbled off—the prisoner did every<lb/>thing I told her to do when we came home this night, and always did—she was quite indifferent, and did not express any sorrow, and looked on more as if it was in her usual work—all the children usually went to bed at 7 o'clock—the deceased was teething—I never gave her fish to eat before—she ate the egg-sauce, and had made a good dinner with that and bread—from pain, I daresay, she would kick about a good deal—the girl took the light up to my husband—there was no light up there, but it was light enough to see in the room—Parsonage Walk runs down by the side, and the lamp there enables us to see—I can't say I showed the wet to the doctor—he went up stairs next morning—I showed it to my husband—the wet was not on the wall—I never knew the child to dribble much—some of my children have done so—the deceased was on the left hand side to the wall, with her back to the wall—what I saw was too much wet to be accounted dribble.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a demonstrator of anatomy, at St. Thomas's Hospital—I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—I saw her a week after Good Friday—the cause of death was suffocation—it was a well formed child—there were morbid appearances indicative of suffocation—on the inner space of the lower lip were two white marks, corresponding in shape and size with the two upper front teeth—they might be caused by the child pressing against some hard substance—the mere pressure of the child's head on the bed-clothes would not account for those marks—the nose would protect the child's mouth, a little—I should think the pressure of the lips against the iron band of the—bedstead would cause those marks on the lip—I think they were made during life—I think the pressure against the teeth was continued until shortly before death—I could not say within a minute or two—if the child had got its head down upon the bed-clothes, so as to interfere with its breathing, and afterwards it had sufficient strength to raise itself by getting on its back, in my opinion it would revive if it had strength sufficient to draw its head out, and to turn on to its back—if it had died from suffocation by the head being down, caused by the pillow being found over it, it would have been found in that state—if it had got down between the bed and the wall, its head would have remained there, and it would have been found dead in that position—it is not unusual after death to throw up mucous, especially after the head is turned down—it is impossible to say the quantity—it would come from the air passages of the lungs and throat—a very small quantity would have made a stain enough to cover a shilling.</p>

I remember saying before the Coroner that if the child's head had been in such a hollow as has been described, the marks upon the lips might have been made by the force of the child resting upon the lip—the positions were described by the Coroner—the cause of suffocation must be continued a minute or more—I recognize Dr. Taylor as an authority on medical jurisprudence—I have known oases where portions of food remaining in the larynx produced suffocation; even by a pea remaining in the throat; even the close wrapping a child's head in a shawl may produce suffocation—I agree with Dr. Taylor that where a child is presumed to be suffocated, owing to the position where he has fallen, evidence of the position of the body, or the sight of the body, is necessary</p>

               <p>before forming any opinion—I recognize Dr. Christison as an authority of eminence on matters of medical jurisprudence—the marks on the deceased's lips must have been produced during life—I agree with him that the appearances of a body, the death of which has been caused by suffocation, are in many cases identical with appearances causing death in other cases.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the pea or food obstructed the passages, I should expect to find them in the throat—the throat and air passages were clear—the fact of the marks on the lips affords very strong presumption that suffocation was caused by pressure—a person may have gone across the child's face and so produced suffocation; that would be accident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard the description in which the child was found; from what you saw at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and the remarks related by the witnesses, do those circumstances exclude or not the notion of an accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a very grave question; I don't like to answer it—if it were shown that the child's head went down this hollow place, I could quite conceive its being suffocated there, and the marks on the lips would be caused by the pressure against the iron bedstead—you will not press me beyond my conscience—I can't say sufficiently that accidental suffocation is excluded—I don't believe the bruises on the lip were caused many hours before death—a piece of the lip was removed and examined microscopically, and the mark was found to be simply due to the blood being excluded, and I take it to be pretty nearly certain that if the pressure had been removed before death, the abnormal appearance of the parts would not have been caused—I examined the body eight days after death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 116, Walworth Road—I was sent for to Mr. Beer's house, on Good Friday evening, about 12 o'clock—I found the child on its mother's lap, dead—she was bathing its feet with hot water—it had probably been dead an hour, or an hour and a half; it would be difficult to be precise—I examined it carefully—I opened the lips, and observed the impression of the teeth—I asked her if she could account for it—she said she could not—it was somewhat strange to me—I have heard the evidence to-day—where the bed was, there was not room enough to enable a child's head to get between the bed and the wall—it might have been on the edge of the bed, and been suffocated in that way—the mark of the teeth was unusual, and could not be accounted for on the lips—the frame of the bedstead would be here—it was a flock bed, not very far above the mattress—the bed was not more than an inch, or an inch and a half, in thickness—I supposed the child died from suffocation—I assumed that it might be found dead in bed—I was not told that it was found lying with its head upwards, and no bed clothes on—I saw nothing at the time to indicate its being accidentally done, except the marks on the lips, that aroused my suspicion—those marks were, in my judgment, caused before death, and were the result of external pressure, unquestionably—I saw the</p>

I am a surgeon, of 285, Clapham Rise, and 61, Kennington Park—I was at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I am of opinion that the cause of death was suffocation—I agree with Dr. Lees that the child could have been suffocated from the head being downwards, and there being pressure on the back of the head so as to keep the lips and nostrils against the clothes, it would have died in that position—I am of opinion that if it had sufficient strength to rescue itself from the obstruction, it would revive—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Beer, and if he is right in the description he gives of finding the child on its back, I should say it would be impossible to be an accidental suffocation—I rely on its having nothing over its mouth—there was nothing in the throat or air vessels to cause an obstruction—the marks on the inside of the lower lips were caused by pressure against the upper teeth—it could hardly be understood that a healthy child, if lying on its face, with no pressure on the back of its head, would continue in that posture, and die like that, without nature making an effort to extricate itself from that posture—to cause these marks inside the lips, the pressure must have been continued up to, and probably beyond, the period of death.</p>

               <p>such slight causes, would produce suffocation, or wrapping in a shawl—I have known cases of people lying on their faces being suffocated, in one case, the child was weakly and delicate, through being wrapped in a shawl—I have known children to die without apparent external cause—a child might be perfectly healthy at the time of death, but be suffering from catarrh, or cold—a child suffering from catarrh, the throat being filled with mucous and having an overloaded stomach, the chances of suffocation would be increased—a child does not secrete mucous profusely after recovering from hooping cough—it is of the first importance to come to a correct judg<lb/>ment as to whether the suffocation was accidental or not, that the actual position of the child at the time of death should be considered—the appearances of a body, the death of which has been caused by suffocation, in many cases are not identical with death from other causes—I think the morbid appearances peculiar to death by suffocation are different to other <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> causes—I recognize Dr. Christison as an authority.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I lived in July and August last at 19, Temple Street, St. George's Road, Newington, with my neice, Mrs. Brown and her husband—the prisoner came into her service in July—Charles Parfitt was a member of the family—he was in very good health—about a fortnight after she came, she went out for a holiday—she came back on the following morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock—she had leave to stay out—the boy had slept with me that night—I got up about 7.30, leaving the boy in bed, in good health, asleep—I went down into the shop—about an hour after I heard a noise, a stifled cry—I went up stairs, I found the prisoner in the act of getting off my bed—the boy was in the bed, crying—I asked him what was the matter, the prisoner said that she thought he had been dreaming—he was in a great state of agitation—he heard me put a question to her—he said "No, I have not been dreaming, Ellen has been trying to strangle me"—I called her by that name—I asked her whether it was true, she said "It is not"—he showed me the way, and put his hands to his mouth and throat—he said "That is the way in which she tried to do it"—his uncle called him into his room, and asked him if it was true—that was not in her presence—she said she did not try to strangle him—the boy said "You did"—he had a sweet in his mouth; I did not see that—his aunt saw that, and asked him what he had in his mouth—I was present—he said he had a sweet in his mouth; Ellen had given it him not to cry—his aunt made him take it out of his mouth directly—Mr. and Mrs. Brown then came up stairs—they called him away into the other room—his mouth was very sore inside the lips—I could not say what kind of sore it was—for two or three days after, the glands of his throat were swollen and tender—I heard her say once she was not fond of children, shortly after this event—she remained a few days after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was living with my niece, as a relation—she was very delicate, and I assisted her—she engaged the prisoner—I never told her father or mother what I have here to-day—I never communicated with the police; I told several people about it—I was examined before the Magistrate;</p>

               <p>I said, "I have told somebody of it, Mr. Freeman;" I told Mr. Sauders the Same day, I believe—they are not here—as near as I can recollect, I told Mr. Saunders that the prisoner tried to strangle Charles Parfitt—I can't say I used the word "strangle" before to-day—I can't swear the boy said "Ellen has been trying to strangle me"—I believe I told the Magistrate the boy said Ellen had given him a sweet not to cry—this is twelve months ago—I believe I gave the Magistrate the same account as I have given to-day—I said before him, "The boy put his hands to his mouth and throat, and said, 'Ellen's been doing so, and knelt upon my stomach"—I thought I had told all to-day—I took the boy to Mr. and Mrs. Brown—they called me—Mr. Brown came out on the landing, and took the boy in to them—I did not say before the Magistrate, "Mr. and Mrs. Brown came and took the boy away"—I said "Mr. Brown came on to the landing"—I did not discover that the boy's neck was swollen till some days after—I said before the Magistrate, "I looked at his mouth, and found the inside of his lips very sore; his throat was very much swollen"—I did not send for a doctor, and none came—I did something for his sore throat—I rubbed it with hartshorn and oil—I and Charles Parfitt slept in the prisoner's room this night only—the shop is on the ground floor—the kitchen is on the same floor as the shop—at the top of the stairs is the bedroom, on the first story—I was in the shop—when she first came in that morning, she went into the kitchen first, then to her bedroom, where the boy was sleeping—there is no doubt I heard this cry.</p>

I am the wife of George Brown, of 19, Temple Street, the prisoner was in my service—she came in July last—I recollect after her holiday her coming back—that morning my husband and I were in bed asleep; I was awoke by hearing the boy before 8 o'clock, or past—he woke me by coming into my room—his Aunt Betsy was with him—he was agitated, pale, and trembling—he had a sweet in his mouth—my husband was in the room—he had been out of the room on to the landing, and came with the boy and Aunt Betsy—my husband called the prisoner upstairs; she came—I do not know that he said anything to her—I did not hear her say anything to him—I was not out of the room—I looked at the boy's lips almost directly—his aunt said he complained of his lips being very much inflamed inside—I told him to take the sweet out of his mouth, which he said the prisoner had given him not to tell—I did not notice any<lb/>thing wrong about his mouth when he went to bed the night before this—nor his throat—I noticed his throat afterwards, about the next day; it was very much swollen—the prisoner said she was at the toilet at the time, she said "How can you say that, Charley?"—he said she was trying to choke him—my husband said nothing to her in my presence—after some time I asked her what she meant by going into Charley's room, she said "Nothing"—she said when he spoke of it "I was at the toilet putting on my cap when he spoke about it"—I had told her what complaint he had made—she said "Oh, Charley, how could you say so?"—I don't think Charley was present then—she ran away on the Thursday following—I gave her notice in the morning, for her insolence—a week's notice—I went over to Mrs. Gardner's, where I saw her the same day—she did not expect to see me there—she said she didn't intend going back to me—I didn't know she had run away till then.</p>
