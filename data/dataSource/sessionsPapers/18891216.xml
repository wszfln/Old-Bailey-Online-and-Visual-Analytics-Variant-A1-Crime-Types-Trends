                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on 27th September I was working for the prisoner Smith—on that day I went away to my dinner, about one o'clock—on my return I saw that a horse and van or cart had been backed in there, and some coals shot in the yard—next evening, the 28th, I got a message from Smith—I went there, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Smith <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> coals up in the van—after they had done it Smith asked me to take the coals down to a meadow that he rents at Bedfont, about two and a half miles from Hounslow—I took them there with a van and cart—I left them in the field, and brought back the horses—I got back between twelve and one—next morning, the 29th, I was in Smith's stable:, from what Mrs. Smith said to me I went into the sitting-room, and there saw Smith and Johnson—they asked me if 1 would go and find, my brother Harry—I went and found him—before that they said if he would say they had shot the coals in the barracks they would give him £25—I then went and spoke to my brother, and he came up—I have been convicted, and it has given me a lesson.</p>

I am caretaker of the house 35, Carlisle Square, belonging to Mr. Edward James Taylor—on 14th November I closed the house, and saw everything safe at eleven o'clock—about three in the morning I was aroused by hearing a noise; I listened, and heard it again—I spoke to my wife, and she got up and went for a constable while I dressed myself—I then distinctly heard footsteps in the drawing-room, and then in the dining-room, over my head—I kept quiet in the dark till the constable came, and then we went into the back drawing-room, and the constable dragged the prisoner out—at the Police-court I heard the prisoner say, "The place was not locked up; I raised the window without any difficulty.

On the morning of 15th November, at 3. 15, I was called by Mrs. Miller to 35, Carlisle Square, and in company with Mr. and Mrs. Miller I searched the premises—in the back drawing-room there was some furniture standing up in the centre of the room covered with a cloth, and on raising the cloth I found the prisoner concealed under it—I drew him out; his boots were off; he was sober—I asked what he was doing there—he said, "I only came in for a <hi rend="italic">doss</hi>," meaning for a sleep—I asked how he got in—he said, "I don't know"—I said I should take him into custody, being found there for an unlawful purpose—he said, "All right, I will go quietly"—on the way to the station he said, "I suppose I shall get into it for this; but I only went in there for a <hi rend="italic">doss</hi>"—he was searched, but no housebreaking instruments were found on him—he gave his correct name and address—his hat and boots were lying by the side of the furniture that was piled up in the room—he was not asleep; he was lying flat on his face.</p>

I am a clock manufacturer, at 38 and 39, Clerkenwell Close—on the morning of 18th November, in consequence of something I heard, I proceeded to examine my warehouse—I found the iron bar to the back warehouse ground floor had been strained and the shutters behind it opened, and entrance effected through the window into the back room—the door of that room into the passage had been opened—in my front office my desk had been forced and the keys of my safe removed—the larger door of the safe had been opened with keys, and the smaller drawers had been forced open—the safe contained no valuable property—some money, under £3 was taken from under a clock on the mantelpiece—I missed three clocks—one was a large gilt clock with an eagle on the top and four lions at the base, it cost £200—the second one was a buhl clock of about the value of £50, and the third was a French carriage clock, of about the value of £4—I have seen none of them since—I also missed a brown blanket cloth which had been covering a clock; it was really an army blanket.</p>

"Come and look for a place to break into"—I and Dutton said, "Yes"—we went down Corporation Road and Rosamond Street till we got to Mr. Moore's clock factory—Williams said, "Here is a place to break into; I have never seen any<lb/>body there"—next to the factory were two houses being pulled down—a hoarding was up in front of them—I lifted Williams and Dutton over the hoarding, and then went to the rear of the clock factory by myself—there was a urinal there—I waited there till about quarter to eleven, and then I saw Williams come round from the front entrance, carrying something on his shoulder, and Dutton followed, with something in his arms—as Williams got towards me he threw something over the gate at the back of the premises into a stone-yard, where stones are kept—I asked him what it was—he said, "A lantern"—we then went up Rosamond Street, and into Corporation Row—they said they had clocks—Williams and Dutton went away for about five minutes—when they came back Williams said, "We have put them away"—we went to look for William Prior; I suggested going to look for him—we went the same</p>

I live at 54, St. Jude's Street, Mildmay Park—on 7th November I had three parcels to deliver for my employers, Arthur Garsten and Co., one in Fetter Lane, one at the Junior Army and Navy Stores, York House, and one in Baker Street—I was taking them by hand—I had delivered the parcel in Fetter Lane, and was waiting at the end of Chancery Lane for an omnibus to take me to York House—it was a little after 5 p. m.—the prisoner came up and said, "Are you Garsten's boy?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Have you got a parcel for Pix and Cox, of York House?"—I said, "No—he said, "Oh, the Junior Army and Navy, York House"—I said, "Yes"—the parcels were hanging on my back and front by a strap—he said, "I have just been down to your place, and they told me I should see you at Chancery Lane waiting for a bus, and I was to take the parcel of you"—on that I gave him the parcel and this receipt, which he signed in pencil, "A. Jones, for Pix and Co., "and gave back to me—he then went off with the parcel down Chancery Lane—the parcel was ladies' belts, worth £2 15s. 1d., and was my masters' property—in consequence of what I heard when I got back I made a statement—I next saw the prisoner on 19th November at Clerkenwell Police-court, where I picked him out from about twenty others as the man who had taken the parcel from me—I am sure he is the same man.</p>

I am a letter sorter at the General Post Office, and live at 137, Praed Street—in the early morning of Sunday, 1st December, I was in the Strand; I saw two cabs turning down Adam Street, Adelphi, going at an ordinary pace—I walked along to the end of Adam Street when I was attracted by the noise of their galloping—they were then about twenty yards down Adam Street—the deceased's cab was in front on the near-side; the off-side cab was evidently trying to pass the other at the junction of John Street, and they came into collision just at the corner, by the Adelphi Hotel, which is the narrow part—I did not see the result of the collision; I went down and found that the driver of the near-side cab had been thrown over his cab, and was lying between the horse's legs, quite unconscious; I called a cab and took him to Charing Cross Hospital; he was then dead—the other cab had gone on; I saw no more of it.</p>

I am one of the house-surgeons at Charing Cross Hospital—between twelve and one on Sunday morning, 1st December, the deceased was brought there, he was quite dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—death was due to asphyxia, and to the injuries to the head; the skull was extensively fractured, and there was some injury to the brain—there was some food in the windpipe—the injuries were such as would be caused by being thrown from a cab on to the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, of 123, Vauxhall Street—on Saturday, 30th November, a little after twelve, I saw the prisoner driving his cab at the corner of Duncannon Street, opposite Charing Cross—he said, "Hallo, <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi> where is your cab?" I said "On Adelphi Terrace; I am going to have supper"—he said, "Jump up here, I am going to have some supper, I am off to the rank and will come back with you"—I jumped up on the spring, and he drove to Adam Street, he was going along very slowly; in Adam Street I saw Dennis on his cab about twenty yards in front going very slowly; the prisoner caught up to him, and on wanting to pass, Dennis <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> his whip and slashed his horse, and just as they got to the corner of Adelphi Hotel and John Street they came into collision, and Dennis's horse fell and he was thrown over his cab—I jumped off the spring—the prisoner drove on, and I did not see him again—I ran down the Adelphi to fetch Churchill—I knew both the prisoner and the deceased very well—our cab was going about six or seven miles an hour, not faster.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I saw the whole thing—I saw Dennis thrown off his cab—I did not see that he was injured—I could not say whether he fell on his head—I did not stop to see—I went for Churchill to help up the horse, and when I got back Dennis was gone to the hospital—I did not give any information as to the name of the man who had driven off—I heard of his being in custody on the Monday morning—I did not go to the station to offer my evidence—I was called at Bow Street for the prisoner—the street is very narrow at the corner of John Street, about thirteen feet wide; great care is requisite in going down there, it is a sort of bend; two cabs could pass comfortably; the prisoner did not whip up his horse to pass Dennis, I did not see him with a whip in his hand; he had a quick horse—they were both going to the rank; it is an advantage to get there first, that was the object—the horses were not galloping—they were both at the corner at the same time—it would have been better for them to have gone one behind the other; it was not in the narrow part that the prisoner tried to go by, it was in the wide</p>

I am a retired bookbinder, of 305, Mare Street, Hackney—on November 2nd I travelled by train from Broad Street to Hackney, between 8 and 9 p. m.; I last saw my watch in Gresham Street before I got into the train; I had no one in the carriage with me, and as I got out I missed it, and found my chain dangling—this is it, I have had it about twenty-five years, that and the chain cost me a few shillings short of £20—Mr. Carter, of Mare Street, cleaned it about twelve months ago—since I lost it the outside has been engine-turned and the number, 7,762, has been altered to 17,782—I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager in the plate glass department at Mr. Goslett's, 26, Soho Square, and George Yard, Charing Cross Road—glass is stored at both places—there is a yard where vans are loaded at the warehouse doors—there is also a counting-house—in Cockpit Yard are the looking-glass manufactory and the silvering and bevelling departments—the Cockpit Yard business is entirely distinct from George Yard and Soho Square, except in respect of the stables—glass is consigned to Mr. Goslett from various manufacturers all over the Continent and England, and comes in stock sizes—in most cases the manufacturer's label is on each sheet—in that condition it is stored in our warehouse—when an order is received, the cutter and his assistants take glass from the warehouse and cut it to the exact size required by the customer—Hilton was one of the cutters, and he and his assistants had access to the ware-house for that purpose—after glass is cut it is marked with soap, and put in a rack till the number of sheets required are cut, and then they are ready for delivery—a delivery and an order book are kept—the goods in the delivery book are those sold to private customers, to be delivered to them—the book is printed and bound in triplicate—the delivery clerk enters goods going out into the book, and by entering them he has three copies; one remains in the book, two are torn out and handed to the man, who hands it to the carman who delivers the goods; when the carman has delivered the goods, he hands the two copies to the customer, who keeps one for his own purpose; he signs the other and hands it back to the carman as a receipt for the goods, and the carman brings it back to Soho Square, and gives it to the delivery clerk—if a carman found glass on his van for which he had no delivery order, his business would be to bring it back to the warehouse and report at once to a delivery clerk that he had goods on his van in excess of what was on his delivery note—we send goods to various trade firms to have work done to them—those goods are entered in the order book, which is in duplicate—the delivery clerk gives the copies to the carman, and when the carman delivers the goods the counterfoil is retained by the firm to whom it is sent—practically it is their order for the execution of work—in most cases he returns the duplicate when the work is finished—each of the books is numbered consecutively—Loveday was a carman in Mr. Goslett's employment—it was his duty to take goods to private and trade customers, and he would have the duplicates given him for that purpose—Chilton is a warehouseman or porter; he superintends the loading of the vans with plate glass; he would tell the carman the glass they had to put on the vans—in most cases plate glass going out of Soho Square would pass through his hands; not in all cases—in most cases goods delivered by Loveday and Stanton would pass through his hands—Chilton would know the particular route taken by each carman—Chilton would assist in loading the vans in special cases—Chilton and other warehousemen would take the glass from the heap to be loaded—Thackeray is a cabinet-maker, a maker of cheap wood work; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188912160027"/>
               <p>has worked for Mr. Goslett, making backs for looking-glasses and frames—those goods would be delivered at Cockpit Yard—he would only have to go to Soho Square to be paid and to get orders—as far as I can say he has never been employed to do anything else—he has not held himself out to do other business that I am aware of—no plate glass has ever been honestly delivered to Thackeray from Soho Square—I have looked through the books of the firm at Soho Square for the last nine months—I found no entry of any glass having been delivered to him during that time—I have no record of any order being given by him for plate or sheet glass—all the order and delivery books are kept at Soho Square—sheets of glass, 34 by 21 ft., are worth about 1s. 6d. a foot, trade price—glass in stock sizes, should not go out of the premises with a label on it, except when we sell it in bulk—there is a label on the corner of this; the size which was on the original has now been rubbed off—at the Police-court the labels were on all four of these sheets of glass—they are stock sizes—no glass should properly go out of our place in this state—when Hilton and another cutter cut it they should cut the glass, clean it, remove the label, and mark the size on it in soap—if either of the men saw a label on the glass after it had passed the cutter, they should take it back and remove it, or if it passed the ware-housemen the carman might have something to say about it—no one who knew anything of it would call this salvage glass—when glass is trimmed down to the exact size only very narrow strips would be cut off—if a large sheet were to break we should make the largest rectangles we could out of the pieces—that which was left would vary in size, out in the majority of cases we should cut off only very narrow strips.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLES</hi>. I have known Thackeray through seeing him come to Soho Square—he has worked for Mr. Goslett ten or twelve years—he is a master-man, a tradesman carrying on business in Brick Lane, I believe—he was not in Mr. Goslett's employment, but, as an independent tradesman contracting for it, he has made overmantels for them—I have not been to his place in Brick Lane, and I do not know it—I know nothing of him, except in connection with his work at Mr. Goslett's—there were labels on all four of these pieces of glass at the Police-court, but they have been damp, and have come off; I can see the remains of them now—it was a plain label with the size on it—there was nothing to indicate that the glass belonged to Mr. Goslett—the four pieces vary an inch or two in size—the term "stock sizes" is known throughout the glass trade; it applies to glass in the rough, as these are—if a customer wanted a sheet of glass we should take the nearest piece to the size, and cut it to the dimensions he wanted—there is no polishing, only cutting—if one of these plates was broken in the warehouse we should get out of it the best pieces we could, and they would be known as salvage to us; the other thing known as salvage to us is pieces of a broken window, but that is in very different condition, because it is not new glass, and the surface has been disfigured; it is this broken window-glass which is generally known as salvage; it would not become new marketable goods—we don't care for the salvage—I have never known salvage in the possession of a man like Chilton; he would have no business with it—I cannot say if he might speculate with it on his own account—<hi rend="italic">ranges</hi> or <hi rend="italic">slips</hi> are narrow pieces of glass up to twelve inches in width. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

               <p>broken it would be squared down to the largest size possible on the premises, and would then be put into the stock of that particular size—I never knew ranges of this size—we have a cash-book for cash transactions; the cutter makes a ticket out for the size of a glass required; the customer would take the ticket to the cashier, who would enter it, and receive the money and give a receipt—no goods should be delivered by any carman which have not passed through one or other of the two books.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant C</hi>). I received instructions and arrested Chilton on 23rd October at Soho Square—I told him what he would be charged with, and took him to the station—after he was charged he made this statement, which was taken down in my presence—on 30th October I took down in writing this voluntary statement from Loveday—it was read to him, and he signed it as correct. <hi rend="italic">The statement was here read, as follows</hi>:—"I, George Loveday, do hereby solemnly declare that on "Wednesday, 9th October, 1889, four polished plates of glass, 24 by 26 in., were put on my van, about 10 a. m., by Thomas Chilton, foreman packer to A. Goslett and Co. In my presence he said, 'For Thackeray'. No other person assisted him. After I went to Willett, I went on to Thackeray, 314, Brick Lane, and delivered them to Thackeray himself. I have received nothing for the glass as yet. On Saturday, the 12th October, I loaded at the warehouse. Chilton put two sheets of plate glass on my van in my presence. He said, 'For Thackeray.' Chilton then finished loading the van, with the exception of three large plates. I was ready to receive them on the blind, when Chilton came out with two other sheets of plate glass, at the same time saying, 'George, two more for Sage's.' He placed them in the body of the van. He then put on the three large plates, assisted by Kidgett, acting under Chilton's instructions. After the loading was completed, I got off my van to fasten up my tail-board. Chilton gave me my delivery notes at the same time, telling me to tell Tom Hilton that there were three only instead of four plates for Thackeray, should Hilton ask me the question. I went to 314, Brick Lane, after I left Smith at Grover's, Green Street, Bethnal Green. The door was open; I went into the shop. Mrs. Thackeray was there. I asked her if the master was at home. She said, No.' I said, 'I have these plates to leave.' She replied, 'Put them down there.' I did so. I was then arrested. If I had not been arrested I should have called in the evening for the money for them and for the glass delivered on Wednesday. I was to receive 7s. per foot super. Chilton and Hilton were to receive equal shares with myself.' I commenced to take glass to Thackeray by Chilton's instructions for six months at least. I have always delivered the glass to Mr. Thackeray, and have always been paid by him. I have delivered glass to Thackeray at least eight times during the past six months. I have never taken the glass from the warehouse, but it has always been put on my van by Chilton. To my knowledge I have never known Hilton to put stolen glass on my van. I have paid Hilton and Chilton personally their share of the money received by me from Thackeray. I have received from 5s. to as much as 24s. from Thackeray at a time for the glass. I have never had to deliver any glass to Thackeray from Messrs. Goslett's in the ordinary course of business. Stanton, the carman, was the first person to tell me of Thackeray. He introduced me to Thackeray on one occasion the beginning of this year. I wanted a back-board, and Stanton took me to Thackeray's. After we left, Stanton said if I ever had anything to dispose of Thackeray would buy it off me. Some time after this, about March last, Chilton put some glass on my van. He said,' You know Thackeray; take this glass down there.' I always trusted to Thackeray to pay me what was the measurement of the glass. Hilton has accom</p>

               <p>panied me to receive money from Thackeray. I would go to the shop, while Hilton would wait for me in the neighbourhood. Chilton has also accompanied me in a similar manner on one or two occasions. Thackeray has told me the sizes of plates he was requiring, and I have reported his requirements to Chilton. I am unable to fix the dates of delivery of plates of glass to Thackeray, as I have kept no notes."</p>

I was on duty in White Hart Street, Drury Lane, and saw Williams walking towards me from Catherine Street with a man on each side of him, and the tallest one, who I believe to be Kelly, walking behind; he struck Williams on his head and knocked him down, and snatched the bundle he was carrying from under his right arm and ran down Little Catherine Street, followed by Williams—I followed them, and when they got nearly to the bottom of Little Catherine Street Pearson stopped suddenly and turned round, and Williams came up and said, "This is one of the men who has just knocked me down and robbed me"—he said, "I am innocent; I am going to the market to buy some flowers"—I took him to the station—he made the same statement there—I am sure he is the man—I lost sight of him for about a minute—a description of Kelly was given at the station, and he was taken last Monday and placed with six others, and I picked him out—I have a doubt, but to the best of my belief he is the man.</p>

I am manager to Francis Arthur Barton, an optician, at 45, St. John Street—no one sleeps on the premises—on 1st November I locked up the premises when I left at night—at midnight I was called by the police, and went to the warehouse—I found that the two first floor room doors were open, the back window on the first floor forced open, and from that window an entry had been made—a glass case in the front room had been very nearly emptied of the most expensive goods, which were kept there for show; it had contained about thirty-six aluminium marine opera-glasses—above that case there were three small flat glass cases, from which a number of watch aneroids and clinical thermometers and compasses had been stolen—I have since seen and identified some of the property, in the possession of the police.</p>

I have been to Dave's room about three times; my first visit was on 2nd November—four persons were living in that room: Dave, Grant and his wife, and Dave's mother; it is not a very large room—I only saw one bed there, not much furniture—I had never seen Dave with a horse and trap before, or with a black bag—the opera-glasses looked brand new—they put two dozen in a basket, and a dozen between them in their pockets; they took them from under the bed; they were wrapped up in a striped curtain; they put that over the basket—I am nineteen years old—I have been in two or three situations; the greengrocer's was my own; I was a beveller of glass in two or three places—I did not know the value of these opera-glasses—I did not know that they were stolen—I never asked Dave what he was; he never told me—I thought I was doing them a favour in carrying them—I did not ask where they came from; it was not my place to ask them; I don't suppose they would have told me if I had; I never thought of asking them—I might have said at the Police-court that I thought Dave was a traveller—I was not to know that Grant was at the public-house till Knight told me—I had no idea then that the things were stolen, nor during the whole of the transactions—I have never been at a racecourse—I was 1s. out of pocket by this—I did not go to Grant's house on</p>

On November 7th, about 11. 45 p. m., I saw a number of policemen surrounding the prosecutor's warehouse—I searched, and found that the thieves had gained access to it by placing a ladder in the back yard against the first-floor window, forcing the window with a jommy, and crawling in at the window, which gave them access to the first floor—an office door had been forced with a jemmy—I have com<lb/>pared this jemmy with the marks, and they correspond exactly—inside the window where they entered there were several sheets of foolscap paper, on which were sooty marks, where somebody with corduroy trousers had been kneeling—the whole warehouse was in confusion, and the drawers drawn out.</p>

I have been an auctioneer twelve or thirteen years, and have carried on business in Bedford Row five years—on Friday, November 1st, I called in at Moss and Jennings', in Chancery Lane, and saw Mr. Knight there between four and five o'clock—I asked him if he had a safe, as a friend of mine wanted one—that was Mr. Kelly, who keeps the little newspaper-shop under Gray's Inn Archway—Knight said that he had bought one, and I made an appointment to meet him there again next day, which I did—I got there at a quarter or ten minutes to twelve—he was there, and showed me a safe, and I was in his company till fifteen or twenty minutes past two—he was never out of my sight from twelve o'clock to 2. 20—we called at Mr. Kelly's about 1. 45, and showed him the safe—Kelly saw Knight.</p>

This has been done with the full knowledge, of Hilton. I have told the three carmen, Stanton, Loveday, and Wing, to take the glass which I had put on the vans to Thackeray's, at 314, Brick Lane, and leave it there. I was with Loveday on one occasion, when he went to receive the money from Thackeray for the glass delivered. Loveday always received the money for the glass delivered by him. Stanton has also received money from Thackeray, and they have shared the proceeds with me and Hilton. Stanton was the first person who proposed to me to send goods out which had not been ordered. Hilton would take the glass from the warehouse, and place it ready to be put on the vans. He has told me to put it on the vans, and I have done so with his knowledge. I have received from Loveday as much as 2s. 8d. as my share of the proceeds of the glass received from Thackeray. Neither Ridgett, Holland, Andrews, nor Liggs knew anything about it. Judging from the amount I received from Loveday, Thackeray paid 6d. per foot for the glass."</p>

I am a cheesemonger, of 119, King Street, Hammer<lb/>smith—on 25th November I went to Smithfield Poultry Market, and about 3 p. m. 1 got to the Angel—I met Mr. Wellington and Mr. Bracken<lb/>bury, and was with them at 11, Chapel Street, Islington, till about four—I then went towards Moorgate Street, calling in at three or four public-houses, I think, on my way—I picked up with two men, whom I cannot recognise we went into a public-house, and talked together—as I came out of the public-house I was all of a sudden set upon by, I fancy, the same two men—they knocked me down and kicked me, and took my silver watch and gold chain, and £3 or £3 10s. or something like that—I next found myself at the station, charged with drunkenness—I don't know what became of the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I told the Magistrate I was knocked down and kicked, but that I did not recognise the men—when the clerk read my deposition I did not notice he read nothing about my being knocked down and kicked—I am certain I was knocked down—I am sure I had £3 or £3 10s. on me—I must have had over £5 in my pocket when I left home—I am a buyer for a co-operative store, which has a shop at Hammer<lb/>smith and elsewhere—I was out with my own £5 on my own occupation—I first went into a public-house that day between one and two—I had no money left when I was at the Police-station—I lent Mr. Brackenbury 5s., I spent 3d. in 'bus fare, £3 or £3 10s. was taken from me, and the rest I spent in drink—I saw my wife at the Police-court on the second occasion—I did not hear her say outside the Court that I never had any money that morning, but that I had borrowed 7s. 6d. before I went out—I last saw my watch safe at the Angel, about three.</p>

I am ten years old—I live at 8, Maccles<lb/>field Street—on 25th November, about 4. 30, I was in Powell Street, Central Street, St. Luke's—I saw the prisoner, another boy, and the prosecutor—the prisoner said, "Let us pick him up; let us take him into the Macclesfield beerhouse"—they took the prosecutor in there, and about</p>

               <p>three minutes afterwards they brought him down to Bridgeman's wood-yard, about three yards away—then they knocked him down and kicked him in the ribs, and took his watch and chain—I saw nothing else—I went and told a policeman, and then Went up to the Police-station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I spoke to Constable O'Brien—I first saw the prisoner at 4. 30 in Powell Street, it was daylight—there were plenty of people in Macclesfield Street—it is a broad street; there were no cabs or carts there—I was on the other side—the prosecutor and the two men walked from me, so that their backs were towards me—I followed behind—I heard the prisoner say, "Let us take him round to the Macclesfield, "access the broad street—I said I heard that before the Magistrate (<hi rend="italic">It did not Wappear in the deposition</hi>)—I have not been speaking to Snelling since I was at the Police-court—I followed some distance behind them; other people were in the street—the drunken man could hardly stand—the two lads were propping him up on each side, then the one on the left let go suddenly and down he went—the other lad did not fall on top of him—I was then as far as I am from you; it was close to the beershop—persons were passing by—after the prosecutor fell to the ground, and while on the ground, his watch and chain were taken by the prisoner, who had been on the prosecutor's right—he did not go down a second time—when I say he was knocked down and kicked, I mean one of the men withdrew, and the prosecutor fell down—I said before the Magistrate, "Then both of them knocked him down on his face and ran away"—I did not see either of them take anything from his pockets—after The man on the right took the watch and chain they both ran away, leaving the drunken man on the pavement—he was too drunk to do anything, and did not seem to know what was going on at all—it is not true that the prosecutor tried to stop one of the men, who then knocked him down—Russell was not with me; I first saw him in Macclesfield Street after it was all over, before I went to the policeman—I did not speak to him; I saw him at the station—the two men ran from me after the watch was taken; if Russell was anywhere near then he was behind me—I did not see him at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I did not see either of the men strike the prosecutor—I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the men 1 saw—I had seen him before—I saw the prisoner snatch the watch and chain.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 10, Northampton Street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner has a shop parlour there, but does not lodge there—on Sunday night, 17th November, just upon twelve o'clock, I went to his room door, and he said he had been to a sale-room, and showed me what he had bought; a table-cloth, a lady's jacket, two coats, and a. black marble clock—he asked me half-a-crown for the table-cloth, and I gave him two shillings—this is it.</p>

I live at Broadway, Plaistow—I have been acting as agent for collecting rents from about 150 small houses belonging to Mr. Candy, at Canning Town—the prisoner occupied one of those houses, 25, East Road, consisting of five rooms and a washhouse; I believe he occupied it entirely himself; there was no other name on my books—it was furnished—I believe he is a man who was always earning good money; I believe in the engineering line—early in October he owed £9 15s. for rent—I had been calling on him for it, but could not get it—it was a weekly rent of 7s—I heard of his moving his furniture and everything to 5. Garberry Road, which was about half a mile from the house he had occupied—I used to call for the rent every Monday, if not, on the Tuesday—it was on the Saturday following the Tuesday that I found the house empty—I had called on the Tuesday and found him and the furniture there, and on the Saturday he was gone; I asked him for the rent on the Tuesday, but he only insulted me, and said he should not pay anybody—a warrant was prepared, and Mr. Anstey was employed as a broker, and on Saturday at twelve or half-past in the day I went and found Anstey at 5, Garberry Road; he was inside the house—I saw a piano in the passage, and the prisoner by the side of it; Hammond, the policeman, was there standing on the steps; I went to fetch another policeman; I returned with Morgan in about seven minutes—the prisoner threatened he would do for me; he threatened me with a poker, which he had in his hand—I went away again to get a van, and he threatened me again with the poker, and said, "If anyone touches my goods I will do for them'—I got the van, and went to Canning Street Police-station, and came back with Pomeroy and some other policemen—I entered the passage; Pomeroy went in and stood on one side, and called me and Anstey to assist in moving the piano from the passage—the prisoner then struck me over the head—I never</p>

I live at Plaistow, and am in business as Anstey and Son—I have a licence as a broker, certified by the County-court, as usual—on 6th October I received a warrant to seize goods at 5, Garberry Street, belonging to Miles—I knocked five times at the door before it was opened, then the daughter opened it—I used no violence whatever to get into the house; there is no truth about throwing brickbats—about five minutes after I got in I saw the prisoner, previous to that there was a struggle with the daughter; she caught me by the throat—on the prisoner coming down I told him I had a warrant to distrain for the rent, £9 15s—when Mr. Living, came in the prisoner became very violent, and said whoever attempted to move his goods he would kill them—Living went away for a van, and then for some constables, and when we were about to move the piano the prisoner struck out several times with a poker, but I bobbed my head down, and it struck Mr. Living on the forehead, and inflicted a long wound—I take it that he directed the blows at both of us—I saw Living's hat knocked in, and his head was bleeding very much, and there was blood all along the passage; he bled profusely—the prisoner made another blow or two after that; I managed to catch the poker as the blow was aimed at me, and I kept hold of it—the police took him into custody as soon as they could get at him, and that was rather a difficult matter—not a word had been said to provoke him—I fancy he went into the kitchen for the poker, I don't know exactly how he got hold of it—the £9 15s. was paid a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The poker was produced before the Magistrate—I went to the Court as a witness—I thought of taking out a summons, but I did not—I was not called, no one was called—I daresay it was over in a quarter of an hour—I had not sent the prisoner any message that he had better clear his things out of his other house.</p>

               <p>I detained him, and took him to Major Hinge's house with a view of getting him identified by the servants; he was not identified—I found on his clothing some dust and chaff, like that which had covered the window that had been broken into—there was also a blotch of green on the leg of his trousers, which corresponded exactly with that on the fence over which he had jumped, at the bottom of the lawn—I found this burnisher in his side-pocket; the groom identified it at once—this looking-glass was also found on the prisoner later on, after a further search at Farnham—I took him to the Farnham Station, searched him there, and in his pockets I found this pipe and case, which have been identified by the prosecutor as his property—I also found two knives, some tobacco, and a small looking-glass which has been identified by the groom—on 17th November, in consequence of what I heard, I went to a cottage at the back of the Half-way House at Heath End, and I found these trousers concealed at the back of the pigsty; the prosecutor has identified them.</p>

The servant cannot recognise me as the man that broke into the house; it appears that it was light enough to see that the man had a dark hat on, therefore it was certainly light enough for her to recognise me. If the man saw me once, I flatter myself he would know me again. As regards the things that Major Hinge is owning, I would not for a moment say they were not stolen. I left Portsmouth five days before I came to Farnham, in company with two other men; they went into Aldershot the night previous, and met me at six o'clock the following morning, and they gave me these things. I left them, and immediately afterwards I was apprehended. If I was the man they chased away from the house, surely I would not have gone directly back to the house, knowing that the police were there; it stands to reason that a man who had been there would know that the police would be there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master butcher, of 9, Marshall Street, Westminster—some time before last Easter the prisoner called on me, and said he was Mr. Bloxham, a solicitor, and he got up these cases, and got money for the next-of-kin, and I was entitled to £9,000 or £10,000 from my father's uncle, deceased, and offered his services, pro<lb/>vided I paid for the certificates; and he was to have 5 per cent, on the amount recovered—I had several interviews with him, at one of which he produced this paper (G), for which I paid him 7s. 6d. "The next-of-kin to William Harrington, who died on January 2nd, 1889, are requested to apply to the Solicitor to Her Majesty's Treasury, Whitehall, London"—I saw the prisoner on April 18th, and saw him draw up this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">By this the witness agreed to pay the prisoner five per cent, on all money he recovered, and the prisoner agreed to give his time and knowledge with<lb/>out further charge</hi>)—I signed it and got it stamped—he wanted the birth and death certificates of all the members of my family—he asked for 11s. 2d., which I paid him, and got this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">Dated April 8th, 1889)—I saw him again on May 1st, and paid him 12s.</hi> 2d., and got this receipt; and on 3rd May I paid him 11s. 2d., and got this receipt—I paid him several other sums after that for more certificates—he then said that a cousin of mine was bankrupt, and he could not go on unless he proved it, and that would be a guinea—I gave him the guinea—he then said that he must employ a broker to sell the stock which the money was invested in, and he should have to pay the broker £2—I gave him £1, and he said he would stand half—I afterwards paid him £1 towards the expenses of counsel to plead at Year<lb/>mouth—I also paid him for a power of attorney, I forget how much; also 10s. 6d. for a caveat—he made an appointment for the family to meet him at the Bank on the first Thursday in August, to receive the money, as the Treasury had sent the papers to the Bank, but afterwards sent a letter putting it off—after that the prisoner drew up a mortgage to raise £300 on the security of the estate, as we had to wait some time for the money, for which I paid him 7s. 6d.—he asked me to sign it, and said he would give me a cheque for the money, but I refused, and told him I should have further advice from a solicitor—he left, and I did not see him again till he was at the Police-court—I parted with quite £15 altogether.</p>

Please let Mrs. Dillaway see it"—I paid for two sets of certificates, one for the Treasury and one for the Bank of England, and one when I changed my address.</p>

I am a widow, of 20, Bishop's Road—the prisoner called on me, and said he was a solicitor, and he came about £16,000, which he was going to take up for me, from some relative on my father's side—I paid him 3s. 6d. for two certificates of identification—he called again on September 6th, and I gave him 5s. 7d. for a certificate of my birth, and offered him my marriage certificate; he said it was of no use—I afterwards paid him 7s. 6d. for a preliminary drawing of £300, which I should get in a few days—I also paid him 2s. 7d., and other sums—I never saw him again till he was at the Police-court.</p>

I took a marble clock, five plated teapots, four or five sugar-tongs, about two dozen plated spoons, and two blankets from the still-room and laundry. I sold the clock for 10s. at a broker's shop in Spring Place, Wilcox Road, South Lambeth, the same day. I will not say where I disposed of the other property.

Gentlemen of the Court, Sir, The reason of my giving myself up to the Brixton police for burglary at Oatlands Park Hotel was to bring my case before the Gentlemen of the Court. Two years ago I was charged at the Old <hi rend="italic">bails</hi> for attempted burglary at Villa Road, brixton. I pleaded guilty, but I was starving with hunger at the time, as my <hi rend="italic">unkle</hi> used to live in Villa Road, and I went to see if I could get some food: my <hi rend="italic">unkel</hi> is H. W. Brand, esq., maker and inventor of brand's essence of beef and sauce. His private address is no. 1, Omega. Cottages, Hornsey rise. I have wrote to him since I have been remanded, to ask him if he would give me a little assistance to get work, but he refused to answer my letter. I have been sleeping where I can for the last fortnigt, and the cold almost killed me; and feeling so miserable I thought I would give myself up for burglary to get a bit of food; but the only light I can throw on the burglary is, I met a <hi rend="italic">watter</hi> who used to work their, and he gave me a pint of beer and some bread and cheese, and he says, '<hi rend="italic">hears</hi> a knife for you' and it had on 0. P. Hotel. I asked him where he got it from, and he says he brought it away with him from the Hotel. After the judge gave me a good talking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188912160072"/>
               <p>to he discharged me, hoping it would be a caution to me, and then I wrote to the manager of the Hotel, telling him I would tell him who gave me the knife if he would see me, but I got no answer from the letter. I met the same <hi rend="italic">watter</hi> about three months ago, and he <hi rend="italic">toled</hi> me he broke in Oaklands Park Hotel and Stole a marble clock, and sold it in wilcox Road, wandsworth Road, at a broker's shop for ten shillings. I have been trying ever since to get a Honnest living, but I give myself up on this falce charge to ask some gentlemen of court to assist me to get work, as I was in such a distented Concition. I can prove were I was on the night of the 7th of October, '87. I was in the royal artillery, wolich. I hope some kind gentleman of the court will have the kindness to give me a pair of boots, as my feet is on the bair ground.—I remain yours Obed. Servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">W. HOLGATE</hi>."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Gentlemen, the reason I gave myself up on this charge of burglary is that I was destitute and starving. After I got off on the other charge, the Judge gave me a good talking to, and said he hoped it would be a caution to me. Ever since I was discharged from the Army, I have been trying to do my best to get an honest living, but I cannot do it. My uncle is in a very good position, Mr. Brand, of Hornsey Rise, but he refuses to answer my letters; any gentleman can write to him.</p>

I am one of the firm of Baily, Adams and Hawker, solicitors to Courage and Co., Limited—on 9th August, 1888,1 was present at the change of the Colby Arms, Gipsy Hill, when it was transferred from Miss Florence Taylor, who was the licensed holder, under a lease of which" seventy years was unexpired—that lease was assigned on 9th August, 1888, to Croft, in consideration of £4,600—Courage and Co. were also parties to the assignment; Kemp was no party—the assignment does not pass the fixtures and fittings—of the £4,600 consideration money, £3,500 was paid to Courage and Co. on their mortgage debt, and the balance to Miss Taylor—Croft found the whole of the money in one way and another, so far as the assignment was concerned; Courage and Co. advanced some part of it, but the difference between the £3,500 and £4,600 did not come from them. (<hi rend="italic">The assignment deed was here read</hi>)—the next step in the change was the execution of the mortgage deed by Croft to Courage and Co.

Mr. Thornton acted as a broker at the change, but not for Courage and Co.—sometimes he acts at our changes, not more usually than others—I could not say for certain if £1,035 was the actual cash paid down—£3,500 remained on mortgage; no part of that was paid in ready money—of the £1,100, I believe part was borrowed from the distillers and part from friends—£1,035 ready money was paid by Croft when he went into this house—that was not for the fittings of the house, but for loose things; the broker could tell you what they are, I cannot—the £1,035 is not the price of the fittings and fixtures only—I will not swear every one of the fixtures is not paid for in that sum—part of the £1,035 covers the fixtures—I instructed Mr. Besley at the Police-court, where a charge of larceny of these fixtures was first preferred against the prisoners—the Magistrate heard the case for three days, and dismissed it—the builder and his foreman, who made good the damages, and one other witness here to-day, were not</p>

               <p>before the Magistrate, I believe; we did not consider the case was thoroughly sifted out then—I don't know if Mr. Johnson got the licence for this house from Newington Sessions about three years ago—I think there have been three or four tenants in the house—the collector who is here knows more of the house than I do—I know nothing about the former occupants—I do not know why Miss Taylor sold the house, except that she got a purchaser—I don't know that she, the prisoner, and Saunders were ruined by going into the house—all the articles we charge the prisoners with damaging are charged in the £1,035, which Croft paid; they are included in this inventory D—he damaged articles which he had paid for, but which he mortgaged afterwards—fittings, fixtures, etc., are not included in the schedule to the mortgage—under the word fixtures, tenant's fixtures pass—the public-house is mentioned in the schedule, the fixtures are not—there is no separate schedule under which these things pass to us—if they were landlord's fixtures there would be no need to mention them—the surveyor will speak to the damage.</p>

Mr. Addison is our managing clerk—he was permitted to swear the information before these proceedings were commenced, without the special knowledge of each detail of it, by any member of our firm—I believe it was settled by Counsel—sometimes Mr. Thornton, of 15, Coleman Street, is Messrs. Courage and Co 's agent, and acts for them in selling public-houses—I am not aware that Kemp left her address at Whitstable before she went there, with Mr. Thornton on 3rd September—I saw the information—I don't repudiate the statement in it that she had absconded—I have since ascertained she is a Whitstable person—she was arrested there—Mr. Besley opened the case before the Magistrate, who refused bail with regard to the man—after all the witnesses had been called the Magistrate refused to commit the case for trial—under the word fixtures in the mortgage-deed only tenant's fixtures pass—the mortgage was not registered as a bill of sale—there was no schedule to it setting out the fixtures.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Mr. Thornton made the inventory; he was acting either for Croft or Taylor, and Mr. Briggs represented the one Thornton was not acting for—this shows what the purchaser would have to pay, subject to deductions for rent, taxes, etc.—the balance is £1,035 16s. 6d.—Craft's £835 was treated as cash; I know nothing about how it was raised—I saw cash on the table, I don't know how much—indirectly all had been paid to Miss Taylor but £335, and that was the balance of the purchase money to which she was entitled after all encumbrances on the property had been paid off—after all that was settled Croft made the mortgage the same day—the inventory was made before—I have never known an instance of a whole inventory being set out and scheduled—at the time of issuing the writ about. £160 or so was due besides the mortgage capital sum—this estimate of the loss of replacing fixtures and making good damage, etc., was made for the incoming tenant; we had to allow him £170 for it to make good the damage—throughout I have acted under the advice of Counsel—the day before the warrant was issued Thornton asked me if I knew Croft's address, because he wanted money out of me—this case was opened before the Magistrate as one of wilful damage to the fittings of the house, and wilful damage exceeding £5—no misrepresentation was made, to my knowledge, before the warrant was obtained—fixtures of the house were taken away, and we got a warrant for</p>

I am collector to Courage and Co., and live at 57, Breakspear Road, Brockley—on 9th August, 1888, I was present at the change of the Colby Arms—Kemp and Croft were there—they went into occupation—I saw the house at the time—the fixtures and fittings were just as usual—I called there every twenty-eight days for the pur<lb/>pose of collecting—I saw this card, "Colby Arms, Kemp and Croft, wine and spirit merchants, "etc.—I have seen Kemp there, attending to the business—on 15th July the fittings were as they had been in the previous August, as far as I could see—during the early part of my visits the cheques paid to me were signed by Croft only, afterwards they were signed by Croft and Kemp, upon a joint account—I heard of the legal proceedings under the mortgage—about 17th or 19th August this year Kemp called on me at the brewery, and told me the Sheriff was going to take possession under a judgment on the following Tuesday, 20th August, and asked if we could give her a longer time, as they might be able to sell in the meantime; they had one or two people inquiring about the house—she said Croft was ill, or he would have come with her—I said we had already given them so long to find a customer, we could give no further time—she called again on the same day with Mr. Worrall, I believe, and after conversation we agreed to give a week's longer time—I did not see her again till she was at the Police-court—on 4th or 5th September the premises were taken by a new tenant, Mr. Green—I was present at the brewery when the arrangement took place—an allowance of £170 was made to him—when I called from August, 1888, to July, 1889, there was a large pendant lamp outside the principal entrance at the corner of the house—I have seen it since; I know it was put up again.</p>

I am a plumber, of Romany Road, West Norwood—on Thursday, 29th August, I went to the Colby Arms, at 7 a. m.,' and saw Croft—I again went at six or half-past six, and saw the prisoners in the bar—Croft said, "I want you to take down these gas fixtures"—I took off six or seven spirit taps, unscrewing them, and cutting the pipe behind—I disconnected the pipes to the beer-engine from the barrels, cut them from the taps and barrels, coiled them up, and put them in the bar—the prisoners were by all the time I was doing it—on the Sunday I went again with Kiddell, and we were engaged some six or seven hours in taking down gas-fittings, and stripping the pewter off the counter—Mrs. Kemp was in the bar, and saw everything we did—the lead piping went to Flack at 10, Colby Road—about six o'clock on Sunday evening Mrs. Kemp said, "There are some drawers there, you can have them."—there were fifteen drawers taken from under the counter, and were, then in the kitchen—she said, "If anyone asks you what you had paid for the drawers, you are to say money"—on the next day, Monday, I assisted in taking down the outside lamp at between 6 and 6. 30, and taking it away—I took away my sixteen drawers, the remainder of the gas-fittings, and some of the pewter on that morning to Kiddell's house—I was working for him at this time—I last saw the prisoners on that morning.</p>

I took the pewter counter off openly—there was only Mrs. Kemp in the bar—I was warned not to injure the property or premises—when the public-house was open nothing was kept secret; but it was not open on the Sunday—I did my work openly, and did no injury to the premises.</p>

I got to the place on Monday to complete the work I began on Sunday, at about 3. 30 or 4 a. m.; it was a nice bright morning—a cart was fetched to carry away the big lamp—that was afterwards taken back when Green was tenant—I took the drawers home, and alter<lb/>wards sold them to Mr. Green for 15s.</p>

I live at 10, Colby Road, and let furnished-lodgings on Toursday, 29th August, I was at the Colby Arms—Mrs. Kemp said she was coming to take my apartments—Croft said he wanted me to take some lead piping and keep it till the morning—I did so, "and kept it till Kiddell took it away again—they both asked me to take the Venetian blinds; I think there were nearly thirty of them—Kemp said they; belonged to them; I was to try and sell them to the incoming tenant and</p>

I was not at the change—we investigate before we take proceedings—before consulting counsel I saw Kiddell, Booth, Gower, and Flack, and I had all the deeds relating to the house—I believe counsel's opinion is dated 5th September—I applied for warrants against the prisoners for stealing, under the advice of counsel—I swore I thought a summons would not be obeyed; that was from inquiries in the neighbourhood—after the case was dismissed I believe we consulted counsel again—that was before we got a letter threatening an action for malicious prosecution against Messrs. Courage and Co.—papers were with counsel when the threatening letter came—we went on with the charge of stealing all the time the case was before the Magistrate, coupled with the charge of malicious damage—the charge for stealing is not included in this indictment—we have followed counsel's advice as to what steps we should take—there is no indictment against the prisoners for felony—we did not write to the prisoners for an explanation; we thought they would be off before we had them—I have been clerk to Courage and Co. 's solicitors for five years; during that time they have not taken proceedings like these—proceedings have not been taken at the Nun's Head at Peckham during that time—the tenants sold the fixtures there; they were not prosecuted—the solicitor in that case and in this was Mr. Worrall—I cannot say if we took counsel's opinion in that case; I did not attend to it—all brewers' mortgages are drawn in a similar way to this; I cannot say if the reference to the fixtures was printed in the same way as this in reference to the Nun's Head—to my knowledge this is the first time criminal instead of civil proceedings have been taken in a case like this—the prisoners vouched Mr. Worrall to the policeman—I did not inquire of him—for all I know their story is correct.</p>
