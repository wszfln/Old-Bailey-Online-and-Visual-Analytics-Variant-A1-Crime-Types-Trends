I was on duty on Thursday, the 9th of February, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, and saw both the prisoners in company together—they passed by me in the City-road—they were about two hundred yards from Mrs. Greening's house—I had occasion to pass Greening's house a very few minutes after, and found the shed-Door open—it was about four o'clock—I called of the inmates—Mrs. Greening came first—I noticed about five tiles taken off one end of the roof of the shed, which was very low—it is a continuation of the roof of the dwelling-house—the whole family were called up—in consequence of information from Mrs. Greening, I and her son Adam searched the premises—we went over some gardens adjoining her field, and, after a long search, we heard a cock crowing—we went to the place the sound came from, and found two hens in one privy, and two hens and a cock in the next privy—the privies were the length of the field from Greening's house—Adam Greening took possession of the fowls—I afterwards received them from him, and kept possesion of them—in the first privy, where I found the two hens, I found this piece of list, and when the prisoners were apprehended I saw some list, found in Cockett's pocket—that was about three quarters of an hour after I left the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent to Greening's house by the inspector about twenty minutes to six o'clock—I found Sergeant Dubois, Adam Greening, and Fearne there—Dubois pointed out two privies to me—I went to them, and stopped there till twenty minutes past six o'clock, and saw Yarroll come down a passage from Shepherdess-walk—he had a bag under his arm—he came to within a yard or two of where I was standing—he looked round, and in a minute or so he went back up</p>

               <p>the passage, and I heard him say, "Come on, it is all right"—I saw Cockett and Yanroll return past where I was concealed—a short distance down the passage there is a door leading to some gardens, through which they passed and came into the yard where I was—the prisoner Yarroll went to one of the privies Duhois had showed me and opened the door—I heard one of them say, "They are gone"—they then separated, and I made my appearance—I attempted to lay hold of Cockett, and we scuffled—he endeavoured to get away—in the scuffle his hat fell off, and I saw this handkerchief drop from the hat, wet—I took it up and put it into my pocket—I took Cockett to Greening's house, and Fearne joined me in a few minutes, having Yarroll—we took them to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer. I accompanied Hawkes and secured Yarroll—I saw him in the yard, and he ran into the privy, and I took him out—I had seen the prisoners join each other and come into the yard, and go to both the privies, as Hawkes has stated—I took Yarroll about a minute after Hawkes took Cockett—I searched them at the station-house, and found two pieces of list on Cockett and a key—I have them both here—it is the same sort of list as that found by Dubois—we took them both to the station-house together, but the inspector sent one of them afterwards to Featherstone-street station-house—as we went along Cockett said to me, "It is a very unlucky day for me; this very day twelve month I had it before," and then he said, "It was Yarroll led me into this"—he said he did not know any thing about the place, but he supposed Yarroll knew all about the premises, living so near, and he said he would confess the whole when he came before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shepherdess-walk, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. My mother keeps the house—I lodge and board with her—I do not pay her for board—I conduct her business for her—she is a blanket cleaner—her Christian name is Mary—on the morn<lb/>ing in question I was called up about four o'clock by my mother—I went Down, and found the tiles taken off the shed, and five fowls gone—it is a long wooden building—it joins the side of the house, and is all under one roof—there is one door opens out of a room in the house into the shed, and there are two doors going out of the shed into the field—the tiles were taken off about the height that a man could reach from the ground—the space was large enough for a man to get in—when I went into the shed I found the door wide open, and five fowls gone—I also missed a silk hand<lb/>kerchief—I saw the fowls afterwards at Worship-street, and knew them to be the same—one of the privies they were found in belongs to Yarroll's father—the field is inclosed all round by a wooden fence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of this house. I let Taylor and Rugg live in it rent free, as Taylor was of service to me, being an ingenious man—they lived in the kitchen—they are poor—he never ac<lb/>counted to me for two sovereigns from my tenants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edith Taylor's Defence.</hi> On Sunday, about a quarter past six o'clock, Mrs. Hill, the prisoner, came down to me, and asked me whether I would come up stairs, as the prosecutor was gone to chapel; and would I come of and assist her—my old man said, "For God's sake, Do not"—I went out, and got two pennyworth of coals; and then she came down, and said, "I am all right; pray come up, and hold me a candle"—which I did—the staple was drawn, and the door open—I took the candle into the room, and on the table there was a watch and some silver, but what I do not know—she said, "I will not be satisfied with this, I will have more, as I know he has got more"—she put her hand on the box—she came down stairs and brought the candle, and put it on the table, to give her husband when he came in—she beckoned me out, and I went with her to Brown's tide door—we had a quartern of gin—she went to pay a shilling, but instead of a shilling it was a sovereign—she asked me, in the morning, whether I would take the key up—next morning she came down, and knocked at our door—the old man got up, but I went to sleep, and do not know what passed—when I got up he was out—in the course of the morning Mrs. Hill was in ray room, quite angry because he was out drinking—in the evening he came home, and she took turn out into the passage—on the Tuesday morning she came down, and asked me to bring that bag along, but not to go the road she did—I looked into the bag, and there were twelve sovereigns—I gave them to her, and she said, "Now I will go, and they may take me up, for they shall never find it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">John Taylor's Defence.</hi> I have heard several times from Mrs. Hill that she would open the door, and get the money out which the prosecutor had—we had heard he had money, and she intended to leave her husband—I did not hear any thing of it; but in the course of the Friday before (I am in he habit of fitting different keys to locks) she brought down a small key—was doing a padlock for a person—she said she had a key that would fit it—I had the key nearly finished for the padlock—I hung it on a nail when finished, and there it remained—I never looked to see if the key was gone out of it till I saw it in the possession of Murray.</p>

In September last I had several parcels of sherry wine at the St. Katharine's Docks, in bond—I had some in vaults A and B—I do not know the prisoner at all—I never had any communication with him—I never gave him any authority to go to the Docks and taste my samples.</p>

Sir, On reading your advertisement in the paper, I take the liberty of writing to ask you to oblige me with an interview at your house to<lb/>morrow morning, at eleven o'clock, if convenient to you.

               <p>"To Mr. Hance, November 12th. Dear Sir, I received your letter this morning, and beg leave to beg pardon for making the mistake—for I was not aware of Mr. Gardiner having my bills, as I did not know you had handed them to him, or to any body else—for I renewed my bill a short time ago with you—I therefore supposed you had the bill still in your pos<lb/>session—I hope this explanation will remove every impression my first letter has caused—and beg leave to state it is my real intention to pay You the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 1st of January, as my brother gives me my 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Scott" across it—I do not know whose writing that is, nor "London and Westminster Bank"—it is not mine—I paid it in at the London and Westminster Bank myself—it had not that on it then—I do not know how those words got there, nor by whom they were written—they must have been added since I paid it in—after giving the cheque I took 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discounting the bill; I handed the £1000 bill over to Mr. Day's daughter, Mrs. Claggett—the discount I accounted for to Mr. Day—he died on the 26th of October, 1836—I accounted to him for the discount in each instance.</p>

On the 14th of January a money-letter arrived, addressed to "Elizabeth Foreman Parson's-green"—this letter-bill arrived with the letters that morning—when a letter-carrier receives a money-letter, he marks his signature against the entry of the letter—here is the prisoner's signature to this entry of Elizabeth Foreman—it is an acknowledgment that he received the letter—this receipt would come with the letter, and would be delivered to the prisoner, to get it signed by the person the letter is addressed to—Elizabeth Foreman came to me on the 5th of February, to make inquiry about a money-letter, and I spoke to the prisoner about it the next day, I asked him what he had done with Elizabeth Foreman's letter—he told me his wife had found it in one of his coat pockets, and he had been and delivered it that morning—I asked him where the receipt was—he told me he had not time to wait for it, as he had to call at Dr. Keate's for some money—this was about ten minutes before ten o'clock—I said it was very odd the office had not sent for the receipt, as it was customary to send for them a few days afterwards—he said it was so, and they must have forgotten it, and he would make it all right—he then went away to breakfast, and I went immediately to Elizabeth Foreman—after seeing her I immediately returned to the office, and saw the prisoner—I said, "What a lie you told me respecting this letter, You hare never been near the house"—I told him the information I had from Elizabeth Foreman—he said he must say something, but he would make it all right, but he could not find the letter—I said nothing more to him then—I went again to Elizabeth Foreman, about three o'clock, to know if he had called, and saw the prisoner afterwards at his own house—I said, "You have never been to Elizabeth Fore-man respecting this letter"—he said he had not—on the following morning, about eight o'clock, I said, "What have you done about this letter, I shall certainly report it; it is a bad job, you have fallen into the error, and you must abide the consequences"—I then wrote to the Superintending President—I went to town and returned with an officer, and we went in search of the prisoner, but could not find him that day—I did not see him again till he was at Bow-street.</p>

                  </hi> I was servant to Mr. Carlton, of Parson's-green, Fulham, in January last. I did not receive any letter that month containing half-a-sovereign and sixpence from my sister—I heard afterwards of such a letter having been sent; in consequence of which I went to Mr. Drake on the 5th of February—in consequence of what passed between him and me I went to the prisoner, and told him I had called respecting a letter which I understood I ought to have received on the 14th of January—he hesitated—I told him I could not account for it unless he had given it to somebody else to bring it to me—(the prisoner knew me—he had delivered letters to me for three or four years)—I said I could not account for it, as I had always received them punctually before—he said he had been ill and got his brother to deliver fur him—I told him then that I had traced the money to him, and should expect him to make it good to me in two or three days; and he said he would do so—I said I should not trouble my<lb/>self any further about it, and left him—on the 6th of February, he came to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman. I was in Union-street, Bishopsgate, on the 9th of February, soon after five o'clock, and felt a tug at my pocket—I turned and saw Aspree at my elbow—he passed on my left and went up to Lyons who was about two paces from me—Aspree gave him my handkerchief which I missed from my pocket—Lyons took off his hat put it in, and they both went off—I followed, and cried, "Stop thief"—Lyons was stopped at the end of Union-street—he made a desperate resistance, and I think would have got off, but another officer came up, his hat fell off and ray handkerchief was in the crown of it—Aspree was taken the same evening—I saw him the next morning, and he exactly answered the description which I gave the officer of him, in his dress, his cap and every thing—I believe him to be the boy.</p>

On the 26th of January the prisoner was pointed out to me in the parlour of the Cock and Magpie public-house, Worship-street, by Mr. Osborne, as the man he had purchased the horse of—I asked him whether he had sold a horse lately to Mr. Osborne—he said he had—I asked where he got it from—he said he bought it of a man who he knew well, of the name of Jenkins—I asked if he could find him—he said he could—I then told him the horse was stolen, and took him into custody—he said, "I bought it, and have got a receipt for it, at least my wife has at home"—that was all that passed—Osborne was present during the whole conversation—in consequence of what the prisoner said, I went to some stables in Worship-street, and found a female up stairs, who answered to the name of Bradfield, and she showed me a paper which I gave her again—the prisoner's solicitor afterwards produced it at the office, and it remained in his possession, I believe.</p>

On Monday, the 6th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went to No. 2, Charles-street, Drury-lane, accompanied by Reynolds and Ashton—I found the outer door of the house open—we went up stairs to the first floor back room—the door was fast—I burst it open, and found the three prisoners in the room—Wilson was Bitting on a chair in front of the fire by the side of a table—there was a good fire, and a candle burning—on my entering she immediately rose from her seat, and leaned forwards to the fire-place—I perceived that she had taken something white from the front of the fire-place, she endeavoured to break it with her hands—I seized her hands, and in the scuffle she fell on the floor, and I found what she had in her hand was these pieces—they are different portions of a mould, and are made of plaster of Paris—the other two prisoners were standing by the fire-place—I proceeded to search the room, and found in the table drawer this Knife with plaster of Paris on it—I observed in front <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the fire an old shovel stuck into the bars; that appeared to be the spot where the mould was taken from—it formed a sort of ledge, and would have kept the mould</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lamb's-Conduit-street, and am a furrier. I know Mr. Jewell—I was passing down Drury-lane on a Thursday, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the two prisoners, Michael and Abraham Gershon, get up into a cart apparently laden with metal and tacks, and drive off with it—the cart was at the door of the public-house, which since this transaction I have ascertained to be the George—it appeared to me when they got up that it had just driven up—it was standing still—they went towards the Strand—I was very near to them—I saw the countenance of Abraham very plainly—the other I had not a full opportunity of seeing, but I believed from circumstances that he is the person—I had rather a side view of him—I was in company with my brother Philip.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a butcher's shop in Goldsmith's-place, Hackney-road. On Saturday night, the 18th of February, I shut up my shop about a quarter or twenty minutes before one o'clock—it is part of my dwelling-house—there is a door out of the shop into the house—the shop window will not open at all—I cannot swear that I fastened the shop door when I went to bed—it has a lock, a bolt, and a latch to it—the latch will open from the outside when it is shut, with a key, but not without—I went into the shop next morning about eight o'clock, and found the door a little open, just shut to the post, but neither locked nor latched—I looked round and missed a quantity of meat and pork sausages—I was the first person down</p>

               <p>—I was sent for by the police at a quarter past twelve o'clock on Sunday night, and went to No. 1, Hay-street—I found the two prisoners and the policeman there—I found two fore-quarters of mutton, two shoulders, and part of another shoulder baked, a loin, a spring, and a hind-leg of pork, and part of a rump of beef—I am certain it was part of the meat I lost—the loin and spring of pork had marks on it by which I knew it, and all the meat was my own cutting up—I knew it also by that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 19th of February, I was on duty between two and three o'clock in the morning, and saw Goddard in Dove-row with a man who I cannot swear to—fifty or sixty yards from Mr. Barnes's shop—Dove-row comes up right opposite his shop—they passed me and went down Dove-row—I took particular notice of them, and can swear to Goddard—I saw Prior directly after, and he went down Dove-row after them—I saw no more of them that night—I had not Men them nearer to Barnes's shop than fifty yards—I had passed the door several times that night, and tried it three or four times as I passed it—I put my hand in the middle of the door, and pushed it, and found it fast—I did it to ascertain that it was fast—I try all the doors—I am certain 1 pushed it sufficiently to force it open, if it had not been locked or latched—I received information of the robbery on Sunday evening, and at twelve o'clock, or a little after, I saw Goddard come out of a public-house next Door to Mr. Barnes's—I and Prior were standing together at the time—I followed him to No. 1, Hay-street—he knocked at the door, which was opened by a boy—I followed him in, and turned my light on—I opened the cupboard, and found the mutton and pork in it—I went to the door and sprang my rattle, and Prior came to my assistance—I then went up stairs and found some more mutton, beef, and sausages in a box—the prisoner Bromley was lying on the bed with his clothes on, in the same room—I found a bunch of eighteen keys in the cupboard, up stairs—they ace all common keys, of different sizes, and some are broken—I asked Bromley where he got the meat—he said, "That has got to be tried"—I took it down stairs, and then went up and brought Bromley down—Mr. Barnes came and took the meat to the station-house, and we took the prisoners there—I cannot swear Bromley is one of the men that I saw—it was a person dressed like him, but I could not see his face.</p>

I am in partner-ship with three others—one front of the warehouse is in Emmett-street, and the other in Ferry-road—my dwelling-house is separate from the warehouse—on the 27th of February, at half past eleven o'clock, I was called by the policeman, and found the prisoner in his custody, and a bag with property in it, which I immediately identified as mine—it had been in my warehouse—the door appeared to have been opened from within, and there was an inner door forced—the warehouse had been entered by the internal Door—a person might have got to the internal door without breaking, but not through it—it was broken—the pannel to which the hasp was at<lb/>tached</p>

I was called to the warehouse about eleven o'clock on the 27th of February, and saw the prisoner in custody—I could identify the contents of the bag—one parcel, in particular, had my private mark on it—I knew the prisoner before—he is a blacksmith—he had called on that day to ask for a job—he had previously worked for my employers—I told him we were very slack, and could not give him a job—I observed the internal door, and it was safe about six o'clock in the evening—the key was left inside the door—there are two doors—one I locked and put the key of it in my cupboard, and another door, communicating with the street, I locked, and took the key to the dwelling-house about half-past seven o'clock, when I left the premises safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. I was in Holborn, with a friend, opposite the Bell and Crown, on Tuesday, the 28th of February, between a quarter and half-past six o'clock—I felt what appeared to me to be a man's hand in my pocket—I turned round immediately, putting one hand on my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I then turned round on the right and saw the prisoner within arm's length, I should say, and no one near him—he was just starting from the pavement—I ran and caught him about three or four paces off, and charged him with the theft, which he denied—I brought him back, and on my return I saw my handkerchief lying on the curb, just by the spot where we had just left the pavement—I took him into the shop of Mr. Cross, the map-seller, about ten or twenty yards off, and sent for a police<lb/>man—it is impossible the handkerchief could have dropped out of my poc<lb/>ket—in coining from Holborn-hill I put it into my pocket with considerable care, having mentioned to my friend that there had been so many robberies about there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the three Directors forming the acting committee of the Argus Company. The prisoner was book-keeper to the company originally—it was his duty after receiving the letters which came by post, after opening them, to bring them up at twelve o'clock to the daily meeting of the acting committee—here is the minute-book of the proceedings of the acting committee—if money or bills came in letters from the country, it would be his duty to enter in the amount of it in this book, and to enter the substance of the letters also—not to copy the letter into the minute-book—there is a book in which letters sent to the coon<lb/>try are entered by the book-keeper—there is no entry of letters received from the country, except the memorandum in the minute-book—there was a cash-book kept by the prisoner, in which the amount of money re<lb/>ceived was entered—there is no memorandum in the minute-book of any communication from Mr. Ferris, on the 14th of May, neither of the letter nor remittance—no such letter or remittance was ever produced or notified to the Directors, by the prisoner in my presence—if he received a bill from Mr. Ferris amounting to £85 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it would be his duty to produce it to the Board with the letter of remittance, and send it to the bankers, Veres and Co., for them to receive the money—he should indorse it first, if it was payable to his order—I have made search for Mr. Ferris's letter, which is said to have enclosed that bill, but have not been able to find it—our letters are put up in separate pigeon-holes, according to the initials—I have searched every where there was a chance of its being—the 13th of December was the day appointed for the prisoner to render up his accounts, and the board to audit them—the prisoner had been apprised of that, and he summoned the members of the committee himself for that purpose in consequence of our orders—he did not attend the committee on the 13th—I did not see him that day at all, nor till he was in custody—he had the custody of the cash-book by virtue of his office—I saw it last on Saturday, the 10th of December, in the board-room—I had it there myself—I do not recollect who gave it to me—it is a necessary book for the ex<lb/>amination of accounts—I never saw it after the prisoner's departure—I have made a diligent search for it, but have not been able to discover it—after the retirement of Mr. Barrett, in July or August 1835, the prisoner under-took the duties of Secretary, combined with his former office—his salary then was 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he lived in the house, and his brother and mother were permitted to reside with him—they left on Monday, the 12th of De<lb/>cember, the day before the audit was fixed.</p>

               <p>committee of Directors generally—I have done it—I do not think I did it before Mr. Barrett ceased to be secretary—the act requires, that the names of the Directors, and shareholders, and secretary shall be registered in the Court of Chancery—that was done I think in July last—there was no appointed secretary then—the deed provides that there should be one—the duties of secretary fell on the prisoner—Mr. Barrett had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as secretary, and resided in the house—the prisoner had 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—I believe Mr. Barrett is now studying for the bar—his uncle is a Director still—I have never asked the prisoner to change a cheque for me—I believe Mr. Barrett has done so—I have never seen it done—I have heard Mr. Barrett say it has been done—I do not know of it having been stated that the prisoner ap<lb/>propriated the cash of the company to change cheques for the Directors—our audits are quarterly—the banker's book, and cash-book, and the general account-books of the office are then produced—it was at the particular re<lb/>quest of the Directors, that the audit in question was appointed for the 13th—there is no fixed audit day—it depends on the pleasure of the Directors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a customer came into the board-room, did not you describe him, and refer to him as your secretary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am not aware of it—I have not noticed any of the directors call him so—Mr. Barrett has been a Director during all my time.</p>

SERGEANT ANDREWS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been the porter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since August, 1833—Mr. Kent and I have differed two or three times—I have complained of him to the Board, and he complained of me the last fortnight—the money that was brought to the counter was given to Mr. Kent—he has got a money-box, a safe, and drawer—when be is not there, Mr. Yardley keeps the money till he comes, and then delivers it up to him—I believe Mr. Yardley was in the office when I brought this money, but I do not recollect—I am positive I gave the money to the prisoner—he did not give it to Mr. Yardley in my presence—it was in bank notes—there was a little cash, I believe—he counted it—he always pulls a little drawer open and puts it in—Mr. Yardley would go to that drawer and put money in if the prisoner was not there—but the prisoner always has the key in his possession—I did not take particular notice of what he did with the 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if the money was right, and turned my back and left his office—I have seen Mr. Barrett, the Director, and the prisoner talking together, and have seen the prisoner give him cash for a draft—Mr. Barrett was in the habit of going into the office on a Saturday night and he has asked the prisoner to cash a cheque for him, as he has said, "I am rather short, and am going into the country"—I have not seen that done very often—once a month was as much as I saw it—I never remember 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being given—I have never seen Mr. Clift, a Director, do the same thing—I have not brought the prisoner cheques to cash for Mr. Clift to my recollection.</p>

I let a lodging to a Mrs. Smith, on the 9th of December—the prisoner came four or five days after—Mrs. Smith said she was her sister, and she resided with her—the last time I saw Mrs. Smith there was on the 21st of January—I did not see her leave—Mrs. Smith wished me to let her stop a few days, till she got her things ready to go to a situation, as she said she had been ill in the Marylebone Infirmary—on the 2nd of February I followed the prisoner up stairs, and she came out of the room and locked the door—I had not seen the things in the room after Mrs. Smith took it—I left them all in the room except the sheet, which I gave the prisoner—that was about three or four days after Smith took the room, that was before the 21st—this is all my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house No. 42, Alsop-terrace, New-road. The prisoners came to lodge there on the 29th of October, 1835, and occu<lb/>pied the back and front parlours on the ground floor—I knew them by the names of Mrs. and Miss Newman—the elder one stated that she was an officer's widow—she did not give any reference—on Sunday, November the 15th, I remember Mrs. Heathcote going out, about one o'clock—the people were coming from church at the time—I went into the front room on the first floor after she was gone, about two o'clock, to draw the windows down, and on the dressing-table I saw what I took to be a box—there were no female servants in my house—we keep none—I and my wife attend to the lodgers—my wife was at home at the time—after going into the bed-room I went down stairs into the kitchen where my wife was—she was busy at the time—about three o'clock the younger prisoner came down and brought down two glasses of wine on a slate—she said we were so very quiet, she did not know what part of the house we were in—she remained in the kitchen, I suppose, from three to five minutes—my wife and I drank the wine—she had never brought us wine down before—they had dined—I believe their dinner was about clearing away about two o'clock—as I was sitting by the side of the fire about five o'clock, I thought I heard the street door open—it was neither light nor dark then—it was getting dark—I did not get off my chair—I merely looked up at the window and saw Miss Newman going down the steps of the front door—I could see that by turning ray head—there is a garden in front of my house—she had a dark cloth cloak on—I had seen the mother wear that cloak before—I did not see the younger prisoner again that evening—on the following morning the loss of the dressing-case was dis-covered—I went to the police-office at Marylebone—a policeman came, and the house was searched, but nothing found—the prisoners' rooms were searched—I did not hear them say any thing—the prisoners remained till the next Wednesday—the younger prisoner said she could not remain any longer under such very disagreeable circumstances.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been married to Mr. Hunter since this transaction—my name at the time in question was Hoseason—I live at No. 23, Grosvenor-street West, Pimlico. In the early part of last year, a gentleman named White, an acquaintance of mine, was in the King's Beach prison—I have not the slightest recollection of what month it was—I went there, and was shown into his room—I found the two prisoners there—I cannot recol<lb/>lect whether there was any other person—I had a reticule in my hand, which contained a diamond ring—I had put it in that morning—my attention was drawn to the ring some time before I entered the prison, when I was in the Strand—it was then safe in the bag—I had not taken it out between the Strand and the King's Bench—when I got into the room in the prison, I left the bag on the table, while I went out to speak to Mr. White—I was not with him long—about five or ten minutes—I do not recollect any one going into the room after I came out—I believe I found the bag on the table when I returned, but I do not remember at all—I staid there three four hours, I think—I do not think I took my bag up till I was going home—I did not miss the ring until some hours after I got home—I have since seen a ring very like it—I suppose it to be mine—this is very like mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I cannot swear to it, but I think it is mine—I was not in the habit of wearing it—I believe it to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of last year I was in the King's Bench prison. The prisoners were inmates of the prison at the time, and I permitted them to use my room for a few days till they got one for them<lb/>selves—I was not in the room when Mrs. Hunter came to see me—I was going up, and I rather think Mrs. Hunter heard me—on my going up near to my door, she came out of my room in my sight, and met me, and I talked to her outside the door, I should think for five or ten minutes—I then went into the room, and found Mrs. Newman and her daughter, but nobody else to my recollection—Mrs. Hunter went in with me—at the time</p>

               <p>we were talking, we were standing close to the door—it is a double door—we were close to the outside door—nobody came in or went out at the door during our conversation—I did not observe any thing on the table when I went into the room—I did not hear any thing said about the bag or ring; (and I should say that the statement I made previously, I find from subsequent conversation I have had,) to be wrong; that the conversa<lb/>tion respecting the loss of the ring was when Mrs. Hunter and her neice came to me the second time; and I should also say I was not aware of the precise time—I know it was early after Christmas—I thought it was the first day of term after Christmas, but I find it must have been March when Mrs. Hunter came—I stated in my deposition that a complaint was made of the loss at the time, but I now find I am in error.</p>

I have the corresponding duplicate to the one produced—it is for three rings pawned on the 21st of September—I was present at the pawning, but did not take them in—it was a smart young person that pawned them—what calls the circumstance to my recollection was a doubt respecting the ring now produced being a diamond one—I had some conv<lb/>erson with the person who took them in, but he has now left our service—that brings the circumstance to my mind, and my impression is that it was the younger prisoner brought them; that is my belief—they were pawned in the name of Julia Newman, No. 8, Fitzroy-place—I have not seen her since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 38, East-street, Red<lb/>lion Square. On the 3rd of January the two prisoners occupied a furnished lodging at my house—they left on the 14th of February, saying they were going to Liverpool, on business—they were going that night to the Bull and Mouth, as they were going off next morning early—about half an hour after they left I missed two spoons, some glasses, decanters, and other things—on the 16th, two days afterwards, the elder prisoner called at my house to see if there was a letter come—I told her I had missed some things—she said she dare say they were taken away by is take, and if I would come the next day, I should have them—she did not say where they were gone to, but I had learnt where they were gone to, and I had got a constable from Hatton-garden: he came by my house at the time she was talking to me, and he and I followed her to where she went, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183702270138"/>
               <p>was No. 25, Hyde-street, Bloomsbury—I went into the house to the se<lb/>cond floor back room—the elder prisoner went in first, and the constable and I went in after her—I found the younger prisoner there, and a gentle<lb/>man named Cousins, the witness—he told me I ought to be ashamed of myself to bring a constable there to respectable people—he did not tell me who he was, but he used to visit at my house when they lodged there, and Miss Newman said he was her uncle, but not in his presence—he never said he was related to them—I said, I had missed my things—Miss New<lb/>man said I was welcome to look, as she had nothing at all belonging to me, and they opened some boxes—they left the room several times to go into the little room adjoining, and the younger prisoner told me to come into that room, and look myself—when I got into that room she opened a box or two, and pulled her things out, and asked me to look—the elder prisoner was present—I found nothing of mine in those boxes—the elder prisoner went out into the big room, and went out at the door to go into the passage, the officer fetched her back, and she had got the rummer con<lb/>cealed down by the side of her—I identified it directly as being mine—the younger prisoner said her mother had only taken it out to drink—I after-wards found one of my tumblers in a small box wrapped up in paper—the box stood in the large room—after that the officer told me to go and look in the bed-room, and I turned the bed things up—the decanter was rolled up in something, and put under the bed—when the things were found, the younger prisoner said, "By G—d the things are mine, I bought them at Liverpool"—Mr. Cousins was there at the time—he laid a sovereign down on the table in their presence for me to say no more about it—he said, I ought to be ashamed to bring an officer there to respectable people, and he did not think any thing of the kind had happened, and told me to take it and say no more, and that would pay me for my loss of my glasses—he did not say then, "Say no more about it."</p>

On Friday evening, the 10th of February, about half-past six o'clock, I was in Pitfield-street, and saw both the prisoners round the prosecutor's shop, close against the window—I watched them for half an hour, and then saw Lane cross from the other one, and go to Mr. Butcher's shop—he put his hand into the glass, and drew the print out of the window—he then put it underneath his coat, and turned into Queen-street, where he took it from under his coat—I ran to secure him—he dropped it and ran away—Chap<lb/>man was on the opposite side of the way, looking over at him, and dodging from one window to the other, while he took it, to see if any body was coming—when Lane ran off I saw nothing more of Chapman, till last Friday, when he was secured in this Court—I followed Lane, and saw him stopped by a man, and given into custody of an officer—I directly re<lb/>turned to where the print was dropped, and found a man had picked it up and taken it to Mr. Butcher—I took it from him at the station-house, and it appeared the same piece of print—it was quite wet when I found it, and the ground was wet—it had been raining.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and am daughter of John Parsons, a carpenter in Ball-alley, Long-alley. I was on my way home from Crown-street on Wednesday, the 1st of March, and when I toned the corner into Long-alley I missed my shawl—I did not feel it taken off—I did not drop it—Mrs. Bowyer came up to me and gave me inform<lb/>ation—I went up to the prisoner William Chappell, and asked him for my shawl—he called roe a bad name, and struck me in my stomach—Mrs. Milward came and spoke to him, and he told her I was his sister; she then went away, and my mother came up—I saw him throw my shawl on the pavement to the female prisoner, and she picked it up—when my mother came up she dropped it, and Mrs. Bowyer picked it up—I met the officer and he took the prisoners into custody—this is my shawl.</p>

I do not recollect him"—he said, "Not recollect him?—he lives a few doors off, at the timber yard"—in consequence of that representation, I trusted him with the flannel, and he went away with it—about twenty minutes after nine o'clock in the evening he came again, and said he wanted ten yards more, and that Mr. Wheeler would be such a customer as I had not tad for some time; that he usually bought flannel for Mr. Wheeler at a house in King-street, and the last quantity was seventy yards; and he said to me, "You did not follow me"—I said, "No; if I suspected you, should have let you known"—he talked so much about Mr. Wheeler, and saying he was a relation, that I let him have ten yards, but I sus<lb/>pected it was not right—I asked him when I was to have the money; whether I was to fetch it—he said I could do as I liked; I could make oat the bill—I intended to go with him—he said Mr. Wheeler would not he at home till to-morrow morning—I put the flannel up, and let him go with it—I followed him, and finding he went by Mr. Wheeler's premises, I gave him in charge.</p>

On Thursday night, the 9th of February, I had a dispute with my brother, inconsequence of which I went out to walk about to seek for a fresh lodging—I went down Stratford, and as I returned, about a quarter to one o'clock, I saw the four prisoners going down the Abbey-lane towards the back part of Mr. Brown's house—they all four had hats on—when I was going to the fish-market next morning, about half past six o'clock, I saw them again coming out of Petticoat-lane, facing Butcher-row, Whitecbapel—that is two miles and three quarters from Mr. Brown's house—Fisher was then without a hat on—the others had hats on.</p>

On the morning of Friday, the 21st of January, I heard from my servant that one of my horses was gone—it was taken between Thursday night and Friday morning—the field it had been in was fenced all round—I saw the field next day, and from the appearance of it I believe it was impossible for one person to take the horse out of the field, the nature of the horse was such, and the fence was so deep—it had no shoes on at the time it was taken—I had had it about thirteen years—I never saw the prisoner about my place—in consequence of information, I went to a gentleman named Abbott—I discovered my horse on the 30th of January, walking along the street, in London, and took possession of it—I scertained that it was in Abbott's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Norwood. The deceased, Emery Haywood, had lodged with me twelve months, and was twenty-five yean old—on Monday, the 23rd of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought him home—they walked together, and did not seem in ill humour with each other—I went into the room, and Haywood's wife came down with a candle—the prisoner said, "Is this your husband?"—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "Then I desire you to keep him at home"—he then went away, and just as he got out at the door, he called Haywood out, and said to him, "Now you mind, don't let me see you on my premises any more"—Haywood and his wife then went up stairs—I went up also—I picked two shots out of his back, but they were very small—he complained of having been wounded—I did not learn that any body had been present when he received the injury—there were some shots round his loins, but I could not get at them—he did not go to work that week—he went to work on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes<lb/>day and on Wednesday night he was confined to his bed—he died on saturday morning, the 4th of February.</p>

On the 23rd of February this piece of lead was cut off in the shop by Langham, and the pipe was taken out in the morning at breakfast time—this piece of short lead was taken out at dinner time—I took out the piece of pipe by Langham's persuasion, and he took the other out to Mrs. Hunt's shop—I never saw any thing of this other lead that I know of, but Langham told me this piece of pipe came from the Harrow-road—I went to Mrs. Hunt's—she asked my name, and where I lived, and I told her—Langham sold the lead—I cannot say for how much; but after he got the money he asked her what she would have to drink, but she did not have any thing—that was at dinner time.</p>

I was on duty between seven and eight o'clock in Bermondsey-street, on Wednesday, the 22nd of February—a man came and told me something—in consequence of that I went after the prisoner, and found him, with these two boxes on his back—I asked where he got them from—he immediately threw them down and ran away—I took them.</p>
