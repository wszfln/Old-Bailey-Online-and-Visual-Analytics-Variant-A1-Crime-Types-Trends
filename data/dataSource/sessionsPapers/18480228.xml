Barclay's recently—he said no, he did not recollect having done it at all, or if he had it was a very long time ago—I asked him if he should know his own writing, and produced the three receipts—he examined them, and said they were his writing, and he had received the money for the casks—I asked what he had done with the money—he said he had given it to Arnall, excepting the porterage, which he kept for himself—I had him taken to the station—I knew Arnall well—I went to the Talbot—he had left—I found him in bed, at his lodging, in the Mint, at twelve o'clock at night—he said, "I suppose you are come about those casks?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Would not the morning have done for this?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I suppose I am to go to the station?"—I said, "Yes, Bishop is there"—I asked what he had done with the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he received of Bishop for the casks—he said he had given part of it to a man named Bash<lb/>ford, and had kept the rest himself.</p>

                  </hi> I am messenger at the General Post-office. On the morning of 1st Feb., about nine o'clock, I was on duty in the Inland-office—the prisoner was employed there, sorting letters to go by the morning mail—he sat at a table—I saw a letter on his left side—he threw his handkerchief over it, and then put the handkerchief into his right trowsers pocket—there was no letter then—I went round the office, returned in about half an hour, and saw him put another letter under his left arm, which was along the edge of the table, not toughing it—after he had sorted all the letters in his left hand, he pushed the letter out of sight, under some French newspapers—he then put his hand under the newspapers, moved it, drew it out, and put it into his left breeches pocket—I could not see anything in his hand—I told the president on duty.</p>

               <p>remember the defendant and Miss Field coming there to be married on 19th June—the banns had been previously published, on 23rd and 30th May, and 6th June—it was not the invariable practice for the clerk to make the entry in the register-book before the marriages were solemnized—I believed the law does not require it, but it is sometimes done, as a matter of convenience, if the clergyman has not come, not to keep the parties waiting—after the mar<lb/>riage was solemnized I distinctly read out the entry in the register-book to the parties, in the form as entered by the clerk—it is a legal form, that we are obliged to go through; we have no discretion—"Samuel Brown, of full age, gentleman, 31, Wimpole-street; father's name, George Brown, farmer, de<lb/>ceased; is that correct?" and the answer given me was, "Yes"—I then proceeded to the second line, "Esther Field, of full age, spinster; father's name, James Field, farmer, deceased;" to which I also received an assenting answer, before either of the parties or myself signed it—I could not swear that Miss Field gave the answer herself, but my impression is that she did—an assent was decidedly given me whilst I held the pen in my hand, and before I affixed my signature—both parties were present—Brown answered his own line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he answer the second line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, an answer was given me, and my impression is that it was the answer of Miss Field—if there was not an assent in words, there was an assenting bow—I cannot so completely charge my memory as to whether Brown spoke, and the lady bowed, but an answer was given in the affirmative—had there been any doubt on my mind I should not have signed it—a most unequivocal assent was given, and upon that I and the parties signed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you recollect at what time you arrived at the vestry that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the parties were in the vestry on my arrival—I was seat for to my own residence, which is generally the case—the entry had been prepared by the clerk, as he generally does—it is his duty to take it down from the parties mouths themselves—I take all the pains I can to ascertain that these matters are correct, by inquiring of both the parties after the mar<lb/>riage—it is the decided impression on my mind that Esther Field gave the answer that was peculiarly for her to answer, but I will not swear it—the decided impression was that she assented—it might be by a bow—when I inquired, "Is this correct?"—there was a bow, which carried an assent, to my mind, because ladies do not always answer—they are sometimes a little nervous on these occasions.</p>

               <p>that he told a clergyman, who he went to see for the purpose of informa<lb/>tion as to the course he should pursue as to solemnization of the marriage, that Miss Field was under age—I believe he mentioned the clergyman's name, nut O do not remember it—he said that the clergyman told him that the young lady being under age, the consent of her guardians would be neces<lb/>sary to the marriage, but he (Brown) telling him that they wished to be married without the knowledge of her guardians, he said the only course they could adopt would be to have the banns published—he told me that he had had the banns published—he said he attended on the first Sunday, and heard them published—I have no recollection of his saying anything about attending beyond that once—he said, that on his return from London, after giving the clerk direction for the publication of the banns, he showed to miss field a paper, which he verily believed she thought was a marriage license—he said it was a certificate which is given when the arty gives an order for the pub<lb/>lication of banns—he said that be doubled back a portion of the paper upon which the word "banns" was written, for the purpose of leading her to sup<lb/>pose it was marriage license, and not a certified of banns.</p>

I went to bed about eleven o'clock—there are two rooms in the house, one up and one down stairs—I slept up stairs—the house was all fastened, the door locked, and the window in the lower room shut when I went to bed—after I had been in bed some time I heard a rumbling noise, and my room door pushed open—I sat up in bed, looked on the stairs, and saw the prisoner standing on the stairs opposite to me—there was a gas-light in the court, and my candle, which was on the floor by the side of the bed, was just going out, but it gave a little light—he immediately rushed on the bed—I said, "George, do not murder me"—I felt a cut about my neck, and then a continual weight that kept me down, and a stabbing, mostly in my arms—he kept on for three or four minutes—I did not struggle, I had no power—after a little time I rallied and sat up in bed, and saw him go down stairs—I got up and pulled the bedstead against the door, for fear he should come up again, and then I opened the window and called out "Murder!" and "Police!"—the light went out just as I got out of bed—a neighbour named Sadler came, and I told him to send my son—my son answered me and came in at the lower window—a person from the outside could pull down the window and get into the room—I had been the prisoner the morning before, between nine and ten—he came to see about my daughter—I knew very well they were acquainted—he had called several times before that about my daughter, and I told him I did not know where she was—he called again between eleven and twelve—I said my daughter was not there, and I knew nothing about her—I had sent her out of the way—I told him not to come tormenting me, I had trouble enough—he went away, and as he went from the door he said, "You may tell her to say her prayers, for when I meet with her I will murder her," or "kill her," or something similar to that—he had said before that my daughter had got his address—I asked him if that was not the case—he said, "Yes'—I said, "Then she had better write to you without your coming <hi rend="italic">magging</hi> me"—I said it was somewhere in the Hackney-road, and he said, "Yes, that was the address"—my husband's name is Andrew Robinson Wilkes.</p>

On the morning of 21st Jan., shortly after on o'clock, I heard cries of "Murder!"—I paid little attention, thinking they proceeded from the house of a quarrelsome neighbour—the cries continued, and I opened the window—I ultimately went to my mother's house—the lower room window was open, the street-door was fastened—I entered at the window, and when I was in the lower room I heard my mother calling from above that George had been there and murdered her—I went up, the bedstead or something was placed against the door—I forced it and it and entered the room—it was dark, and I could not see my mother—I let a policeman in, and by his light discovered that my mother was bleeding—her clothes, the bedclothes, and floor were very bloody—I have seen the prisoner once or twice before—I knew there was some acquaintance between my sister and him, by the name of George—I did not know him by any other name—I fetched Dr. Broadwater.</p>

                  </hi> I am terasurer of the Society of British Artists, which was incorporated last year. I have been treasurer since then—we have a gallery in Suffolk-street, Pall-mall—artists and their paintings there to be exhibited and sold—we have fixed terms on which we receive them—we sell them at five per cent. commission to out-door artists; that is, those who are not members of the Art-Union, and two and a half per cent. for those who are—a great number of paintings are sent for sale—the prisoner was employed by the society—the secretary employs the servants, the prisoner received his instructions from him—I do not recollect whether the terms of his engage<lb/>ment were sent to him in writing—I understood there was a written agree<lb/>ment; that a letter was sent to him from the secretary to employ him—he was employed as a servant—the minutes of the society are entered in a book—the secretary generally makes those entries—I do not know whether any instructions were communicated to the prisoner, except what are in this book—I understood the secretary had given him instructions—there are no printed rules connected with the prisoner's duty—he received his instructions from the society—he was employed in the gallery, during last season, for the sale of pictures—I saw him sell pictures from time to time—the price of these pictures would be entered by him in a book—I know of his selling pictures in the gallery during last season—he would enter the sale of those pictures in the books kept by the Art-Union Society—this is the price catalogue (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is in the prisoner's writing—No. 308 is "A Rock Scene, near Simon's Yat, in Monmouthshire," by J. Tennant; it is booked in the catalogue, in the prisoner's writing, fifty guineas—No. 563 in the printed catalogue is, "The First Venture," by W. Shayer; the price of it in the price catalogue, in the prisoner's writing, is thirty-five guineas—No. 435 in the printed catalogue is, "A Scene on Sevenoaks Common after a Storm," by Henry Boddington; the price of it, in the prisoner's writing, is thirty-five guineas—this other book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the register of works sold—No. 308 is "A Rock Scene, near Simon's Yat, in Monmouthshire," purchased by A. Boetefeur, Esq.; the prize in the Art-Union—it does not say the amount—No. 563, "The First Venture," by W. Winter, Esq., prize in the Art-Union—No. 435, "Scene on Sevenoaks Common after a Storm," by H. Hillier, Esq.; a prize in the Art-Union—this other book is a register of what the works are sold at—it is in the prisoner's writing in this book—No. 308 is, "J.

(<hi rend="italic">producing it.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; these cata<lb/>logues are published by the return made from the catalogue of the Art-Union—I imagine they take the prices of the pictures from the price-catalogues; and there 192 appears to be sold at 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no book of ours which would enable the catalogue to state that it sold for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think either of the gentlemen are here who put in these pictures—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is Mr. Hassetts' writing—he was the former secretary—the present secretary is Mr. Flint—he is not here—I believe none of the artists are here whose pictures the prisoner is alleged to have sold, and as to the sale of which he is alleged to have pout any money into his pocket—I am an artist—I think I painted two or three years ago, a picture, which I called "The Head of a Greek Boy"—I cannot recollect to whom I sold it—I think I have heard of a gentleman of the name of Bone, of Devonport—I might have sold it to him for seventeen guineas—it was sold in the gallery, to my knowledge—I do not recollect that I sold it over again, not the same picture, it is a common prac<lb/>tice to make a copy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in point of fact, send a copy to Mr. Bone, and send the original to the second purchaser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been the case, if they are painted by the same hand—I acted according to custom—I did it deli<lb/>berately—I think the second was the best of the two—the picture the first gentleman bought, he saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not sell to him a picture he saw, for seventeen guineas, after<lb/>wards sell the same picture to another man for ten guineas, and send Mr. Bone a copy, which you painted afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was painted at the same time, I consider, or thereabout—I may have painted a picture which I put in the Society for sale, and sold it to Mr. Bone for seventeen guineas, and afterwards sent it to a second purchaser for ten guineas; and afterwards painted another for the original, which I sent to Mr. Bone—I think it was so—at the last season, for 1847, I sold a picture to Sir Thomas Phillips, for ten guineas—I had another picture in the society at the same time, called "Dividing the Spoil," priced at 200 guineas—Sir Thomas Phillips agreed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184802280056"/>
               <p>for that—I had not received the money for the first picture of the Greek boy before I transferred it to another customer—I do not think I received a deposit on it—I do not recollect it—I had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Sir Thomas Phil<lb/>lips on the small picture—I contracted to sell him the large one for 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he sent to me afterwards to ask me to take it back, as it was not conve<lb/>nient for him to pay for it—I did not afterwards go to the prisoner and ask him to alter the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit which I had received for the 10<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> picture, to the other picture, that I might enforce the sale of it—I merely asked whether the 2<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> could not be considered a deposit for the two pictures—that might be after Sir Thomas Phillips wanted to be off his bargain—I asked the pri<lb/>soner whether he did not receive it for the two pictures—I considered it was on them—this letter contains the terms and conditions on which the prisoner was appointed to his office—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>,"He shall immediately communicate to any artist whose work are for sale, any offer that may be made of a price less than that inserted in the price-catalogue, and act on their instructions as to the sale of such works." "Sir,—On the other side I forward you a sketeb of the duties to be required of you for the office of keeper; you will perhaps be kind enough to produce the same at your next visit to the gallery on Monday next, should the members wish you to read the same before them")—the artists regulate the price of their own pictures; though they are put in at any price, the artist may reduce it to what he likes—one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being sold for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is an unusual instance—there was a picture put for 150 guineas, and sold 80 guineas—if a picture at 100 guineas sells for 20 guineas, with the consent of the artist, the society is only entitled to commission on what it is sold for.</p>

Feb., about ten o'clock in the evening, I was crossing Hyde-park with James Young, and saw the prisoners with a gang under a tree, about twenty yards from the path—the prisoners came up to us—they attacked Young, wanted his money, knocked his hat off, and kicked it about—Miles said, "Money we want, and money we will have"—I said they would have none from me—Miles struck me on the nose, put his hand into my pocket, took my handkerchief, put it into his jacket pocket, and they ran away together—my nose bled—we ran after the prisoners, and never lost sight of them—a policeman took them—we gave them in charge—my handkerchief has not been found.</p>

               <p>you say if she had not got any money she would lend her things; more fool her. No young man would make me do such a thing, except it was for some good motive; but I think, if any young man wished a young woman well, and his meaning is good to her, he would not wish anything of that kind from her. Henry, for you or any other young man, I would not do such things; and if you are not ashamed of it, I am; as I never can give you aught. Look back since Christmas how much you had from me; and so, if that is all the love you have for me, I do not care for such love, I know you care more for that young woman than you do for me, because she can give you more money than I can: she gets it easier than I can. She does not get it in service. You know it very well, that no other man but you had my company since you wished for my company; but you can please yourself, and go and see her or any other young woman that can give you more than I have; but please to give me back what you have of mine, that is, two books and the pencil that you have; but I wish to see you once more, to part friendly. You had the face to tell me one day that I could not do without you or other men. I have done before, and I know I can do now; but I am sure you cannot do without a woman. Henry, do not be afraid to face me once more, for the last time, and write to me here. I home she will be more kind to you than what I have been. One day you had the face to tell me that I had done nothing to what some had. I <hi rend="italic">done all what</hi> lay in my power, and I am not going to do what they do to raise you some money. I did not let you do what you liked to me because I thought of getting some money, no! but it was because I kindly loved you; and what did you say to me in the park the last evening? I little thought that I should have to write such a letter to you as this Henry our case will be a warning for others; you will see what kind love means soon, Henry; but do not be afraid, I am not going to do anything to you; all I wish for you to do is, to see you once more. When I asked you on Sunday if I should see you next Sunday, you said, 'It all depends;' but you did not say what, but I can think what. If you like to come next Sunday, at half-past six o'clock, I shall be able to go out then. We can make it the last time to see one another; but please to let me know, as I must tell mistress in time that I want to go out at that time; and if you have not get a penny, as you say, you can send your letter without paying for it. I hope I have said enough for you to think what your <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> are to me. No more. God bless you! Do not forget what I told you.

               <p>assure you you will not make a fool of others; you know what I mean by that; but if I know your heart is with me, I shall then be happy, and I shall not care what I do for you. Anything that you want done, say so; with the greatest pleasure I will do anything for you. My dear Henry, I cannot, get to see you to-night, it is so foggy. I am very glad you are not upon guard to-night. I hope it will not be foggy to-morrow night, Wednesday night I mean. I will go to see you. Be one the look-out about seven o'clock, as you wished me to go. Dear Henry, when you wrote your letter you had no love to send me. Perhaps you send it to another; but I hope not. Now I have sent you my best love. I hope these few lines will find you in good health, as they leave me to-night, thank God for it. Dear Henry farewell! May Heaven watch over your health, and speedily conduct you to the arms of your faithful and affectionate and loving girl, <hi rend="smallCaps">ANNETTE MEYERS."</hi>)—("10, Northumberland-street, Sunday afternoon. My dear Henry—this comes with my kind love for you. I hope you are better, still better than you were last Thursday, when I received your letter, and I have answered it the same night, for you to have my letter on Friday morning, and I thought I should have had an answer from you yester<lb/>day, but my lookings were all in vain. I hope you had my letter on Friday. I have sent you the postage stamps and an envelope too that you asked for, and I hope I have not said anything to affront you; if I have, I did not know it; perhaps you will tell me if I have, Do please to favour me with a few lines, and tell me if you are better, and if you had my letters, and when you think you will come out. Oh, Henry! I wish we had a home of our own, then I could nurse you, and soon well, and cheer you up. Oh! Henry, if that happy day <hi rend="italic">do</hi> ever come, oh! how happy we shall be, with the blessing of God—with the blessing of God, I hope that day will come when we may meet to part no more, till death parts us. Henry, I should like to know you thoughts upon that matter of business—I wish I could read in your heart to know your thoughts about it—do open your heart at once and tell me—do not deceive me, dear Henry, you know I have heard a great many things about you, but you see I have not believed one of them; we will forget all that has passed, and think of what is to come—all is past and ended, we will learn to be more wise. Dear Henry, I am going to Eaton-square this evening and I am going to leave this letter as I pass at your barracks, for you to have it to-morrow morning; then, I hope I shall have an answer on Tuesday morn<lb/>ing, if all is well. Dear Henry, I hope those things you have got of mine are quite safe. Dear Henery, my cold has been very bad, but it is better to<lb/>day, thank God. I cannot write any more this time, but with love to you. Do write, dear Henry. Yours, most affectionately, <hi rend="smallCaps">ASSETTE METERS.</hi>")</p>

                  </hi> I am an attorney, and reside at Ryde, in the Isle of Wight. I am concerned for a family named Charsley, and for Miss Mary Ann Charsley, in the receipt of some interest money, payable to her half-yearly—on 23rd Jan. I enclosed this bill of exchange to her—it then had no indorsement or acceptance—it was a ten days' bill—I put a note from my wife into the enclosure, addressed to Miss Mary Ann Charsley—I also wrote a letter when I enclosed the bill—I afterwards heard that it had miscarried before I heard from Miss Charsley, and wrote to the authorities—in conse<lb/>quence of what I learned, I saw the prisoner, William Edwards, on 4th Feb., the day the bill became due, at the Portugal Hotel, in custody—Rowe and Tucker were with him—they told me he was come to explain about this bill—I told the prisoner at the first to take care what he said, because if it should prove hereafter that he did not satisfactorily account to me, I should take advantage of anything he said; and in the course of this conversation, with respect to Miss Charsley, he said that she had gone by the name of Underwood, that she had represented that she expected some money from a Captain Butt, and had requested him to get this bill changed for her; that he had done so, and taken back the money—he asked whether he might not arrange with Mr. Tucker—he would give him any security he liked, and that of course he die not know whether it was all right—I saw Charlotte Edwards the day after, 5th Feb., as I was coming out of Guildhall, from the examination—she stopped me, and said, "Captain Butt, I believe?"—I said, "No"—she said, "I thought I had seen you"—I said, "My name is Butt, not Captain Butt"—that was all, and I walked away—I was present at the examination, and acted as attorney for the prosecution—after I had made a statement, and asked for a remand, the Alderman asked Edwards, "What have you to say?"—he said, "I received it of a Miss Mary Ann Charsley, who lived at our house"—his Worship then said, Have you any witness?"—he said, "Yes, I have two, my mother and the servant"—they came forward—Char<lb/>lotte Edwards was examined—no note was taken of her evidence—the ser<lb/>vant, Mary Leeson, was then examined by his Worship—after I had cross-examined her a considerable time, my evidence and that of another, sufficient for a remand, was taken, and it was remanded to the 12th—the case was then gone into at considerable length, and his Worship again adjourned case to the 19th, with directions for the mother and Mary Leeson to be summoned, as they were not present—on 19th, I brought more witnesses, and Mary Leeson was produced and put up—I asked her some questions, and in the course of them Mr. Charnock, who then acted for the prisoner, objected to my ques<lb/>tions, because I was cross-examining my own witness—I never heard of such a person as Captain Butt—I should say there was certainly not such a person in Ryde.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to my father, who is a discount agent, carrying on business at 37, Nicholas-lane. I know both the prisoners—the male prisoners is a cattle-dealer—I have been at his house—I was not intimately acquainted with him—I met him casually in Cheapside, I think on 25th Jan.—I do not know the day of the week—it was about two o'clock—he said he had got a check, which he had been to the City to collect, but found it was not payable for several days—I desired him to let me see it—he did so, and I found it was this bill—I told him it was not a check, but a bill, which had to be accepted by Jones, Lloyd, and Co., and afterwards endorsed by Miss Charsley, and if he would get it so endorsed I would give him the cash for it—I then desired him to return with me to Jones, Lloyd, and Co., as I was passing there—he did so, and he saw me put it into the acceptance-box—I wrote out a copy for him to present next day to the clerk for it, and told him to get it endorsed, and then bring it to me—he did so the next day, the 26th, and I gave him the money for it—he did not bring it me after it was accepted, and before it was endorsed—I am quite sure of that—I asked him what he would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> for it, and he said, "Anything that is usual, Miss Charsley will pay for it"—laughingly said to him, "Well, will you give me a sovereign?"—he said, "Yes, certainly"—I took it to messrs.

Boyd's—he said, "I have done no such thing; I did not</p>

                  </hi> I am warehouseman in the calico department of Messrs. John and Christopher Boyd. The prisoner was their porter for two or three years—he had access to their warehouse—here is a mark on this calico—the width of it is thirty-five inches; the length was fifty-two yards—it is marked with the manufacturer's mark—these pieces are, in my judgment, part of one entire piece—to the best of my judgment these two fag<lb/>ends are off the same piece—here is a selvedge and the blue ends—this is the book in which we enter all the articles sold to any persons in employ of the firm—I make entries in it—it goes back nearly three years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Boyd would not consider it right if they purchase a large amount—I never knew of any limit—I cannot say whether the prisoner has pur<lb/>chased from 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—he has purchased calico, I only know that from the books—I do not remember his making purchases—I have never served him, not seen him served, to my knowledge—I have never seen him take away goods—I know nothing about selling this piece—the worth of this whole piece would be about 17<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>—it is 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—he could have bought it at that price—it has been cut into pieces—I do not know that he has bought 150 yards of this calico within twelve months—here is one</p>

"You must be foolish; you may as well have anything for your own use when you want it"—I was taken into custody—I said to the prisoner, when I was in the library, "How came you by the handkerchiefs"—he said, "That is nothing; you say you bought them in a sale in the Borough, and that will clear you"—when I was in the Compter I told the prisoner I was uneasy, and wanted to tell the truth—he said, "You must be foolish; you are sure to get off"—I said, "What am I to do then?"—he said, "You will not be ale to get a character; you cannot get a situation where you are known: I will give you the money to take you abroad, that is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the handkerchiefs he spoke about were two that I was charged with stealing—they</p>

The prisoner has been clerk there some time—Hurton lodged in my house—he was cashier up to about 1st Jan.—the prisoner was appointed to collect the rent of a house eight or nine months ago—he came to me on 1st Feb., and said that Hurton's accounts were very imperfect—I do not recollect that he had come to me before that—I said, "Go to him about it"—I believe I was present on 18th Jan.—I remember Mr. Begant coming to pay some rent—I</p>

               <p>think the prisoner asked me if I would take it—I said, "No, I shall not takt it; it is not part of my duty to take money"—I said he had better keep it—Hurton was at home ill then, and I think he was cashier then—I under<lb/>stood he was cashier till the time he left, about 27th or 28th Jan.—I do not remember Mr. Burt coming to pay his rent—I remember the prisoner saying, about a week after he left the office, that Mr. Burt had come to pay his rent, and he had 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him—ge did not say that on 19th Jan.—I did not know for nearly a week that he had received that money—I do not remember the firm being very pressing about Watt's rent—I have nothing to do with the cash payments—I think the prisoner left about the beginning of Feb.—he never wrote to me—he came to my house, I think, on the evening of 8th Feb., more like a mad man than a sane man—he said he had received some money, and had been robbed—he produced a portion of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the number had been corn off—he wished me to acquaint the firm—I said, of course if he wished it I must do it—I told him about the beginning of Feb. that the firm desired Oliver's account to be made up—I was directed to make out the bill of costs—I told Walker I was going to make out the bill, and the prisoner came to em with a bit for paper in his hand, and said there was some<lb/>thing wrong about it with Hurton—I told him, to go to him about it.</p>

On Wednesday night, 23rd Feb., I left the chapel locked up safe—the vestry door was locked, and all the property within was safe—I went there again about nine o'clock on Thursday morning—the vestry had then been broken into, the plate-chest broken open, and a chalice, two pat<lb/>tens, or salvers, and two cups, which were used for the purposes of the Church, taken from it—the poor-box in the chapel had been broken open, and a little money taken from it—three cassocksm a gown, and two scarfs were also gone, and some money, out of a small cupboard.</p>

On Thursday, 24th Feb., I went to West-street Episcopal Chaple—the outer door was not broken open—at the vestry door the door<lb/>post had been worked away by a chisel, or some sharp instrument, which allowed the box of the lock to be forced back, with a little pressure, and the door to Come open—there were marks of its having been forced—I afterwards went to Compton-street and High-street, and saw the three prisoners walking up High-street together—I got out of the way, as well as I could, into a pawnbroker's shop, and as they came by I beard Welch say to either or both of them, "Now don't be a b—y month, and I will wait for you"—they went on, and Welch waited close by there—I lost sight of the other two and of Welch, for a minute—I them fetched West and another constable, and when we came to the end of Compton-street I saw Robins coming down on the opposite side—where he saw me he ran up a court—I ran after him, and said I wanted him—West came, and took him into custody—I then came out of the court, and Davis was passing by with this handkerchief, which I afterwards found contained nearly all the plate—the handle of the chalice was aticking out of the handkerchief, through an opening—it was not tide up very closely—whether he saw us or not I cannot say, but he turned into a shop close by there—I went to him, and told him I wanted him for stealing the communion<lb/>plate in West street—he said he knew nothing about it, and commenced fighting with me very violently—I ultimately secured him, and handed him over to another constable—I then went into a barber's shop, at the corner of Hampshire Hog<lb/>yard, where I saw Welch standing, and said I wanted him for being concerned with Davis and Robins in stealing, the communion<lb/>plate in West-street—after conveying him to the station-house, I went to 27, Compton-street, to the back room, third floor, and there found the remnants of two surplices, these three letter<lb/>bags, and other property—I had seen Robins go into that house once previously—I believe they are his discharged at the station-house—Robins stated at the station that she was his wife—West also found a great number of things there.</p>

Mr. Hammond came to me on 18th Jan.—he marked some money in my presence, and it was given to Mrs. Gladwell—next evening I watched near Mr. Hammond's shop till Mrs. Glad<lb/>well came out—Mr. Hammond then called me in and gave the prisoner in custody—I found on him money in different parcels, and seven sovereigns loose in his coat pocket—he said he had got the money from his lodgers—I found in the desk two half-sovereigns and one sovereign wrapped in this piece of brown paper—one of the half-sovereigns is one that was marked in my presence—I afterwards went to his house with Mr. Hammond, and searched it—I found there 137<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, and a silver three-halfpenny piece—he money was all done up in different bags in an iron chest—after I returned from the prisoner's house, I looked at the mat on which he had been standing at the prosecutor's but found nothing there.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Prosect-place, Hornsey—I am in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company, as inspector of works. On 8th Feb. I observed that some posts had been removed from their stations on the railway—I gave directions to John Mattison—I afterwards went with a policeman to the prisoner's house, which is near the railway—the policeman went first—in about five minutes he came to me, and I went into the house—I found a quantity of timber in a room on the first floor—I found a piece of deal scantling, five oak fencing-posts, some fir boards, and some scaffold planking—one piece is marked "T. B."—the contractor for the railway is Mr. Thomas Brassey—I found four large fencing<lb/>rails in the cellar, and some pieces of posts—I know the property of the Company pretty well—all these were articles that were on the railway—I saw from four hundred of five hundred bricks in the cellar, which had the same marks as the bricks of the Company—I had been in the prisoner's house on 12th Nov.—these articles were not there then.</p>

               <p>from Mr. Gayman, and on 8th Feb. I saw a little boy, named Wilks, bring a post off the railway to where he was living, which was at the prisoner's house—I went there with a policeman, knocked at the door, and inquired for Mrs. Willks—the policeman rushed in, and demanded the piece of timber—she said there was none brought in there—I said there was, and said some<lb/>thing about the boy—the prisoner came to the door presently afterwards, and inquired what we wanted—the policeman said, "The piece of timber"—he said there was none brought there—I said there was—he said if there was he would reprimand the boy, and send him off next morning—the mother called the boy, and said, "Was any timber brought in?"—he said there was—the policeman said, "Bring it out at the front door"—the prisoner said it should be taken out at the back—we were not inside, the door was ajar—we asked the prisoner to let us in—he said we should not go in—he resisted letting us in for about ten minutes, he pushed against the door—another policeman came up, and we pushed from without—we succeeded in getting in, and took the two boys and the prisoner to the station—we went back about eight o'clock, and searched the house—we went up into the rooms, and found a great quantity of timber and rails, and the post was brought out at the back door by the boy—there were some rails in the room, some in the cellar, a quantity of bricks, and some hoops—as far as I saw, the property belonged to Mr. Brassey—I had seen property of that description at Mr. Brassey's—I saw this form there—it has "T. B." on it; that is the way his boards are marked—I cannot swear to the bricks—these two oval hoops, and one round one, were in the cellar—they are such as were on the railway.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 29th Jan., between three and four o'clock, I saw the prisoners and another boy talking together at the corner of the mews—one of them threw some snow, and ran round the corner—they said, "Let us snow-ball him"—they came back again, then left, and all went round the corner again—I afterwards saw them again all together, and the one who is not here was carrying a till, which I knew was Mr. Cranfield's, by having seen it in the shop—the one who is not here gave it to Plowman, who ran, put it down on the ground, turned the money out of it into his cap, and threw the till over some palings—they then all ran down Camden-place together—a boy named Stone came—I told him where the till was, and he got over the fence, and brought it—we took it to Mr. Cranfield's—I did not see the prisoners again till they were in custody—I am as sure of them—I knew them before.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, between two and a quarter-past two o'clock, I went there—the prisoner opened the door, and said Mr. Neble was out, and the landlady had left her in charge of the house—I waited, and Mr. Neble came in in about five minutes—the prisoner spoke to him on the stairs, and then went down stairs—I do not know whether she went out—I went up stairs—I went down about three o'clock, and the door was open—it was shut after I was let in—I did not see the prisoner again that afternoon.</p>

               <p>to London, and introduce you to the parties, in order to bring them down"—he called on me about two o'clock on the Tuesday, 1st Feb., and we went to<lb/>wards the wharf where we were to embark—before we got there, he said, "We will ca on Mr. James, I want to see him"—he is a watchmaker—I went with him into James's house, and he said he was going to London, and wanted the direction of a Dr. Penny—Mr. James said he would give it him, and he got his book, and wrote the direction—Mr. James went away into the shop or up stairs, and Burlton said, "There are five is watches there, and there are plenty more up stairs, which I shall take; this is one that we must <hi rend="italic">do</hi> on a Sun<lb/>day night; but I do not think he has got much cash"—there were five watches on the table—we then went across the river, by the Eastern Counties Railway-boat, and went up by the rail; but before that he said, "I will show you how I can work the old man out;" and when we came out, he said, "Take particular notice of the locks, and so on, so that we can give a parti<lb/>cular description of them when we get up"—he asked Mr. James if he would take anything, and he came with us to the Pier Tavern, and had a pot of porter; and after that he said, "You see how I can work him out"—while on board the boat he made a remark about Fryer, a policeman, and said, "What is that <hi rend="italic">bobby</hi> doing there?"—he went up to Shoreditch, and after we had got out of the train, Burlton said, "So help me God, I thought he would have <hi rend="italic">crabbed</hi> the <hi rend="italic">deal</hi>"—he meant that I was trying to put some one of his to catch him—I said, "Oh no, why should you think that; if you have not got confidence in me, don't go any farther"—he said, "Oh no, come on, it is all right now, I see"—when we got to town, we went to the Duke of Wel<lb/>lington, and from there to the Folly House Lamb's-fields, Bethnal-green—the name of "John Flowers" is over the door—we went into the tap-room—it was then about three—there were four people there, playing at cards—we waited till four, when Flowers and Johnson came into the room—they were going out again on seeing me, but Burlton said, "He is one of us'" and they came back again, and we all four went not the parlour—while there altoge<lb/>ther, Burlton said, "We have brought you a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">job</hi>"—Johnson said, "That is right, what is it?"—Burlton said, "It is a public-house job, and almost as good as the other, I think, but this party will tell you more about it than I can"—Johnson said, "I hope we shall not have so much trouble as we had with the other;' and he blamed Burlton, and said if he had not have <hi rend="italic">crabbed it</hi> the second time, he would have been in that—Flowers asked when it was to be done—Burlton said, "Before Friday, for that is his brewer's day"—Johnson said, "We will go down to-morrow, and meet you at the some house as before," meaning he Trafalgar—we were to be there a little before three—Burlton said, "Mr. Mould is a man of the world, he must be worked out;" and said that as I knew him I could do so—I said I would take his to Greenwich, as I had a little business there—Burlton was to look that see Mould and me pass, in order to go to th Traflagar, to let them know that we had passed, and were out—Johnson said if there was anything like 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he should give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and Burlton 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Wednesday afternoon, and Feb., about one, I called on Mr. Mould—he went out with me, and we west towards the piper, past Burlton's house—I did not see him in the shop—so I went in, and he came out of the back-room, and said I was <hi rend="italic">piping of</hi> you—I thought be meant that he saw us—Mr. Mould did not hear that, he walked on—I afterwards joined him, about a hundred yards on—we then went to the sand-pits, and came round by another road, at the back, and into his house; that had been arranged between us—we went into the back-parlour,</p>

               <p>where there is a curtain—we looked under the curtain, and in about three minutes after three, Flowers came in, and called for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy and water—he stood at the bar, and said to Miss Mould, the bar<lb/>maid, "Is your father out?"—she said, "Yes; he is gone to take a walk to Greenwich"—he said, "It is a very fine day for a walk, Miss?"—she said, "Yes, sir"—he said, "I see you have got several beer-shops about here"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "I think you have too many;" that was all I could hear—he stopped there, drinking his brandy and water, and smoking his cigar—Johnson then came in, and Mayhew followed him in almost immediately, as close as could be, and they both passed Flowers, and went up stairs—there were some policemen in the parlour with us, and I pointed out the prisoners to them as they came in—there is a coffee—room up stairs, over the bar—when I was at Flowers's house, he brought out a package of skeleton keys from a drawer and another from the cupboard, in the parlour—they were placed on the table, and Burlton said, "These are the men to handle these sort of things; there are not better in London"—I afterwards, when the prisoners were in custody, accompanied the policeman to Flowers's house, and pointed out the place where I had seen the keys, and they were found there—from the Sunday, the second day that Burlton spoke to me about this, I acted in compliance with the police, and in concert with them and Mr. Mould.</p>

               <p>it was all right at the Folly-house beer-shop, when Burlton said he had brought a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">job</hi>—I am not confusing Johnson with any one else—I do not know a widow of the name of Saunders—I recollect an excursion taking place—it was not for the benefit of a poor widow and her family—I do not know who the benefit was for—the <hi rend="italic">Odd Fellows</hi> got it up—I was then a member—I sold ten of the tickets—I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each ticket—I never paid that to anybody, because they owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, for my expenses, in going down to Gravesend to hire the boat for them—the committee agreed to pay my expenses, but did not—I cannot say for whose benefit the excursion was—I did not see something in the bills about a widow—each of the committee were to have one ticket free, so I accounted for nine—the boat was to be 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the captain had 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would not go without the whole of the money, on account of his orders from the proprietors—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid him, and I advanced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I considered he had a right to have it—I suppose about two hundred and fifty <hi rend="italic">Odd Fellows</hi> went in the boat—I planned this robbery at Mr. Mould's—I had never worked at his house—I used to pay my men there when I was a master—I sometimes had twenty or thirty men, according to business—I told Burlton that the money would be in the bedroom over the coffee-room, and the coffee-room was over the bar; that would be on the third-floor, including the ground-floor—there are two rooms there—there is a stair<lb/>case—the doors of the rooms are directly opposite each other, and there is only four and a half inches between them—the staircase is lighted fort the window of the concert-room, which is on the first-floor, over the skittle<lb/>ground—it is a very dark staircase; it is quite dark in the passage—I never noticed any gas lighted there during the day—Mr. Moule told me, on the Monday or Tuesday, that Friday was his brewer's day—I advised him to put his money between the bed and mattress, and I told the prisoner it would be found there—I do not think Mr. Mould keeps a cash-box—I did not observe any drawers in the room—I first told Mr. Covill of this on the 30th, and Mr. Mould next—Burlton had spoken to me on the 22nd—I tried to see Mr. Covill between the 22nd and 30th, but he was engaged in London—this is the first time I have had to do with anything of this kind, and I hope it will be the last—I swear I was never the means of anybody's being taken in to custody before—I have never been a <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> before, not ever <hi rend="italic">peached</hi>—I have never been <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>—I have never been under a lock—I swear I have always been a respectable character.</p>

                  </hi> I am a baker, at Royal-hill, Greenwich—Christain Ryle was my servant for about a year and eight or ten months. In consequence of a communication made to me, my attention was directed to him in the bakehouse—I called in an officer, about nine or ten o'clock is the evening, and searched about the flour-room—I found about twenty-five empty bags, which had had flour in them, concealed behind the four-sacks—next day I searched for them again, and they were gone—no one had access to the flour but him—I have discovered very great deficiencies in my stock of flour for the last eighteen months—after he was in custody he sent for me, and I went to him—he asked me to forgive him, as Mr. Baxendale had forgiven his man—he said he would come and live near me, and nothing of the kind should happen again, or he would leave the country.</p>

                  </hi> I am ostler, at the Lord Wellington. On 27th Jan., between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the small cart drove to our door—I do not know the man who drove it—I do not know that I had seen him before—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the prisoner came with a large cart—I went out in front of the house, and saw them removing some<lb/>thing from the large cart into the smaller one—the carmen were each in their own cart—I could not give a description of what it was—it was past, six o'clock, and rather dark—it appeared to be something bulky, about the size of the chest found in the cart—there was nothing else found in the cart but the mats and tarpaulin—when I saw the men moving it, I asked them if they wanted any assistance—they said, "No"—the prisoner then came into the tap-room and had some bread and cheese—Mr. Corrall and Mr. Hudson came, and I told them what I had seen—there was nothing found in the large cart—the smaller cart had come empty to our door.</p>

IV., and Victoria—I had taken no other—next morning I brought the cash-box down, left it in charge of my wife, went out about nine or ten o'clock, and returned at night—I saw the Victoria half-crown again, on the Monday, in Mrs. Thorpe's possession—the prisoner came again on Wednesday—I was in the room behind the bar, and saw her—my daughter brought me a Victoria half-crown—I went into the bar, and told the prisoner it was a bad half-crown, and that she had passed me another bad obe last week—she said she did not, she was not aware this was bad, she had taken it the night before of a gentleman—I then sent my daughter, who brought Mr. Thorpe, and the other half-crown—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was given in charge, with both the half-crowns, to Boxall, the officer—I marked them first—theses are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

On 21st Jan. we were at his mother's—we slept there the night before—we took him to Bethlehem Hospital, about ten o'clock, as a patient, but he was refused admission, on the plea of permanent insanity, arising from paralysis of the brain—we came back to his mother's between eleven and twelve—he appeared quite deranged that day; he was quite wandering in his mind—he said he thought there were two people in the street who wanted to injure or arrest him, and that he heard people talking to him through the wall—he has been of very weak mind ever since I knew him, and has been subject to paroxysms of this kind for some time back—I have been obliged to call in the police, in consequence of his wildness and violence—I left the room, came back, and found him about to go out—I said, "Where are you going, my dear? What is it you want? don't go out, but wait till Mr. Otway comes"—he said, "I don't want to stop here; I want to go back to that place" (meaning Bethlehem)—I asked him to wait till Mr. Otway came, and he should be taken there—he said, "You must have me confined; for I don't know what I do when these fits come on"—I again asked him to sit down till Mr. Otway came—he sat down—Mr. Otway did not come—he got rather impatient—I said I would put on my bonnet, and see if I could find him—as I was rising, he put his hand on my arm, gently pressed me into my seat, and said, "No, do not go yet; stop a bit"—I spoke to his mother about getting a lodging, where he could be taken care of—she gave me a signal to look at him—his hear was down on his breast, and he was frowning very much; his eyes were almost shut—I asked him if he would lie down, and try to go to sleep—he said, "No"—he peeped round, facing the table, and began gnawing his glove—I told him not to do that, and turned to answer a question his mother put to me—she screamed, and he put his left arm round my waist—he had a knife in his hand, and tried to cut my throat, or my bosom—I said, "Oh! what are you going to do? you would not hurt me? you would not murder me? think of dear <hi rend="italic">Charley?"</hi> that is my child—I do not think he answered—he still attempted to cut me—I was holding his arm, and my hand slipped from his fist on to the knife; I caught hold of the blade—he turned it first one way, and then another, and cut me severely—his mother was assisting me—he threw her down, leaving the knife in my hand, and I dropped it—he still had hold of me—his mother screamed again, and I saw that he had another knife—he endeavoured to stab me in the bosom with it—I put up my hand, it cut my thumb—we struggled—his mother got up, and threw herself on him, which overbalanced him—he staggered over the chairs, and I fell to the ground—he was about to repeat the blow with the knife—some one rushed into the room, and he was secured—he had only had a glass of ale that day—he was always very kind to me when in his right senses—he had been drinking to excess the Saturday before, but not that week—Mr. Lingham was our landlord—we had lived in his house about three</p>

I was a casual pauper at Lamboth Workhouse—on 9th Feb. the deceased Jane Jackson, was assistant nurse of the probationary ward—a person named Clark and the prisoner came there that evening as casual; poor, and soon after two others, named Sutton and Buckley, came in—Buckley led the deceased into a water-closet, and while there I saw her through the doorway give her a bottle from her pocket, con<lb/>taining about half-a-quartern of gin—I do not know whether she drank it—the door was then closed—the deceased then came out of the water-closet. went to the side of the bed, and asked Clark and the prisoner to remove from it—Clark said she would have no words, but would go into the passage and eat her supper, which was a pice of dry bread—the prisoner still sat on the bed, and made no reply—the deceased said, "I never can get up to my bed for one or the other"—the prisoner said, "While there are favourites here, I shall come here too," and Clark said, "Good God! no one can speak here but you"—Buckley said, "It is quite enough for the nurse to speak"—Buckley got into bed, and made use of very base and coarse language to the prisoner, but she did not say anything till she repeated it several times—she</p>

               <p>called her a wh—, and was very aggravating—the prisoner then jumped up to strike her—the deceased was siting on the side of her bed, and in going to rise to save the blow, she caught it on the front of her head, at the top—she said, "Oh, my God, my head!" and place her hands to her head directly—she gradually got worse, and fainted, and was sick, and died a little after twelve—she never rallied, but kept complaining of her head—she ceased to speak not more than twenty minutes after receiving the blow—she was in good health before this.</p>

On 9th Feb., about ten o'clock, I was called to the deceased at Lambeth Workhouse—I found her perfectly insensible—she gradually got worse, and died—I afterwards made an examination—I discovered nothing externally, but on opening the membranes of the brain, I found a vast extravasation of blood on the left side of the brain, down the base of the brain—after clearing away the blood, I found a hard substance at the termination of the carotid artery—I cut it, and found it to be part of a <hi rend="italic">sac</hi>—I passed my finger into a larger opening, and found it to be a dilated artery or an <hi rend="italic">aneurism</hi>—I should think it had been of some standing—I attribute the death to the bursting of that <hi rend="italic">sac</hi>—any concussion might cause it to burst, or any sudden exertion or jumping forward—a blow such as has been described might produce it.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Bishop, of 29, William-street. The yard at the back of our house joins the yard of 43. Lant-street—Mallows lodges in that house—on Wednesday, 2nd Feb., at a little before twelve o'clock. I was in the yard—I saw Mallows take two sheets from a line in Porter's yard, go into the water-closet, fold them up, and then come and take the shift—I went into my own house, and soon after Mrs. Porter came and knocked at my door, and I told her what I had seen—we ran up to Mallows' door—she was not at home—she came home at half-past four o'clock, intoxi<lb/>cated, and said she was perfectly innocent—we told her if she would acknow<lb/>ledge it we would not give her in charge—she still denied it, and we gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Skinner-street, Snow-hill, and am a boot and shoemaker. On 22nd Feb. I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Coal-hole—the driver got off, and we went in and called for ginger-beer—the prisoner was standing at the bar—I put down a sovereign to pay for the ginger-beer and a glass of rum—the prisoner snatched it and ran away with it—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>immediately—the prisoner ran across the road—if course I could not run so fast as he did, I had my box coat on—there was a person in charge of the door—I said, "Shut the door, don't let him take my gentleman's money," and he shut it against me.</p>
