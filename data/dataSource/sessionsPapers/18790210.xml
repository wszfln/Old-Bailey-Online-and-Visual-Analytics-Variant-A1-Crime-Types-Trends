                  </hi>. About a year ago I came from Baltimore, and was servant to Mr. Levy, a bootmaker, at 19, Old Montagu Street—about seven months ago Mr. Levy went to lodge at Artillery Passage, and I went with him—about five months ago I left his service, and went into the prisoner's service at 19, Old Montagu Street—he is a tailor—I remained there till the fire happened—that was on 24th December, the day before Christmas Day—I slept in the basement, there is a kitchen there—there are two rooms on a floor—on the ground-floor there is a shop and parlour, on the first-floor is a front room where there was a sofa where the prisoner used to sleep, and a back room, a bedroom, where the prisoner's daughter used to sleep—she is a girl of about 14, and a Miss Moss, a neighbour's daughter, used to sleep with her—on the second-floor were the workrooms, the back room was where the machine was—there were no rooms above—on the 24th at 1 o'clock the prisoner's daughter and Miss Moss went to Stratford to see some friends—I was in her bedroom that morning and attended to it, the bed was made, and the room left all right—there was some paraffin in the house, in an ordinary pint bottle—I had bought a pint about a fortnight before, it was used for a night lamp in the daughter's room—it was kept underneath the dressing-table in the bedroom—I saw it there that day—I am sure it was not on the mantel-piece—the door of that room was always kept locked—I used to lock it, and the key was kept downstairs in a table-drawer in the kitchen—there was no fire in the bedroom that day, we never had a fire there—I was in the workroom that afternoon—there was a coke fire in the grate there—there were three workmen at work there that day—near about 3 o'clock the prisoner told me to put on my things and take some work to the shops—there were two bundles in the workshop—one was for Mr. Keen, of London Wall, and the other for Mr. Croft, of Shepherdess Walk, City Road—the workmen all left at 3.30—Morris was the last one to leave—the prisoner went out before him, directly he had told me to take the work to the shops—I was the last in the house—I put on my things, and took the bundles—I left no one in the house—it was 3.45 when I left—I had a key of the street door—it closes on the latch by slamming it—I took the key with me to let myself in when I returned—I delivered the bundles at Mr. Keen's and Mr. Croft's, and returned to the house after 6 o'clock—I found there had been a fire, and the engines and firemen were there—I kept my key in my pocket, and afterwards gave it up to the police—this is it (<hi rend="italic">two keys produced</hi>)—the prisoner used to have the other key sometimes, and sometimes his mother-in-law, Mrs. Kruntz, had it—she had it that day—she</p>

               <p>lives at 16, Finch Street, Spitalfields, not far off—I could walk there in three minutes—she did not live at our house—she used to bring her husband's tea—he is a tailor, and worked for the prisoner—I know she had the key that day, because after the fire the firemen asked Mr. Marks for the key, and he went to his mother, and took it, and gave it to the fireman—that was after 9 o'clock that night—the daughter came home after 11 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner left the house before'me with a man named Friedenberg—I had bought paraffin before this—we use it to the machine mixed with oil—that was what I bought it for, and for the night lamp—I was not kept at the places where I delivered the goods—I was not tied to time—I did not hurry myself—I had not used the bottle for a couple of nights—the lamp had been supplied from the pint of paraffin for a fortnight—it is a very small lamp—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was used every night when I turned off the gas at the meter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at 17, Old Montagu Street, next door to the prisoner—on the evening of 24th December, about 5.40, I heard an alarm of fire—I went into the street and saw fire and smoke coming from the second-floor front room window of No. 19, and the door was wide open—I went in and went upstairs to the second-floor front room; I found fire on and over and under the table—the window was open—there was no fire in any other part of the room; the table itself was on fire; there was more smoke than blaze—there was no fire in the grate—I then came down to the first-floor landing and went into the front room; the door was open—there was a couch in the room—I found an old lady there, she is outside now, she might be between 50 and 60 years of age; I think she had on a cap or kind of bonnet—she was in a stooping position; what she was doing I could not discern; there was no light in the room—I told her to come out, as the place was on fire—she said something in reference to a child, in consequence of that I felt round the room as far as I could, there was no child there—I had placed the woman towards the door near the staircase, and I then caught hold of her and carried her downstairs and into a neighbour's house opposite—she was no doubt able to walk, but she might have been confused—before I carried her down I noticed that the light was beginning to show through the floor where the gaspipe was—I returned to the house, hearing of an old man being in the back room—I went upstairs again and went into the second-floor back room; the door was locked; I burst it open—there was no fire there—as I came downstairs there was a policeman at the door—I then went to my own house and got on to the roof to look after my own property—some short time afterwards the fire was put out—about half an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner and Mr. Moss in the street between Nos. 17 and 19—Mr. Moss tapped the prisoner on the shoulder and said "You must thank Mr. Walton for saving the old lady"—the prisoner thanked me and asked me to have a glass of something to drink—we went to the corner house at the bottom of the street and had a</p>

                  </hi>. I am the assessor to the Staffordshire Fire Insurance Company an 1 to Fire insurance companies generally—I took this statement from the prisoner—I read it over to him and he said it was correct. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Fire happened Christmas Eve; no one in the house. I had been to work until the afternoon. The workpeople were also there. My servant took the work to the shops; she is a South African, had been with me about six months. She was brought over by a man, a bootmaker, who used to live at my place. I have been a tenant of the house four years. I left the house after 3, between 3 and 4 o'clock, on Christmas Eve. I left the girl there. She took work to Mr. Keen, 51, London Wall, and to Mr. Croft, Shepherdess Walk, City Road. The work was packed up before I left, ready for the girl to take away. The first I heard of the fire was find<lb/>ing the fire-engines there after 6 o'clock. The girl had the key of the door. I had been to several places to buy things; at a goldsmith's in Goulston Street; his name, I think, is Jacobs. I am informed the fire happened about half an hour before I came back; there was gas in every room in the house. I turned the gas off at the meter every night, and then my child, 14 years old, had a night-light; for since my wife died she was so timid. The child was at Stratford at the time. Miss Moss sleeps with my child for company. I sleep on a made-up bed on the sofa in the sitting-room on the first floor. My tenant left about a fortnight before the fire; he gave me notice. I can't give any idea as to the cause of the fire. All was safe when I left. The girl had to dress herself and then go with the work; she had no necessity to have asked. She sleeps in the kitchen. The fire had not reached the kitchen or shop and parlour, but was confined to the work-room on the top of the house. I am not able to form any opinion as to which floor the fire began on.") I have had experience in estimating claims—I cannot say that I examined these goods—I looked over them—speaking generally, I agree with the evidence of Mr. Armstead as to value—I re<lb/>member some observations being made about the key, and the girl Robinson made a statement about it—the prisoner said there was a second key, and when asked where it was he said it was with his mother.</p>

You dragged me out of bed to go to work on the 28th Nov.—you would not work, and I had to work—you slept in bad till 12 or 1 in the day—you turned the baby topsy-turvy, and it frightened me, I thought the child would go into a fit—I rushed towards the child and then you hit me—I did not throw the basin at you, I threw a cup—I said no bad word—you told people a man at the docks cut your head—I threw the cup because that morning I had to go out to work and I had nothing to eat and nothing for the child, and I said "Bill, you're no man, or you would not let a wife and child go out as you do," and with that you beat me and took up a lamp to throw at me, and I felt so crushed that I should have to go to work in that way, and I took up a cup and threw at you—you had been beating me that morning—I had the marks about my face, and the baby was in my arms when you flogged me—I was going to summons you for it—when you came back from the hospital I was at my place of work, and the mistress was afraid to let me be seen because you had threatened me—I did not swear at you—on the Monday I was at work at 22, Beaumont Square—I went to the workhouse for protection, I stayed there three days—I had not gone to the play with another man—I will take my dying oath it is not true—it is not true that there was any young man of whom you were jealous—on the Saturday when I went to the Court you had not seen me for a week, I had been in the workhouse three days—when you asked me to forgive you, I said I had put up with it so long I must have some protection from you—this chopper does not belong to me, it was one exactly like it, but a little longer—it did look very much like the one we had at home—the one belonging to me had notches in it—I</p>

I am a potman at the Albert Arms, Bancroft Road, Mile End—the prisoner came there on the 9th Dec, about a quarter past 4—I was pouring some hot water into a tub to wash some bottles—the prisoner said "There is nothing like plenty of hot water," and I said "No"—he walked down to the bottom of the skittle-ground—there are some old window panes standing there—he said "You have still got some old window panes there," and I said "Yes"—I saw him lean over, and he came back and pulled out an old scarf from his pocket and said "Do you want to bay a scarf?"—I said "No"—he said "I will sell it for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "If you want 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I'll give you the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and he said "Good-bye," and as he went to shake hands with me I noticed his hands covered with blood, and before I shook hands with him he ran over into the pot-house, where I clean the pots, and washed his hands in some fine sand in a sand-tub—he said "Good-bye; I have done it"—I asked him what he had done—he said "I have knocked her down three times with a hatchet"—then he went through into the bar, and I followed him—as he was going out of the house he said "Good bye; you won't see any more of me until the rope is round my neck in Newgate"—when he was gone I went back into the skittle-ground where I had seen him go—on looking near the window-sashes I found there this chopper—there was blood on it—it was not wet, but had just dried on—there was a stream of blood right down the blade—I handed it to the constable.</p>

I am surgeon to the London Hospital—about 4.30 on the night of the 9th December the prosecutrix was brought in—she was bleeding from many wounds—there were seven incised wounds on the back of the right forearm and hand, the most serious one 2 inches in length; it fractured and splintered the small bone of the arm—there were six incised wounds on the scalp, varying from 11/2 to 21/2 inches in length, two of them penetrating deeply into the skull and through the outer table of the skull straight behind the ear—she had lost a large quantity of blood, and was fainting, but had not quite lost consciousness—I considered her life in danger.</p>

I am barman at the Wooden Shades, Bishopsgate Street—on 15th January, about 9.30, I saw the prisoner and two or three others there drinking together—the prisoner's wife went up to Mr. Wright and asked him if he was going to stand anything to drink—the prisoner then went up close to him, and he treated him to drink—Mr. Wright was then sick, and stooped down, and the prisoner put his hand in front of his chest, took the watch out of his pocket, and took it off the chain—I told the head barman, who jumped over the counter and said, "That won't do for me here," and ordered the doors to be closed—a policeman came, and Wright said to the prisoner, "I shall charge you with stealing my watch"—he said, "I did not take it"—he was taken to the station—one of his companions left before the police came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 637). At 1.30 a.m. on 12th January I was on duty in Narrow Street, Ratcliff, when I saw the prisoner and another man approaching me—the prisoner was carrying something under his arm, and the other was also carrying something on his shoulder—they came to within 20 or 30 yards of me, when they looked at me, turned round, and ran away—the prisoner turned down what is called the "four-foot way" leading to the Thames, and the other man threw down a picture and ran along another street—I gave chase to the other man but lost sight of him—then I met a Thames constable, and we searched for the prisoner—down the narrow way we found a looking-glass—we then went on board the barges which were lying about 20 yards from the narrow way—it had been snowing and freezing, and we traced some marks into the cabin of the barge "Jane Dale," and there we found the prisoner lying down very wet and steaming, as if he had been in the water—we had got there by going round a considerable distance—I said, "What are you doing here?" he said, "Nothing"—we took him ashore, and asked him what account he could give of the picture and looking-glass—he said, "I met a man at a coffee-stall in Commercial Road: knowing he was going my way homo and seeing he was carrying these things, I consented to carry the looking-glass"—he also made the same statement at the station when the charge was read over to him—the spot where I met the men is about five minutes' walk from Brunswick Place—the prisoner had 30 or 40 yards to run before he turned into the narrow way—I examined Mrs. Knowles's house, and found the panels of the door had been forced in, and the window had been forced open from the outside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>."Last Saturday night week I was going home with a mate of mine, Charley Merritt, who asked me to go up and have a cup of coffee with him. While I was standing with him drinking my coffee this man came up with a picture on his shoulder and a looking-glass in his hand. He seemed to be half intoxicated, and got singing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100023"/>
               <p>I have often seen his face, and knew him as Ted the Boilermaker. When I told him to go home, he might get locked up, I said 'I will see you home; I will come a little way with you. It will all be on my way, as you say you live at Millwall and I live at Limehouse.' On going along he says, 'Give me a spell with this wanting me to carry the picture and the looking-glass. I say 'No; I will take the looking-glass, in case you break it.' I got him round again the White Swan, down London Street, into the narrow way, that being the nearest direction to go. We got half-way up this narrow street, and I was walking ahead, when all of a sudden I heard a crash. On looking round I saw he had dropped the picture and was walking away as fast as he could. Presently two policemen ran by me. I stood for a moment and didn't know what to do. I put the glass down, and stood again this alley way when the policeman rushed over towards me. I backed down this alley, and before I knew where I was I was in the water. I sank down and came up again. I struggled on the ice. I saw a rope, and I grabbed at it I crawled on to the barge, and there I said insensible, and I remember no more not before I felt a blow, and on looking up I saw a constable and another man with him—he told me the charge, and I went and told him all I knew about it".</p>

At 12 p.m. on Saturday, 11th January, I met the prisoner at the Lord Nelson, and asked him if he was going up to have a cup of coffee—we went up to the stall and had some coffee, when a man came up to the prisoner with a large picture on his shoulder and something else on his arm—he and the prisoner left the stall and I went home.</p>

               <p>Phillips—Wainwright stood Mr. Bacchus up against a lamp-post, and Phillips helped him—I asked Mr. Bacchus where he lived—he said, "15, Everholt Street"—I did not ask his name—I took his arm to lead him across the road—upon that Wainwright pulled me away, and said, "Come out of the b—way; you don't know how to hold the b—man up at all"—he led him up the street about 200 yards—I saw him put his hand into Bacchus's pocket and some money dropped out—I followed them—I saw another man not in custody pick up the money—I thought Bacchus was a little worse for liquor; it might have been from excitement—I was looking at Wainwright's hand—he asked what I was looking at, and said, "I'll put this in your bleeding eye"—I stepped back—the man not in custody gave a private whistle, and the two prisoners went across the road—I went back—a cab was coming, and Phillips came with me to it, and we went to the hospital—I heard Wainwright say to Bacchus that if he didn't get up he would kick him in the b—legs—that was when I saw them trying to put him up against the lamp-post—Phillips came to my assistance, and went to the hospital with me—I am positive he is the same man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Wainwright</hi>. When I saw you first, I did not ask you what was the matter with the prosecutor—I had just left Gower Street Station at 11.20—he went to fall, and I caught him in my arms—I did not give you any money—Phillips did not run away at all—the man who whistled ran away.</p>

               <p>Hayes—for the last 11 years I have been employed as a watcher to Sir Charles Mills—the prisoners work in the brickfield—I have known Miller all his life, and Kitson two or three years—on Monday, 23rd December about 5 in the evening, I was coming across a field in Hayes parish, I heard somebody beating in the cover, I got over a stile out of a ploughed field into a meadow, and walked along one side of the cover, I could not see any one, and I turned back and met the prisoners and another man named Edward Jellaman, who is not apprehended yet; they had just come over the stile out of the cover—Miller had got on a brown jacket, Kitson had some<lb/>thing on his face, or it was blacked, I had but one sight, they gave me no chance—I said, "What are you chaps doing here I you had better go away"—they began swearing, language not fit to mention in Court, and said, "What have you to do with it I we will corpse you"—all of them used the language, all together—they then all rushed at me, knocked me down, and kicked me about—I was alone—one of them had a stick in his hand, I had a fork under my left arm that I had been working with all day—while I was down, Miller said, "Have you got any bleeding money about you I if you have we mean having it"—I did not say anything—Miller got his hand in one of my trousers pockets, and Kitson in the other as I laid on the ground—I said, "If you will let me alone I will give you what I have got"—Miller said, "Well, let us have it, then, and bleeding quick"—I then gave Miller a sovereign, I had more in my pocket, I said, "Here is a sovereign, don't knock me about no more, don't murder me"—Miller then hit me in the face with his fist, and said, "We mean finishing of you"—they were all three close together; the other two then began kicking me again—Jella-man said, "Let us corpse him, let us make a job of it now we have got the chance"—Jellaman is a man just about the game age, size, and stamp as the prisoners—they kept kicking me about, and one of them, I can't say which, said, "There are two or three more of you b—s we mean to serve the same"—they kicked me a few more times after that, and then went away, and left me lying in the snow; they kicked me all over my head, at the back of the left ear and face, all down my thighs and private parts, and my hands; there are the scars now—they aimed at my private parts, it was not an accident—Jellaman kicked straight right between my legs as I laid on the ground—just before they went away they kicked my hand, when I tried to save my private parts—I can't say who kicked me there besides Jellaman, they kicked at me there several times, I was partly stunned—I suffered for several days, but not a great lot; I bled, they kicked the skin off me, I was all sores all over the head and face—they kicked the skin off my private parts, and they smashed the back of my hand—I bled all about my face and head—when I recovered myself I went home to a neighbour's, Mr. Trussler, the under gamekeeper, I live in the next house to him—I made a complaint to him, and asked him to go up to Mr. Gold's along with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Benson and Hedges, cigar merchants, of 13, Old Bond Street—on 15th December a customer of mine, William Worth Newenham, left this country for Australia—I did not see him on board the Somersetshire—on 24th December, I received this letter: "December 24th, 1878. Coxe's Hotel, 32 Room. Sir,—he so good as to send me three boxes of Maria Victorias, and three of La Intimidads, and two pounds of your smoking mixture, as soon as possible.—Yours truly, W. W. Newenham." I went to Cox's Hotel, and made inquiries and went back, and then Mr. Adams, the clerk to Messrs. Beale and Inman, called on me, and I went again to Cox's Hotel about 1 o'clock with him, and saw the prisoner in the coffee-room—I produced the letter, and Mr. Adams also produced a letter—I addressed the prisoner as Mr. Newenham; he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have written to me for some cigars"—he said, "They are for Mr. George Newenham"—I said, "What is the meaning of this, did you write this letter?" he said, "No, it is written by George Newenham," either a cousin or brother of William Newenham, I am not certain which he said—I said, "How came you to come to this hotel in the name of Newenham, when your name is Jackson?"—he said, "I came for the purpose of receiving the goods—he also said that he knew that W. W. Newenham had gone to Australia in the</p>

               <p>Somersetshire—I told him it was a very serious case; he most make his explanation before a Magistrate, and gave him in custody—he said, "I was going to take the goods to Mr. George Newenham"—one of the witnesses said, "Where is Mr. George Newenham"—he said, I had rather not say," or words to that effect—Mr. Adams showed him his letter, and he said, "I posted that with one other"—I said, "To whom was the third letter written?"—he said, "I decline to say," but we discovered that after-wards—I know Mr. W. W. Newenham's writing, and I am certain that these three letters and envelopes were not written by him—I have his writing in our address-book, and have compared it—the cigars and the smoking mixture are worth from 20?. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I fancy I have seen the prisoner at our place of business-his face is familiar to me—I have made several in<lb/>quiries, but cannot hear of hear of George Newenham's existence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known W. W. Newenham since June 11, 1878; that was the first time he came—he has had dealings with us to the amount of 3/. or 4?., for which he paid; but the amount standing to his debit now is about 30?.—he came to the shop, and was a constant customer up to the time of his leaving—he belongs to a good family; his father is an Irish gentleman of property—the defendant's brother has had dealings with us for about two years, and owes us about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have received a letter from him since the defendant has been in custody, asking for his account—he lives either at his father's seat, or at the town residence in Park Street—the family is one of position—there is no attempt to imitate Mr. Newen-ham's writing in my book in this order—when I went to the hotel on the second occasion the defendant had not come down from his bedroom, but he came down into the coffee-room—nobody else was there—I told him that his name was Jackson—I knew that, because I saw it marked on his clothes, which had been given to the servant to brush, but I did not know that he was connected with that family—I had no knowledge of a third letter till the defendant said that he had posted three—he repeated at the station that he had posted three letters, but he did not say to whom the third was sent—we discovered that afterwards.</p>

I am one of the firm of Beale and Inman, of 131, New Bond Street, hosiers—on the morning of 24th December this letter came by post and my partner showed it to me—I have not got the envelope now—we had a customer named William Worth Newenham: "Coxe's Hotel, 32 Room, Jermyn Street. Sir,—Kindly send me a fight-coloured smoking suit, the same as you sent me last tune; also three of your thickest coloured Jerseys, and ditto drawers, six made-up hunting ties, three white, remainder black and white. Kindly let me have them as soon as possible. Yours, &amp;c., W. W. Newenham." We had known W. W. Newenham since 1874, and were in the habit of giving him credit—the goods mentioned in the letter are worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know the prisoner before this.</p>

"Very likely you have been sending it to half a dozen others. Are there any more?"—he said "I only posted three altogether"—I said "Who was the other to?"—he said "I shan't tell you"—Mr. Hedges said "I shall give you in charge"—he begged him not, and said who he was, and said "Mr. George Newenham has written them, and I was to stay at the hotel for the goods"—I said "Who is Mr. George Newenham?"—he said "He is my cousin" or "brother," I won't gay which—I know the prisoner as a customer—I saw him in our shop about three months ago, and one of the young men said "There is Mr. Warren Jackson's brother."</p>

               <p>of complaints of loss of letters, I made up two test letters at the South Lambeth Sorting Office—I addressed one "Mrs. Watson, 79, Motley Street, Wandsworth Road, London," and the other "Mr. Tatlow, Tailor, 30, Robertson Street, East Wandsworth Road, London"—in the letter to Mrs. Watson I enclosed a sovereign and 55 stamps—I previously marked the stamps with the date with chemicals, and the coin with my initials—I posted the letters in the pillar box at the corner of Devonshire Road, Wandsworth Road, about 200 yards from the sorting office—I had given special instruc<lb/>tions about them and saw them cleared at about 6.10 by a man named Spear, head letter carrier—at about 6.50 I saw the prisoner leave the Sorting Office (where I had seen the letters taken) to go out on his delivery—I watched him down to his own house—I could not see if he had anything in his hands—it was contrary to regulation to go to his house before his delivery—he remained in his house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—after that I saw him pass through Motley Street—I saw him pass the door of No. 79 without delivering—he did not go into Robertson Street—I had given instructions to Spear at South Lambeth Office—I then returned to the office—I saw the prisoner there at about 8.20 and told him who I was—I said "Have you been into your house on the 6 o'clock delivery?"—he said "No," and I said "Did you do the Queen's Road delivery on the sixes?"—that is a techincal term for the 6 o'clock delivery—he said "Yes"—these letters would be in that delivery—I said "I saw you go down to your house; you remained there from 10 to 15 minutes"—he would have had to go out of his route to go to his house—he replied "Not so long as that"—I said "Did you give your wife anything?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you give her any money at that time?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you see a letter on the 6 o'clock delivery for Mrs. Watson, 79, Motley Street?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you see one for Mr. Tatlow, Tailor?"—he said "No"—I said "Both those letters are missing, they were sorted out for your 6 o'clock delivery, do you know anything about them?"—he said "No"—this conversation occurred at the post office about 8.20 the same evening—after that I went to the prisoner's house and saw his wife—that was about an hour and a half after the letters were entrusted to him—he had been home before he commenced his delivery—I am not able to say whether he went in afterwards, we lost sight of him—nothing has been found with regard to the letter addressed to Mrs. Watson—on the following Monday the letter addressed to Mr. Tatlow, Tailor, turned up at the S.W. District Office—when we went to the prisoner's house we were kept waiting at the door a long time—on going in I saw his wife—I saw a lot of postage stamps there that were unobliterated, and as if torn from envelopes and newspapers—the paper had been bodily torn off with them, and was still adhering—I also noticed embers of paper recently burnt in the grate—I examined them—I could make nothing of them positively—I went back again to see the prisoner—this was about 10.30 the same evening—I saw him in the sorting office, I had him detained there in the meantime—I said "I have seen your wife, she says you gave her some money; be careful what you say; what did you give her?"—he said "I gave her a sovereign and a few shillings"—I said "What did she do with the sovereign?"—he said "She changed it"—I said "I suppose it was to pay for the gin I saw upon the table?"—he said "Yes, it might have been"—I said "What change did she bring you back, was there a half-sovereign amongst it?"—he said "Yes,</p>

I am head letter-carrier at the South Lambeth Sorting Office—on the 11th January I saw Mr. Bradford post the two letters addressed to Tatlow and Watson about 6 o'clock—I afterwards collected those letters and brought them to the office—I sorted them to the Queen's Road delivery—I then saw the prisoner arranging his letters for delivery, and saw him pick the test letters out from the others—I was about a yard from him—my attention had been previously called to them—I saw him place the two letters on his right-hand side, and the other letters on the left—they were not tied—they were placed ready to be taken out on delivery—I swear the two letters were on the right—he pressed them with his finger—I. saw him examine them—I saw the address on one of the letters—I could read it distinctly—he took the two test letters up in his right hand in the sorting office, and the others in his left hand—he walked straight out of the office still holding the two letters in his right hand, they were not registered—it was a most unusual thing to do—they ought to stand in their order all in one hand—there was a large bundle, over twenty in number—I went out on delivery soon after—not with Adams—I saw him after I came back—I believe he brought some letters back—I had nothing to do with them.</p>

W. and A. Gilbey—he said "I have an interest in their business and draw 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from it, and I have two sons there"—we had some further conversation with regard to the nature of Messrs. Gilbey's business; he seemed to be well acquainted with the firm, and spoke of the wonderful way in which the firm had risen; that all their business seemed to come to them, that they had not much trouble to look after it—he was dressed as a gentleman, most respectably, not as he is now—I let him have the kitchener entirely in consequence of what he said about Messrs. Gilbey, and his interest in the firm, and that he was drawing 900/. a. year—I made no inquiries in con<lb/>sequence of what he said—I have had dealings with three or four members of Messrs. Gilbey's firm, and have supplied them with stoves and various things—I sent Mr. Fishbourne to take particulars for fixing the stove, he brought back a report to me—the stove was delivered about a week or two later—I have never been paid for it—several applications were made for</p>

On 31st December I apprehended the prisoner on a warrant at his house, 19, Ledbury Road, Bayswater—I had some difficulty in getting into the house—we waited out there from 9 p.m. till 2 next morning, and had to get up a ladder 12 houses off and walk along the balconies—I got a policeman to knock at the door and tell them there was a man in the area, and when Mrs. Savory came to the window to see what it was, a policeman who was on the balcony got through the window before she could close it again—when we got into the house the prisoner was there dressed—I told him the charge—he said nothing—we had posted con<lb/>stables round, so that he could not get out—we searched the house, and found the bill relating to the stove, some pawn tickets, and letters of application for payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I never anticipated cheating Mr. Edwards the least in the world. As to the other things, it was to make up a set of things that I had at home, but being very ill and pressed I pledged them. I was not at home when the things were taken in. When I went to Mr. Edwards I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, and if he had applied for the money he would have got it, or a portion of it, at any rate; but Mrs. Savory's father fell ill, and died on 16th December, and I paid every shilling I could out of my pocket to meet the expenses.</p>

I have seen him walk without a stick since—he limps a little on one foot—I said before the Magistrates, "I am aware now that he is a cripple"—I was not under the impression that he had been drinking—I am not aware that anything had occurred to put him out of temper—I should think he was quite sober—he was not excited—he simply came into the house and used bad language, and I was told to put him out—I took him by the shoulder and was proceeding to walk him out—he is about the same weight as I am—he had this stick in his hand, and hit me with it across the head three times—I put him out and held him there—when the surgeon examined me I had two wounds on the top of the head.</p>

I am waiter at the Black Swan Tavern, Bow Road—on the night of the 21st January I saw the prisoner and a woman outside that house at about half-past 11—I did not hear the woman say anything—they were tumbling about—I heard neither of them speak—I said to the man, "Why don't you let the woman alone?"—he said, "It's my wife, and I want to get her home, she is drunk"—she said, "I am not"—he then took hold of" her round the waist and threw her down, and fell</p>

I am the wife of John Palmer, of Summer Street—I was in the Bow Road, near the Black Swan window, on the night of the 21st January—I don't know the time—it was rather late—the lamps were put out—I saw the prisoner and a woman talking by the window—his back was towards me, and her back stood against the window—he stood in front of her and was asking her if she would have some baked potatoes—he asked her two or three times—she said "No, she was not hungry, but she would have some brandy"—a customer came up, and I was serving them afterwards—a little while after I heard some one cry "Police! Murder!" and when I had served my customer I ran to the corner to look, and I saw it was the same people in the road—I saw her clothes a little way up—she was on the ground a little way from the gutter—the man was kneeling over by her side or at the head—I could not see very well, it was dark—I did not go up close to them—I called out "You brute"—he appeared to be on his knees—her clothes were a little way up above her stockings—he never answered me—he appeared to be drunk—I was called away then to serve my customers—I afterwards saw them—I do not know whether she was walking along or being led or carried round—I could not see distinctly, because there were two or three customers round me.

                  </hi>. I am a ticket-collector, and live at 8, Orchard Terrace, Bow—on the night of the 21st I was in the Bow Road, outside the Black Swan—I saw the prisoner there—we had worked together on the same line—he had got hold of a woman round the waist behind her, trying to pull her out from the public-house—she had hold of the handle inside, holding to it—as soon as she left go they fell—she fell sideways—I assisted her up—he fell on her—she kept saying, "Let me be, I am not drunk"—after I had assisted her up she called "Police!" and "Murder!"—he caught her round the waist again from behind to carry her away—they went a few yards and fell down again into the road—the prisoner held on her then and exposed her—he pulled her clothes up with one hand—they were both on the ground together, he on his side lying beside her and she lying on her side—he pulled her clothes about as high up as the waist, and he smacked her with his open hand—he said, "Now, won't you come home?"—a man then helped her up—the prisoner had got hold of her round the arm, and they got back again in front of the Black Swan, where they were at first; and there a policeman came up, and wanted to know what all the bother was about—I do not know what the prisoner said to that—I heard the policeman say, "What are you going to do with the woman?" and he. said he was going to take her home—the policeman said, "Take her home, then;" and the prisoner caught hold of her and attempted to carry her away again—after going five or six yards they fell down again, he on top of her, the woman under—her clothes were up—I could see the man was drunk—he was carrying her round the waist from behind—he did so twice—the police<lb/>man saw him do that the last time—they came up and saw the man drunk trying to carry the woman; they looked on without interfering—somebody said, "Aren't you policemen going to interfere, as that woman doesn't belong to the man?" and that he had been exposing her round the corner—the police then went directly and got the man off the woman, and got the woman up, and took them to the station.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Deponent, Elizabeth Glover, upon her oath, says: 'I am now a patient in the London Hospital. Between 10 and 11 last Tuesday night, in the Bow Road, a man came out of a ham shop. Another man came out after him. The first shoved me. I said, 'Do not shove me.' He came and shoved me again. I said, 'I will lock you up.' He struck me on the nose and I fell. I got up. He took me by the arms and dragged me about; he hurt me. He then put my clothes over my face. He kicked me across the thigh above the knee with all his force. Then two police came. I called 'Police!' 'Murder!' The police did not take him at first; they then took him. My leg was cut where he hit me. I never saw the man before. I am sure the man who was taken to the station was the man who struck and kicked me. The prisoner is very like the man who did it.

I am surgeon at the London Hospital—I saw a woman named Elizabeth Glover, who was admitted on the 11th January—she is now dead—she was brought in about 12 o'clock—she was suffering from a contused wound just above the right knee-joint, and had a bruise on her back, a bruise on her right hip, and two bruises on her right leg below the knee—her nose had also been bleeding—the bruises were recent—within a day—changes in colour had not taken place—the wound on the knee might have been occasioned by a blunt instrument, or a kick, or by a fall on a kerbstone—I believe considerable violence must have been used, the wound was deep—I think the position of the wound pointed more to a kick than</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100060"/>
               <p>a fall—it was not at that part of the knee which would first strike the ground if she fell—the position of the wound was in front above the knee—she had been drinking, but was able to answer questions intelligibly—she was under my charge until the Sunday following, and then she died—we made a post-mortem examination—the cause of death was exhaustion, produced by suppuration around the knee-joint, and a constitution already broken down and debilitated by disease—without the injury to the knee she might have lived some time—the wound was the cause of the suppuration—but for that she might have lived for years, certainly had she taken care of herself—in the opinion of one of our surgeons 20 years, in my opinion I should not care to say more than 5 or 6—I form that opinion upon my medical knowledge and experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I will not say the injury in the knee-joint was not caused by a fall on the kerb—the body was in a very diseased state—I examined the head—there was syphilitic disease of the bones, the rest healthy—syphilitic disease of the liver—syphilitic disease of the spleen and granular kidneys—most of the organs were diseased—the actual working parts of the organs were not so excessively diseased—there was more deposi<lb/>tion of structure of tissue than destruction of tissue—a wound or a blow would be much more serious to a person so diseased—with people having granular kidneys the slightest wound is very severe, and often followed by rapid and fatal results—we never make a practice of cutting such people—in a healthy subject the wound would not cause death—the wound hastened death.</p>

               <p>Lodge—on Thursday, 12th December, about half-past 4 or 20 minutes to 5, the prisoner rang at the front-door bell, and told me there was a fire in the stable yard; I said "It is impossible, there is no one there"—he said "You had better come and see"—I went as quickly as possible with him through this little gate; the stable door was locked, and the key in the lock out<lb/>side; it was not locked—Mr. Campbell does not keep any horses—it is a two-stall, and both stalls were bedded down for friend's horses, and there were two old cane chairs there—I did not notice any smoke before I opened the door—when I did open it there was a quantity of smoke, and the whole straw was in a blaze in both stalls; the prisoner said "Shall I run for the engine?"—I said "Certainly, as quick as you possibly can," and he went off that instant as fast as he could run—the page boy Cooper came and joined me, and I set him to pump water, and shouted for assistance—I used pails of water, and got two of the maids to assist me, and we ultimately put out the fire before the engine came—the straw in both of the stalls was burnt—one of the chairs was scorched a little and the other had just begun to take fire—I should say the engine came in less than a quarter of an hour from the time of the alarm—the prisoner came back with it—after a time I asked the prisoner his name and address—he said "My name is Budge"—Ashby the gardener, who was then present, said "No, Soper, when you worked for my father; four years ago your name was Soper"—he said "No, Budge," but Ashby said Soper was the name—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told him to come back for a further reward—none of the family were at home, only myself, the page, and four maid servants—the gates leading into the stable yard are kept locked, and they were locked that day—there is no access from the stable to the rear; the only access is by coming into the front court and going through that little gate—I did not observe any other people in the yard—on Monday, 16th December, the prisoner called and said that he had been advised to come, as I had asked him to come, for a further reward—I asked him if he were really at work at Kensington Palace Gardens—he said "No, I have left"—he had told me on the Thursday that he was at work there; he did not say why he had left; he said he was an amateur fireman—I then took him to Mr. Campbell, and he asked what he was doing—he said that he had got an appointment that morning as engine keeper to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—Mr. Campbell asked him to write his name and address and to call in a week; he then wrote on this piece of paper "George Williams, 10, Stanford Road, Kensington"—Mr. Campbell gave me instructions, in consequence of which I went to the station and saw the inspector—I think the fire must have been burning a very short time before I went into the stable from the fact of the two chairs, which were in the centre of the burning straw, being so little burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant at Swansea—on the 3rd of April, 1877, while going by steamboat from London to Woolwich, I formed the acquaintance of the prisoner on board, and treated him to liquor—on coming ashore he took me to the barracks and had more drink—subsequently I became intoxicated, and remember his putting me to bed—on waking up next morning I found I had nothing left; there was missing my gold watch and chain, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and all my clothing ex<lb/>cept my boots and my shirt—the prisoner had deserted—I gave information to the police on the 4th—I saw my watch afterwards on the 18th January—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

You were with Bombardier Black on the steamboat—I do not recollect the name of the public-house we went to in town—there were several artillery-men there—no one joined us, no compan<lb/>ions of ours—there was some singing, and they were all drinking—I did not sing—I did not say I intended to be a soldier if they would take me—I visited Woolwich for pleasure; to enjoy the evening going down on the boat—I had not been employed as assistant at Bleak and Robinson's drapery establishment—we went from the public-house to the barrack-room before 10 o'clock—no one asked me if I was going to London that night—you ac<lb/>companied me to the barracks; no one else—I cannot say what became of your friends—I remember your putting me to bed at the barracks, nothing else—I did not send for beer—I could not say how many men there were, or how many the room would hold—it was a large room—it would hold about 50 men—I do not recollect you asking me for the clothing, or say any<lb/>thing about deserting—I am quite sure I would not give you my clothes and go without them myself—I enlisted, and was soon after admitted to the hospital and afterwards discharged—when I went to the police I wore the clothing of a recruit who was in barracks—I never appeared in barracks in your regimentals—they were taken away by the sergeant-major—there were no non-commissioned officers in the room that I am aware of—I had been employed as a draper's assistant in London previously to visiting Woolwich—I had not been discharged that morning; I had given notice—we leave at a moment's notice if we wish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am provision foreman at Hibernia Wharf, London Bridge—the Gray arrived at the wharf, when I saw eight barrels of mess pork landed—there should have been nine—there was one short—I saw five or six of the barrels opened, 2nd to the best of my belief the quality of the pork was the same as that produced.</p>

I am deputy warehouse keeper and colonial sampler at Hibernia Wharf—I produce two samples of coffee—one was given to me by the detective at the police-court, and the other I drew from a cask taken from the bulk—not from one of the casks on board the Gray, but from the same previous ship—some of the coffee was in barrels, and some in bags—they all bore the same mark—I drew the sample B—A was handed to me by the detective—I believe them to be similar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at Forest Hill—Thatcher was the only goods porter there—hay is kept in the goods yard, and there were 300 or 400 trusses there on 22nd and 23rd January—they are not kept in the porters' room—on 23rd January Stump came to me and I went with him to the goods yard at 7 p.m., and found in the porter's office two trusses of hay—four pieces of paper were put into it, and I arranged with Stump to watch—I saw the trusses at the police station two days afterwards, and saw the two pieces of paper put into each—those two trusses were I should say good hay, they were not thrown aside to be sold as litter—Thatcher had no authority to dispose of it—I was present on the 24th, when Stump accused Thatcher of stealing the hay—he said that he had it to put in the goods room—I questioned him about it, and he admitted that he had sold it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a truss—when there are sweepings of hay in the yard it is cleared up with the rubbish and put in a truck and buried—these are not sweepings—I know Wale, and have seen him in the yard; he came for hay, and always had a consignment note—I never allow goods to be taken away except by persons who have consignment notes.</p>

We have hay in every day—the trucks are run into the goods yard and the hay is unloaded into waggons—once or twice the consignees have stored hay on the premises to release the trucks—I did not touch these two trusses, I could not—I was accountable for 60 trusses, and I charged him with stealing two trusses without going home and counting to see if I had lost any—I have never known the bands burst on unloaning hay, and the only litter has been from the sweepings of the trucks or the droppings from the cart—the two trusses of hay were good serviceable stuff—this is clover—Thatcher came there I think last May; he has a wife and child—he was taken on the 24th.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have known Wale some years—several residents at Forest Hill are here to give him a character—I go into the goods yard occasionally—there is sometimes a litter in the yard from the sweepings of the trucks—we have 700 or 800 trusses a week—all the hay swept up is not appropriated by the company—the sweepings are sent away and sold; We do not give the money to the consignor—I cannot say whether it goes to dividends—I heard Wale say that he was innocent of knowing that it was stolen—Mr. Martin, of Brockley, is a large consignor of hay to our place—he could not have his hay there because there is no siding—the consignor</p>

Litter consists of the sweepings from the trucks—we do not appropriate it to dividends; we burn it—it is of no value—there is not the slightest pretence for saying that this was litter—litter is never concealed in the porters' room—besides the consignment of Mr. Martin's 60 trusses there was another consignment of 80 trusses—I ascertained the value from Mr. Martin—goods are only delivered upon a consignment note unless the consignee comes himself—no goods were consigned to Wale on this occasion—the servants are not allowed to receive gratuities.</p>

On November 4, about 1 o'clock, in consequence of circumstances that came to my knowledge, I went with Harvy to Collingwood Street—it is a very low street, nobody living in it as far as I could see but a lot of costermongers; there were a lot of costermongen' barrows in the street—as we were going down Boundary Street a little girl, between 10 and 12, who stood at the public-house at the corner facing Col<lb/>lingwood Street, called out "Coppers"—she ran into No. 3—I and Harvey ran after her as hard as we could; we pushed her into the passage and ran upstairs—the room door was partly open—I jumped inside to the middle of the floor, and said, "We are policemen"—the prisoner and a man named Hill were in the room—I said, "What about this butter?" the firkin of butter and this cloth were standing beside him; the cover was on, but un-fastened—Hill and the prisoner were standing together—I had no sooner spoken than I was hit on both sides by the two—there was a picture there, and I was driven through the picture—the prisoner ran and jumped through the first-floor window and escaped, and Hill was going downstairs—a dog had hold of me behind—I ran after Hill, brought him back, and threw him down on the floor, and Harvey took possession of him—I then searched the room—I found these 5 pieces of cloth, one of which had on the ticket that has</p>

It was not a bad one, it was good, and I have changed it at another place"—I said "Where did you change it?"—he said "I don't know," or words to that effect—at the station I searched him, and found upon him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze good money—no florin—on the charge being read over to him for uttering on the 27th and also on the 28th he replied "I know nothing about it"—he was taken before the Magistrate on Monday the 30th, remanded, and discharged—he gave his name as Frank Foster, Price Street, Gravel Lane.</p>

He said it was bad. I looked at it, and saw it was a good one; it would not bend. I walked out to a fish shop about eight doors farther and changed it for some fish. I got under the lamp to look at the money and fouud it was good, and then changed it. At the Hat and Feathers I went with another man, and I gave Mrs. Wright the half-crown, and she came back and said it was bad. The other man put it in his pocket and said "I will take it back," and went away as fast as he could. I drank my ale and was leaning by the counter, and then went to light my pipe at the fire, and went out The landlord followed me. I never had the half crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Fowler, of 8, The Oval, Hackney Road—Lloyd is my nephew—he was not living with me—this letter for him came by post—I took it in and opened it—the postmark is December 9th—it is addressed, "Mr. Lloyd, 8, The Oval, Hackney Road, E.," and contained this memorandum. (<hi rend="italic">This was written on the back of one of the Prisoner's shop-papers, bearing his name</hi>.) I gave it to my husband—the prisoner called the next day and asked for Mr. Lloyd—I said, "He does not live here, what do you want with him?"—he said, "I bought some cigars a little time ago, and I wrote a letter"—I said, "Yes, I received one; what do you want with him?"—he said "I want some more of the same sort"—I said, "If you have bought cigars of him don't by any more if you are a respectable tradesman, for he comes by them dishonestly"—he said, "Well, that is what I want to know, for he sold them to me too cheap"—he gave his name Mr. Voss—I said that he was my nephew.</p>

I am a tobacconist, of 517, Hackney Road—on December 13 I received this letter and envelope from Mr. Fowler, and the next day went with him to the prisoner's shop, 98, Old Kent Road—I said, "Are you Mr. Voss?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "I called to speak to you in regard to one Richard Lloyd; have you seen him lately?"—he said, "Not for some time?"—I said, "How long?"—after a short time he said, "Better than a week ago," hesitating; he did not seem to recollect—I said, "Have you written to Richard Lloyd lately?"—after some time he said "I have"—I produced this envelope before he gave that answer, and said, "Is this your handwriting, Mr. Voss?"—he looked at it and said "Yes"—I said, "You know the contents?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "There is no occasion for me to show you," and put it into my pocket, and said, "You have called at 8 the Oval to see Lloyd?"—he said "Yes, I called as I went to Hackney"—I said, "Give me a piece of paper," and he gave me one of the counter papers, on which I wrote my name and address—this is it: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Lodell, 417, Hackney Road, Cambridge Heath, London, 14-12-78. Re Richard Lloyd. Detain goods if he brings. Communicate as above.") I gave that to Voss, but did not tell him why I had come to his shop.

I did not tell him I was a tobacconist or who I was, nor did he know until I wrote the memorandum—I should take this for a London or British made cigar, but it requires a very keen judge to say whether cigars are British or foreign—they do imitate them, but not these.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an army accoutrement maker, of 67, Willow Walk, Bermondsey—at the end of 1877 I had a large contract with the Government for making military valises—I employed the prisoner as an outdoor hand to make them up, for which purpose he would receive some valise backs and some strips of leather called gussets—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, they are part of 25 which were found at Baerd's; they are part of what we gave out to the prisoner to make up—they are stamped with my name before they are given out—I can positively identify 40 out of these 60 gussets found at Dear's—they had been given out to the prisoner during 1877 and the commencement of 1878—I received a communication last year from a man named Baerd, in consequence of which I Went on 17th December to the prisoner's place, 8, Romney Street, Westminster—I said "Potten, I always understood you to be an honest man, but I find you have been disposing of a great quantity of my property"—he said "It is a lie," or something to that effect, "I have not disposed of a pennyworth of your property"—I asked him if he knew a man named Baerd—he said "The only transaction I have had with Baerd was about the selling of a pony"—he also said that Baerd had recommended men to him who he believed had robbed him—Inspector Fox, who was with me, asked him if he had any objection to being confronted with Baerd—he said "No, none whatever"—Fox then went with Kimber over to Southwark Police-court—I afterwards went to Mr. Dear's, the furniture dealer, of Knightsbridge—I had a con<lb/>versation with him and obtained from him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether the endorsement "George Potten" is the prisoner's writing—I then went back to Southwark Police-court and asked the prisoner if he had any conversation with A. and W. Dear, of Knightsbridge—he said "No, none whatever"—I asked him if he had a cheque of A. and W. Dear in his possession—he said "No"—I then showed him the endorsement on this cheque, and after a little hesitation he said "I believe Baerd gave me that cheque in payment of some money borrowed."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The cheque was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 4th February, 1878—he said that he received the cheque from Baerd in payment of some money</p>

               <p>Baerd owed him—I am in a very extensive way of business—there are two other firms who contract with the Government, Ross and Co. and Bryan Brothers, of Westminster—I never heard of Paul and Co. or Bramston and Co. having orders, nor do I think Jones and Co.—Peter Tait and Co. are out of existence; their place is closed—I don't know Middle-more, of Birmingham, who contracted for these things—they have to be of the regulation pattern—the stamping is done at my premises—several boys are employed—everything is not stamped before it goes out, but it is before it is delivered to the Government—Ross and others have their stamp as well—a large order had been given by Government in 1877, and I had to make between 20,000 and 30,000 of them—Ross and Co. and Bryan Bros. I believe also made them—the prisoner has worked for my firm ever since I can remember—the whole of the work was given out to him cut for sewing, and he employs men to sew them—we handed him 200 or 300—Mr. Mayor and Mr. Lovelock gave them to him—there is a book in which a record is kept of the quantities—several articles are handed to him to combine into valises, and there would be so many booked out to him—there would be the number he would have to return—he had not in his employ over a hundred persons to work for me—I am aware that he works largely for Ross and Co., and for Bryan Bros., and has done so for many years—there are not eight or ten other persons who work for me, only about four—they would take stuff out, and I employ about 100 persons indoors, sometimes more—there are only five or six boys to stamp and tie up—the various things are cut out at the warehouse, and would be lying about—I have casually looked through the articles found, they do not all bear my stamp—I speak to the gussets by the way the leather is dressed, and by the particular kind of leather, which I do not think any other manufacturer uses, and also by the rolling—I pledge my oath that they are mine—I have not been going round and making inquiries with reference to these gussets—Ross's and Bryan's use different leather entirely to what I do—there is a difference in the way they use the hides—they are split before they are dressed, and ours are not split at all—there is also a difference in the sewing; there is lock-stitch sewing and machine sewing, mine are always sewn with a lock stitch—Baerd called on me on 11th December, and left his card, but I did not see him—I had never seen him—he called again on Friday, and then I saw him, and went down to his portmanteau shop in Buckingham Street, Pimlico; from there we went first to Willis and Stone's, and from there to Mr. Dear's at Knightsbridge—he is a large portmanteau maker—when I spoke to Potten on the 17th he said "I have not sold anything of yours; I have lost too much already"—he would receive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for making up each of these valises—one man would take a little over two hours to make one—I do not know whether they are paid by the hour or by the piece—I believe they are paid so much for putting the strips on in the different parts or paid for piecemeal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I find on the strips "G. and W.

I am a trunk-maker, of 7, Elizabeth Street, Eyton Square—I have known the prisoner about two years—I was at his workshop in Romney Street at Christmas, 1877, when he showed me a gusset like this before me, and said, "Can you do anything with this?"—I said, "How</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100086"/>
               <p>much apiece?"—he said, "6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "They are too expensive for me, they cut in waste"—I said, "I fancy at better shops they could use them, and I could sell them for you; give me a sample," and he gave me three—he said, "They are wrong cut, and they are from Government"—I took the three to Mr. Adamson, a trunk-maker in Piccadilly, and left one of them there—I then went to Mr. Dear, a trunk-maker in Knightsbridge, and leftone there, and I left one at Mr. Willis's, a trunk-maker in Sloane Street—I had a con<lb/>versation with Mr. Dear, in consequence of which I went with Hudson, who works for me, to the prisoner's premises in January this yea?—I said to the prisoner, "Have you those things ready for me?"—he said, "Yes"—we had a barrow with us, which we left outside—Potten said, "There are 120 gussets and a bag full of basil pieces"—I wanted to carry them on the barrow, and Potten said, "I will take them out for you," and he carried them out and put them on the barrow, two linen sacks full—I said, "Mr. Dear says he would like to see the bulk of them"—Potten said the price was to be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb for the basil pieces, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for the gussets—I did not tell him how many gussets Mr. Dear wanted—I went to Mr. Dear's with a portion of the property on the truck, and left 60 gussets with him, and the basil pieces and 60 gussets at Mr. Willis's—I had a conversation with Mr. Dear as to the price, but he did not make me an offer—I did not settle the bargain with him—Potten afterwards came to my house and said, "Mr. Baerd, I want a little money"—I said, "I have been to Dear's, and he won't give me more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them gussets; you had better come and see Mr. Dear yourself"—I said, "He will not mind giving 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the other leather, only he wants to pick out the best pieces"—I went with the prisoner to Mr. Dear's at 8.30 that night, but the shop was shut—we saw the foreman, to whom I said, "Here is the man that belongs to the leather; you tell him what the governor offers me for it"—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said to the prisoner, "Now, Potton, you see you can believe me; I could not get more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "More fool you"—I said, "You can have the goods back or take the money; you please yourself," and then he said, "You had better take it"—this conversation took place at the Sun public-house, to which Dear's foreman came—on the Monday morning I went to Mr. Dear's by myself, and he gave me a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 60 gussets at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the cheque to Potten's house, but did not see him—I gave it to Mrs. Potten—I took the other pieces of leather from Dear's to Willis's—Potten brought me the checque back two days afterwards, and said, "You must endorse it"—I did so, and gave it back to him—there was no other name. on the back—I do not know Potten's writing—Willis paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in May, as I found he had sold 30 gussets at id., which makes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he also had the basil pieces, that made 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go near Potten for a fortnight, and then he said, "Have you any money with you?"—I said, "What do you call money?"—he said, "I am very short to-night"—I said, "I can give you a half-sovereign. By the bye, Mr. Willis has paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you can have it to-morrow morning. Aren't you going to liquor up?"—he said, "No, you have got all the money"—I said, "You had better send for a shilling's-worth, I will pay for it," and he paid for a shil<lb/>ling's-worth of liquor—we drank it, and he said, "My mother is coming home to-morrow. The old lady said, 'Good-bye,' and I said, 'God bless you.' I must give her half-a-crown"—I gave it to him, and next morning he came to my place and I paid him—Mrs. Potten came to my house next</p>

The painter made the name Baerd outside my shop, and I took the name—that was not because I had a little fire there—I had two fires at my place, and had compensation from the insurance office, but not at the premises at which I now am—one fire was in Waterloo Road, and the other in Theobalds Road—one of my workmen named Brown called my attention to something in December, and I attended with him at' Mr. Chip<lb/>perfield's, who took down Brown's statement of what he could prove—Brown left my employ last Saturday fortnight—he was in my employ then, but I have discharged him since—he was with me nearly 9 months—he was not with me in February or March, 1878, nor in May—I think he was in June—he was not present in June when Potten brought the 25 valise backs—I do not know whether Brown is here—if I had sold the bulk, I dare say Potten would have given me a little discount—I sold them for him on the chance of his giving me something—Hudson was in my employ—he left last April, I think—Brown was his successor—on the day that I gave evi<lb/>dence before the Magistrate against the prisoner/1 went to his house between five and six o'clock—I had charged him with this felony—I found his wife at home—I had been with Hudson before that, and left him in a public-house in Bermondsey—I had been to two public-houses with him—I did not return to Potten's house that evening, nor did I see him—I did not rejoin Hudson—I went home—I had left him in the public-house, promising to return to him—I do not know that he went to Potten's house that even<lb/>ing—I did not express regret to Mrs. Potten for the evidence I gave at the police-court—I did not say, "I am sorry for the evidence I gave to-day; will you forgive me?" nor anything like that—I asked her to tell Potten to come round and see me, as I thought he would come with me to Mr. Almond's next morning—I did not think that, Mr. Almond having given evidence, it would be allowed to drop—he said that he could not compound a felony, but I might do what I liked—I cannot explain myself exactly, but I did it with a good intention—I was going to take Potten round to see Mr. Almond—at the time I made my statement to Mr. Chipperfield he had taken down my evidence—I was at Potten's ten or fifteen minutes with Mrs. Potten all the time—Hudson could not have gone there within two or three minutes of my leaving him, for when I got home he was at my place—he was not at the police-court that day—I did not go to Potten's house on 17th December, the day of the first hearing—it was after the second hearing—Hudson had not been to me at the police-court—it was the day before the hearing that I went with Hudson to the public-house—I had not then been before the Magistrate—I met him at 10 a.m., and he was in my company all that day—I took him to Mr. Almond's first, and then to Mr. Chipperfield's office—when I got home I found him at my</p>

O. U.—I am positive that this cheque was not handed over to the prisoner's niece in part payment of that sum—her name is Burton, I think—she is married—she came and fetched it from my place, and there was no one present—neither Mrs. Perry nor Mrs. Phillips was pre<lb/>sent—I made a statement to Mr. Chipperfield before he examined me in the police-court—I did not say before the Magistrate a single word in reference to the payment of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Willis or Mrs. Potten coming to me and my giving her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said something about the prisoner telling me he would come in the winter, when work was slack, and work up the 25 valises, but I did not say as an inducement to buy them—I do not know one of the men in Mr. Almond's employ, or one who is employed outside—I did not know that Potten worked at Mr. Almond's—I know McGill—he never told me that he was employed there—he works for a trunk-maker—I do not know where he lives or works—he has no place of business—he is one of the outsiders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer living at Tit St. Giles—on Saturday, 19th October, I was in the field where the fire was—I saw the drum and the straw; the drum was standing about 4 yards from the stack of mustard straw; it was a great lump of straw, it was not particularly a stack—there had been threshing going on there for two days before, and it was finished at 12.30 on Saturday—the theshing had been done with the prisoner's machine—the elevator was not there—I saw the engine there, that was taken away about 12.30; it was drawn out by horses—there was no road from the stack into the road, only what was left unploughed; it was an unploughed piece of the field—there was a road left straight up to the headland, and then from the headland up to the gate—there was a man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100092"/>
               <p>there named Joseph Hill who had been feeding the machine—I saw the prisoner there that day, and heard Hill say to him "What are you going to do with the old drum, are you going to pull her out of the way?"—Mr. Matthews said "No, it don't matter about her, I shall have her away on Monday morning"—I was about 6 yards from the drum at this time—I did not notice whether there was any straw under the drum at that time or not—I did not notice whether the shafts were on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was engaged for Mr. Dearlove during the whole of the thrashing—it began on the Thursday morning between 9 and 10 o'clock; they left off about 4 o'clock that afternoon; they broke a riddle—I don't know what time they worked on the Friday, I should say they began about 7.20, and left off a few minutes after 5 o'clock, as near as I can tell—before beginning work they would of course have to get up the steam—on Saturday we left off about 12.30; I believe they were done—I don't know how Mr. Matthews's men were paid—our men make half days and three-quarters—cloths are used in threshing, to lay under the machine to catch the waste seed—it is not always the custom in a mustard field to place straw under the machine on which to place the cloths; the object of putting the straw is to keep the cloths from the wet—I have threshed hundreds of days without straw, and hundreds of days I have had to put a great lot under—I will not take my oath that there was not straw under there on the Saturday, or that there had not been for the three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I would not pledge my oath one way or the other whether there was or was not straw—you can crawl very well under the axle of the machine and the blower—the blower comes rather lower than the axle—the riddle of the drum broke some time between 3 and 4 o'clock on the Friday; that entailed a loss of time—I don't know whether the men got paid for their time notwithstanding that—Mr. Dearlove had five men at work the first day; I can't say how many Mr. Matthews had, I should say seven, perhaps he might have eight, I did not count them—15 or 16 in all were employed about the threshing after the first day; out of that number I should say Mr. Matthews employed eight or nine after the first days.</p>

I did not come out of the Butchers' Arms with him at 8 o'clock; it was about 10 minutes past 8—I was not outside when he came out; I came out just after him—I don't know the field where this stack was set fire to—going down the road from the Butchers' Arms it is a straight line to the fire—I saw no fire at 10 minutes past 8—I walked towards my own home; that is the opposite way from the fire—I live about a quarter of a mile from the Butchers' Arms—I went straight home, I only stopped when they shouted "Fire"—it was about half-past 8 when I saw the fire.</p>

I live at Leverington, Parson Drove, and work for my father, who has a machine—on Sunday evening, 20th October, my attention was called to the fire—I saw it—I was at a village called Gorfield, about two miles off, when I first saw it—that is to the north of the fire, towards Wisbeach—it was about a few minutes past eight when I first saw it, to the best of my belief from five to eight minutes past—I did not look at my watch—it was a wonderful large blaze—I ran to the fire—I should think I must have been about twenty minutes in getting to it—I was not the first who got there—I think one had been there, and gone away again—when I got there the straw was on fire—a good deal of it was burnt, and ultimately all the straw was burnt—the drum was right close to the straw stack—the shafts were on the drum, and the straw was burning between the shafts—the shafts were wonderful hot—I and others took the shafts of the machine—there was a good deal of straw between the shafts—I should think it was piled about four or five feet from the ground—it was above the shafts, at the end of them—the shafts were shoved underneath the straw, the straw laid on the shafts—the tops of the shafts were touching the ground—there was straw underneath the bottom of the drum that had not caught fire—the straw that was on fire was between the shafts—we got some forks and cleared it all away—it was blazing, and wonderful hot.</p>

It depends upon what sort of land you are on, whether you place straw under the machine when threshing, whether it is lowland or highland—it is not all lowland there, it is flat, but some of it is won<lb/>derful wet, and some dry—the whole district about there is perfectly flat, but it is well drained—there are several hedges in some parts—there are no hedges between where I caught sight of the fire and the fire itself—there are very few trees—I am the son of a machine-man—the coals are generally supplied by the farmer on whose land it is—we do not want any horses there, we take ours by steam—we are forced to have a traction engine, because the farmer objects to supply horse-power—some of the men who work the machine get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—I don't know what</p>

               <p>until the police-constable called me up about 11 o'clock at night"—he also said again that he was not insured for that drum, neither for a new traction<lb/>engine; he said he had two sets insured—a set consists of an engine, a drum, and a jack-straw or elevator—next day when I went there I saw a water-tub in his cart that he was riding in; he was then in the ground where the fire was—he was there before me; he might have taken up the tub that morning—I can't tell how long he had been there before I got to the ground—it is 189 or 198 yards from Poplar Drove Gate to the stack, but I did not go in at that gate, I went in at Mill Lane gate—I can't tell you how far that is from the stack, it is near 400 yards—Poplar Drove runs on one side of the field and Mill Lane on the other—I did not notice the prisoner till he came up the ground—I know the roadway from the stack to Poplar Drove—there was a headland of ground left; there was nothing to prevent the cart going over it—on the first occasion before the Magistrate I was not represented by a professional man; the case was then dismissed—after it was dismissed I got a letter from Mr. Sidney Ollard, who appeared for the prisoner; this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "November 11th, 1878. Sir,—I am instructed by Mr. James Matthews, of Parson Drove, to apply to you with reference to the serious charge preferred by you against him, namely, that of setting fire to your mustard straw, such charge being wholly false and unfounded As Mr. Matthews has, through your unjustifiable proceedings in the matter, suffered great anguish of mind, and been put to considerable expense, I am instructed by him to inform you that unless you do, on or before Thursday next, fully apologise to him for your conduct and pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, legal proceedings for substantial damages will be forthwith commenced against you, without further notice. Yours, &amp;c., Sidney Ollard.") On getting that letter I went to my solicitor, Mr. Jackson, the Clerk to the Magistrates; he could not act because he was Clerk to the Magistrates, and I went to Mr. Wilkin and put the case in his hands—he had the conduct of the case before the Magistrates—a great number of fresh witnesses were called.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Superintendent</hi>). I produce a policy effected with the Norwich Union Fire Insurance—I got it from the Magistrates' Clerk—I know the prisoner's pony, it is quick and quite capable of trotting ten or twelve miles an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It may be broken-kneed since I saw it—I have been inspector in that neighbourhood five years, and have seen the pony at different times—I have never ridden behind it—I have never before said that it would go ten or twelve miles an hour because I was never asked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Frews and Wright, solicitors, of Wis<lb/>beach, and agent to the Norwich Union Fife Insurance Office—I manage their insurance business—I know the prisoner—he came there on 15th Jan., 1876, and insured three threshing machines for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, two of which were made by Foster and the third by Clayton and Shuttleworth, which is the one mentioned in this policy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave it as dated 1873—that refers to the year—that policy is not now in force—it was in force until last Christmas, that would be after the fire took place. (<hi rend="italic">This policy was dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1876. <hi rend="italic">Annual premium</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on a thresh<lb/>ing machine, straps, cloths, and utensils belonging, by Clayton and Shuttle-worth, dated</hi> 1873, <hi rend="italic">and a straw elevator for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)</p>

               <p>numbers, and he could not supply them—I asked for the dates when they were made, and he gave those dates—this conversation was on 18th January, 1876, three years ago—I kept no record of what took place on that occasion beyond the entry in this book—my attention was not called to it till this case arose, and then by referring to the book, and seeing the dates 1873, 1874, and 1875, I am able to say that those were the years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Those entries were made at the time the policies were re<lb/>ceived from the head office—policies entered "February, 1876, "were entered in February, 1876, and not within the last year or two.</p>
