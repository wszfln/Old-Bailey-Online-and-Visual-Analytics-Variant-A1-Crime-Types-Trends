I am a servant at Alford House, Prince's Gate—on 14th or 10th November last I was in the Brompton Road between 4 and 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoners with another man—Williams was dressed as a baker, with flour about his clothes, Cameron was dressed about the same as he is now—Williams had a bird in a bag and Cameron had one in a cage, which he wanted to give, with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to Williams for his bird—Williams would not take it; he walked on—I heard Cameron and the other man say that it was a good bird, and the other man told Cameron to go and <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> Williams out of it—Cameron went after Williams and said that the bird was no good, and he bad better take the money—Williams would not hear anything he had to say about it, and ran on—I went after him, and he turned and said to me "Would you let them have the bird"—I said "No, I heard them say it was a good bird and worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "You can have it, if you like, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"—I said I did not want it—he said he wanted it to have a good home, that he had caught it in the bake house, that it whistled beautifully, but he was obliged to part with it, as his mistress overhead was very ill and could not bear the whistling of it, and as he was obliged to sell it, he would take 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—at that time Cameron came up and said he very much wanted the bird and he would give 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, that he had not the money with him, but if Williams would come to his house in the Edgware Road he would give him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Williams declined to do</p>

               <p>so, as his time was up to be in to his work—Cameron was jumping about I pretending he should lose all chance of buying the bird, and I was induced I to buy it on the condition that Cameron should come in the course of an hour with the money and fetch the bird, and if not Williams was to have it back—Williams said that he lived at Mr. Flack's, the baker's, just over the way, and had lived there five years—he went home with me, and I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and took the bird—the prisoners never came to the house after<lb/>wards—I put the bird in a cage with some water, and it got into the water and washed all the paint off, and in three or four days I found it dead in the water—it was a sparrow.</p>

On Saturday morning, 9th June, about 2.45, I was on duty at the corner of Albert Terrace, and saw the prisoner, with two other young men, standing at the corner—I watched them from one street to another, and they watched me for a considerable time—I went down the next street, and saw them all three again at the corner of Russell Court—they went through there, and I lost sight of them for about ten minutes—I next saw them in Chapel Street; the prisoner was on the pavement and the other two were in the court—I concealed myself in a doorway—they all three crossed the road into White Conduit Street, and stayed there about three minutes—the prisoner came back to the corner and looked down Chapel Street—there was no other person in the street—I went back to Albert Terrace and saw the prisoner leave the doorstep of No. 2—as soon as he saw me he ran away, down Albert Street into Denmark Street—I went the reverse way and met him—I took hold of his arm, and asked him what he was loitering about for at that hour in the morning—he said "Nothing," that he lived in Elliott's Place, Essex Road, and he could not sleep for the bugs—I said "Where are those other two men that were with you a few minutes ago"—he said "Gone to work"—I said "Where"—he said "At Batey's Ginger-Beer Manufactory"—I said "Where do you work"—he said "At a milk shop in Camden Terrace"—I took him back to the corner of Albert Terrace, and discovered the fanlight of No. 2 wide open—I rang Mr. Prior up, and when he came down I took the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Bankruptcy Court, and produce the proceedings in bankruptcy of the prisoner—the petition was filed on the 9th October, 1876—the act of bankruptcy was the failure to obey a debtor's summons—I have the affidavit of service of Samuel Daniel—the prisoner was adjudged a bankrupt on 30th October, 1876—the first meeting of creditors was on 14th November, when Mr. John Vale was appointed trustee; December 9th was appointed for the prisoner's public examination—I have here a note that he failed to attend—on 20th December a warrant was issued for his apprehension—there is also a statement filed by the prisoner on 19th May, 1877—the debts are returned as 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the assets 890<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a labourer living at 7, Prince's Street, Drury Lane—on the 27th May, between 7 and 8 o'clock p.m., I was in the kitchen, the prisoner was standing near the window—Gleed was near the sink washing up some things—I heard the prisoner say "You—I hate you and your b——country, before you leave this house I'll put you on the fire and roast you to death"—Gleed crossed to the other side of the kitchen, saying "You will do for me will you, I want nothing to say to you, I have heard of you before"—the prisoner then ran and caught hold of Gleed, and stabbed him—I rushed between them, and putting my hand up received the blow on the back of my hand which was cut—the prisoner then fell to the ground with the knife in his hand; I missed Gleed at that time—I said to the men in the kitchen "He has stabbed me too"—I gave him in charge in the street—my wound was bound up at the hospital—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 658, Commercial Road—about 5.45 a.m. on 26th May, I was called to the deceased—he had then been dead probably two or three minutes—I could tell that he bad died from haemorrahage—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination forty-eight hours afterwards—both lungs were very much diseased, especially the left—there was a cavity in it, and the vessels had given way and caused the hæmorrhage—I have heard the evidence—I have no doubt that the struggle accelerated his death—he might have lived for a month if free from care and excitement, but such a struggle as this would bring about a fatal issue—death was caused by hæmorrhage from the lungs, the predisposing cause of which was long<lb/>standing disease, but the exciting cause was the struggle.</p>

I stopped at the same time. He searched him, but did not search me. The deceased had two papers in his hand, and he caught me and said "Where are you going?" and cut my lip. I seized his hand and said "What are you doing?" He seized me, and we went to the ground, he below and I on top. He walked up to his box, and the constable took hold of me. I believe there is a witness here who was coming out at the gate with me, but I do not know his name. Nothing was found on me when Douglas searched me except what I worked with. I suppose he heard that the man was dead, for he came back and said "Put the handcuffs on him." I said "You won't put any handcuffs on me," and he jumped up on a stool, reached a staff, and dealt me a blow over the eye. I sat in a corner, and the hand<lb/>cuffs were put on.</p>

               <p>bed, and I could see that they had been-sick—by my persuasion Mrs. Hall took Jane to a doctor—she was away about half an hour, and the three other children were sick while she was away—she came back without Jane, and she and I took the other three children to the doctor and Jane and Frank were taken to the hospital; the other two were brought back—I saw two bottles on the floor in a corner of the work-room that afternoon; these appear to be them. (<hi rend="italic">One of these was labelled "Laudanum.</hi>") They are empty—Mrs. Hall took hold of them and took them to the doctor's when she took Jane—the other children were then living there; they are well.</p>

I live at 23, Gerard Street, Soho—on 8th June, a little after 3.30 Jane Hall was brought to me by her mother—I saw that she was suffering from a narcotic and administered an emetic—the mother showed me these two bottles, which smelt of laudanum—I kept the child three hours and sent the mother to fetch the other three, which she did—Frank and Annie were suffering from a narcotic, but the baby did not appear to be sleepy at all—I sent the other two to the hospital—laudanum would produce the effect I saw—in a child of this age, if it had no assistance, thirty to forty drops would be a fatal dose—I should think Jane had had a large quantity; I cannot say how much, I judge from the effect.</p>

I am resident medical officer at Charing Cross Hospital—on Friday evening, 8th June, the little girl Jane was brought there; she was holding her mother's hand and staggering, she was intoxicated—the boy seemed very tired, but nothing very noticeable—I looked at their eyes, the pupils of both were contracted, especially the girls', which were contracted to a pin's point; that would be caused by the narcotic, such as laudanum; that would account for the intoxication—they both vomited per<lb/>fectly clear saliva—after a child has been sick from natural causes that would be the kind of vomit—they were discharged cured on, I think, the 14th—laudanum is a very dangerous thing to administer to young children—I think their lives were endangered.</p>

From information I received from the pawnbroker I went to Chelsea Barracks with the pawnbroker—the sergeant-major sent for the prisoner, and I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing a watch and chain in Hyde Park—he said "I didn't steal it; I bought it of a man at the Grapes public-house for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him to produce it; he said he had sold it to a man outside a public-house, but did not know him or the public-house—I asked if anybody was with him, and he said "Yes, Venables, the man who was with me when I went to pawn it; he saw me sell it"—after the prisoner was confined in the guard-room the sergeant major sent for Venables—I told him who I was, and that I should take him in custody for being concerned in disposing of the watch—he said he had nothing to do with the watch, and had only been with the prisoner when he went to pawn it—he went before the prisoner and made the same statement, and the prisoner didn't deny it—I searched the prisoner and found this purse, which I laid down in the guard-room—I asked him how he came by it, and said "How long have you had it?" and he said "About nine mouths"—I took them to the station and sent for the prosecutor, who identified the purse and the prisoner—the charge was read over, and he made some statement about buying the watch.</p>

I am an auctioneer's assistant at 55, Duke Street, West Smithfield—on Friday, 25th May, I was in Newgate Street, about 8 p.m., and going towards Cheapside on the left hand side of the way—I saw two <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> go towards Holborn Viaduct, a yellow and a green one—they were near the General Post-office, and I was near King Edward Street—the yellow one was about the middle of the road, behind the green one, which was near the kerb on the left hand side, and both were going at a furious rate, though I am no judge of the pace of horses; they were gallop<lb/>ing—after they had passed me, I turned back and saw them in collision—I walked back and saw the large wheel of one <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> caught in the hind wheel of the other, and one of the horses was down with its leg nearly on the pavement, but I cannot say of which <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—there was a man and a barrow against the kerb on the left hand side, going towards Holborn—he was knocked down and run over, and the hind part of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was turned round towards the other side of the road—I attended to the man and took him to St. Bartholo<lb/>mew's Hospital—I did not see a mail cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On 2nd November a man named Morris Cohen was brought to the Bethnal Green station, and I entered the charge, which was unlawfully receiving a pianoforte, value 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which bad been obtained by fraud from Jules Gautier—he was brought up at Worship Street on that charge on 3rd November, and remanded till the 10th; bail was accepted, but it was not obtained till, I think, the 8th or 9th—there were three remands, and the last hearing and committal was on the 24th, and on the 25th the depositions were completed—on 4th November I went to Cohen's premises in the Minories, which had the appearance of a wholesale dealer's in boots and shoes, but inside the warehouse I found a large quantity of goods of various descriptions, and musical instruments—on 10th November Ann Hardy attended to give evidence with reference to a piano of hers, obtained by false pretences, but there was no charge entered against Cohen with respect to that—I first went to the City Bank on 10th November, and saw one of the clerks there—I went again on 12th November, and saw the defendant Gliddon there, the manager—I went there in conse<lb/>quence of this letter received from him. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Private. The City Bank, Aldgate Branch, November 11th, 1876. Mr. Inspector O'Callaghan. Sir,—re M. Cohen. I am sorry I did not see you here yesterday, but I shall feel much obliged if you will call upon me here on Monday between 11 and 12, or Tuesday the same hour. The fact is, that, believing in the entire innocence and integrity of the prisoner, I have agreed to be a witness as to his character, but if he be a well-known receiver of stolen property, and known to the police as such, I should prefer aiding the police to obtain a conviction than to assist one of the worst kind of criminals. I shall be pleased, therefore, to tell you all I know, and would only urge you to thoroughly investigate the character and conduct of Cohen that the real truth may be arrived at, and if he be bad, I should, of course, prefer not being mixed up in it I am, Sir, yours obediently, A. Gliddon, Manager.") I alluded to the receipt of the letter, and he said he was at the police court when I called on the 10th, and had not returned—he asked my opinion about the case—I expressed a belief in Cohen's guilt, and said "There will be a number of other charges with regard to a man named Francis, goods obtained by him having been found on Cohen's premises, and taking that into account, and having regard to all the facts, I have no doubt of Cohen's guilt"—he said "Of course you must do your duty, but you must remember what will be the fate of his wife and daughters if he is convicted, and not press him more than you can help"—he said "Cohen has done only what is done every day in the City, buying goods without asking too many questions, or something like it, but one of the clerks expressed his dissent from that remark—I told him I had not called about Cohen, but about a man named Francis, who had dealings with Cohen, and had an account at the same bank—understood him to say he had no account, but only paid in enough to meet cheques as they were drawn—I found him in John Street, Minories—I was serving a warrant at the time, and I told Gliddon so—on 17th November I was at the police-court—the case was then in the hands of Mr. Wontner, on behalf of the Treasury—when I was at the police-court on 10th November, Danziger was sitting in the solicitor's box, with Cohen's wife and daughters, and Mr.</p>

               <p>Gautier's solicitor applied to the Court to allow his client to withdraw from the prosecution—that was at the opening of the case, and Mrs. Hardy had not given her evidence—three pianos had been found on the premises that morning, and J told the Magistrate that there would be other charges forthcoming, and I put forward Mrs. Hardy, and having heard that, the Magistrate declined to allow the case to be withdrawn—I had seen Mr. Barrett, the salesman of the Anglo-Continental Company, and the manager, also; neither of them appeared at the police-court on the 10th or the 17th, they had been summonsed to appear—on the 19th Mrs. Hardy's evidence was gone into, and the case was remanded to the 24th—Gliddon and Danziger were present on 17th; I cannot speak positively about Lazarus—I think they were all three there on 25th, when Cohen was committed on both charges—the case of Mrs. Hardy's piano was proceeded with in this Court.</p>

I have produced this charge-sheet—the charge is "Morris Cohen, 28, St. Peter's Street, Mile End Road, shipper and leather merchant;" I took that description from him—I put Jules Gautier, as of 62, Camden Road, St. Pancras, pianoforte manufacturer, under the head of person charging—he was the only prisoner at the time—under the head of charge how disposed of by Magistrate, and what offence proved; I have entered that there was a remand to the 10th, 17th, and 24th, and then tried Central Criminal Court," that means, the Magistrate committed him for trial at that time; I found that Gliddon was the acting manager of the Aldgate Branch, of the City Bank, the clerk asked my name and address and I told him—I made inquiries about Francis' account and mentioned Cohen's name in connection with him, I then received the letter, and on the Monday, I think the 12th, I went to the bank and Gliddon told me that the bank was opened in May, 1876, and he had been manager since then—he also told me he had been manager of the branch at Pad<lb/>dington, he did not say that Francis' account had been opened by a previous manager and not by him—he said that he had not seen Francis that he could remember except once—the clerk told me that a good many inquiries from banks had been made in regard to Francis, and Gliddon told me the same—he mentioned Mr. Hillman, the previous manager, and said that Francis had a respectable reference—I do not remember whether Francis' account was opened by him or not—it is my impression that he said "Buying goods without asking too many questions," and the clerk differed with him—he told me that he firmly believed in Cohen's innocence, but he said "Of course you know more about him than has been given in evidence"—I did not see Francis' account; I asked the state of it and they said that he had no balance—Cohen's account was not shown to me, and I did not inquire about it—I understood him to say that Cohen had been an old customer of the bank, but he could not be of that branch as it only opened in May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jules Gautier, a pianoforte maker, who was defrauded out of a piano on November 1—I gave evidence before the Magistrate on 3rd November with reference to the charge against Cohen—I remember seeing Gliddon and Lazarus there that day, but not Danziger; we had no conversation—the case was remanded till the 10th and on the evening of the 9th. Gliddon and Lazarus called, but my husband was out—Gliddon asked how long he would be; I said that he might be in a few minutes—he waited some time, and then said "Could I see in the morning?"—I said "You will have to be very early, because we have to attend at the police-court."—he said "'That is just what we have come about; it is a dreadful affair altogether about Mr. Cohen; I have known him myself for twenty-five years and I know he is quite innocent, and this affair has put bis family in great distress of mind, and we have called on you to-night to see your husband to induce him not to prosecute, him as I know he is innocent of the charge"—I did not ask him who he; was he gave me his card—he said "Do you know whether he has instructed a solicitor?"—I said "I think he has instructed some one"—he said "Do you know who it is? "I said "I think it is some one in Gray's Inn Lane, but I don't know the name—he said "Do you know the solicitor's private residence?"—I said "I do not"—he said "We can see the solicitor, which will save your husband the trouble of going to the court in the morning"—he said "What did you pay for your instrument?"—I said "25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said 'Weil, we will pay you the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the piano, and you must have been at some expense, we will pay all your expenses besides, and see you are not out of pocket by it"—I told him I was sorry, as he knew Mr. Cohen was inno<lb/>cent that he had got into trouble, and I hoped he would be able to prove his innocence—when he said there was no occasion for my husband to appear in the morning, I said "But what about the Anglo-Pianoforte Com<lb/>pany? "—he said "We have settled with them, and they will not appear"—he stayed a little while waiting for my husband, and had some private conversation with Lazarus, perhaps a dozen words, and he said "I can't stop any longer, I shall be at Paddington to-night, if you want me you know where to find me," and he went away, leaving Lazarus, who remained till</p>

               <p>my husband came, about 8 o'clock; they had a conversation, but I did not hear it all because a customer came in and spoke to him—my husband went for a policeman, as Lazarus would not give his card—I heard my hus<lb/>band say "I believe Cohen is a rogue, and you are another; you want me to compound a felony, and I would not do it fur 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," or words to that effect—I went to Worship Street next morning and saw Gliddon and Lazarus, but I am not sure Danziger was there—he was pointed out to us one day at Worship Street; I don't know which—they had no conversation with me that morning—the case was heard and remanded to the 17th, and on the evening of the 16th Gliddon came with one of Cohen's daughters—I do to him "What about the old lady?" meaning Mrs. Hardy, who I heard give her evidence on the 11th—he said "We have seen Mrs. Hardy, and she will not prosecute, and you will be left alone, and it will be a great expense to you and cost you a lot of money"—he said he would return at 9 o'clock, as I said I thought my husband would be in then, but instead of returning at 9 o'clock he came at 8 o'clock with Miss Cohen and saw my husband—on every occasion he said that if we could get Cohen out of trouble it would be a good thing for us, as Cohen was a large shipper of pianos and would recommend us—we went before the Court next morning, the 17th, and the case was remanded to the 24th—on the evening of the 23rd Gliddon called with Miss Cohen and Danziger; he introduced Danziger as Miss Cohen's intended and said they were to be married, and said what a pity it was this had happened, and there was the same proposition as before—Gliddon asked whether we had received a subpoena—I said I did not think so—he said "Because if you have had no subpoena, there is no occasion to appear"—he also said there was no doubt that the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could be put in some one's hands until the case was over, or something like it—he went away, but Danziger and Miss Cohen staid till 10.30 and then left without seeing my husband—we went to the Court the next morning, when I believe the depositions were read over and we had to sign them.</p>

               <p>that is very possible, but nevertheless you must admit you were hasty in giving him in charge"—I said "The reason I gave him in charge was because he told me so many falsehoods this morning"—he said "What falsehoods?"—I said "Well, he told me that the piano had gone in the first place to his house, back to the Minories, and back again to his house, whereas we know very well that the piano did not go to his house, but went to a public-house, the Devonshire Arms"—he said "Oh, that is where the mistake is, I can easily explain that to you, it is quite true that the van stopped at the Devonshire Arms, but while the men were there some of the men went to Cohen's house"—I said "I thought that might be the explanation given of that," and rose from my seat—he asked me to sit down and listen to him—I said "No, I have beard quite enough will you oblige me with your card"—he pointed to a card lying on the piano; I picked it up and found it was that of Mr. Alfred Gliddon—I asked my wife whether that was this gentleman's card—she said "No, his friend gave it to me"—I asked him for his own card—he said that he had none—I said "Then give me your name hand address, will you?"—he said "No, I won't, I don't see why I should, in fact when I came here I thought I was coming to speak to a gentleman, but I find I have made a mistake"—I said "Well, I want your name and address, and if you don't give it to me I shall lock you up"—he said that I had no right to demand it—I said "Well, I will show you," and locked the door and went out—I also said "You and your friend have come here for the purpose of compounding a felony, and under those circumstances I consider I have a perfect right to know who you are"—he appealed to my wife and a gentleman who was there, and said "What have I done, I have said nothing—I fetched a policeman, and when I got to my house again Lazarus was coming down the steps, and said "You have imprisoned an innocent man, you will repent if it costs us 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I replied "I believe Cohen is a thief, and you are another"—he said "And so are you"—next morning the 10th, I went to the police-court, and Mr. Gliddon spoke to me outside the Court—he touched me on the shoulder and said "Are you Mr. Gautier?"—I said "Yes"—I knew who he was, because he had been pointed out to me—I said "What for?"—he said "On behalf of Mr. Cohen"—I said "You had better speak to my solicitor," pointing to a gentleman with me—I stood close by, and Gliddon said to my solicitor "I can assure you Mr. Cohen is a very honest, upright man. There are many men here, some of them influential City merchants, ready to speak well of him. This is an unfortunate affair for him; he has been made the dupe of either Mr. Harris or Hart"—that is the man who took the piano off the premises—my solicitor said "What is it you want my client to do?"—he said "Well, let him keep away, he has no need to appear"—he said "I cannot advise him to do that"—Gliddon said "Well, you do as you like, but you will find that we are so thoroughly satisfied with Mr. Cohen's respectability and innocence that we shall spare no expense in his defence, and we shall obtain remand after remand, so that it will be a source of trouble, expense, and anxiety to your client"—he also said that the Anglo-Continental Company had withdrawn from the case, and written a letter to the Magistrate to that effect—my solicitor said "The only thing that can be done is to make application to a solicitor, asking his advice whether ray client had not better withdraw the charge"—Mr. Gliddon then said "Oh, that will do, we don't want anything illegal or irregular, and if you do that,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187706250051"/>
               <p>that is all we want you to do"—I afterwards went into Court, and there was another remand—I heard an application made for permission to with<lb/>draw the charge, but in consequence of another charge being made against Cohen the Magistrate declined to allow me to withdraw from the prosecution—on 16th November, the evening before the further hearing, Gliddon came to my house with Miss Cohen, and said what a pity it was for Mr. Cohen to have got into this trouble and bother, and it was a bad job for those daughters of his, and he could assure me that he was an innocent, upright man, and no doubt, after he got out of his trouble, he would be a good customer of mine, and would recommend me to his friends, many of whom were shippers or merchants; that the Continental Company had been settled with, and had received the price of their pianos, and would not appear, as they had withdrawn from it altogether, and that Mrs. Hardy also would not appear, as they had arranged that, and there would be no one there; I should be the only one—I replied that those considerations could not have the slightest influence on my conduct in the morning, because if I found myself left alone, the better course for me to pursue would be to cause the application to be made again—Danziger was at my house once; he came with Miss Cohen after the committal.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th Nov. I was at Mrs. Hardy's when Danziger called with Miss Cohen—there was a suggestion that what was said should he said in my presence, and he said that he came to ask Mrs. Hardy to withdraw from the charge, and that they were willing to pay her 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him she could not accept the money, it would be compromising the case, and that I did not believe Cohen was innocent, and I bad reason to believe other cases would be brought against him—he said that in order to satisfy me he should like me to see Mr. Gliddon, the manager of the City Bank, who would satisfy me of her innocence—I made an appointment to meet Danziger the next day—I said when he was leaving "I have not the pleasure of knowing your name," he looked at me, and said "Ah! that is where I have the advantage of you"—I heard his name in Court for the first time—he called on the 15th, and I went with him to the bank at Aldgate—I had not arranged to go there, but to a lawyer, and he took me to Gliddon's instead—he had mentioned the name of Mr. Mullins, the solicitor to the Banker's Association, which I mentioned to Mr. Gliddon when I saw him, and he said that he would not advise us to go there, because he was not a good criminal lawyer, and suggested another gentle<lb/>man in Basinghall Street—he also said that he was perfectly satisfied that Cohen was innocent, and that Mrs. Hardy could withdraw, and the money, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could be deposited with him—Danziger and I went off to see the other solicitor, and Mr. Gliddon went part of the way with us; we walked, and he left us by the Royal Exchange—it was suggested that a paper should be drawn out for Mrs. Hardy to sign, for the solicitor to instruct counsel to withdraw, and Danziger said that he would pay the expense if she would withdraw, but I did not agree to that—as we came down the stairs of the solicitor's office, we met Gliddon, he returned with us, and the lawyer repeated the advice he had given us, and going along Gliddon said that Danziger could deposit three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes with him, and that he should hold the money—I said that I could not accept that as I knew Cohen was guilty, and it would be compromising the case, and I knew the Treasury were going to take it up—further conversation took place, and we again repeated our refusal to withdraw—in the evening Danziger called at Mrs. Hardy's again for her to sign a paper to withdraw, but I did not see it—I told him it was no use his coming, we should not withdraw under any circumstances—he said that Mrs. Hardy could say that she had been satisfied by Mr. Gliddon of Cohen's innocence; I said that we were not satisfied, we bad no evidence to that effect—on the following Friday, the 17th, the case was before the Magistrate at Worship Street, but I was not called—I saw Danziger there before the case came on, who said "It is all right, you can have the money, it is deposited with Mr. Gliddon"—I said we should repeat our refusal, as the Treasury had taken the matter up, and I had nothing more to do with it—Gliddon was then a short distance off—I spoke to him in Court, and he said "The 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is all right with me, you can take it out when you like"—I said "No, it is all wrong, the Treasury have taken the matter up, and we want to have nothing more to do with either of you—I communicated with the Treasury; I did not see them again till Cohen was convicted here—I saw Gliddon then.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "As requested by your letter of yesterday, and upon the understanding that the costs herein, amounting to 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10rf., are sent me by return of post, I enclose the conveyance duly executed.

Reeve, Esq., Lowestoft, Coastguard"—all the cheque is in my writing except the signa<lb/>ture, and the endorsement, I know nothing about the endorsement—Mr. Fullager waited while I wrote out the cheque, and I then handed him the book with the cheque in it to take to Mr. Bristowe to sign—he took it and went into Mr. Bristowe's room, he was gone about ten minutes—he then returned and said that Mr. Bristowe declined to sign it, but that he—would do so on Monday—this was between 1 and 2 o'clock, the office closes rather early on Saturday, I used always to go away at 2 o'clock on Saturday—while Mr. Fullagar was gone I got the cash-book and entered the cheque, thinking it would be signed as a matter of course—this is the entry: "27, January, Mr. R. H. Reeve, Lowestoft, Coastguard, 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—as if it were a cash payment—if that cheque had been brought back to me signed, it would not have been my duty to do anything further with it, Mr. Fullagar would bring it back and write the letter, if I had had to send it, it would have been my duty to cross it; I make it a rule always to cross cheques, either at the time I draw it or before it goes away—Mr. Fallagar brought back the cheque and the book to me on the Saturday, and I locked it up in my drawer till the Monday—on the Monday; he came to me and said "I will take that cheque for Mr. Bristowe's signature"—I handed him the book, he took it in to take to Mr. Bristowe to get it signed—I did not see him do so, he took it away, I saw no more of it that day that I remember—we had separate rooms, Fullagar's room adjoined mine—Mr. Lindsay and I occupied one room, and Peter the messenger had a temporary seat there for a time as we had not any room for him—we had no letter book, a draft is kept of letters sent, which is kept with the other papers—it would have been Fullagar's duty to write that letter—search has been made and no such letter can be found, I was in the habit of entering as cash paid, merely on the signature of a cheque—if I had to send away a cheque it would be the ordinary course to make an entry of it in the day-book, which is a rough book where everything is entered, the whole of the office business; the</p>

               <p>prisoner made entries in it, it was open to all, it was the office book, any person sending such a letter would make the entry, but Mr. Lindsay generally made the entries, although others might do the act, and I did it myself frequently—this entry was made by me: "January 29th, letter to Mr. Reeve with cheque for costs 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a bill of costs"—I made that entry, seeing that there was not one made, and seeing a letter to Mr. Reeve in the letter-box—the letter-box is on the mantelpiece, in which all letters going away are put—I think I saw that in the afternoon, it was a foolscap envelope with an enclosure of course, a thickish envelope, with "On H. M. Service" printed on it, and with the Admiralty solicitor's blue-seal, one of the official envelopes—I saw the direction on it, it would be in Mr. Fullagar's handwriting, he having written the letter—I saw the address as far as I recollect—I am able to say that I did—I could not say positively in whose handwriting it was, but Mr. Fullagar having written the letter, it would be in his—there was nothing at all unusual in my making the entry, although I did not do the business, it was the usual thing, it was a sort of con<lb/>fidence in the office, we did not think anything about it, we trusted to each other, it is at page 16—the body of the page is Mr. Lindsay's—I had to draw three other cheques on the Monday; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I had the duty of sending those away—I have crossed them; that was my practice when sending them away—the first one, as to Blake, would be entered to the day-book, not the others, because they did not relate to any particular business; they would be entered in the cash-book—I believe Mr. Fullagar took them in with the other cheque for Mr. Bristowe's signature—Peter Dameral, the messenger, had to take the letters from the box just before 5 o'clock, and take them to Whitehall to go into the official bag—the three cheques are entered in the cash-book on 29th January, "Messrs. Blake, Cromer, Coastguard, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Messrs. Moulton, law stationers' account, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Mr. Hansard, votes, Session 1877, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—only Messrs. Blake's cheque is entered in the day-book; the latter part of that entry ib my writing, and the former part Mr. Lindsay's—I wrote that letter and enclosed the cheque in an envelope, put it in the rack, and Dameral would take it to the post; that would be the ordinary course—I was examined at Bow Street—do not recollect Mr. Fullagar making up the letter and return, from his room with the envelope and cheque, putting the letter and cheque in the envelope, and leaving it with me to enter; I have endeavoured, as far as I can, to bring my mind back to the transaction—the next I heard of the matter was about a fortnight before we left Richmond Terrace; Mr. Lindsay and I were clearing up the things a bit, and we could not find that Lowestoft conveyance—Mr. Fullagar did not speak to me about it until he he brought me the bill; that was three or four days after—I could not fix the day exactly—he came out of his room and brought me Mr. Reeve's bill of costs, with the receipt to it, and said "Here is Mr. Reeve's bill of costs"—as far as I recollect, he had only the bill of costs in his hand; he cer<lb/>tainly did not being a stamped envelope and show it to me and take the bill of costs out of it; he brought it to me open—I took it from him, looked at the receipt, and put it up with the other bundle of vouchers—I don't recollect his saying anything about there being no letter with the bill of oosts—he did not on that occasion say it was great <hi rend="italic">cheek</hi> of the postman to leave it downstairs; I am quite sure of that—he had done so on a previous occasion—I put it among the vouchers and put this docket on it—it was about the middle of February when we could not find the conveyance—I</p>

               <p>asked Mr. Lmasay whether it had been reported, and he said he had not reported it; that means reporting its completion—when completed it would be reported to the Secretary of the Admiralty, or according to his directions, to whoever it came from—I went into Mr. Fullagar's room and asked him if he knew anything of the conveyance; he said he did not—I then spoke to Mr. Lindsay, and it was arranged that a letter should be sent to Mr. Reeve for the conveyance—I afterwards handed the cheque and the bill of coats to Mr. Chabot—the paid cheques are returned by the bankers every month or so in the banker's book, and they are generally tied up in a bundle and marked as paid cheques—I keep the vouchers until Mr. Bristowe's quarterly account is Bent in to the Accountant-General of the Navy—I remember the prisoner being discharged before Mr. Flowers on Saturday, 31st March—some days afterwards he came into my room at the Treasury and said "My object in calling on you is to personally apologise to you, Mr. Swainson, for the observations of Mr. Straight, and to assure you that they were not made through any directions from me, but you must consider them as only apply<lb/>ing to the handwriting and not to anything else, as I am quite sure you had nothing to do with it"—Mr. Straight had said at Bow Street that the handwriting on the cheque was as much like mine as Fullager's—he was re<lb/>presented by Counsel on the second occasion, not on the first; he conducted his own defence then—I have not seen him since that occasion—after his discharge I was, in common with other persons in the office, examined by Mr. Stephenson—the prisoner has borrowed trifling sums from me on several occasions; I think the last occasion was about a fortnight before we left Eichmond Terrace; he had a sovereign of me—these cheques are on the Westminster branch of the London and County Bank—I have to go there from time to time to pay in money—I am pretty well known there; I have been going there nearly two years, off and on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard the Solicitor-General's opening, as to the crime being between me and the prisoner, or perhaps a third person—I never heard that suggested by the prisoner or any of his friends—Mr. Straight's remarks were only as to my handwriting being as much like the cheque as Fullagar's—when Fullagar came to apologise for it, he said it was not in<lb/>tended to draw any other inference from it; he was as friendly towards me then as he ever had been—the sovereign he borrowed of me was somewhere about a fortnight before the office was transferred—it was repaid shortly after we went over to the Treasury—he was not the only person that ever had a sovereign of me—I paid the petty expenses of the office; Mr. Bristowe used to give me a cheque for petty cash, which I cashed—I kept the cash in an iron safe to meet any petty payments—I had funds in hand to pay petty cash with—the sums he borrowed occasionally were for private purposes, for his own accommodation, not for petty cash—he did not tell me they were for his own accommodation, but I knew from his manner they were—he never wanted money for office expenses unless he told me what it was for—he would give me a list of his petty expenses at the end of the quarter—he generally waited till the end of the quarter before he got the money for them—they were small sums, principally cab hire—it would be about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, perhaps, for cab hire—Mr. Alfred Bristowe has occasionally had trifling sums from me for his private requirements, and I: think Mr. Oswald occasionally—Mr. Lindsay has had trifling sums, and I have occasionally lent Peter, the messenger, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time—it was—common thing in the office, that has been going on for a good time—the</p>

               <p>prisoner repaid me all that he borrowed, sometimes within a week or a month, different times—he brought it me back voluntarily; I never asked him for it—the salaries were paid at the end of each month—there was never any difficulty in getting the salary—Mr. Bristowe paid him his salary—it was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was also allowed to practice as a solicitor on his own account—after Mr. Flowers dismissed him I went up to him, shook hands with him, and congratulated him on the result—he was in the passage as I passed—my evidence was given on the Saturday—I think he was appre<lb/>hended the night before—the case was adjourned for a week—he was not out on bail—he came up again on Saturday, 31st March—I had known him from the time he entered the office in 1875—he was not in the same office with me all the time, only from December till February, at Richmond Terrace—that was only a temporary arrangement because we had not got room—we had three rooms at the top of the house; the first floor was un<lb/>occupied, the ground floor was the office of the Conservator of the Mersey, Admiral Evans, and the Privy Seal Office; the servants were underneath; I don't know who they consisted of, we were there so short a time—there was a housekeeper, a woman—I used to see a youth there occasionally; I don't know what relation he was to the housekeeper—there may have been others those were all I saw—there were attics above our offices, they were empty—the papers in reference to this and other matters were brought from 39, Parliament Street, to Richmond Terrace—we left Parliament Street some<lb/>where about 31st December, 1876—the principal part of the work in reference to this matter had been done there—those who came over to Richmond Terrace were Mr. A. I. Bristowe, myself, Mr. Fullagar, Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Alfred Bristowe, Mr. Oswald, and Peter; that was the whole staff—Mr. Lindsay had been unwell, and went away for a holiday in August, then scarlet fever broke out in his family, and he did not come back till January, I think—in consequence of his absence there would be more work for Mr. Fullagar to do—I suppose some of it would occasionally get into arrear—there were several letters from Mr. Reeve during the latter part of last year asking for a settlement—if I was there first I should open the letters—they were placed on Mr. Lindsay's desk by the messenger—they were addressed to the Solicitor or to A. I. Bristowe, Esq., most of them—they would be delivered at the house in the morning—Peter was there earlier than the others, and would attend to the offices—they were not locked up at night, they were left open in charge of the housekeeper, who would light the fires and dust the rooms—anybody who was there with her would have an oppor<lb/>tunity of going into all the rooms; they were all open, none of them were locked—I don't know what the housekeeper did with the letters the first thing in the morning, whether she delivered them or whether Peter brought them upstairs—the postman occasionally brought them up—I used to be there from 10.30 to 10.40—in the middle of the day the postman frequently left the letters below, and they were brought up by the first person who came in—persons connected with the office were constantly going in and out, so they would not remain long—anybody might come in that liked, it was a private sort of entrance, up steps; the front door was open, there was an inner swing door—Mr. Fullagar has complained of the postman leaving letters below—I could not say that he made that observation as to this particular letter but I believe not—as far as I recollect he did not say a word about the postman leaving letters below on the Wednesday—my memory docs not enable me to say positively that he did not—am positive that he did not</p>

               <p>open the letters before me—I was positive before the Magistrate; if I said I did not remember, perhaps I got a little confused and did not quite under<lb/>stand the point—he came out of his room into my room up to my desk and handed me the bill, and said "Here is Keeve's bill," and I took it and looked at the receipt, and put it with the other vouchers—letters brought in during the day would be taken in to Mr. Bristowe if he was there, if he was not there, perhaps they would be laid upon Mr. Lindsay's desk, or whoever might be there to take charge of them—if Mr. Lindsay was there lie would keep them—he and myself and Mr. Fullagar had the right to open them, and we did open them, if Mr. Bristowe was not there, or if he was there, if they were thought to be public or business letters, we did not take them to Mr. Bristowe first; Mr. Lindsay would open them in the morning and enter them in the day-book before they were taken in to him; if I came in before Mr. Lindsay very likely I should open—them, and if Mr. Lindsay was away I should enter them—if the prisoner came in before Mr. Lindsay he would most likely open them—I can't say for certain what time of the day it was when this bill was given to me; I think it was somewhere about the middle of the day; Mr. Alfred Bristowe was in the office—I was the accountant; I had occasionally to write letters and see to the general business of the office sometimes—I have occasionally written a letter to a solicitor as to some purchase of a coast guard; occasionally, if others were absent I should attend to the conveyancing part; in fact, I used to do generally any class of business in the office; that mostly happened when others were absent; I did part of the office work in addition to the accounts—three cheques were drawn on 29th January, one referring to the Cromer Coastguard; I wrote the letter for that, for Mr. Bristowe's signature—I have occasionally acted for the business of the office generally, while any one else was there—it was not my business especially to attend to the Cromer business—did not write in reference to the Lowestoft business, because 51 r. Fullagar was attending to the Coastguard, and Mr. Lindsay was per<lb/>haps busy in other matters—Mr. Fullagar had no particular branch, he was the solicitor in the department; I believe he is a solicitor, admitted many years, he was engaged as a solicitor, qualified to do solicitor's work; I was not a solicitor—I should have written the letter with reference to Lowestoft just the same as I did with regard to Cromer or anything else—I have occasionally attended to other purchases or anything of the sort—I attend to any business in the office occasionally; I had nothing to do with this particular matter of Maid's Acre, except paying in the purchase-money—I made the entry in the journal of both the Cromer and the Lowestoft cases—as a rule I only entered the work that I did myself, but I have occasionally entered for others—this is a journal of all the business of the office done in the course of the day—there is no handwriting of the prisoner's here with reference to the Marsdon case—Mr. Fullagar attended to White and Borritt's business; I know that, because I had the cheques to pay the costs—this book was mostly kept by Mr. Lindsay; Mr. Bristowe always signed the letters if he was there—it would depend upon who attended to the matter—if Mr. Lindsay signed he would sign for the solicitor, and if I wrote the letter I should sign "Swainson for Admiralty solicitor"—Mr. Liud say attended to the principal part of the business relating to the Lowestoft purchase—I think it was in consequence of his absence that Mr. Fullagar had this to do—Mr. Lindsay did the principal work in that class of business, the Coastguard business and the preliminary conveyancing—Mr. Fullagar</p>

               <p>occasionally did so, and I did occasionally—Mr. Bristowe might occasional hand letters to Mr. Lindsay to write—if Mr. Lindsay had the Lowestoft busi<lb/>ness. in hand the ordinary course would be for him to carry it out, he would be responsible for it—I think the prisoner attended to part of the Chancery work—the Lowestoft property was a church property, and they had to get the consent of the Court of Chancery, and if I recollect right Mr. Fullagar attended once or twice with Messrs. Gregory's clerk, about the matter at the Chancery office—he had the papers in his room when Mr. Lindsay was absent—I believe Mr. Bristowe handed him the bill of costs to look through—I wrote the letter in reference to the Cromer business, because I had drawn the cheque for the costs; I also drew the cheque for the costs for the Lowestoft business, but I did not attend to that, because Mr. Fullagar had gone through the bill of costs, and was attending to that part of the business—am not aware that he had gone through the Cromer bill of costs—I cannot swear that he had not—I had no power to go through a solicitor's bill of costs and settle it without Mr. Bristowe's authority; I did not get the authority to go through it—I think Mr. Lindsay handed me the Cromer bill of costs to draw the cheque, he having attended to the matter—I wrote the letter because Mr. Lindsay was attending to something else perhaps, at the time—of course I cannot tell whether Mr. Fullagar was not attending to something else, than the Lowestoft business at the time—I did not say I had gone through the Cromer bill of costs and settled it, I cannot dis<lb/>tinctly remember—the ordinary course would be for the person who handed me the cheque to write the letter—I have no particular recollection why I wrote that letter—if I sent the cheque away I should enter it here as a matter of course—I believe Mr. Lindsay handed me the bill to draw the cheque—here is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deducted from the bill—I cannot exactly say whether that deduction was made by Mr. Fullagar—it might be; I cannot swear that he did not go through that bill—I fancy Mr. Lindsay gave it me—I think he had returned then; I think he was in the office at the time—I should not like to swear that the prisoner did not hand me the Cromer bill, but I think it was Mr. Lindsay that did it—I am still of that opinion—Mr. Fullagar got three other cheques signed for me—he did not apply to me to fill up the other two—no one did, I did it myself—I drew them of my own accord because it was business I was attending to—on the Monday, either Mr. Lindsay or Mr. Fullagar asked me for the Cromer cheque—I wrote the three cheques at the same time, and Mr. Fullagar would go with the cheques and the book to Mr. Bristowe, and get his signa<lb/>ture and then bring them back to me—I remember his bringing the cheque<lb/>book back to me and retaining the Lowestoft cheque, Mr. Reeve's cheque—it was out of the book when it was handed to me—he tore it out of the book; I do not recollect whether he did it in my presence, but he had torn it out for the purpose of sending it Mr. Reeve—I cannot tell you why he did not do the same with respect to the Cromer cheque—I believe Mr. Fullagar got Mr. Reeve's bill in his possession; I do not recollect seeing it on the Monday—I believe it was not on the desk—I will swear it was not—I did not say before the Magistrate that the bill was on the table—I have Rome doubts whether it was on my table; I think it was not—I did not write a letter to Mr. Reeve, I am quite sure of that—the prisoner did not in my presence put a letter and the cheque into the envelope and leave it with me to put the bill in, I swear that he did not give it to me—I cannot exactly recollect the hour that Mr. Fullagar brought back</p>

               <p>the cheque to me—I think it—was somewhere about mid-day—the usual hour for leaving is 5 o'clock—sometimes one stops longer than the other—the letters were sent up to Whitehall, just before 5 o'clock—it was Peter's duty to take them from the box, and take them there; I made the entry just before the letters went—who put it into the box originally I do not know—the entry was made in the afternoon; I did it because I did not see it there—occasionally we had a good deal of work to do in the office, and occasionally we were slack—persons came to see me; very <hi rend="italic">few</hi> friends called at the office to see me—one of my nephews came; he was a clerk in the Admiralty—he occasionally looked in, not frequently, not once a day; on an average, not once a fortnight—he might have called once or twice a week, about January, about his private affairs; I do not think oftener, certainly not every day—I think not, as far as I recollect—he was in debt, I must admit—he came to me in reference to his money matters—I had brought him up with my father—I have another nephew who was in the Post-office—the one who was in the Admiralty had been reprimanded, I believe, for irregularity—the nephew in the Post-office had been dismissed; I afterwards tried to get him reinstated, and they refused—in January two Navy bills were stolen from the Accountant-General's Office in New Street; my nephew was in the Accountant-General's Office there—Mr. Bristowe investigated the matter, I had nothing to do with it—it was sent to the solicitor to investigate—I never was in the Accountant-General's Office—my nephew sent some money lenders to the office to arrange with regard to his money transactions on more than one occasion—I had authority from my nephew to receive his pay at the Ac<lb/>countant-General's Office—I gave an undertaking to one of the money<lb/>lenders to pay a portion of his salary to him—there were only two called—I think I gave a written undertaking to one to pay him so much a month for his bill; the other was only a verbal understanding that if he would keep up his arrangement I would pay him the trifling amount—I have not said that it was my practice not to cross cheques unless I was going to send them off—the Lowestoft cheque was drawn on Saturday afternoon in the presence of Mr. Fullagar; I have given my reasons for not crossing it—I drew the cheque in his presence while he waited for it, and thinking Mr. Bristowe was waiting, I handed it to him, I suppose, without crossing it; that was the only reason—it was a sort of accidental thing—I had charge of that cheque in the book from the Saturday till the Monday—he brought the book to me with the cheque; I put it in the drawer and locked it up—on the Monday I drew three other cheques; he was not waiting for them then—I did not cross the cheque then; I presume I passed it over, thinking it was a cheque that was to stand over and I did not notice it, I mean I did not notice the absence of the crossing—I knew it was the cheque I had drawn on the Saturday, but I did not notice that it was not crossed; it was an oversight—it was about the middle of February that I found out the conveyance was not there—I and Mr. Lindsay found it out—Mr. Lindsay said that he drafted the letter to Mr. Reeve—I did not write; I only suggested to Mr. Lindsay, who had to do with most of the matter, to do so, and he told me a few days afterwards that he had drafted the letter to Mr. Keeve and put it on Mr. Bristowe's table; that was at Richmond Terrace—I did not speak to Mr. Fullagar about it; he seemed to be attending to other matters and was indifferent as to the business then, and Mr. Lindsay had been principally attending to it—I do not think he attended to it after he went away—</p>

               <p>composed of Mr. Swainson and Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Alfred Bristowe, a cousin of mine, and Peter Dameral, the messenger—Mr. Swainson was the ac<lb/>countant, but he was not limited to the accounts—Mr. Lindsay was a clerk in the office, attending principally to the Coastguard work, but also to other work that any of them were liable to—he had been seventeen years in the service—my cousin had been eight years in the service, and Dameral two years, but he had been with my father as a clerk before for fifteen or six<lb/>teen years—he did not follow my father to the Admiralty; he was brought there subsequently—my cousin principally attended to Greenwich College Hospital, but they were all liable to be called upon for any work that my father or myself might choose to place in their hands—I engaged Mr. Fullagar at the end of May or the commencement of June, 1875; I also engaged Mr. Oswald, I think, in August, 1875—I remember negotiating for the purchase of the site for a Coastguard station at Lowestoft; the purchase was completed some time in 1876 and paid for by a Navy bill—Mr. Swainson would draw all cheques, unless he was away, and I signed them—originally the correspondence relating to the purchase of the Coast<lb/>guard station at Lowestoft was in the hands of Mr. Lindsay, but he had an illness in his family and was away for some time; I think he went away about 11th or 12th November—he had previously been away with me at Portsmouth—I think we went there twice, once in July and once in August; he then had leave for a time—he was away the great bulk of the time, from the beginning of September till January—I don't think much corres<lb/>pondence about this business went on subsequent to Mr. Lindsay's absence, but I placed the bill of costs in Mr. Fullagar's hands that he might tax the charges—I remember Mr. Reeve's bill being brought to me in January this year by Mr. Fullagar—I had previously urged him to go through it as quickly as possible, as Mr. Reeve had been complaining of delay—I don't remember the date; I think it was a few days before—he brought it in and said "Here is Mr. Reeve's bill, I have been through it"—I asked him if it was a reasonable bill, and he showed me what he proposed to take off—I looked through the amounts and said "They are so small, only 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I think we will pay the bill in full," and I directed him to tell Mr. Swainson to draw a cheque for the amount—he said "Yes"—I think we then went on to speak of other business—I remember this cheque being brought to me for signature on Saturday, 27th January—I believe Mr. Fullagar brought it; I am informed so—I don't recollect personally who brought it to me; it would probably be Mr. Fullagar—I recollect it being brought, but I don't recollect who by—I declined to sign it, as I did not sign cheques on Saturday; I would do it on Monday—I would not sign cheques for any considerable amount on the Saturday, as it afforded facilities for their being stolen, by remaining in the post-office until Sunday evening; that was my rule—it was not on the Saturday that I went through the bill—I don't re<lb/>member the date; it was a few days before, I can't tell you how many—I believe Mr. Fullagar brought the cheque to me on the Monday, but I do not recollect the person: I have no doubt it was Mr. Fullagar, but it is from information I received, not from recollection—Mr. Fullagar himself in<lb/>formed me that be brought it on the Monday, subsequent to the proceedings at the police-court—I saw him two or three times subsequent to his dis<lb/>charge before the Magistrate; once at the Reform Club, and I met him in the street—have now no doubt that it was he who brought the cheque to me on the Monday, and I signed it; that was all—I signed some other</p>

               <p>cheques at the same time; I think he brought them—I think they were brought all together to me; I think they were in the book—this is the cheque; it is not crossed—my attention was not called to that at the time, otherwise I should have crossed it—in the ordinary course of things Mr. Swainson would cross it; it was his business—at the time I signed the cheque I believe I signed a letter to Mr. Reeve; I believe that letter was in Air. Fullagar's writing—it was presented to me by the same person that brought me the cheque; it was to accompany the bill of costs and cheque to Mr. Reeve—these other three cheques were signed by me at the same time—in the ordinary course of business a cheque would have a letter ac<lb/>companying it, stating "Herewith we send you cheque for so-and-so, good enough to acknowledge it"—it would not be in the ordinary course of business to send an envelope without a letter—I heard nothing more of the matter until the prisoner was given into custody—I went and saw him at the police-station the morning after he had been arrested; that would be Saturday morning, 24th March—I saw him iu the cell—I had received a letter from him the night before, telling me that he had been arrested for stealing a cheque, and asking me to come and see him as early as possible in the morning, and I did so—I paid the prisoner a salary of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have made advantes to him on his salary from time to time, at his request, but not recently—the last time was, I should think, sir months before the office was transferred to the Treasury—should certainly think not subsequent to October or November last—I have occasionally lent him money; not recently—I cannot exactly recollect when—I do not think I have done so for six or seven months from the present time—I am aware that my statement has been taken by a short<lb/>hand writer—I say again I do not think I have lent Mr. Fullager any money for six or eight months; if I have done so it has only been a sovereign or a couple of sovereigns—I may have done so since that time; it has only been small sums, but I do not recollect that—I would not swear I had not done so—I think last year I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one or two occasions, certainly not more than two; he always paid me back—occasionally I repaid myself from his month's salary, but at times when he asked me to lend it him for a time he paid it me back—it was not a common thing for him to do so, but in the course of our acquaintance he has done so several times—I may have lent him a sovereign last January; I do not recollect doing so—the signature to the receipt of Mr. Reeve's' bill appears to be an imitation of his writing—I have looked at it before—my attention has been invited to it more than once—there is no handwriting that I am acquainted with in the office that resembles it—I have looked at the endorsement on the cheque; I do not recognise any likeness in that—that is also an imitation of Mr. Reeve's handwriting—I think it is a good imitation; it is like his writing—I see some handwriting of Mr. Fullagar's in this book; there is one line and a half at page 3, in his handwriting, it is an entry of the 15th January—then on page 15, the first entry is in his handwriting, the subsequent ones are in Mr. Lindsay's—the entry at page 16, refers to Henwood and Childers; that is in Mr. Lindsay's writing—at page 201, the entries are in Mr. Fullagar's, with the exception of one or two—at page 202, about half of it is in Mr. Fullagar's handwriting, and the other half Mr. Lindsay's; not equally divided, it is mixed—I know nothing about these post-office orders—I did not go and get the money, or write any of these documents.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The signatures purporting to be Mr. Reeve's are not in the writing of anyone in the office as far as I can tell—this letter of the 18th November, 1876, from Mr. Reeve, bears an endorsement in my hand<lb/>writing in pencil; it is "Mr. Fullagar to draft reply"—at that date no doubt Mr. Fullagar was intrusted with correspondence—I did not remember it before—Mr. Lindsay would be away at that date—in conse<lb/>quence of that, extra work would be thrown upon Mr. Fullagar—the most pressing work would be done first—I said that I thought the letter to Mr. Reeve was in Mr. Fullagar's writing—I signed the letter—the letter would only be sent with, the cheque, and the person who brought the cheque would probably bring me the letter to sign—it would not follow of necessity that that letter should be written by myself—as a rule the person having charge of it would bring both the cheque and the letter—if two cheques and letters were brought at the same time, I should probably sign, both—I should not necessarily expect them to be written by the same person—under ordinary circumstances that would be so—I should suppose the person who presented me the Cromer cheque would write the Cromer letter—the ordinary course is this, for whoever writes the letter accompany<lb/>ing the cheque to bring it in with the cheque to me in order if I wanted any information before sending the cheque, I might have it from whoever had charge of the matter—I have been in Court to-day—I have no recol<lb/>lection at this moment who wrote the letter in reference to the Cromer transaction—I am under the impression that at the latter stage of the Lowestoft matter, Mr.' Fullagar had the correspondence, and I think he had written the letter; I am under that impression—that impression is obtained from the belief that he had the correspondence in hand—I do not recollect it—I do not think Mr. Reeve's is in partnership with anyone—anyone who had the letter would obtain from that the information that it was in payment for the purchase of the Coastguard site—he would see "R, H. Reeve, Esq.," in the corner—I know the handwriting of Mr. Fullagar, very well—I have known it for some years; I do not recognise his hand<lb/>writing in the two forged documents that have been produced, namely the bill and the cheque—it is very like Mr. Reeve's writing—I say it does not resemble Mr. Fullagar's writing, or the writing of anyone else in the office—that is my opinion—Mr. Fullagar told me in the autumn that he was getting up a Mortgage Reversionary Company—he told me he had incurred expenses in that—I think he repaid me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent him last year—the salary is paid monthly—I know that at different times I have both lent him and advanced him small sums—on those occasions he told me that he did not borrow it as a loan, and I advanced so much—if he had wanted any money in January, I should have advanced it him aa I had done before—there had been nothing to prevent his making a friend of me—as far as I know he was not in want of money then; at all events he did not come and ask me for it—I first heard of this loss on the night Mr. Fullagar, was arrested—I went to him next morning in consequence of his letter—his letter was the first intimation I had that the cheque was stolen—I have not got that letter; I did not keep it—t was very short; I could give you the effect of it—from January to March, I was living, as I am now, at Lewisham, coming up to town every day—I was lot at Portsmouth, at any part of that time—I was there sometimes; I was n London, nearly all the time from January to March, except a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days at frighten, and a few at Tunbridge Wells, but I do not think there wag a</p>

               <p>with reference to Maid's Acre, at Lowestoft—I remember Mr. Reeve's bill of costs coming—when the negotiations began, Counsel drew the drafts and I instructed Counsel and examined abstracts of title—I prepared the draft, forwarded it to the vendor's solicitor, and received it back approved—on 28th July, 1876, the management of Maid's Acre was concluded so far as Mr. Reeve was concerned, receipt that he had the engrossing of the deed, and we received a letter with his bill of costs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—up to 28th July I was the person attending to the matter with Mr. Bristowe and his father, but I did not pay the money into the bank—the conveyance was sent to him sepa<lb/>rately for examination—I opened the letter on the morning of 28th July, which contained the bill of costs; I presume it was dated the 27th—there was a letter with it which I took to Mr. Bristowe, and I assume it is with the papers—Mr. Bristowe directed me to give the bill to Mr. Fullagar to tax, to look through it, and see whether the charges were proper—I took it to Mr. Fullagar on the same day and gave him Mr. Bristowe's message—he said "All right, put it down, I am engaged, I shall want the papers to look through, as I know nothing about it"—I gave him the letter, but not the envelope—I am not a solicitor, nor have I received a legal education—the prisoner, being a solicitor, Mr. Bristowe invariably sent his costs to him to see whether the charges were correct, whoever might attend to the management of the matter—I pat the papers on the floor by the side of his chair and called his attention to them—he said "All right," or "Thank you," or something to that effect—that was all that passed between us at the time—about a fortnight after<lb/>wards there was a further entry from me to Fullagar about the bill of costs—he said "I have looked through these costs; I do not see much to object to except full charges for attending the Trustees to sign the agreement, and full charges for the expenses of conveyance"—that was the stationer's fee, which ought to be reduced after the first attendance to execute the deed—the charges were for attending each Trustee, and he thought Mr. Reeve's costs ought to be less—Fullagar had the bill with him—this was in the front' room in Parliament Street, where he sat by himself—I do not remember whether he had the bill in his hand at the time, it is so long ago—on a subsequent occasion he said that the man had been kept so long without his money that he thought he should allow it in full—that was all he could do with the matter—I believe that was about seven weeks before we left Parliament Street—I must alter my answer, I believe it to have been six or seven weeks before January 1st—here is a letter of Mr. Bristowe's dated 20th November, 1876, requesting me to stop away from the office—I had then been away for a month from 20th November to the beginning of January through sickness in my family, and before that for a holiday—refreshing my memory by that, I say that this must have been in September or October—I hope in the course of the day to be able to give you the definite date—I came back on 2nd January, and found that the office had been changed to 8, Richmond Terrace—I had no further conversation with the prisoner about the bill of costs until after he and I had changed rooms, which I think was about the 10th or 12th of January—I, Swainson, and Peter were then in one room, and it used to be Fullagar, Swainson, and Peter, in Parliament Street—in Richmond Terrace Mr. Bristowe was in No. 1, Alfred Bristowe and I in No. 2, and Fullagar, Swainson, and Peter in No. 3—there are steps which go down from the house into Whitehall, and windows looking on to the Duke of Buccleuch's—there are two large windows</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the office of the Admiralty solicitor, at Par<lb/>liament Street, and Richmond Terrace—I have been in Mr. Bristovee's service forty-five years—I have no recollection of the 27th or 29th January—I did not attend at Bow Street—day duty used to begin at 9.30 and con<lb/>tinued to 5 p.m.—I remember the office removing from Parliament Street and Richmond Terrace at the end of December, 1876—I made a complaint to the postman at Kichmond Terrace, as he used to leave the letters on the scroll of the staircase bannister—I used to see them there, and goodness knows how long they had been there, and I told him to bring them up, and threatened to report him to the Postmaster-General for not doing so; that was a week or a fortnight I should think after we went to Kichmond Terrace, it was the first time I had the opportunity of seeing him—after that he used to bring the letters up—I used to put the letters on Mr. Lindsay's desk—there was a letter box in the door for the first delivery in the morning—I used to take letters for the post up to the Admiralty, about 4.4:5—I took them from the box on the mantelpiece—there were three compartments to it—it was an open rack—I used also to go and ask Mr. Bristowe, Mr. Lindsay, and Mr. Swainson if they had any mure letters for the post, I then put them all in a bag, if there were many, or if there were only a few I tied them with string, and took them to the Admiralty, where the post bag hangs in the hall, into which I put them—if there was no bag, there was a deal wooden box, into which I put them—it was not locked, but there was a hall porter there—I do not know how they were gathered from there—I also had some to deliver to the different departments—this paper is my writing—I know nothing of these cheques or post-office orders.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was messenger in this office—I was there all day, except when I was sent out with the letters, which I often was—I sat in No. 3 room with Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Swainson, and when I was not out on messages I used to enter reports in the report-book of the director of works, at Mr. Bri<lb/>stowe's dictation, and I used to have copies of the draft reports to enter, in the Accountant-General's office; Mr. Lindsay gave them to me; also reports connected with the Admiralty solicitor's office; they would lay about five or six months, and I had to make them up, as Mr. Lindsay did not enter any reports—I had a little black leather bag, opening with a spring, for the letters, and I used to see that no letters were left behind with it—if there were only half a dozen letters it was not necessary to use the bag; it was not an official post bag, it was left to my suggestion and I used it for safety, but I was never told to do so—I took the letters every evening—if there were eight or ten. letters I should tie a string round them, but if there were only one or two I should hold them in my hand; I never put them in my pocket—the bag at the Admiralty is about 5 feet deep, a regular leather mail bag, and it is put on a hook—the hall porter is enclosed in a little place inside the hall, and the bag was on the opposite side to him—sometimes he would say "Hi, here are some letters for your department"—he was frequently there, he was stationary in the hall, and if anybody came he would say "Go to No. 1 or No. 2"—he sometimes would be away in some of the offices, but generally</p>

               <p>speaking he was there; there was always somebody there, messengers or somebody else sitting in the ball—when the bag was not there I put the letters into the box—if there was a letter in the day it was put into the box, but I very rarely posted letters in the day—the box was there in the even<lb/>ing, it was never moved—they used to take letters out of it, I suppose; it was about 2 feet long, 1 1/2 feet wide and about I foot deep—it stood on a ledge 4 feet high—I believe everybody put their letters in there—I believe that was the only bag—a man attended to the bag, and when it was full be put another bag; it was sometimes nearly full; it was the general receptacle for letters from the Admiralty.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square, I have for many years made handwriting a study, and have given my attention to dis<lb/>puted cases of handwriting—I have had placed in my hands the forged cheque and the forged receipt; I went to the bank and took tracings care<lb/>fully of the bank-notes, which tracings have been photographed—the bank-notes themsslvea are now in Court—I have seen numerous specimens of the prisoner's handwriting; I have also looked at the journal of 1876 throughout and certain pages—I have acquainted myself with the general character of the prisoner's handwriting—I am inclined to believe that the bill of costs, X 2 is in Fullagar's handwriting, but the writing being an imitation of another handwriting, I cannot express that opinion with any degree of strength, or rather I should say I cannot express a positive opinion—looking at X 1, I say that is undoubtedly in the same hand writing as the receipt—there is no similarity in X 2 with the prisoner's handwriting—the X 1 is undoubtedly the same handwriting as X 2, but taking X 1 by itself I can express no opinion whatever as to its being in the prisoner's handwriting, because it is a servile copy of another handwriting, I mean an exact copy, and the nearer the representation is to the original the more unlike it will be to the natural hand of the person who is making that representation—I make no distinction between an imitation and a servile imitation, both X 1 and X 2 are servile imitations—I have compared this signature "R. E Reeve" with the genuine signature of Mr. Reeve, and it is what I call a senile imitation, and so is the "K" in the word "received"—X 3 a and X 3 bare undoubtedly in the same handwriting; I cannot say that they are in the same handwriting as X 1 and X 2—to the best of my belief X 3 a and X 3 b are in the prisoner's handwriting, but I do not express an absolute belief—X 4 and X 5 are in the same handwriting, I express an absolute belief as to that—X 6, 7, and 8 are all in the same handwriting as X 3 a and b, and X 4 and 5 without any doubt whatever, and I believe they are all in the prisoner's handwriting—I express the same belief as to X 1 and 2 with the same qualification—in a serious matter like the present, I am very careful in expressing my opinion, taking X 1 by itself I cannot form the slightest opinion as to its being the prisoner's writing, I formed my opinion upon it from documents which I have not now in my possession, but which were put into my hands before the Magistrate. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here and in cross-examination entered in detail into a number of similarities existing in the forged documents to the handwriting of the prisoner, especially in regard to the for nation of certain letters; such as E, d, y, B, R, P, the crossing of the "t" and other peculiarities which taken singly would not amount to much, but taken together led him to the conclusion that the forged documents were in the prisoners writing.</hi>

Kansomes and Rouveries', where I had an account—that was in 1875 or the commencement of 1876—I think that was paid out of a former cheque-book, which I no longer have—I generally tore up the old cheque-books—I have advanced salary to Mr. Fullagar a good many times—except for salaries these are my private cheques—I have not got my pass-book with me; I believe it is at home—I did not look for it this morning, I thought these counterfoils would do—I can obtain it—it was not a constant thing to advance Mr. Fullagar's salary before it was due, but I have done so very often—he would ask me some<lb/>times to let him have some of the money; he said it would be convenient to him, that he would be glad of some of it before it was due—he is not the only one in the office who did so—sometimes I have advanced it a week before it was due, sometimes a fortnight—the Navy bills that were stolen were from the Accountant-General's Department—they were bills that should have gone through the post, but our theory was that they were stolen from the boxes in the hall at New Street by somebody in the department—that was the theory of the Accountant-General and the persons who instructed me to endeavour to ascertain about it—I ascertained that they were cashed at the Postmaster-General's office on the day after—I think they were taken out of the post-box by somebody in the department, and cashed the next morning—investigated the matter myself, and I came to the conclusion that they did not pass through the post at all—the crossing on these cheques "&amp; Co." is not my writing, nor the writing of anyone I know—they have been crossed after they were handed by me to Mr. Fullagar—I was in the habit of paying Mr. Fullagar his salary by open cheque.</p>

On Monday night, 21st May, about 11.15, I was on duty in Church Street, West Ham—I heard cries of "Police!"—I went to the spot and found McCardle and the prisoner strug<lb/>gling together—McCardle had his coat-and belt on, but no helmet—he said "I have been brutally assaulted by the prisoner"—I said "All right, I will assist you"—I took hold of him; he was very violent, and tried to strike him again—he made use of very bad language, called him a <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, and many bad names—we had great difficulty to hold him—he said "You b——Irish <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, I will do six months for you. You b——, I will knock your head off"—he struck me a violent blow in the mouth and cut my lip open—my lip bled very much indeed; I was spitting blood all the way to the station—my face was covered with blood, and my coat—my helmet was knocked off and thrown over the church wall—McCardle was knocked down by the prisoner, he got up again, and with great difficulty I held the prisoner fast and went towards the station—he still made use of bad language all the way—at that time Burobell came up, and with his assistance he was taken to the station—he still repeated the same words, that he would do six months for the b——; he challenged me to fight, and he has got the worst of it—he said he was sorry for me—he was very drunk—he was very violent at the station, and made use of the same expressions—McCardle was sober, as sober as I am now—he was bleeding very much, his eyes were wollen and very nearly closed, and he was bleeding from the nose very much—his helmet was left behind; it was brought to the station by a gentleman—I received the two helmets together from the gentleman.</p>

Guage—the two constables were bleeding very much from the face, one from the mouth, and the other had his eyes cut and all smothered in blood, and his coat was dirty where he had been thrown down—he had his coat on—he was perfectly dressed, belt and all—I assisted in taking the prisoner to the station—McCardle was perfectly sober, but very much excited through being knocked about—on the way to the station the prisoner was very violent; he made use of bad language; he said he would do six months for McCardle, but he was sorry for what he had done to the other, that there was not a man among us; that he had given McCardle a good hiding, and he would serve me the same only he had not the chance; he said he could do me in two minutes if I let go his arm—I saw Fisher that night between 60 and 100 yards from the station—I never saw the prisoner before, or any of the others.</p>

I live at Villiers Street, Camden Town—on Satur<lb/>day, 2nd June, I was going for a row on the Thames between 3 and 4 a.m. with two other lads named Thompson and Sutton—the prisoner was in the boat—he said "I am going to draw the plug"—I said "No, I shall not let you"—he said "I will," and I said "No"—we both got out of the boat—he said "If you hit me I shall run this knife into you"—I said "I do not want to hit yon," and T pushed him—I pushed him again and he ran his</p>

I am house-surgeon to the Poplar Hospital—Munday was brought in on June 2nd—he was very pale, and suffering from loss of blood—he had an incised wound on the left side, caused by some sharp instrument—I probed the wound, and it went to the left rib—it was very dangerous—it must have been a violent blow, from the quantity of clothes it had gone through.</p>

I am barmaid at the Castle, Woolwich, about the minutes' walk from the Mitre—on 8th June, about 9.45 p.m., Salmoj came in and asked for a glass of ale—he tendered a sixpence; I put it in the till; I do not know whether it was good or not—five or six minutes afterwards Davis came in for a glass of ale and tendered a shilling, which put in a till where there was no other coin; I afterwards took it out and Mr. Lennie bent it with his teeth, and I laid it on a shelf; I gave it to my brother—on the next day the witness Neale gave me a bad florin and I gave it to my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in the same house—my mother is the landlady, and the Hearnes were her tenants—f heard Mr. and Mrs. Jackson's voices, and Mr. and Mrs. Hearne and Mr. Jackson came out on the landing and banged the door, and it was opened, and I heard a smash and screams, and saw the man on the stairs in a blaze—I ran and caught him at his own door, and tried to put it out, but burnt my hands, and, with the assistance of another man, held him on the ground and tore his shirt off, and went and got a rug, and while I was putting it over him the prisoner said "It was not him, it was me threw the lamp at him"—after I came from the station I saw the prisoner again, and she said "I bare done it, I know I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I beg for mercy, he burst the door open, I had the lamp in my hand and threw it at him, but not with such an intention, I did it through terror. He has always been on at my husband because he is a quiet man; only a fortnight previous when I had my daughter at home he said he would kick the door in, and I fastened it to keep him out. He burst the door open to take my husband's life, and I believe one blow would have killed him. He was a very violent man, and his wife had to walk the streets for two nights, as he ran about with a knife in his hand; my hus<lb/>band locked the door.</p>
