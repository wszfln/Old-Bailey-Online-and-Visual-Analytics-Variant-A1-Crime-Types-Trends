When I went out I left my wife and my family, two children at home, my wife is here. I went out at one o'clock as usual, I had not been home between one and seven. I can swear to the articles, to the spoons by the initials of my name; I know the tea tongs by the cyphers of the same, the table spoon the same as the tea tongs; I leave speaking of the rest to my wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him whether the place was broke open or not, as I am indicted for a burglary.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is your landlord? - I rent the house of Mr. Copeland, in St. Martin's-lane, a carpenter; I let all the rest of the house out furnished or unfurnished, except those two apartments; I pay the rent of the whole house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the house broke open; did there appear to be any violence about the house? - There was no other violence than about the flap of the bureau, that had been attempted to be broke; the linen and cloak was taken out of the drawer underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence done to any part of your house? - There did not seem to be any violence as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend they got in? - At the door, I imagine.</p>
               <p>- MOSCRIP sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I was not at home when my property was taken; the last time I went out was about two o'clock, I have two children, a girl and a boy, and I took them both out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200004"/>with me; I left nobody in my apartments when I went out; I left the outer door on the latch, because there was lodgers in the house; my husband first discovered the house had been robbed; I was sent for and came home after the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How are your rooms situated? - The one goes into the other from the kitchen into the parlour; when you come to the street door, there is a passage and the two rooms lay on the left hand, one behind the other; the parlour is nearest the street door, you pass by the parlour and come to the kitchen door; when I went out at two o'clock I locked the kitchen room door, but left the parlour door open, I gave the key of the kitchen to a lodger, all this property was taken from the parlour; there was no violence done to the parlour at all; the door was left open, there is no entrance into the parlour but through the kitchen; I missed all the articles in the indictment; the shirts and cloak were in the top drawer, the plate was in a cupboard in the parlour; that cupboard was left open, there is no communication from the parlour to the passage, I knew they could not come into the parlour but by breaking into the kitchen, I can swear all the things to be mine; I know the shirts to be my husbands, by the marks made by myself, and I examined and I found so many were missing; I had had the cloak eight or nine years, I particularly know it by the lace, it is a broad lace and a thing that I commonly wore in turn; the tea spoons I might sell for 6 s. the tea tongs for 7 s. the silver table spoons for 10 s. the five shirts for 12 s. and the cloak for 14 s. I saw the whole of the plate taken from the prisoner by the officer Cook, the same as my husband spoke to, I have kept the linen and the cloak from that time to this, the officer has the plate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think I heard her say she saw the property taken from me. - I did, I saw the plate taken from him.</p>
               <p>EVANS LOGGARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a lodger with Mr. Moscrip, that day I went home from my work about half after five from Craven-street, in the Strand, where I have worked eleven months; going home I went up two pair of stairs to get the key of one of Mr. Moscrip's lodgers, I gets the key and went down, and set by the fire about an hour, in this kitchen that leads into the parlour where the things were taken from, I used to use the kitchen; leaving the kitchen I cannot be sure whether I left the door on the latch or open, I went up to my lodging room, I know I did not lock the door, I went to put a lock on to a tea caddy in my own room, whilst I was up stairs I heard the landlord call for assistance, and I ran down to his assistance; going down to the kitchen I saw the landlord had hold of the prisoner, the prisoner was at that time in the kitchen near the parlour door, I saw the plate taken from him, I did not see the bundle in his hand; the prisoner had dropped the linen and the cloak at the door, I did not see him drop it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are your sure that you latched the door? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the latch was down of the outer door? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You was the last person that came in before the prisoner was found, how was the street door? - I cannot be positive whether I shut it or left it open.</p>

Are you sure she did not come down again? - Not till the morning; I fastened the house, we have no shutters to the windows in that room that was robbed; it is the kitchen backwards, belonging to the house, it has only one window in it, a casement, that window was shut with the asp, it is on the same floor as where I sleep, I was the last in the room, and took an handkerchief from the clothes that was lost, that window had not been opened for some weeks, I did not try it that night, I did not take any particular observation that night nor for some weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the maid servant might have opened it? - She had no business in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the window that the person had come into the room by, that took your things? - It was, the pane of glass was broke, taken out, and the casement opened; that morning I got up a little before six; the servant came down and was in the room first, and called to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200006"/>me and asked where the linen was that was in the room; it was

               <p>I get my living by dealing in old clothes in Rosemary lane; on the 20th of January Sunday morning, Butterworth the prisoner and another they came to me between five and six in the morning, and told me they had a quantity of wearing apparel, and they had got it hid away in some place, in some fields; I am told the name of the other is Faulkner who came with him, and they wanted money of me to go and get a coach to bring the bundle, they said it was not prudent to bring it then on account of the patroles for fear of being stopped; I refused them any money that time of the morning, they went away and came again about seven or it may be a little after, both of them, each of them brought some of these articles which they spoke of before; they offered them for sale, and I bought as many as I gave 30 s. for, they told me they had as many as would come to 10 l. or 12 l. but they could not bring them then for fear of being discovered; the things that I received were dirty; they said the other things were washed and done up fit to carry home, and they said they could not bring them then, but they would another time; after that I heard no more particularly of them, till I heard they were taken up, they never came to me with the others.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was this? - On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after this? - I naturally put them out of my house for safety; they told me that they got them so and so, and desired me to put them out of the house; I put them in a bag up a chimney in another house where no person lived in; then Wednesday morning I was taken up, and I took the things to Shadwell office, I was taken up for some other things, and I was admitted an evidence, and I told all as I knew; I had known this boy about two months, I did not know the other.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you had known this boy some months, in what way of life was he in? - Sometimes he was at work and sometimes he lived with girls; but I never knew him guilty of housebreaking.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have no doubt that these things were stolen? - I did not doubt they were stolen, but I did not think that they had broke a house open for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then being taken up for some other robbery you was admitted a witness on this robbery? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no caution used, but he signed it merely as a matter of course? - The boy was asked the question by justice Staples and he did it.</p>

               <p>Court. Your memory Mr. Dawson does not seem to be quite accurate; the examination reads the same as Mr. Young has now said. - When Hugh Young was before the magistrate and they had taken down his evidence he contradicted a part of his evidence. I took Fitzsummons away about ten o'clock at night; I went into the Nag's Head by the side of Tower-hill, were Loney and Barlow were sitting, and I apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Court. I am not fond of officers so forward in court of justice; where they give their evidence right and proper it is a pleasure; but when they come to swear to fact, and refer to writings, and are not confirmed in it, it does not look so well.</p>
               <p>Court to Young. Did you say as Mr. Dawson states before the magistrate? - If I said so I must have said a great falsity, he did apprehend me so at first, but I corrected it and said as I said now, that I saw him near me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Loney.

I have seen Stevenson since and brought him to Mr. Clarke's house; he said he lived at No. 15, Grafton-street, Soho; so he did; I asked her how she came to tell me they belonged to Mrs. Thompson; she said, because she was a poor woman, and she thought I might not take them of her; so through the recommendation of the man I bought them of her, and gave her 30 s. for them; in the course of the afternoon I went out and I went down to Westminster, to the house where she lived, and the man gave her a very bad character; through that I went in search of her and took her up, and I said to her, how could you bring me stolen goods;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200012"/>she said, she found them in New Bond-street; I asked her for the money that I had lent her on them; she said, she had but 9 s. 6 d. left, and wanted me to take the 9 s. 6 d. and let her pawn them for the rest of the money.

               <p>Q. Was this parlour of your's at the back of the shop? - It is, and the glass door between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door shut or open? - It was shut to, but I cannot positively say whether it was fast or not; it communicates with the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner, or any body concerned in this business with you? - No, nobody is concerned with me. I am a single person; I never saw the boy till after he was retaken; the prints are here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>We were drinking tea in the parlour adjoining the shop, there was a candle in the shop but not in the parlour; I saw the reflection in the shop of a man; I said there is somebody in the shop; I believe Mrs. Page got up and said, there was somebody; I went out to him; on his being closely pursued, I saw him throw the things over the palisades; I did not see any body near him not so near as to lay hold of him; I am confident that I perfectly saw him throw the things over; when he threw the things over he was a very little distance from me; Mrs. Brookes came up as I was bringing him back to the place; he was got about seven or eight houses off when I took him, and she went inside of the palisades and took them out; we brought him back to our house, the prisoner was very penitent and begged pardon, and wanted to get off, he would go for a soldier, or do any thing if we would set him at liberty.</p>
               <p>(The print produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Page. Did you see him go out of the shop? - I did not see him till I was out of the shop; but I immediately pursued and never lost sight of him till I got him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Brookes. What is the value of that cotton? - It cost me 3 l. 12 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two men running before me about three yards, these two men were before me, I had been looking after work, and I was going through the town, I never saw the things; I have no witness at all, I have no soul in London that knows me excepting the girl that I live with.</p>

             ran down the street; I had hold of them before she delivered the watch to the other, I kept them till the officers came, they came and they took them into the watch-house in Cow-cross; that is, Ford and Taylor; then they took them from there to the prison Clerkenwell. At the time I held them somebody picked my pocket of my pocket handkerchief, and somebody picked my breeches pocket, but I cannot tell they did it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lay hold of Taylor? - She assisted the other, she laid hold of me as soon as the other had got my watch, she laid hold of my arm, she interfered as soon as ever I laid hold of her that took my watch, she did nothing more than hold me.</p>
               <p>Q What did she hold you for, was it to prevent you from running after the others? - Yes, to be sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q How soon did you see Bailey after this? - It might be in the course of two hours and a half; they took her and two more, there was five of them in all at the end of the court at which I was robbed, they took the five up, Bailey was taken as she was coming up the alley, Jacob's court with a pot of beer, and the two other women stood a little lower down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that Bailey was the woman that ran away with the watch? - I am very positive of it; when Sarah Bailey took the watch of Elizabeth Ford, them two other women went along with her, they ran off together.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any lamps in this Cow-cross? - There are lamps.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a moon light night? - It was very light.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say whether you recollect it was moon light or not, I cannot be certain, it was very light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamps near where these women robbed you - There is a lamp stands opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Women of this description are dressed very much alike? - I can positively swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure as to Bailey? - I am very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the other women get away from you? - No, never; one I held inside of my arms, and the other I held in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose; - I lost a silver watch, two Bristow seals, one bed hook in the form of a knife and a steel chain; I have never recovered it since; when I took Bailey she was coming with a pot of beer in her hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200015"/>Q What officer was with you when you took Bailey? - All the officers, four of them were there.</p>
               <p>Q Which of them pointed out Bailey to you? - I was going by the alley and I saw her face, and I knew her directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the officers point her out to you? - No, they did not, the officer asked me if that was her; I saw her myself first, she had the same dress before; the women were all strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ford. Please to ask him whether he did not stop me by my arm and said, says he, I have lost my watch; with that he up with his hand and made to strike a blow at me; I called to the watchman. I never saw the man before he catched hold of my arm and went to strike me, and said he had lost his watch; and that young woman came that side of the way and he catched hold of her and he said, he lost his watch, and we called out patrole.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you sure that you saw the watch in her hand? - I am sure I did; I saw her take it, and I saw her deliver it to the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bailey. He never saw me in his life till he took hold of me; I was coming home with a pot of beer, a bit of cheese and a penny candle, and the constable laid hold of me and said, he wanted me, and that man came up and said, I was the person.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was the man Appleyard laid hold of her by my desire; but not till I had told him.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go up into that place to that woman? - I knew it was a place of ill fame, and it was the corner of the court where the prosecutor was robbed; she was coming along with the candle in her hand and a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of her after you had taken her? - Yes, after I had taken her I left her in the care of two patroles, and I went into another room; I am positive it is the same woman.</p>
               <p>Q Did you examine her? - I did, I found nothing of any consequence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Ford. They said, if we could raise five pounds they would let us go, and we could not; and he said he would shew us as much mercy as the judge would.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said any such thing, they sent a man to me, and offered to give me money, but I said I would not take money; but I said I would be glad to have my watch again; I never said I would make it up for five pounds on my oath; I had money offered me to be sure, but I refused it.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole; I was on my duty, and I heard a noise, and I and my companion came up, and we found this man, with these two women; he said, they had robbed him of his watch; with that we took them to the watch house; the two with him, were Ford and Taylor; I did not see them examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ford. That there gentleman sent word to me that if we would raise between us a watch as good as his own he would make it up; with that, we sent word that we were unfortunate girls, and if he would false-swear himself he must; he sent word again, if we could raise five pounds for him to buy a watch as good as his own, he could go a great way off, he was a single man and nobody should know were he was; we sent word we could not; he said then, he would just shew as much mercy as the judge could shew us.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever send any message to them? - I never sent any message to them; the person that came to me told me, there was four of them would subscribe so much a piece to give me satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Taylor. Mr. Appleyard was the constable of the night that took me, and that man and this woman had a quarrel in the alley; I went over to see what was the matter, and the man immediately laid hold of me, says I, what are you going to do with the woman; with that he says, damn you, what are you one of them, and he laid hold of both my hands, and he had me stripped start naked in the watch house; says I, have you got any charge, no, says he; says Mr. Appleyard you may as well go you are sure to be cleared to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bailey. When I was going home with the pot of beer about half an hour after ten o'clock, Mr. Appleyard came and took me by the arm and said, he wanted me; with that he called the prosecutor and asked him if he knew me; he said he believed he did; directly he asked me what was my name, I said

               <p>Court to Appleyard. Did the prosecutor say there he believed she was the woman, or did he positively say she was? - He positively said, that that was the woman, the first time he clapped his eyes on her when I was with him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever admit taking a false oath about this business?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200017"/>- Not at all my lord, I should be very sorry to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer took up the whole five? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the other two to be discharged? - Because they had not laid any hands on me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bailey. The prosecutor said at the justices the robbery was done between seven and eight, and I can bring people to prove that I was that night in a chandler's shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You told me that this happened a quarter past nine - I said the same before the magistrate, which it certainly was to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how much you had in it? - I can swear to more than was found on her, I had more than that; I look upon it there was as much as 7 l. but I did not find any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you put this 7 l. in a canvas bag in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bed room door locked? - No, it was not; the prisoner was in the room in the morning, as soon as she was up; she came up about seven o'clock she did not take it then from me; it was later than that, she came in and took the money from me; I had been poorly, and had not slept much in the night; and I fell asleep after that.</p>
               <p>Q Had you a character with this young woman? - No otherwise than that I knew she lived in the neighbourhood, she had done so for a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you first of all to tell us your husband's name was Samuel? - I beg you pardon, I was thinking of my other husband; I have had two husbands, my first husband's name was Samuel.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you would have forgot your other husband long ago; how long was it your husband got up before you that day? - A good while.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think? - Eight or nine o'clock, he is afflicted he cannot dress or undress himself; it might be eight or nine or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any lodgers in your house? - No, only an old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not got soldiers? - Only one and he was upon guard.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day did he go on guard? - About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was on guard from seven o'clock in the morning till two, Do you mean to say that he is never relieved for nine hours? - They are there all the day long, they do not come off till the next day; he is down at St. James's at the King and Queen's guard.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed some money about a month before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found there was some money mislaid, and you found it again? - No, it was my husband had taken the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You charged the soldier with it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about it? - I spoke about it, and said I had lost my money; but I did not charge him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say now that you did not charge either the soldier or that woman the time before? - I did not charge the soldier; but missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe afterwards it turned out that the money was mislaid? - No, my husband had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q Is your husband here to day? - He is not, he is very bad in bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Where had you missed the money from before? - My husband took it out of my pocket when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him take it? - I did not mind it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it when you was asleep? - He did; but he told me as soon as ever I said I had lost it; he said don't make yourself unhappy, I have got the money.</p>

               <p>I am the patrole of Castle Baynard ward; I met the prisoner at the bar about two minutes before the half hour past six o'clock in the morning, on Sunday the 27th of January, he passed by me in Little Knight Rider-street, Doctor's Commons; I said, my friend what have you got there? he said, he had picked up a prize, and he kicked his foot against it at Paul's wharf, against the beer casks; says I, you must come along with me to the watch house and give a better account of yourself; I called to a man opposite, a soldier, to aid and assist me to take him to the watch-house, he took the man and I carried the iron; when he came into the watch-house his defence was, that he meant to carry it to the custom house, or leave it at the next watch house that he found open; we sent for Mr. Billing, Mr. Crawshaw's clerk, and he owned the property.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was Crawshaw's property? - Because it was so near the wharf; we found on him fifty-six pounds weight of iron; three bars.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat Prisoner's Counsel. You are a patrole? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from this wharf that you speak of was from the prisoner? - Two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner walking or running? - He was not running, he was walking very steady with a stick.</p>

On the 7th of January last, about seven in the morning I heard a rapping at the door, I was not up, and there was nobody in the house up and I rang the bell, and the maid got up and went down and let in a watchman, and he wanted to see me, and he told me there was a man taken up with some iron, and I went to the watch-house, and who should it be, but this prisoner at the bar, who had been a watchman on the premises for six or eight months, then I asked to look at the iron, and I was convinced at first sight that it was the property of Messrs. Crawshaw; I ordered the man to be sent to the compter till the next morning, doing that I returned immediately home; I always carry the key in my pocket; I went immediately to that pile of iron, which I conceived it had been taken from; it had been a frost the preceeding night, and I could perceive that the ground was rather fresh broke, it did not appear to have been done above an hour or two at furthest; two bars were missing, and the chalks were missing likewise; when they are laid they are placed perpendicularly, and the cross bars are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200023"/>chalked; I observed the place where a piece had been taken from very lately; I looked further round the yard to see where the other bars could be taken from, which I will not pretend to swear to; I believe it is one of our bars, but I cannot swear to it. (Deposed to the other two.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You are clerk to these gentlemen, Messrs. Crawshaw, Son, and Thompson; how many partners are there in the house? - Three.</p>
               <p>Q. No more? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems that these premises from whence you suppose them to be taken, are on the side of Paul's wharf? - The whole premises is called Paul's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the beer casks from the premises of the partnership's wharf? - About ten or fifteen yards, there are in the common gang way, between the two wharfs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they are not at all on the premises of the house stated in the indictment? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these bars of iron you have told the court how you know them; tell us something more about them if you please. You know them by some chalk mark; I think, and there is one there that you did not swear to? - I did not swear, but I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the two that you swear to, do you know them by any thing else than the chalk mark on them? - I know them by their original mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Now pray sir, these bars are manufactured from the oars? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now does this manufactory produce no other with that mark on them but what is sold at your house? - Very possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is very possible, and it necessarily follows, that there is a great deal of iron with these marks? - But I have something more to say; this part of the cargo that laid uppermost the lighter that it came in sunk, and the sand leaves a sort of muddy complection on the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the iron you speak of been out of the barge? - About a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the mud was of a particular complection; do you know the mud by the colour, smell or taste? for I confess you are better learned than I am. - I know it by the complection of the mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you know it by the complection, it is of a very different complection from all other Thames mud; I suppose in the next wharf it is more light or more dark; now about this notable chalk mark of your's, it seems to be a strait chalk? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no other persons but at your house that chalks at all? - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps your chalk is a particular colour and complection? - I do not describe it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then probably it is common chalk which every old woman uses, and it is nothing then a cross mark? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it marked unusually high or unusually low? - I have no particular mark from the chalk; the reason why we chalk, it is evidently that we may know if any is taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any person take it away? - I did not.</p>
               <p>

               <p>On the 27th of January, in the morning, I saw this man as I went down Paul's wharf; I saw him stoop down and take up this iron; says he, in the name of God what is this? says I, I think it is a prize; says he, I am going to take it to the custom house, and when I get there I shall not get more than a pot of beer; the man turned his back to me and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a seaman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this? - At half after six.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200024"/>Q How came you there at half after six? - I was going down to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q Where is the necessary? - On the left hand going down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - Outside the wall of the wharf going down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Billing. Is there a passage between the two wharfs; - There is, and a public necessary and a shore underneath.</p>
               <p>Court to Mahanam. Did you see Chambers there? - I did not; I saw no man but himself; he told me that he was going to take it to the Custom house; he said, he should not get more than a pot of beer for his share; it was half after six; it was a very light morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the man before? - No, he does not know my name as I know of; but I happened to see his wife the 17th of last month, Sunday, I called to see a person in prison and I was standing at the door, and I heard a woman making a complaint; I should not have known the man if it had not been for the woman; I don't know this is the very man; I don't know what it is than what the wife told me; I never knew the man before; I might see his face but no further; I don't say that I recollect the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for what you know it might be some other man? - I could swear to the iron I put my hand upon that morning by the length of the bar and the bag that it was in.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you swear to the iron if it was in a bag? - The end stuck out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you just now to say that you could swear to the iron if you never saw it? - I clapped my hand on it and felt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from feeling of it you are enabled to swear to it? - Certainly I am.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses to his good character, and the Counsel stated to the Court that the commissioners of the customs had a very good opinion of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity of callico was lost? - Twelve pieces; some run twenty-one and some twenty-four yards in a piece; they were lost from the lower part of the grounds, out of the copper house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the term boking? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this copper house join to the house you live in, or is it a part of it? - It adjoins to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How does this join to your house? - I come out of my own door to go into the copper house; there is no way communicates with it on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this copper house before the callico was missed from it? - I had seen it on Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the copper house connected to your house by boards or any thing? - It is all under one roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body sleep in the copper house? - No, nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any wall round the building that completely incloses them? - No, there is not; I saw the door of this boking house fast on Saturday night between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, at the time we left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the workmen lodge in your house? - No, none at all</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next have occasion to see the copper house? - On Sunday between seven and eight in the morning I see it, it was fast then as I left it the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you perceive that any thing was missing from thence? - On Monday morning I went up to go to work about half past five and I saw a light in this house by the door being half way open; I went up stairs for a candle and lanthorn, and I went to look and I saw a bit of iron lay at the foot of the bridge; I looked at the door and the nail was wrenched out and the bit of the wood where the nail was wrenched out was cracked; the door was nailed up; the carpenter had been at work; I went into the copper house and I found the new wood, the boards was what gave the light; I went to look at the goods, and I found some were missing; it was the light of the morning that I saw in at the door; there was no light within the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the opening of the door let in that light you talk of? - Yes, I believe it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to find the door open when you got there? - No, I did not. When I got into the copper house I found a parcel of goods missing; I cannot rightly tell how many, in one parcel was fourteen pieces tied double, and seven were taken away; I cannot tell how many were taken away from the other parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual way in which they are left, to be tied double? - Yes, it is. There was a man came and took an account of them all, and there was twelve missing on the whole, seven pieces ash goods and five pieces of four; the four goods are goods finished for printing, but ash goods are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these called british white callico? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any of the other buildings? - No, none but our own copper house; all the goods were lodged there of a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men at the bar? - Yes, I know Arnold very well, I lived with him over in Surry, and worked with him; I worked with him five weeks him, he had been over at our grounds this half year.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200026"/>Q. How lately had he worked at Mr. Macmurdo's grounds? - It is a month ago last Tuesday since he was taken away, when he was taken away on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where abouts the value of these goods are? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q Are they worth 20 s.? - More than that</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Do you know there was twelve pieces taken away of your own knowledge? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see them tied up? - I did not, the man that worked with me tied them up? - I was there when he tied them up.</p>
               <p>Q Is that man here? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you was in the copper house at the time the man was tying them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them after he had tied them up? - I did not count them exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Fourteen is the usual quantity in a parcel? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q Did it look less than ordinary? - On Saturday night it did not, but it did on Monday, and the top part of them had been throwed down in the dirt and picked up again.</p>

               <p>Q.How can you swear that to be your's? - From the number that is on it, twenty-five, nearly erased; the servant has so many spoons given him with such a number on them, and when we looked over the spoons we found it was No. 25 was lost; I told my servant it was that number; I am sure it is mine; I can safely swear it. On Monday week I had intelligence of it from Mr. Heather; on Mr. Heather's coming to me I looked over the plate which I should not have done then, because we were so busy.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I was sent for to Mr. Heather's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200028"/>and took charge of the prisoner; I brought the prisoner down to the office; Mr. Heather has kept the spoon.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Heather. How soon did you go to the Crown and Anchor? - I sent to Mr. Simpkins directly from the office, the 11th of February; I sent the spoon and the same person brought the spoon back; I can swear to the spoon; I thought first of all it belonged to Mr. Willis in St. James's-street, I sent it to him, and he came; I shewed it to Mr. Clarke, and he said, it was Mr. Simpkin's.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Simpkins. Can you say of a certainty that that spoon was missing? - I can.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it Mr. Heather sent to you? - It was the 11th of February when I went to Bow-street, and I saw Mr. Heather there; the spoon brought to me was carried back to Bow-street; my own clerk gave it to me, who brought it in I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it given to at Bow-street? - Mr. Heather had it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say for certain that this was the spoon that was carried to Mr. Heather at Bow-street? - Yes, I can, here is Crown and Anchor on the bowl which has been partly erased, and here is five, the remainder of the twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Monday week I was coming up Long-acre, I met with a Mrs. Brown, she asked me to go into the shop and get the spoon weighed; when I went into the shop she was at the door, and when she saw me laid hold of she ran away; I was neither to sell it nor pawn it, but only to have it weighed and return it again; then they took and searched me; I had a good number of duplicates about me, but every thing was my own. Then on the day following I was carried down to Tothill-fields, and the next day there was a Mr. Willis swore to the spoon, the same as Mrs. Simpkins has. I am quite innocent, and I beg of your Lordship to look into it; I have lived twenty-nine years with various gentlemen, particularly nine years with judge Nowel; as for my part I know no more of it than only receiving it of the woman in the street, and was to return it to her immediately; they took away from me my almanac, my pocket book, and my letters, they took away all the duplicates of things I had pawned when I was ill of the rheumatism; my wife also was attended by Dr. Morris; I could not afford to keep a nurse for her, I was obliged to attend her myself and it prevented me from doing my business. I would be greatly obliged if your lordship would let me have my property returned to me again, my seals, my letters, my key of my trunk and other things.</p>
               <p>Court to Heather. Was Mr. Willis sent for? - He was, and he swore to the best of his knowledge that it was his spoon, but when he saw the Crown and Anchor he said, it was not; this was before I sent to the Crown and Anchor, it was in the course of an hour; the Crown and Anchor is visible on the spoon.</p>

               <p>Q.Did she tell you the number? - She did not; I went into one or two houses before I found out this man's house; I went in and asked the man if he lost any thing? he told me No; then he went up stairs and found there were some blankets and a sheet gone; I have kept them ever since.</p>

I said, a woman had given them me and asked me to pawn them.</p>
               <p>Court to Sapwell. Did she say any thing to you about the pawning of them? - She told me that she was going to pawn them for her master when I first stopped her.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; on Tuesday evening a man passed by my box, and told me of the ladder at this window, and that he suspected all was not right there; and so I went up and alarmed the house, I went and saw the ladder, and the window up; I went up stairs, being let in, I turned into this room that the ladder was to, and found nobody was in it; there was some clothes laid pulled off the line and some strings up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of that room open? - It was as they told me, I saw it open; I went up stairs and found the prisoner at the bar lying on the stairs, just about half a pair higher than the one pair of stairs room, on the second pair of stairs, I brought him down, I searched him and found nothing on him, but his knife; I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q You searched him every part? - I felt him about.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken to the justice that there woman that stands there, for the things that they had lost, wanted my mother to make a recompence for them, and my mother being a poor woman, and I innocent of the fact, told my mother to do no such thing; and they said they would go as far as the law would go; it is a bad house for all sorts of bad women, they have not lived in it so much as a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever tell them you would make it up? - His father and mother came to my husband and said they would make a recompence; they came to make me the offer, I told them it would not lay in my power.</p>

               <p>I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at the magistrates; on Saturday the 2d of February, a little before twelve at noon; we missed two furr muffs from the window of my son's house, his name is Dudley; I am there always by day, I never saw the prisoner, nor never see any body take them, but I missed them in a few minutes before, I had just turned out of the shop, and the muffs were stole; and when I came into the shop again, I missed them. The officer Sanders brought the muffs back.</p>
               <p>- SANDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I was chose an extra man at Marlborough-street; I am an hardwareman. On Saturday the 12th of February, about twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner coming down Vine-street; I was standing at the bottom of Vine-street in Broad-street, it is a street that leads from Russell-street to Broad St. Giles's, he had a blue apron before him, I saw him with something lapped up in it very close against his body, I knew the boy before, and I suspected he had got something that he had no right to, I waited at the bottom of the street till he came to the bottom; I asked him what he had got, and I took hold of him, and brought him into the house where I lived, I searched him to see what he had got in his apron; he did not speak any thing plain that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200036"/>could well understand; I asked him if he had got a swag there, and I took and opened his apron, and found these two muffs; I don't think it was above a quarter of an hour according as I heard after they were lost; I took the boy and muffs up to Marlborough-street, where he was committed; I asked the boy where he got them, he said a man gave him sixpence, to carry them through St. Giles's for him, from the end of Oxford-road where I met him into Drury-lane, and to take them from him again; I found no sixpence about him, in searching him, as I supposed if any body had given him sixpence he must have had it; I went to a number of houses where they sold muffs, to enquire whether they had lost such things. On Monday morning I found Mr. Dudley had lost two, I went to Mr. Dudley and acquainted him that the prisoner was in custody, and he came up to the magistrates, and identified the muffs.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hellear. Do you recollect exactly what time of the day it was you missed these muffs? - They were there at half after eleven, and I believe a quarter more; I had seen them a very few minutes before I missed them. (The muffs produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hellear. Was there no strangers in the shop about the time these muffs were missed? - There was no one in the shop but our own family.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose that the muffs were taken by some person or other when nobody was in the shop? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the shop? - There were several people in the parlour adjoining.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing a boy, or such a boy as that about the shop that day? - Not that day, but I had the day before; and I saw some of his accomplices, I know the boy by sight, when I saw him at the justice's, I recollected him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him before? - Near the house, but not that day as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you seen him with? - With another boy and girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether you ever saw me before? - I don't know that ever I saw this boy before, till I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Oxford-road and a man came up to me and tapped me on the shoulders, says he, my boy will you carry these two muffs for me to St. Giles's, and he told me to go down Vine-street, and when I came down Vine street this man apprehended me; I thought the man was behind my heels, and directly I looked back the man was gone.</p>

               <p>I am the constable that was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I have got the bundle, delivered to me by Mr. Harrison. (Deposed to by Mrs. Harrison.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never went into her house in my days, nor never near the place; I was going home through Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and just at the end of Holborn a man comes to me and said you must go back; I said, what for? says he, you will see presently, and when he brought me back, this woman had her linen, and said, I had been robbing her of it; I said, no, I had not, for I did not know her; she said, she was very sure I was the person; for I had a black gown on; she brought me before the justice, and there she told the justice that the woman that took the things had a black gown on; I never deprived her of a halfpennyworth, nor never was inside her doors in my days; and the gentlemen said they bad frequently been robbed by the lodger in the house, and that there was not a week but they were robbed of several things, and that if it cost them twenty guineas they would transport me, and I should pay for all.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Harrison. Did you ever say any thing of that sort? - I never said no such thing; my husband in his passion might say he would transport her; I have frequently been robbed, but never by my lodgers. She said, at the justice's, that if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200038"/>I would let her go, she would pay me half a guinea that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband earns a guinea a week. I have no occasion to take any thing; I never expected my trial, her lodger, that she said robbed her, sent me word that she would not find the bill against me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. This old bed gown that the things are wrapped up in, is that lodger's that she was acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witness here, I had been to great Rider-street to my husband and was going home; and where they found the linen God knows, I don't know no more than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. I saw her drop them out of her lap, but she turned the corner, and there was a man before me that pushed on to catch her before me, she was going down the place called the Vine-yard.</p>

            ; I could not find the waiter; I found he was gone in search of the coachman, I asked Mr. Careless if he could describe the coach, coachman and horses; I went down to Charing Cross to look for the coach, and coachman, from which place I understood Mr. Careless had taken the coach, I made an enquiry among the watermen, and the coachmen who were on the stand, and gave them such a description as Mr. Careless had given me; I offered a guinea reward, I might be about ten minutes making this enquiry, I went up to the Golding Cross, Charing Cross, supposing I might get some intelligence there; coming down from the gateway, I met a man with an apron on, this man told me he believed he could inform me where the coachman was, in consequence of which I endeavoured to find out the person; I found him at the bottom of the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the man as Mr. Careless had described him to you? - I described him to that man, and the trunk also; accordingly I met with this man that is at the bar at the bottom of the gateway, near to Charing Cross, I asked him if he had brought a fare from Covent Garden? he said, no, he had just come from the city with a fare, and there is the money for my fare, and shewed me eightteen-pence, I told him I had got some idea he had got the property of a gentleman at my house; on looking into the boot of the coach, his coach was standing at the bottom of the gateway, rather to the left of the gateway, he had just set down his fare; looking into the boot, I saw the end of the trunk which answered the description which Mr. Careless had given of it; with that I told the coachman I believed that was the property of a gentleman at my house, I put my hand on the trunk and ordered him to take it out of the boot and put it into the coach, the man very readily assisted me in doing so, I believe he put it in for me; I then ordered him to drive me to the New Hummums which he did; as soon as I arrived there I called the waiter to aquaint Mr. Careless with what I had done, that I had brought his trunk Mr. Careless came to the door to the coachman, and he said it was his trunk, I then ordered one of my waiters to go to Bow-street, and get one of these people from Bow-street to take him to Sir Sampson Wright, and he did so; I went with him, the coachman and Mr. Careless.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time that Mr. Careless came into your house, to the time you went to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross? - It might be near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Harrison what did the prisoner say, when Mr. Careless saw his trunk again? - He did not say any thing then; at Charing Cross when I interrogated him about taking the trunk away, he gave for answer that he had brought it from the Black Lion, Water-lane Fleet-street, and that he should have taken it back to the New Hummums as soon as he had an opportunity; there was a direction on the trunk, Mr. Careless's name, directed to my house; when he got to my house I think he repeated it, that he intended to bring it back as soon as he had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200040"/>Q. Did you see any body get out of his coach at Charing Cross? - I did not, but I had some reason to believe that he had set down a fare, because he shewed me the 18 d. for the fare he had brought from the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other reason except seeing the 18 d. in his hand? - He had it in his hand as if he had just set down his fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether it is an 18 d. or a 1 s. fare from your house to Charing Cross? - It is only a shilling fare.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel to Mr. Harrison. When you took the coach at Charing Cross you got into the coach, and he drove you to Covent-garden? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with stealing at that time? - Yes, I believe I did; I told him that it was Mr. Careless's property, that he had taken it away either intentionally or by a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time he told you that he meant to carry it to the new Hummums? - To the best of my recollection he did.</p>

               <p>I was waiter this 23d of January at the new Hummums when Mr. Careless came there, between the hours of three and four; I went to the door and opened the coach door; I took out a little dressing case; I told the coachman to bring out the trunk; I went in doors with Mr. Careless, I cannot positively say whether the coachman made any answer; I went in doors with Mr. Careless and went up stairs to shew him a room, and when I came down again to see for the trunk, the coachman was gone, on which I made enquiry; I thought the man had gone without his fare, but I found he had been paid by one of the other waiters. That waiter is not here.</p>
               <p>Jury. What answer did the coachman make when you told him to bring in the trunk? - I don't immediately recollect he made me any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he heard you? - He stood close by my elbow.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you attend at Sir Sampson Wright's office? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you depose there? - I believe I deposed he answered yes; I said, I believed he answered yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 23d of January I got down from Spring Garden gate, and took that gentleman, Mr. Careless, up; he ordered me to pull up to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, I did s; he then ordered me to the New Hummums, Covent-garden; in going to the New Hummums my near side keeping rein broke, just about the end of Southampton-street; in consequence of that I did not think it proper to stop to mend my keeping reins there, but as soon as I got to the New Hummums the prosecutor got out, he ordered the porter or waiter, I don't know which, to take the luggage out of the coach; I then went to put my keeping reins to rights to mend them; in a few minutes after the waiter came out and says, coachman what is your fare? I told him a shilling, he paid me a shilling; I then continued, I suppose, five minutes at the same door, mending my keeping reins; after I was paid I walks on gently to Catharine-street, and I found the rank full there, and I goes to the Temple, and I put in second coach at the Temple, and I was not there above three or four minutes before a man calls, Coach, I follows him to take up at the Black Lion, Water-lane, Fleet-street, he ordered me to turn round, I turned the coach about, and pulls up to the inn; when the man had opened the coach door the gentleman was ready with his luggage,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200041"/>he said, coachman that trunk does not belong to me. The gentleman that I carried said so; he had luggage to take up himself; I told him no, I supposed it was the trunk that belonged to a gentleman that I had set down at the Hummums, that the porter had omitted taking out; in consequence of that he ordered me to drive him to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross; I drove him to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross; and as I was setting him down this Mr. Harrison, that gentleman there, was making enquiry.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time the gentleman said it was not his? - I put it openly on the foot board, because it should not be mixed with his things. I meant to return it when I had set down my fare.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know before he went away that the gun was missing? - I did not, it was three weeks after he was gone I knew it was missing, and the man came and told me that there was a gun to be sold; after the gun was missing there was a little bit of an oration in the part about our neighbourhood, that the gun was to be disposed of; I did not go, but the man went.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw your gun again? - The man was taken the 7th of February, he was brought to Bow-street the 8th of February, and there I saw my gun at the publick office; when the gun was found on this man I was not present.</p>

I found the gun when I went behind some straw; I did not interrupt it then; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200042"/>was not there then; I went back to my master again; my master sent me over again to fetch it, this was the same day; when I went over again I went to his lodgings in the evening, his lodgings are at Kingsborough-green; he told us he lodged there, I saw him there; I went in and asked if Mr. Sturges was at home; I said to him, I hear you have got a gun to sell, and I should be glad to see it if you please. He said, he had no such thing, and he knew nothing at all about any such thing of the kind. The constable delivered the gun up to me at Bow-street.</p>

On the 13th of February at half past two o'clock, I went down to get a little mortar, the ladder was not there as used to be, and I got down to the mortar by means of some boards; while I was putting the second shovel full in I heard some lead fall down, one part fell on the wall and the other on the joist; I immediately looks up, and see this Mahonay coming down the ladder through the joist, he was coming down three pair of stairs from me; I saw him coming down the ladder in that direction where that fell, and I fills my board full of mortar, and he came down, and I see him get over the wall, a back way; I don't think but that he saw me, he must hear me; I immediately came up and I found this piece of lead, one part of the wall and the other part on the joist; I picked it up, I goes directly to his foreman and told him what had happened, and afterwards we found this long piece in the same building, one story above, they both dropped down but one story above another, and I took it up myself; I knew Mahonay before he was employed on the building, he was a bricklayer's labourer; we went after we found the lead to seek some officer to take him up; we could not find any, and we took him up; we took Mahonay to the place, he had left the place and went to the foreman, and afterwards we came back again to the place, and then we carried him to Worship-street; his employ was in the basement story; the ladder had been taken out of the area; I had been down twice before, about half after eleven o'clock in that day; as soon as we came back from Worship-street I went down to Mr. Rolfe, and he told me to try to match the lead any where; I did; this was before he was committed, and the small piece and the large piece were all taken from the same place, they were both taken from the attick story, one was taken from the wooden roof which was on the laundry; the whole that is missing is not here by a great deal, it was sixteen feet four inches that was missing; and in the large piece of lead this chiswell was found.

About eleven o'clock I went to the watch-house and the watch-house keeper asked me if I had an owner for the breeches; I had not; says he, bring them to me, and he said, he knew the man, he had billeted him; I went down to Westminster, and I saw one of the regiment and he told me, if I went to the Haymarket some of them were quartered there; but Sporforth was gone to Basingstoke; I went into the Hay-market were this regiment were quartered, and I found he was gone to Basingstoke; I went to the George, I believe the sign is, and I desired the man to send a letter to Basingstoke to him, so he did, and she came up again on Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Sporforth. It was from this house, the George in the Haymarket, that you went to the White Bear? - It was.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to, the things being marked.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out waiting at the London coffee-house at dinner, and I was locked out of my lodging; coming home I was enquiring for a night house and I met with a man coming up the Haymarket, says the man, if you will go along with me I will take you to my lodgings; I met him at the White Bear, Piccadilly, and he had got this bundle in his hand; says he, if you will go along with me I will treat you with part of a pot of beer; we went into this house and he went away out with a pretence to call a coach, and he left me there, and I was there in the house in the box with the bundle; I did not know what the contents was, nor did I know any thing of the man; with that I set there till this watchman came in, and he asked who that bundle belonged to; I said, I don't know, it was not my property, it was the man's that came in with me; I know nothing of the man nor never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sporforth. That is the man that desired me to go into the house; he was some time persuading me to go in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was never near the door at all, nor near the house.</p>

On the 24th of January he was along with Bryant in my tap room drinking a pint of beer; Bryant took his place; he lived with me at this time. Mr. Farmer wanted a man and Gregory went to live with him, within two or three days after he left me; Bryant was along with my servant at that time; they had been backward and forward together, and were often juggling together; in the night they appointed at this time to meet there, and to come early together on Friday the 25th the next night; I heard them set and whisper, and say, come here to-morrow night, come earlier; they came again on Friday night the 25th, and there they sat till such time as it was time to shut up, which was about five minutes to eleven, and I unbolted the door and I let them go out into the gateway, and I saw them go down to the yard, and was there a little while, and I saw the stable door open; I saw Gregory run out of the stable and ran by the door into the street, he ran out of the gateway as hard as he could; this was about five or six minutes after I let him out; I don't think the whole was ten minutes; Gregory was against the stable door where the hay was carried, in which I first saw him; that stable is much about eight yards on the left hand side going down, it is one of the stables that Farmer occupies; he ran by me as fast as he could, then I opened the door and I went and I found Bryant standing at the door locking of it; he could not get the key out; this was after the other had ran; I said to him, you scoundrel you have been robbing of me; No, says he, I have not; Bryant did not lodge in my house, nor Gregory; I went a little further to my next stable door and I found the door open; it is my own, one of the six that I occupy; in the mean while I then went up and looked at my hay; Bryant went away after that; I went up to my own loft and I missed two trusses of hay from the loft of the stable that I occupy myself; I had four trusses of hay in particular on one side of my loft, I had laid them there that very evening about six o'clock at night; the hay sometimes runs better than it will at others, and I had a horse that was not well, and I made a reserve of that for that horse; I picked it out on purpose from among the other hay, I thought it was sweeter and better; I suppose there was a load and a quarter in the loft at that time, and this was laid by itself; Bryant nor Gregory had nothing with them when they went away. When I found Bryant at the door I asked him where the lanthorns were; says he, my wife was in the yard and I gave it her to carry home; I went back to the stable door again and I stopped a little while, and my son happened to come home from his work and he came into the yard, and he asked me what was the matter; I told him I had been robbed, and I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200047"/>him down to Mr. Farmer's for somebody to come up and open the stable door, to see if my property was there; I traced the hay from my own door to Farmer's door.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great deal of hay carried up that yard? - No, there is not, only at different times. Farmer sent somebody and we unlocked the door; at first I found the two lanthorns inside of the stable door, shut in on the right hand; then we went a little further into the stable and we found one truss of hay, we looked down a little further and we see the other; one lay on the ground and the other in a little binn. I can swear to the hay.</p>
               <p>Q Will you undertake to say that these two trusses are those which had been in your loft? - I can; I had picked them out by themselves, and I had laid them up; I can swear to it by the colour and herbage of the hay; I deal with two farmers.</p>
               <p>Q Do either of these farmers sell hay to any body but you, do you know where all these people in your yard buy their hay? - This is a lighter coloured hay and a deal more herbage in it; there is no such hay in the yard.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find any more hay in Farmer's stables besides these two trusses? - I dare say there was not two pounds; the man had borrowed a truss for Mr. Farmer's horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say, supposing you had seen these trusses of hay without these circumstances, that this was your hay? - When I took Bryant to the watch-house he told that he took my private keys. When Bryant came to work Saturday morning, about six o'clock, I charged the watch with him; he told me then that he did not take the hay, nor did he meddle with the hay; I asked him how he came to rob me; he told me he did not rob me; he told me he should have gone home about his business, but

The watchman came and took him to the watch house, and from there to the Rotation office in Marlborough-street. Gregory was taken up last Tuesday week, he absconded, we could not hear any thing of him; he was apprehended at a place called Winchmore Hill; the constable told me he knew the man and he would take him directly; I had a warrant for him the same day as Bryant was taken, but he was not taken till last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gregory. Please you my lord I belong to east Middlesex militia, they were embodied the 28th and I was obliged to go on Monday the 28th. Ask him my lord, whether he saw me take the hay out of his stable - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. When I came to work at six o'clock, as usual, my master charged the watch with me; there was no such charge, as my master has said; as to carrying in a bit of hay, or locking or unlocking the door I never did.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Farmer; I know nothing more than that the gentleman's son came to me between eleven and twelve o'clock, and took me out of bed to open the stable door that night, I went, but I could not find the right key, for the man Gregory did not come back that night; Mr. Mole and his son unlocked the door with another key; I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200048"/>the right key; and the trusses were there in the stable, they were both laying in the stable, one at the end binn and the other on the ground; I can say we had no hay of our own and we borrowed a truss, and there was no hay in the stable but what was out of the truss; I had not looked after the stable that night; I was in the stable before in the forenoon between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say what kind of hay there was in that stable? - I went to Mr. Haywood in the evening, just about sun set, and borrowed the hay, because there was none for the horses that night; Mr. Haywood gave it to Gregory; I was not present, but I went and borrowed it of Mr. Haywood, and it was to be used for Mr. Farmer's horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gregory. That man lives fellow servant with me. Please you my lord and gentlemen of the jury, I lived along with Mr. Mole about eleven weeks, I left Mr. Mole and he gave me an exceeding good character, and I went to live along with Mr. Farmer; at the time I went to live along with Mr. Farmer I did not know about the militia; after I had lived there about nine days I heard that the militia was to be embodied; accordingly I went on Sunday morning down to the militia at Edmonton; I was down there better than a fortnight; two men came down while I was in the ranks and asked me if my name was Gregory; I said, yes; they wanted me to go up to London with them; I asked them for what? They told me Mr. Mole wanted me, and had not I lived with him? I said, yes; I told them I would go; they went to my officer and and they said, that they had got a warrant against me; I came accordingly up to London with them; I know nothing of the affairs no more than a child that is just born.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. I lived along with Mr. Mole. About three days before I came to Mr. Mole, I lived with Capt. Morrison of the Guards; I had been out of place, and having nothing to do I heard that Mr. Mole wanted a man, and then after I had been there nine days, I was taken up and accused by my master of robbing him of two trusses of hay; he accused me of locking the door, and taking the key out of the door, which is no such thing; I never touched the door.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Gregory called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you value your hay at? - Three shillings.</p>

On Monday morning about half after eight o'clock, the 18th of this month, I ordered the prisoner to go to breakfast; the prisoner had a rush hand basket in his hand, with some balls and some other things, which he took up stairs into the warehouse; I followed the prisoner up stairs, having some suspicion; I placed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200049"/>myself in a room, the back part of the house, to endeavour to see if I could see him put any thing in his pocket, but I could not see him do any such thing, as such I came down stairs, when I came down to the lower part of the warehouse stairs I saw the prisoner go through to the front shop and he went out, I immediately went to the door and looked after the prisoner and found his pockets looked very bulky; I looked out at the door of the front shop, another porter was standing by, I ordered him to go and desire this man to come back again, I wanted to speak with him; he came back and out of his coat pockets I took these two parcels of horse hair; I ordered the prisoner up stairs, when we got up stairs I asked him what he was going to do with it, or what business he had to take it; I don't recollect particularly which question I asked him; he downed on his knees and begged I would let him go, and told me it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the kind, that he was going to make some cod lines with it; I told him he had got enough; he said, he meant to take out that part which would answer his purpose and the remainder he would have brought back again; I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he told me in Marlborough-court, Bishopsgate; I went accordingly and found he did not; I went back again, and I told him he had given me a wrong direction; the reason why I asked him was that I might get a search warrant and search his apartment, the first time I asked him was immediately after he had committed the robbery at half past eight; between ten and eleven after I had come back from the other place I asked him again; and he said, it was Marlborough-court, in Wentworth-street, near Petticoat-lane; I went and I found it was right, I went the same morning to his lodging; he told me he had a room on the ground floor and a room on the first floor; I asked him whether he rented the house or whether he took the rooms of any body; he told me he could not tell who lived in the house above him; I went and got a search warrant, and got to his house between twelve and one; we found several articles in the room, and among the rest we found one of his cards containing a direction where he lived before he went there; we found four pounds of hairs, two pounds I believe below and two pounds above, and also a hair broom head, and a flesh brush, and several articles which are not in the indictment; we took him before the Lord Mayor, and he was committed. There is two pounds of the hogs bristles which have got our private mark, and I believe them to be my own marking; I cannot swear to the horse hair; the broom head has got our mark on it; the flesh brush has no mark on it more than it is an article we sell in our shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat You don't pretend to identify it? - I believe it to be ours.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated just now that he stated he had never done the like before; you don't state that he owned he took it. - I say that he told me that it was the first time he had done any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he had taken that hair. What had you said when he said that? - I don't recollect exactly the words that I said to him; I asked him what he had got in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not at all threaten him? - I don't recollect that I said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. I fancy there is a great many thousand pounds weight of hair of that sort? - I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The two parcels that you particularly state to know to be yours, is because there is your mark upon them; on what part of the hair is it upon? - On the bottom.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you mark them? - We generally mark them with letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200050"/>Q. Are they all marked with one letter, or different letters? - Different letters according to the stiffness of them, this was a particular kind and it is a mark that we know the price by; it is a C.</p>
               <p>Q Then I suppose if you was writing upon paper you would make such a C as that? - Most likely I should not make it so large; this is made with a brush.</p>
               <p>Q. So it seems you can tell your own hand writing from any other, if you write even with a brush. Upon my word, sir, your faith is very strong; for your faith you may be a Mahometan. Then you mark them all on the heads in that manner? - No, only some.</p>
               <p>Q Pray, sir, if you had seen these bundles on a journey to York would you have supposed them to have been your's? - I should have supposed them to be ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it is a peculiar stile of hair. Is there any thing in the colour? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing in the smell? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Well this brush that you speak of you put that mark on other brushes? - Every one of this size.</p>
               <p>Q. You mark a great many in a year? - We do.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very possible then that a man might have bought fifty brushes out of that shop, or even out of other shops, that might have had that mark on it. The flesh brush you know nothing about. Had he lived with you some time? - To the best of my knowledge he came there about the month of November.</p>
               <p>Q How many partners has you master? - Not any in that business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that that is your writing? Recollect, it was done with a brush. - I believe it to be such.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave in you service? - He always behaved very well.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peat. How do you mean they have been in your possession? - They have not been opened but before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went out this morning to get a pennyworth of purl; I bought the hair of a man at the door; I wanted some to make some lark lines; he said he had got some very nice as would suit me; I bought the hair of the gentleman; I came in; Mr. Matthews told me to go to breakfast; when I was got about a hundred yards up the hill he sent after me and had me back, and took this hair out of my pocket; I told him I hoped he would let me go; so they took me into a room and locked me up; they asked me where I lived; I told them when I moved out of the Borough that I moved to Catharine wheel-alley, Bishopsgate, and from there I moved to Marlborough-court, Wentworth-street; then they came back to me some time after and told me I had given them a wrong direction; they asked me to write it down myself; they took the direction down; then I told them Marlborough-court, Wentworth-street; they went and they broke open one door and the other they got in at the window, and they not only took away these articles that my master dealt in but they took the money, a guinea and a half, and some silver, and they brought it to the turnkey at Newgate.</p>

Did you you take some money from the house? - Yes, a guinea and a half and three shillings; I thought it was unsafe to leave it as there was nobody in the house, and I delivered it to the prisoner before the turnkey.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole; the night this robbery happened I went with Vogle and Eckford when they opened the foundry; I saw him taken out of the foundry, and this parcel was in his hand; I was left centry outside for fear he should jump over out of window; the prisoner had the bundle, he carried it to the watch-house out of the foundry; I went to the watch-house with them, I followed behind; Vogle had the prisoner in his hand; Vogle and I had the key of a Small cupboard where the articles have been kept ever since till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the conduct of the prisoner during the time he was going from the foundry to the watch-house? - I saw nothing only that he seemed very dull.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he got it? - He said he went and slept there after the men had been at work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been locked out of my lodgings and I knew that the men got in to sleep in the foundry if they were locked out, and I got through the window to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Court to Bishop. Did the prisoner ever work at your shop? - I came to work in September last and he worked there then, some time before Christmas he had a burn, and he said he was not able to work, and by that means Mr. Eckford had got another man.</p>

               <p>I live in Leadenhall-street; I am a jeweller; I keep a shop there; I mean to impeach the evidence of Vogle and Macdonald; I know enough of Vogle as far as the best of my belief he is not to be believed on his oath, and I know enough of Macdonald to say the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Leadenhall-street? - Seven years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. You was rather fortunate to meet two of old acquaintance again. It is a lucky circumstance that you should happen accidently to be in court when there were two witnesses that you know. - When you have done with your soliloquy I will speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Davis we will take Vogle first. How long have you known Vogle? - I believe about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. There must have been some very peculiar transactions to enable you to form this opinion. - There were. I have a house in Cheapside which I occupy and carry on the same business as in Leadenhall-street, and I thought it my duty to serve constable, and I cannot say whether it was in the month of November or December, it was my night to be on duty and set up in the watch-house; I always made it my duty to patrole the streets instead of setting in the watch-house. One night one of the patroles led me towards Blackfriars, when I came there, I never had been down one street in which there is a watch-house, the watch-house is very little distance from our patroles beat; sir, says he, this is the way; I went after him thinking it was my duty to go that way; when I came into the watch-house I understood there was no constable there; this man passed as constable and with a great deal of importance asked me who I was; he was sitting dressed in his patrole dress and asked me what I wanted; I told him I should be glad to speak with the officer of the night; says he, what do you want? I am the officer of the night; the officer was sent for and this Vogle came and struck the patrole that was with me, it was after some words<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200053"/>had passed between them about his innovating on their premises in their ward; Vogle then struck him, in which this man I believe Macdonald, assisted him; I had got my great coat on, and there was a gentleman watching at the window all the time of the transaction; I waited nearly half an hour and said, I would go away, they made a prisoner of me, and kept me there; these men after the constable had come in, they declared and said, they would swear on their oaths, that I pulled off my coat to fight them, and had used a great deal of abusive language, which was quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this cause ever tried? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot help then expressing my astonishment at your swearing that you would not believe these men on their oath on this cause, and which cause was never tried.</p>

The young man, who I supposed to be a shop-man or an apprentice to Mr. Jennings, was shewing them several articles in the course of their business; these two gentlemen still kept pointing to the shopman, who was shewing the articles on the other side of the counter, which he kept his eye on them, and at the same time he shewed the articles he put them away on the other side of the counter; they came out, they passed me at the window, and they walked up the right hand of Cheapside from Jennings's shop, about one hundred yards, when they were joined by another woman without a cloak, a taller woman than the other two; I kept behind them, and there was some conversation took place between these three women; I followed them up Cheapside, opposite the shop of Mr.

             came in, and then the other bought a pair and gave me two shillings and sixpence for a pair, and when they went out Mr. Davis brought her back and said, she had got a pair of buckles, and I went out a door or two to get a constable, and when I came back the buckles were on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth. This woman that was with me asked me to go into the shop with her to buy a pair of buckles; I was coming out with her and this gentleman stopped me and said, he saw me take a pair of buckles through the shop window, and I never saw him in my life; I have no witness except the gentleman favours me.</p>

               <p>- FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was digging a shore in Somer's Town, on the 23d of January; we always make it a rule to go to dinner at twelve o'clock; the carpenters go to dinner at one o'clock, and one of the carpenters was going to dinner, and the man that was wheeling some stuff away was saying something to him about the carpenters being likely to lose some of their tools; in consequence of hearing this I went round to see, in the pursuit of the man, and the other man followed me, and I saw the prisoner at the bar out in a field, just behind the building; this was at about a quarter after one; I followed him out into the field, when I got within an hundred yards of him I saw something under his arm of his left side; he looked round and he saw me a coming, and made towards a ditch where there is a good deal of water, and then I saw him drop the saw from his coat, from his left side into the water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I was going across the ditch and he knocked me down.</p>

I had him then by the collar; with that he said, it was his own; I asked him how he came to put it there? then he said, he saw me coming after him and I might think that he stole it, with that he said then, that the saw belonged to one John and Richard, but did not mention any surnames; with that I told him he must go along with me to the public house, and he refused, and he said, he brought the saw from Knightsbridge; I took a plane out of his right hand pocket at the same time, which he said, he brought from the same place, and that he was going to carry them to Cambden Town to these two men; I was not satisfied with this, I took him to a publick house and sent for the constable; he first offered me six shillings to let him go; I told him no, if he gave me six guineas I would not let him go; with that there was a number of carpenters in the house, but none of them owned the saw or plane, with that he offered me nine shillings to let him go, and produced the nine shillings and three halfpence on the table; that was all the money he had, with that the constable said, there was no owner for the saw or the plane, we had no right to detain him; I told the constable I would take him before a magistrate till there was an owner; we took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed till the Monday following; I heard nothing of any owner till the Monday; I have got the saw here; before we took him to the office he seemed rather impertinent, and I insisted on his being searched, and he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper, with that he kept it in his right hand and refused to let any person see the sight of it; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a number of duplicates, the first duplicate that was looked at, it contained three saws, being pawned for eight shillings and six-pence; we told over the duplicates and they amounted to twenty, and in the twenty duplicates there was seventeen saws pawned, and two rules, two planes and a plow; two coats, a waistcoat and two pictures. (The saw produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q When had you worn these clothes? - Not for some months.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not laid them of course on his bed? - I had not; the place for keeping them was the trunk; a servant of my brother's kept the trunk and had the key, and had not locked it that day; that servant is not here, and there was some black clothes rolled up which I suppose was with an intent to carry away, when I went in first, one of the waiters of the inn came into the room, and left the candle; he had not gone out of the room before I discovered the man; I rung the bell and sent for Mr. Ibbotson, the master of the House; and I believe I said to Mr. Ibbotson, this is the manner that we are robbed; and I sent for a constable, and he was committed to the watch-house, I asked the prisoner how he came there? he said he was drunk; I had not been in my bed room since five o'clock that evening, I had gave no orders to have those clothes out, nor had I had them out for some months; and when I was in the room between five and six o'clock, the clothes were not on the bed then, and the trunk was shut.</p>

A few minutes afterwards I heard a rattle, I was just got into my watch-house in Berkley-street, not above one hundred yards from Mr. Platten's premises, though not in the view of the premises; then I observed Haycraft come past me, he was passing me before; I saw him, he was going from the premises of Mr. Platten; I knew him again well, it was a person with a short jacket on, he was very remarkable; Haycraft now is nearest to the jury; when I saw him pass the second time I did not know what was the matter, or else I should have stopped him then; a few minutes after

             was brought to the watch-house, and Turner confessed; I told him it would be better for him if he would impeach the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where does Badger-yard lead to? - From St. John's Square, into Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. This a thoroughfare through which any body may pass, is there any thing remarkable in a man's coming through there, it is free for any man? - It is certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen this man before in your life? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between one and two o'clock in the morning; you dropped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200060"/>your voice when my friend asked you whether it was a dark night? - It was not so very dark.</p>
               <p>Q Had it not rained that night? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself a little, had it not been raining a great deal that night? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You can remember a man's face whom you had never seen before in your life, but you cannot remember whether it rained or not; I ask you whether it had not rained a great deal that night? - I do not recollect, I was not out all night, I will not say any thing about it; that was not the point I expected to be asked to.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the point you expected to be asked to; on your oath had it not rained a great deal that night? - It might or might not; I remember it did not rain in the morning when I went to fetch Haycraft out of his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it rain when you pretended you saw this man? - I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you took this man Haycraft? - I believe it was about five when he was brought to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the regular inspector of the watch? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so now? - Now I am here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that answer does you any credit? - Well, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been discharged from that sort of employment? - No, I have been in it upwards of sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you a little while ago whether it rained that night or no, and you could not tell you said? - I reckon after twelve o'clock it is morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you thought I was talking about night only, between ten o'clock and twelve? - It did not rain whilst was walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no moon you told my friend. Can you tell us what sort of a hat the man had on? - He had on a round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he passed by you and brushed by you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought then he was one of the man's servants; you know you have been examined on this matter before; you told my friend he passed you a second time, on your oath did you say before the magistrate that he passed you a second time? - I don't know whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you must have a better recollection of it the next morning than you can have now, a month afterwards, yet at that time of night on that view you venture to swear positively to a man's person? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you could not recollect the next morning to say he had passed you a second time. Did you search this man when he was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know whether he had any knife about him by which he could effect this purpose? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you have been sixteen years superintendant of the watch to the present time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not your business to be out all night? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great many rainy nights about the month of January and February? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are sure the prisoner Haycraft past you? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You said in your first examination that you looked into the prisoner Haycraft's face, and there was a lamp opposite? - There was.</p>

In a few minutes after I heard the gate go moving backward and forward; I got out of my box and went close against the gate, then I saw

            , I did not know the other; I am sure the other man is not the man that I laid hold of with him; John Turner was coming out of the little gate, I walked along with them about twenty yards; I was afraid to take them in the narrow passage, and when they came out I sprung my rattle and collared them both; the other man struck me with an oath and ran away; I kept Turner, I am sure Turner is the man at the bar that came out of the yard, and another with him: from the time they came out of the yard I never was away from their side; I gave them all the good words I could, till I came to the place where I took them; I took them to the watch-house when I had taken them, and there I saw Mr. Aslip the last witness, then I went and called Mr. Platten up; then Mr. Platten and I went to the watch-house, and we went back together to the yard; Mr. Platten looked about and he clapped his hands together and said, God bless me, there is somebody has taken all the glasses out of the coaches; we found some glass close by the yard gate; we left the glass there, and went to the watch-house. I went back again to the yard, and Mr. Platten put the glass in one of the coaches all night for safety; I can make no observation on the glass at all; I looked at him, and I said, they were very good glasses; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you took Turner he went very quietly with you? - He made no resistance at all.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that got away struck you? - This man strived to get away, and I paid him over the head with the rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Haycraft was not the other, or you would have known him? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. If Haycraft had been at all coming out of that yard, you must have seen him? - I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search Turner? - I did at the watch-house, and found nothing at all on him.</p>
               <p>Court to Aslip. How far might Haycraft be from the gate of Mr. Platten's when you first saw him? - It was as he came out of the gate of Mr. Platten's yard in Badger-yard.</p>

In consequence of what happened I went to the watch-house on the 23d of January; I went afterwards to the Coach-yard, and I found the doors of the coaches open in the yard, and the tassels cut off; there were five glasses gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of glasses were these? - Plate glasses covered with wood and cloth. I went then to the watch-house again; I came back again and we looked in and found the glass in the yard close to the gates one or two of them, the wood was separated from the glass, and the glass was gone from the frame, the other was all packed together, only one separated from the frame, the others were whole; the tassels that draw them up were cut off, or else they could not draw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200062"/>through the frame of the door; I know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the coaches to see how many were lost? - There was five, two pair and an odd one, and there was five laying down close to the corner of the gate, I put them in the bottom of a coach; we went after Mr. Haycraft, there were many went with links and flambeaus, we found him at a court in Liquor Pond-street, it may be near three o'clock in the morning; the other prisoner was with us, the other prisoner called him two or three times; we found him there and he was taken into custody, and I was very happy, and they were both of them taken to Clerkenwell New Prison; I got home to my premises about five o'clock, when I found the glass where I had left them in the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you drive your coach that day? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you observed these coaches from whence you lost the glasses? - I had seen one of them come in that evening, the first coach I looked at.</p>

On the 23d of January, Wednesday, about a quarter after seven at outside, it was moon light, I went there with a little boy, I perceived the prisoners long side of the barge, they were in a boat, I had seen them before on the river, I cannot say I had seen them very often. When I came along I saw them take up one sack and hawled the cloth on the remaining part of the vessel; they lifted it to the skiff in which they were; the Yarmouth was about two foot and a half from the edge of the water; they could reach to the cargo of the barge standing in the skiff; they perceived me coming to the barge when they had lifted the sack into the skiff, and they shoved away; I said to the little boy, pull, and I held my arm out and lay hold of the skiff; I was about twenty-two feet from them when I saw them and I called to them not to heave them overboard, they had two in the skiff, but I only saw them actually take one; just as they had taken the two sacks and heaved them overboard, I jumped into the skiff immediately; the prisoner Tucker hove one overboard on one side and then he turned to get the other over, he could not get it overboard without assistance; I never lost sight of him from the time I saw him take one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200063"/>sack from the barge till the time I saw them thrown overboard. I called to one Henry Hall to shove off; I then called out to him that they had been robbing the barges, he is a watchman to Mr. Duncan, he watches on the barges, but it was not in his charge then, he shoved off; we got into the skiff and Tucker made use of an expression, and asked what I could swear to? the words that he used were, buggar you, what can you swear to now? on this I and Hall secured them; they surrendered quietly; we put them in custody of the headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the barge was it they threw the sacks overboard? - It might be twenty yards from the Yarmouth. I went to that spot the next day, somewhere about nine in the morning; Mr. Hall and Corsaint made a search and got the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of these sacks of barley? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there nothing but barley in that barge? - Nothing but barley, all Mr. Davis's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Tucker. I want to ask whether he saw me along side of the craft or not? - I saw them both.</p>

               <p>I live nearly opposite where the deceased lodged; my husband and the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200065"/>worked together; the deceased came over to my place on Wednesday the 9th of January about twelve o'clock, and she asked me if my husband was come home to dinner? I said, no; she asked me if I knew where they were? I said, my husband talked of a fight in the morning and I take it they are gone there; so with that she asked me to come over to her place; I went over and had been some time in the room where she lodged, I went to order a pot of beer for she and I, so I had ordered the beer, and when I ordered the beer I see the prisoner was wheeling my husband in a wheelbarrow to the Brazen Head, a public house, they went in there; I take it they stopped about a quarter of an hour before they came; they had a pot of beer in their hand when I saw them, but whether they drank I cannot tell, I did not stop to see; so with that I came home and I was standing in the room of the deceased and the prisoner came home; I saw him come into the room; when I saw him coming along, I said to the deceased, here is your husband coming Mrs. Ruddle, you had better hide the beer; I sat at the window and she answered and said, no, he might think more of it if she was to hide it; so with that he came up into the room, and when he came I handed him the pot to drink, it was in the room up one pair of stairs, and he drank good health to me and good health to his wife, and he handed the pot to his wife and she took the pot; so with that she began talking to him, and asked him if he was not ashamed of himself to stay out so drinking and his poor brother so ill? he said, it did not signify talking to him he wanted some victuals; he asked her what there was for dinner? she said, salt beef and carrots, and if he could not make a meal of that he must go without.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said rather roughly? - I think it was; she checked him when he came in about being out drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. This was said crossly to him at the time? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in was he in good humour? - Yes, he seemed in as good humour as ever I see him in in my life; so he went to the cupboard and he looked in; so whether he said he could not eat it I cannot tell, I sat opposite the window and I saw the man that had been drinking along with them, there had been a good many drinking together, the man lodges in our place; I see him and says to Mr. and Mrs. Ruddle, I must go and send my husband some victuals I see he can send for some; so I went down stairs and went over to my own place, and I cut some bread and meat, and I sent it to my husband to the public house; so with that I came down stairs and came out, and was going over to Ruddle's; so when I came down stairs a gentlewoman that is here,

            , says, Mrs. Baker you cannot think what an outcry there is with Mrs. Ruddle, I take it he is beating of her; I ran up stairs into the room directly and when I came up stairs he stood at the bed room door with the child in his arms; so I said to him, I am surprized at you Ruddle to get ill using of your wife, as I hear you are; so he said, he had not been touching of her; and I said, he must by what I had been told; he said, she began with him; I had a child in my arms and I laid down the child in the cradle, and I lifted her up in my arms, she laid on the floor with her face towards the ground; so when I lifted her up I said, Lord have mercy on me Ruddle you have killed your wife; I think he said, I hope not, she was only in a fit, and he said, I knew she was subject to fits.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that so? - I have seen her in fits before, but not this time; so I took her in my arms and set her in a chair, and got hartshorn and water, and I thought if she was in a fit I would see and bring her too, and when I got her into the chair she made a very heavy sigh<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200066"/>and looked up to me, and she never spoke nothing after that nor ever offered to move after, she never spoke at all; there was hartshorn in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar assist at all? - He did; he endeavoured to bring her too and took her in his arms, he got the hartshorn and rubbed her temples, and he seemed to take very great account and cried sadly over her, and tried a good deal to bring her to, and had her in his arms a long time, for half an hour, he took all the pains he could for bringing her to life again, and was very much distressed, and cried bitterly a good deal; so while he had her in his arms the harts-horn was all used, and I said, I would go and fetch the doctor, and I went for some hartshorn; I don't think I was gone above a quarter of an hour, and when I came back he had her in his arms the same as I left her, he was endeavouring to bring her to, and I asked him how she did? he hoped, he said, she was better; with that he desired me to take her into my arms, he asked me if the doctor was coming that I went for? I said, I don't know for I saw nobody but a little boy, and he said, he would tell his master to come directly; so with that I had been a little time in the room with him and his brother, and he took on very sadly and cried, and he asked me if I had any money? so I made answer and said, Ruddle I have got 6 d. if that would be of any service, and he made reply, then he would have the 6 d. and would go and fetch the harts-horn, and bring the doctor directly; and he went and I never saw any thing of him till I saw him at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any blood on the floor? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have used any instrument? - No, I saw nothing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see any marks of violence? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people attended her afterwards? - I cannot tell, there was so many; there was but one doctor, but the doctor's man came first, and the doctor came after, and the doctor's man blooded her before the doctor came</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she never recovered? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Baker, you probably have known the deceased and the prisoner some time, how did they live together? - I never see them live any way disagreeable that ever I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your account he seemed to be in perfect good humour when he came into the room? - Yes, in perfect good humour as ever I saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he fond of his wife? - Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children had he? - Two, one is two years old and the other is about a twelve month.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and the deceased were lodgers of mine, they lodged in the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what passed on this unfortunate occasion? - I saw nothing, but I heard, nobody saw but Ann Baker; the first that I heard was Mrs. Baker run down stairs after Mr. Ruddle came home, I got up and watched her home; I do not know what was the reason, but I did do it. As soon as she was gone, there was a strange noise upon the floor were the prisoner and the deceased were; it founded to me like a fall and a blow, when I heard Mrs. Ruddle give an uncommon cry, I got up and took my infant in my lap, and went to open my door for to hear what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200067"/>was the matter, and just as I opened the door I heard Mrs. Ruddle cry out murder very fierce; when I went to the door, Mrs. Ruddle came down stairs and she went and stood at the door with the little boy in her arms; I looked at her and she looked at me, and she shaked her head three times, but never spoke, and when she came by to go up stairs again, I asked her to walk into my room to stop a bit; she made me no answer, but shaked her head and went up stairs, there was a child in the room, and she says to the child, I do not know who you belong to, and she took the child to put it down stairs, for it to go down stairs; he told her she was a damned lyer, she did know who it belonged to, and as soon as she got into the room there was the same noise as I heard before; there was a rumbling on the floor like fails, and a noise like blows; then I heard Mrs Ruddle give an uncommon cry, I got up and opened my door, before I could get to the stairs I heard her cry murder; when I went up stairs I met Mr. Ruddle on the landing place; I asked him what he made such a noise and such a piece of work in my house for; I asked him whether or no he was not ashamed to use a poor woman of ill? he asked me, what business I had with it, what affair it was of mine? I told him if he made such a noise and riot in my house I would fetch a constable and have him taken up; he told me I might fetch a constable and have him taken up and be damned; he told me I should go down stairs, if I did not he would kick my backside down stairs; Mrs. Ruddle said, I should not go down, very fierce; at that time she was standing at a chair before the window, with one hand to her head and the little boy at her left knee, and he said, if I would not go into my own apartment he would kick me down, and he looked so spiteful and malicious, but having a young infant in my arms to save the child I went down into my own room and shut my door, and sat myself down, I got a clout and put on the young child, in that instant, I was struck all with a cold shiver, directly on that I heard the same rumbling as I heard before; I heard a noise in the prisoner's room like falls and heavy blows, like that of people fighting; it was the same sort only louder than I heard before, and I heard Mrs. Ruddle call out Mrs. Bishop, she gave two cries more and I heard no more of her; and then I stopped a while and I heard Mrs. Baker come in, and I heard her say, damn it Ruddle what have you been doing; and I sat and lissened a great while, and I could hear nothing of Mrs. Ruddle, and heard a great crying and walking about the room, but did not know what was the matter, and I went up and knocked at the door, Mr. Baker was there, Mr. Ruddle opened the door and came to me himself; I asked him how Mrs. Ruddle was; Oh! he said she was very well, she would do very well, she would come to presently; I stopped and talked to him a good while on the stairs, and asked him how he could use her so? says he, does not your husband and you have words sometimes? I said, yes, but not blows; he told me he should give her a beating no more; I asked him what he abused me so for? I had done him no harm; he asked my pardon and wanted me to shake hands with him; he asked me what I would have to drink? I told him nothing at all; I went down stairs and stopped a while again, but I could hear nothing of Mrs. Ruddle, Mrs. Baker was in the room all the time; I went down and stopped a while and I went up to the door again, and he came to the door himself again, by some means or other the door slipped out of his singers as he went to pull it after him; I asked him to let me go into the room? and he said, no, she would do very well; I says,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200068"/>she looks to me to be dead, why will not you let me go into the room? he said, no, no, never mind she will do very well; I says to him, she looks to me to be dead, you have killed her, you have killed her, you have given her the death wound; he said, no, no, she will do very well; I went down stairs and alarmed the neighbourhood as fast as ever I could, in the mean time he changed his coat and hat and he came down, as I stopped at the door, and went down the street as unconcerned as if nothing had been the matter, and he walked down the garden and along the street, just as he used to do when he went to his daily work, Mrs. Baker came down the stairs and called me up, as soon as I entered the room I saw she was dead; I says, to Mrs. Baker, she is dead; Oh yes, she says; says I, have you sent for a doctor? says she, no; then says I, send for a doctor directly; I went down stairs and sent some little boy to the doctor; the doctor's man came, but I did not go up stairs to see any thing further.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation to day with any body about this? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any thing been read to you to day? - No, I am sure of that</p>
               <p>Q. Has nobody read a deposition to you in the parlour nor in any room near this court? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Baker. Was not some deposition read here to day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the last witness there? - No, it was this good woman and me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Bishop. Whether I ever said that I would kick you down stairs? - Yes, to be sure you did.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; on Wednesday the 9th of January last, as near five o'clock as I can guess, two boys came desiring I would go immediately to see a poor woman who had been having words with her husband and was either dead or in a sit; at that time I was in a conversation with a gentleman in the shop on some business, I desired my assistant to go with the boys and I would follow directly; after the assistant went I went after him, I found the deceased laying on the floor senseless and motionless without any symptoms of life whatever; the assistant had attempted to bleed her without any effect; on that I examined the body particularly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200069"/>at that time to see if there were any marks of violence about the body, on examining particularly all over the body particularly the external part, I saw no appearance of violence there whatever, the only appearance I saw was under the chin where there was a little bit of skin grazed off; on enquiry I found that had been there for several days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine sufficiently to see whether she might possibly die of a fit? - I saw no symptoms of her dying in a fit at that time, at that time I could not tell what had been the occasion of her death; there was no mark any where and no appearance of blood no more than on the apron from attempting to bleed her; at the time there was a conversation that she was pregnant, and I particularly examined the stomach to see if there was any mark in her stomach where there might have been a blow that would have occasioned an immediate suspension of life, but I saw none on the stomach, and the stomach was perfectly flat, no appearance of her being far advanced as I was told; I was ordered before the coroner on Saturday, and was ordered to examine the body, and I opened it, on examining the body at that time there was no appearance of violence any where on the body, except about the neck from ear to ear, and under the left ear a great fullness of swelling, a very great extravasation of blood. On opening of the body I found the whole of the viscera was in a perfect healthy natural state, both the thorax and abdomen, and she was not pregnant; on referring to the head and examining the scalp no injury at all, nor to the bones of the head, on opening the head and turning on one side the covering of the brain, the dura mater, there was a general extravasation of blood, there was a great extravasation of blood on the cerebrum and cerebellum.</p>
               <p>Q. Now could you on the dissection of this head discover what was the occasion of this poor woman's death? - No doubt it was that extravasation.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that that had been caused? - As if violent pressure about the neck had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it be done by a violent blow? - It was in consequence of violence but what sort of violence I cannot say, it appeared by violent pressure of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any measure to find out whether it might be by a fit? - I did, there might be the same symptoms take place of a fit or a violent blow, or fall, but there would not be that great extravasation of blood about the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I take you right any violent means, or any accidental means that might be the occasion of this rupture of the vessels might have had that effect? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if the woman had died in a fit such would have been the appearance as they were now? - Possibly, though in a slighter degree.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know the prisoner at the bar and the deceased? - I might know them personally, but never to my knowledge; I have only to observe, when I saw her on Wednesday there was no appearance of the blackness about the neck and of the extravasation; the pressure would not shew immediately, but it would some time after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That day that this accident happened I had been out along with my fellow workmen having a little beer, and my wife had been drinking too, not with me; when I came home it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Baker was in the room and they were drinking some beer and they asked me to drink, and I drank, I drank both their good healths, and soon after Mrs. Baker went out of the room; in Mrs. Baker's absence I asked my wife whether we should have our dinners; she replied, no, where I had been to get my beer there I should go and have my dinner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200070"/>and I replied, and said to her, why should you be angry you have been drinking a little as well as I have; she said that did not signify for I should have no dinner there; I was sitting down in the chair and words arose, she being angry with me she took the poker out of the fire and struck at me twice, and I asked her why she did that? for I said, I was not angry with her if she was not angry with me; she still kept the poker in her hand and I took hold of her by the arms, and set her down in the chair and begged of her to be quiet, and she got up again and I set her down in the chair again close by the window, and being rather intoxicated with liquor she alarmed the neighbourhood, which I had not meddled with her at all; she got up again and said, I should go out of the room I should not stop there; I replied and said, I should not go till I had something to eat; she came to me in the mean time and attempted to put me out of the room; I took hold of her again for to set her down in the chair again, and with attempting to set her on the chair against the window I shoved her beside the chair and the chair and she, and I fell all down together, the cradle stood close by, the rockers of the cradle caused the blow at the side of her temple; that is all.</p>

I saw the child lay dead on the naked boards naked without any covering nor nothing, and his little head was in an old slipper of her's in a dark part of the closet; I returned down stairs very much frightened; I did not make any more observations on the child, and I said, what am I to do? what is this that is come to my house? and she asked me, Mrs. Williams, what is the matter? I says, O you brute, you ask me what is the matter, and you know what you have been about locking yourself up stairs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200072"/>all day, and she begged my pardon; she says, I beg your pardon Mrs. Williams, I could not help it I miscarried; miscarriage or not miscarriage I should know of it; for God's sake, says she, say not a word about it to nobody and I will take it away in the morning, and have it buried, and I will go to my uncle and be there; No, says I, not a limb of it shall go out of my house in that manner; then Mrs. Gibbs came down stairs and asked what was the matter? she is a lodger of mine; I told her there was matter enough with me, that woman had told me she had miscarried, but however, says I, she has got her dead child in the cupboard; with that Mrs. Gibbs answered, let me see the child will tell you whether it is a miscarriage or not; I took a candle and took Mrs. Gibbs with me up stairs, we went together into the room and to the closet, and the prisoner

               <p>Q. Before this had you seen any symptoms of a delivery besides the child? - Yes, it was in the pot along with the baby in the closet and an old rag of a pocket handkerchief with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the after burden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after this happened? - The next morning, I went up stairs and asked her if she would have something to eat, and asked her why she did not leave the child alive in some corner of the room for me, and if she had a mind to run away herself if she had left the child alive I should not care; I wish I had now Mrs. Williams, says she; whether she meant that she wished she had left the child alive or wished that she had run away, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to forget this before the Coroner? - I answered every thing they asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about the birth? - She told me it was a miscarriage; I asked her whether she found the child was dead or alive with her? and she told me she believed it was alive in the birth; I went with that and acquainted the people at the office; I went first of all to a gentleman, Mr. Ashmole, in Petty France and told him what had happened and he went with me to the justice's office, Queen-square; she was in bed all this time in my house,</p>

Did you lock her in the next morning? - I did not; the parish people came there about ten o'clock on Wednesday and the woman from the work-house was watching her all night.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known this woman a good while, of course you must have had a good opinion of her? - I had a very good opinion of her, if she was a sister of mine I could not have a better opinion of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps she had before this time communicated to you that she was with child? - Yes, she agreed with me to nurse her for the month; she told me the first time she came she was married and with child, and since she came to lodge with me she told me that she had an uncle in Bond-street and kept a public house, who had promised to send her three sacks of coals for her laying in and a sack of wood, and she told me that a relation had promised her all the baby linen, but she never brought none to my house; I saw her working at a bit of a shirt and a cap, I asked her whether she was doing her baby linen? she said, yes, my baby linen is at a relations, this is nothing but to amuse me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before she was brought to bed you see her at work about this shirt? - About a month or more I had seen such a thing in her hand; but she told me her baby linen was at a relations.</p>
               <p>Q. From her coming to you she made no secret that she was with child? - She told me she was with child, and she told me she was married, and I was to take care of her during her laying in.</p>
               <p>Q. That was agreed upon? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with nursing of the child? - She told me she would never suckle herself, nor no woman living should suckle her child; I was telling of her one day of bringing something for the baby's use; she used to say, don't you fear I shall have every thing that I want for my baby in time; says she, I shall not lay in till the latter end of February; she was going on in my debt, telling me she had a yearly income and the writings were in Mr. Montague's hands; she said, she had 15 l. a year; she told me the Wednesday morning after she was delivered that she was not married.</p>

I heard her speaking these words, I cannot because I am cleaning myself; and my aunt came down and told Lewis that she was a cleaning herself, and would be down by and by; she was not very long in the room and I heard her come out of the door and shut the door after her, and called to Lewis, if you want to speak to me come up; she stood on the landing place; Lewis went up and spoke to her; he was there about five minutes; I don't know what they were saying, I did not hear that at all, but he returned down stairs and went out, and my aunt went out to fetch her milk home, and in the time that my aunt was out she came down stairs, and I was sitting with my face towards the window sewing, she came by me and sat down in the corner by the fire; I asked her what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200074"/>she had been doing up stairs, and why she did not come down and keep me and my child company? I have been sewing, says she, very busy about it; that was the very words; and I said, your thimble is here; she told me she had another thimble in her pocket; I said, I thought you were ill or something; no, no, says she, I was not ill, when I am ill I will let you know fast enough; I was in the room down stairs by the fire; my aunt came home about half past five o'clock, and she drank tea with us about seven as usual; about nine o'clock at night we had a bed in the two pair of stairs not made, my aunt told me to go up and make the bed, so I did, as I was going up I saw a stain in the landing place where she stood to talk to Lewis; as I was coming down after I had made the bed I turned into this room, and the room was all over of the same.</p>
               <p>Q.

I saw the knot on the left side, and Mrs. Gibbs undid the knot directly, for my aunt told her, and they carried the child down stairs and had it in a flannel by the fire; the child was so cold it was all in vain, and then they carried it up again and put it down in the closet where they found it, and came down stairs both of them, but my aunt put her to bed first, and we went down stairs and my aunt locked the room door after her, and my aunt went out for a doctor, but the doctor could not come that night; I looked at the child after the ribbon was taken off and the track of the ribbon was in the child's neck.</p>

               <p>Q. We understand that you went up stairs this night to examine the room, who did you go up with? - With Mrs. Williams, and I saw as fine a child as ever I set my eyes upon in the cupboard with its head in an old shoe; I put my hand on its left shoulder and I thought then that I saw its right foot wag, that made me cry out to Mrs. Williams, bring me a flannel for I think it is alive now;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200075"/>I observed a great deal in the cupboard; I took the child up, Mrs. Williams said, what is this ribbon about its neck Mrs. Gibbs? I laid hold of the ribbon at one end and off came the ribbon; I gave it a good hard pull; we carried the child down stairs in a flannel and we rubbed it by the fire; I could observe no life in it, but it was very black about the mouth, and looked to be a blow on the temple; I carried it up stairs again, and I put it where I took it from as I found it was dead; I said, I will take care of the ribbon and I gave it to the Coroner, and I received it of Latimer now; it is a silk ribbon.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner, about ten weeks ago the prisoner lived with Mr. Trevers as a chair woman; I was an assistant to Mr. Trevers as an apothecary; I asked her once what time she expected to lay in? she said, in eight weeks; I asked her if she was going to stay with us in the situation of a servant? she said, she could not as she had not above eight weeks before she expected to lay in; I enquired what she meant to do with her infant? it was one afternoon while we were at tea; she said, to put it out to nurse and to procure herself a situation as wet nurse; she was only there till we were supplied with a constant servant; she slept in the house while she was there; there was no concealment whatever.</p>
               <p>- LINN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; I live in Parliament-street. On the 30th or 31st of January I was desired by the Coroner to examine the body of the child, previous to the Coroner's sitting; I found an evident mark like a ligature about its neck, and a slight excoriation, as done by the ligature; I opened the body; I found the lungs had contained air, having been partially inflated; the blood vessels about the neck and heart were particularly turgid and full; I did not open the head, if the child had breathed it must have been a very short respiration; if it had breathed at all it must have been very short.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the lungs to be inflated to such a degree without the child having some degree of breath? - I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the breath which it might take in the act of delivery be sufficient to inflate the lungs? - It might most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet the child die instantly? - It might. I went up to the prisoner and told her that I understood there was a ribbon found about the child's neck; I wished to know of her what was the reason for applying it; she said, she applied it to bring the body of the child from her; she found herself in great pain and that it stuck at the shoulders; she was pulling for about ten minutes before she could get it away from her; the child was remarkable large and it appeared to me that she could not have got it away without some such assistance. I am not a practitioner in midwifry, here is a gentleman here who can speak better to that point, he is the man midwife to the parish; but that is my opinion of the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200076"/>Q. Now, Sir, supposing this story to be true, suppose the child had been some time stuck by the way, by the shoulder, before she applied the string, might not that impediment suffocate the child? - In my opinion equally so.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the child might be suffocated in the delivery before the application of the string? - I believe it frequently happens.</p>
               <p>- GRAVES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a man midwife employed by the parish; I saw the child, and a very large child it was, prodigious large over the shoulders, and when the child sticks so it stops the circulation between the mother and the child, and destroys the child ninety-nine out of an hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it likely it would be the case with this? - I have no manner of doubt.</p>

               <p>I was told that this young man was shot, in consequence of this I went to Bartholomew's Hospital and there I found him; I believe he was shot on Sunday night the 18th of November, and the Tuesday following I went to him, to the best of my knowledge, and we found him in Queen's Ward, his father was with me, and his father asked him how it came to happen; he said, that he came to a new public house near Tabernacle Walk, and a woman of the town and he had some crank, gin and water; on this he said, that he was there and when he came out he heard this patrole, who is the prisoner, cry patrole; this woman went up to him and said to the patrole, this man has got my bonnet; has he? says he; then he pointed the bayonet at him, and he ran away being frightened at the bayonet; on this he said that he ran very hard; I understand that he was rather deaf of hearing; on this he said that he ran near an hundred yards before he dropped; we begged of him to tell us the truth for the physicians had told us his life was in danger and he could never recover.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased told that he was in danger? - Afterwards we told him the next day, for the physicians had told us that he was so; he said he ran away being frightened, and in about an hundred yards he dropped; in consequence of this we went to the neighbourhood to see if we could learn any thing of this transaction, at last we found one Mr. Mills and he told us he knew and had seen every thing transacted of it, and we went to the sister and she told us; on this we made particular enquiry whether there was any alarm of murder. Also the Sunday before he died he declared that was the truth that he had said to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about the bonnet? - He observed one time to the nurse that she threw her gown over her head when he saw the patrole and the bonnet dropped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Jones what are you? - I belong to the India House.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you act as an attorney in this business? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never represented yourself as acting in this business? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's inquest on this occasion? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The Coroner's jury who heard all this deposition, I believe, brought it in this was justifiable and inevitable homicide on the part of the man? - We were turned down and knew nothing what was brought in; for any thing I know the jury brought him in guilty of shooting him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick by this answer? have you never heard that the jury brought it in justifiable homicide? - I don't know the terms of the law in that. The prisoner was not taken up till after he was at Hounslow Heath; there were four bails against him and they never surrendered him up.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not he attend the Coroner's jury himself? - I cannot say; I never saw him but once and that was before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200078"/>Q. You never learned what was the verdict of the Coroner's jury? - I understood that they brought it in not guilty of murder, but of shooting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ever make any enquiry what the verdict was? - No, we were ordered to prefer a bill before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - By different opinions of different people.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear you was ordered to attend the Grand jury and prefer a bill of murder against him? - The father-in-law was advised to do so and I told him I would attend and give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that to be an order? - Mr. Shelton drawed out the bill or his clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any man ever order you to attend the Grand jury to prefer a bill of indictment? - We had a just right to get justice done; the prisoner was under bail of four men of forty pounds each; he was bailed before the death of the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now we must go gently on with you? - If you please.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they bailed him with four men in forty pounds each that he was to surrender if the man died; then he was to appear before the Coroner's Jury? - I supposed that the bail ought to bring him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on your oath did not you hear that the Grand jury had acquitted him, and that therefore you advised the the father-in-law to indict him for murder? - I did not we were advised to come before the Grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You was advised to that? - I had not a doubt but I should go before the Grand jury, I was compelled to it because there were subpoenas given.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you advise the father-in-law to indict the man, yes or no, for murder? - I cannot charge my memory, it is three months ago; several of us did; I might say prefer the bill before the Grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, on your oath? - I might for what I know, but I think to the best of my knowledge I did not; I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not think you did? - I have told you as I told you before; I cannot take on me to say; we were advised in different companies to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took out the subpoenas? - Mr. Cummins the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the Coroner's jury had sat.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you prefer the bill for murder? - The very next sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the Coroner's jury sit? - On the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not at all bound over to prefer a bill of indictment? how came you to tell me you was ordered to attend the Grand jury? - Ordered or not ordered we were advised.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again whether you was ordered? - No further then we were advised; who could order us, we were advised but not ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear that you was ordered to go before the Grand jury? then you was never ordered? - By no authority.</p>
               <p>Court. You come here to speak to expressions, and you therefore ought to be accurate in the expressions you use; was you examined before the Coroner? - We were examined before Mr. Shelton, I think there were a few questions asked.</p>
               <p>Q. And your examination taken down? - To the best of my knowledge Mr. Shelton might; I did not sign any thing, I believe he would not hear but very little what I had to say, because he said I was not present when the man was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a man of the name of Cropwell and Black examined; they were not present when the man was shot, he heard them? - Mr. Shelton asked them who ordered them to there? and they made answer that the bail had ordered them; that they found we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200079"/>the runners to take this man up; Mr. Shelton advised the father that it would be only throwing his money away to prosecute the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present then? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you begin with saying you was ordered? - He was not taken up on the Coroner's inquisition at all; I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. After the Coroner had brought in their verdict you did not enquire what it was? - I was told afterwards that it was brought in guilty of shooting, but not of the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you subpoena all the witnesses that were examined before the Coroner? - We did not know of it till two hours before the jury sat.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was compelled by being subpoened to give in evidence before the Grand jury. Did you subpoena all the witnesses that were before the Coroner? - No, only Sarah Mills and I, and another witness; they were all subpoened but the doctor, who could not be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you meant to say that the other witnesses who were examined before the Coroner, where subpoened before the Grand jury? - Yes, the two were; Mr. Cummins subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the witnesses subpoened? - There were several witnesses examined before the Coroner in favour of the prisoner, but not in ours.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to do with it; is it your cause? - No, it is Mr. Cummin's cause.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you make use of those words, our cause? - It is an error in judgment no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you go before the Grand jury of Middlesex first, and did they not throw out the bill? - I almost undertake to say it was not drawn up</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there was a bill prefered in Middlesex and thrown out? - No, I believe not on my oath, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say at some time of the last sessions that you would give such an oath as would do that man's business? - No, I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know Mr. Hedge? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Moody? - No.</p>
               <p>Q Mr. Rederick? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you would give such an oath as would do that man's business? - No, never to the best of my knowledge; I might have said that I would do all my endeavour to take the prisoner, but never to say that I would do for him, to any person whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never declared to any body that you would make such an oath as would do the prisoner's business, or words to that effect? - I will take my oath that I never said that I will do the prisoner's business, but I would do my endeavour to take him prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you never say words to that effect? - If I was to die this moment to the best of my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a fact which you must recollect? - I cannot, if I knew that I had said so I would acknowledge it; I positively do not think that I ever said such a word.</p>
               <p>- GALE sworn.</p>
               <p>I came on account of the young man, the deceased; he worked for me and boarded with me and lodged with me; I know nothing of this transaction.</p>

               <p>I live in Whitfield-street, Tabernacle Walk, No. 19; I had been out on Sunday evening and returning home I found the deceased laying in a sad situation, near about half past nine to the best of my knowledge, he was laying at No. 4, Friendly-place, at the steps; I thought that the man really had been in liquor; I then knocked at the inhabitants door the deceased laid at, and they brought out a candle; I examined the man and I found he was speechless, for some time I could not get any thing at all out of him, so then I said to the inhabitant, it was a pity the man should lay there in that situation; I supposed the man had been in liquor and had had a fall, and hurt himself; immediately some blood came out of his stomach; I then said, to the inhabitant that lived at the house where the man then laid at the door, it was necessary that that man should be taken care of supposing he had been in liquor and hurted himself by some means, directly hereupon the gentleman at No. 3, says, do you know any watchman that will take this man away? I said, I dare say the patrole is on his duty I will go and desire him to take him; when I came into the street the patrole was crying his round as usual; I then said, Boyle, I want you, he immediately made away to me, and crossing the street he told me, master I have shot a thief; well, says I, what did you do with him, have you taken him; no, sir, says he, he has got away; says I, I have got a man that lay in a shocking situation in Friendly-place; it is about two hundred yards from where the man discharged the piece; I then said to the patrole, there is a man laying in this court perhaps it may be the man you have shot at; do you know the man? he said, no, he should not; it was a very dark night to the best of my remembrance; then I asked him where he had shot him? he said, if I have shot him at all I have shot him in the legs I believe; says I, come up along with me and we will go and look at the man's legs; I examined the man's legs and I found the blood to drop out of the band of his breeches; then the patrole asked him if he had been shot? he said, no; that was repeated twice to the best of my remembrance, and he twice denied that he was shot; in about ten minutes we asked him again; he said, O damn that person that has led me into this error; to the best of my knowledge he then asked him if he had been shot? he immediately said, O! says he, I am shot in the back; directly when we found the man was shot, the inhabitant charged the watch with him, suspecting him to be the thief; I then applied to two of the watchmen and the watchman going past took him; he did not approve of the watchman taking him, he wanted to go in some public house; says I, my friend if you want any thing to support you I will get you something; I went into a public house going past and brought him out a drop of gin, and gave it him and he drank; then in going from that public house to the watch-house he kept still in the same mind, he did not want to go to the watch-house; we went to the watch-house; I spoke to the constable of the night and when they put him in they found the wounds where over the left shoulder; then I said</p>

               <p>to the constable of the night, it was proper the man should have a surgeon to examine his wounds, suppose he was a thief; the constable of the night immediately applied to a surgeon and examined the wound, then my lord I left the watch-house, and saw no more of him till two or three days afterwards, I went to the Hospital and he said, it was some boys that took off the bonnet, and he took it away from the boys.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he say any thing about a bayonet at his breast? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe this place where the patrole stood on guard is a place much infested with robbers? - There is scarce a week but there is some robbery committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jones attend the Grand jury? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he examined? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe this place has a good many uninhabited houses about it? - It has.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course it requires a very active patrole. This wound was not received in front it was in the back? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was discharged by the Coroner's jury? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a secret at all there abouts that the Coroner's jury had acquitted the man? - This Jones stood by the side of me when the jury brought it in that the man was accessary to his own death by running from justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones must have heard that? - He certainly must.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you subpoened to attend the Grand jury? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. This is nearly about the same spot on which Goodall and Mayo committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200083"/>the robbery. What is the character of the patrole, is he a malicious man? - I always found the man to be a very just dealing man; he was always very civil indeed; I actually do think he was fit to be trusted in his station.</p>

I was told he was very poorly, Mr. Black went to him first and spoke to him, and asked him how he did? he said, very ill, and asked what was the occasion he was shot? says he, I had been near an hour at Whitefield's Tabernacle; he said, that he had met with a young woman and she and he agreed to go together, after they had agreed to go together, she refused going with him; then says he, I snatched away her bonnet from her and ran away, and I ran such a way that I thought no watchman would meet with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cropwell are you sure that he made use of these expressions? - I am positively sure; I communicated the sentiment to the employer of him that very night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you think any body could be ignorant that the man was acquitted by the Coroner's verdict? - I should think not.</p>

               <p>I am the beadle of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch. On Sunday the 18th of November last, between the hours of nine and ten I was sent for, the watchman informed me there was a man had been shot and carried to our watch-house; accordingly I attended, when I came there there was a gentleman of the name of Wilson, he had examined the man before I came and advised him with all expedition to send him to the Hospital; accordingly I did, I sent him to St. Bartholomew's; the next morning I met the houseman and the officer taking the prisoner before the justice; he said to me, the man that was shot last night is now dead. We came near Mr. Hedge's house, and I thought proper to acquaint him with the business; the man was not dead; I went to the Hospital the Sunday following and told the sister of the ward I would be glad to see Mr. Calland; she gave me a candle to go to see him, and he told me that on the Sunday before he was coming along by the Tabernacle that he met with a woman, that he snatched the bonnet off her head and run away; that the woman called out stop thief; that he was stopped by some body; with that he said, that he had passed the patrole, and the patrole said, if he did not stop that he would fire; he said, that the patrole attempted to stop him, but he got by him; soon after that the patrole fired, and that when he shot him he did not know that he had more than stunned him, and that he ran down Friendly-place, about three hundred yards from the place where he was shot; he denied telling his name; when I first sent him to the watch-house he gave me two or three different names.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray madam did you happen to hear at all of a paper importing of a child being lost? - I never see it till I was subpoened on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what did the child do while it continued with you? - As all other children did; sometimes it played, sometimes it sat still, it was very quiet all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the child leave you? - It was from the Tuesday to the Friday following; the prisoner went away on the Friday and took the child with her; it might be about ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray did you examine the prisoner at the bar concerning the child? - I asked her if it was her child? she said, yes; I knew her to be a woman that travelled the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear to you that the child was dressed a little above the state of a blacksmith? - I did not think any thing of that; I asked her if she had brought it up? she said no; she said it had been at nurse, and it was at nurse with a coachman's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child ever tell you where it lived? - No, nor I never asked it, because I always thought it was her's, she used it so well I could not think any otherwise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would like to know how she came up on this piece of business? - I was subpoened.</p>

               <p>What do you know of this matter? - I was the person that took the child from the prisoner when she brought it home; I am a lodger in the house; the first time I saw the prisoner was on the 11th of this month, Monday; she said here is your child, and I have brought him all the way from Windsor; she knocked at the door, and I went down to the door; the mother of the child was up stairs; I knew the child, I said how could the child get as far as Windsor? she said it was brought to the Duke's Head at Windsor by a travelling woman, as travelled about the country; and he was at play there with a little boy of her's, at this public house; and she asked the child whether that was his mammy? and he said, that was not his mammy, for his mammy lived in New Street-square, No. 35, and she took him home with her little boy; and she said to her husband she would write to town the day after, to let the parents know where it was; her husband said she would have no call to write, for they were coming through town on the Monday following, to go to Maidstone fair, and they would bring the child with them, and see if they could find its parents, they should have him; if not they would take it along with them, where they were going; she said she lived at Windsor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did I say I lived at Windsor? - You did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did not; I said that I lived at Layton Town, in Warwickshire.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. Bride's; I saw the prisoner the 11th of this month, Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200087"/>night; I went to Mr. Vaughan's house where the prisoner brought the child home; I heard several questions asked the child, and where she had brought the child from; she said she brought it from Windsor; she said it was brought by a travelling woman to that house; I asked her what the reason of her taking to the child? she said she liked the child well, it was a pretty likely child; and she would wish to keep it; I told her by all means she had no right to take the child from that woman but to have left it with the person that belonged to the house; and as it was not their's they would have advertised it, and found the owner of it. Several neighbours asked several questions; Mr. Vaughan gave me charge of her, and I took her to the compter; she said that her husband was standing a the corner of the street waiting for her; we could not find him.</p>

               <p>I heard the voice of a woman enquiring for the name of Vaughan, on Monday week the 11th of this month, about nine o'clock in the evening; I live in New Street-square, No. 2; I heard her say she had found the child or left it at a public house, I cannot tell which, then I thought it was the lost child found; and I went to enquire of its friends, I had heard of Mrs. Vaughan having lost her child, on the Saturday before; when I went in the prisoner was sitting down by the fire, and the child in its mother's lap; I asked the prisoner where she found the child? she told me it was left at a public house the Duke's Head at Windsor, by a travelling woman; she said she was a poor low life drunken wretch; I asked her if she knew her? she said she knew her well; I said she must know that that child was not her's, she said she knew that well, for she knew that she never had a child in her life; I asked her how then she could tell the child that its mammy was gone; for she had told me, that she said to the child your mammy is gone, when that woman went away she said the woman told her it was just come from nurse; I then took the child on my lap and asked the child who took him away? he told me that lady, pointing to the prisoner; I asked him when the lady took him? he said the first day, he is a very intelligent child, this was all in the hearing of the prisoner; I asked him where? he said he rode in a cart, I asked him with whom? he said with that lady, pointing to the prisoner; I asked him where? he said not far; the prisoner made answer and said, that he had been in no cart with her; the prisoner said that he had rode on the coach top, from Windsor that day; the child made answer and said he rode in a cart the first day; she was silent to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it explained what the first day meant? - The child said he had left home a good many days; but that was the first day he rode in a cart, when he left home, he said they were measuring coals, where he strayed from; the child could not mention the name of the street, and he crossed the way, and that lady laid hold of his hand, and said she would take him to his mammy; she took him a little way, and then she put him into a cart, and that lady rode in the cart with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to this? - She said she had rode in no cart with the child.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she deny any other part of the story? - She said the mother had got the child, and what more did they want? she would not have brought it if she had known that there would have been that piece of work; she had taken great care of it, and washed its shirt and bought it a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Vaughan. I think you told me that all the clothes were brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200088"/>back again? - Yes, there was, only the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any buckles in the shoes? - Yes, they were brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of shoes were they? - The shoes were not very good, pretty much wore; the child came back with another pair of shoes which had been new, the heel pieces were wore off and his feet were so blistered he could hardly stand for three days afterwards; they had been bought new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came from where I lived in London, when I am in London; I was coming to the top of Holborn and there was a parcel of bullocks and cows running in the road, and the child was there and would cling on me whether I would or not, and he said, pray do take care of me and he would hang on me whether I would have him or no, and I took the child by the hand till all the bullocks were gone by, I loosed the child from my hand, and he said, he was going this way, and followed me all the way along Piccadilly, till I came to Hyde Park-corner, and the child would go into the public house along with me, and I gave the child some beer, there I asked him which way he was going? and he said, he was going this way, after I got through Hyde Park-corner, I stopped for the coach there, at the Hyde Park-corner, I got on the coach, I had not got to Knightsbridge before a man ran after me and said, I had left my child behind me, it was crying, the coachman stopped there and I got down from the coach again and I stopped there, and two men brought the child to me, and I did not know what to do with the child, and I told the people the child did not belong to me and they said it did, and I sat there with the child on the ground for a matter of an hour, I wanted to go to my journey's end, and I took the child along with me, just at the end of Knights-bridge I gave a man six-pence to ride in a coach to Brentford, the child would not tell me where it belonged to, and I got out of the coach at Brentford and I walked to Hounslow with the child in my hand, and the child's shoes were very ordinary, and I went and bought a new pair the next morning, and I asked it what its name was, and it said, Jackey Vaughan; and the next day I brought him down to that gentleman's house at Colnbrook; on the Thursday night I was putting the child to bed I asked the child where his mammy lived, he said, in New Street-square; I was coming to London on Monday and I thought I would bring the child then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know these men before? - I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it? - It was very near one; it was star light and very windy.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men disguised at all? - The man that came to me first had on a brown jacket, and the person that stood behind my back had a dark drab great coat, and the other person had a lighter great coat on, rather taller than he that had the jacket on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they robbing you? - They might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Five minutes is a long while. - The first man that came was dressed in a brown jacket, he had a round hat, they all three of them drew their cutlasses, and the man that stood behind me had a round hat on with a drab great coat, the other that stood by the side of him he had on rather a lighter drab coat, they had all round hats, the person that had the light drab coat on he had his hair tied, the other person's hair was short.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a cloudy night? - It was rather cloudy, but it was star light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed? - I was; the person that was in a brown coat put his hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. This was rather a darkish night and a late hour; was you sober? - I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see these two men? - I saw him last Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before the 11th of February? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your property found? - No, none of the property was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Their hats was never off their faces? - Their hats were never off their faces, but I saw the person's face that shaked hands with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not long shaking hands? - But when I asked the person that was in the jacket to shake hands with me, he said, no, go along or I will cut you down, make the best of your way; I observed the person's face that shaked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200090"/>hands with me; I looked him full in the face; I can swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had never seen that face before nor for a week afterwards? - I saw it the very night that he shaked hands, and I saw it the Monday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that from the mere observation you made while he was shaking hands with you enabled you to swear to his face? - I know it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in place now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in place then? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you live with? - I live with Mr. Tootelle, in Swinton-street; I have lived with him between three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard there is a reward in these cases? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London? - About seven or eight years; I lived between four or five years at Tottenham High Cross, and I lived at Southgate some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been a coachman all that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have you drove for the last three years? - I drove for Mr. Minett, he had a house in Old Broad-street; I never heard any thing of the kind of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with Blackiter concerning a reward? - I have not, I never saw him till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear him say there was forty pounds for each of them if convicted? - I never heard any thing of that kind; I have heard of rewards if any body took any body; I never heard of any reward by any conviction of any person; I have heard of a reward offered in the papers if people were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the person that brought these people here? - I was the person that told the officer in the Old City Road the circumstance that happened to me and the next morning it was put in the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you just now to tell me that you never heard of a reward? - I did not understand you at first, I have heard of a reward as far as this, that there is a reward offered for taking of people.</p>
               <p>Q. You can read? - I am not a very good scholar, I never understood any thing but it was for the taking of a person.</p>
               <p>Q. None of your property has ever been found? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You told us you did not see Blackiter till last Monday? - The last Monday of all.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not misunderstand me that it was the last Monday? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when were these men examined before the magistrate? - On Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You was no time in company with Blackiter at all? - When I went to Worship-street, I drove my master to Finsbury-square, and I left the coach and horses in Finsbury-square while I went to the office to see these people.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the people were taken up? - There was one of the officers came to Swinton-street, to let me know in the morning; they told me they had taken up some men and they wished me to go and look at them, and when I went on Monday morning I left the coach and horses in Finsbury-square, and I looked at the men, I saw them both; I saw them at the public house adjoining the justice's office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you then? - The officer was walking about the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in this public house in the company of the officer? - I was there to the best of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200091"/>knowledge ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were taken up for examination that day? - They were, but I could not stop, I was afraid something would happen to my coach and horses, they were waiting in Finsbury square; they were taken on suspicion of robbing me; and when I saw them, I knew them to be the same persons that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew before you went before the magistrate; you had seen these men, and were told they were taken up on your account? - They were taken up on suspicion of robbing another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Blackiter shewed you a coat, did not he? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Which he told you belonged to Hicks? - He did not tell me who it belonged to, when he shewed it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he shew it to you? - He only shewed it to me once, he brought the coat into the tap room, and he said, do you know any thing of this coat.</p>
               <p>Q. This was Mr. Blackiter's private examination before you went before the justice to be examined? - Blackiter brought the coat to me, and asked me if I know any thing about it, I said that is the lightest coloured coat, I would not go to say any thing that was wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things did Blackiter point out to you, before you went to the justice at this private rehearsal on Monday? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other of these persons, officers as you call them, was you sitting in company with at the public house? - I was not in company with any of them, I was walking about the room, first in one room and then in another.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord you never heard of a reward; you lived at South-gate some time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not far from Finchley Common, and Finchley Common is a very common place for robberies? - It may be so for what I know, I don't recollect any just now.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positive as to Hicks? - I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you always positive? - I was positive since he shaked hands with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said that you was positive as to Hicks? - Yes, always.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you positive before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear positive? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was examined before the justice, they took down your very words and you signed your examination; you swear that you verily believe according to the examination? what makes you more positive than you was a week ago? - The more I see that man's face the more it strikes me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there was a hat on his forehead? - I looked him full in the face when he shaked hands with me.</p>

             had been robbed; I went to a house in St. Luke's, the Golden Hind, in Allen-street, in Goswell-street; it is a house where very few people resort but thieves; I went there and I saw the two prisoners there;

             said he was robbed by three men; there were two men in dark coloured coats, one a little taller than the other, and one with a sailor's jacket on; but the one with the sailor's jacket on was not there; he gave me no other description than that, I knew the persons before; I took Hall to New Prison, Hicks called himself the landlord of the house, and I was in doubt about it till I went out; coming back from the prison I went and took Hicks. On Monday morning they came up for examination<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200092"/>before the magistrate, the servant that was robbed came to Worship-street, and he did not stay five minutes, I lost him; I did not know where he was gone to; the magistrate sent for him to come up the next day at eleven o'clock, and he came, he said before the magistrate that he had his doubts about Hall being the man; he believed that Hicks was the man that shaked hands with him.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to slip out that word believe? - I did not hear him say believe; he said of Hicks that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sware positively to Hicks? - He swore that was the man that shaked hands with him; he declared that he had his doubts about Hall, because he stood behind the sailor. While they were at the office the justice ordered us to go and search the house, to see if we could find any goods, any thing of the robbery; Armstrong, Harper, Ray and I went and searched the house, we found these two slicks, and facing the door of the cellar in the yard, I found these three cutlashes, with about a wheel-barrow full of stuff over them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the house? - Mrs. Lucas, she is a widow woman; her husband is in trouble for debt; this house is a common resort for thieves, and finding a man there in dark coloured clothes I took him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not pretend to have the least doubt in the world before the magistrate about Hicks? - No, not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the examination read to him? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been in this way of business a long time, how many years? - About ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got to the New Police office now; is it your practice before persons go before the magistrate to produce every thing to them, and examine them? - Not in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of course you produced nothing to this man, to ask his opinion about it? - I never saw the prosecutor till he came before the magistrate; I never saw till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first of all to say that you did not see him till he came before the magistrate? - I mean that he was at the office door, and the magistrate was not come then, and he went away again, and he was remanded on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Blackiter be a little correct, because you know what evidence is; how came you to say that you did not see him before he came before the magistrate? - I did see him, but I said so because he did not see the magistrate at all on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will try a little more of you. You say then you never produced property before a person, till he appears before the justice? - No sir, I never examine before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you in this instance? - I never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an answer to my question? then you never produced any thing before him for his opinion before the Tuesday that he was before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he has sworn that you did, he has lied most abominably. - I never saw him on Monday, only he came into the public house and went out again, he told what he had lost then, and that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this man had no knowledge whatever of any reward? - I never told him there was a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any man more likely to know of a reward than a coachman driving on the road? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that there is a reward of 80 l. if these two men are convicted? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200093"/>Q. How long have you been in your situation, as a person apprehending people that committed robberies? - Ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first of all to say that the man said he believed? - Upon my word I should be very sorry to say any thing that was not truth.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know that in relating the difference between the man's believing and being positive, stands all the chance of receiving the 40 l. or not? I will have an answer. Do not you know that if the man only swears that he believes, you are not so likely to receive the reward, as if he swore positively? don't that make all the difference of the chance? - As for the reward, I would not wish to take any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give me an answer? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it comes from you like a drop of blood? - The man said every time he looked on Hicks, he knew him more and more.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any conversation with the prosecutor on Monday? - I asked him if he had been robbed on Monday? and he said yes, but I did not even ask the prosecutor what he lost on Monday; it was not the prosecutor that gave the information.</p>

            , I am the responsible person, and Mr. Houghton lives with me; our sleeping place was in these chambers On Friday the 18th of January we left them about six o'clock, I saw the doors fastened, I did not absolutely lock it myself, but I felt, and it was fastened, I left them perfectly secure; I believe, as near as I can guess, about five minutes past six, we had light candles, we light candles about half after four when we dined, it was dark then out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that the robbery had been committed? - About half after seven, we received intelligence of the laundress; in consequence of which information, we immediately both of us went to the chambers with the laundress, we found them in a very great state of confusion and disorder, there were two trunks drawn out of the bed room into the sitting room, with the locks absolutely forced up from the bottom, we had left them, one in the passage just by the outer door and the other was in the bed room; the locks were forced underneath and wrenched off, and the lock itself was torn from the wood, and left on one side of the trunk; my trunk was nearly emptied of every thing, but some letters, and some papers, that trunk was left in the passage, I lost all the things mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200095"/>in the indictment; I attended at Bow-street afterwards, I saw Stone in custody on Friday the 4th of February, all he said before the magistrate was taken in writing. The lock of the outer door was found in a perfect state, there was the mark of some instrument at the dressing room window, as if it had been forced up; the window looks into the garden in Clement's Inn, it is the ground floor, the mark was on the outside of the window, but whether it was done at that time or before I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You went out about six, who was with you? - A gentleman, a stranger was with me and Mr. Houghton, we all went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you observed that the door was fastened, how do you mean? - I said to the gentleman, Gardiner, will you lock the door, he did, and I put my finger into the key hole to see if it was fast, and it was.</p>
               <p>Q.As to this mark in the window was the sash fastened down with any thing? - It is commonly fastened with a bolt, but whether it was bolted then or not I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other gentleman a key? - No, we both had one, and the laundress had one.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say what the value of the articles were? - According to the value I have laid them in the indictment, they are six pounds, and they are laid very much under their real value.</p>

               <p>I am laundress to the last gentlemen, that stood up here, I went to the chambers about a quarter after seven in the evening; I opened the door, and I found two mould candles burning, and there were two trunks broke open, and the locks were wrenched with great violence; I went into the dining room or sitting room, and said gentlemen are you in? after that I went into the bed room, and I found the candle burning there, and there was a pair of leather breeches very near, and if I had not gone as soon as I did the breeches would have been on fire by the light of the candle; I went out of the bed room to the gentlemen, to the office in Carey-street, No. 3, I called the gentlemen out and they came with me; it is Mr. Miller's office, the gentlemen were there both of them, we came to the chambers and found they were robbed, they took Mr. Gardiner with them to the chambers, and I went with them; I found then that the things were gone, and the dressing room window about that high up.</p>
               <p>Mr Peat. The dressing room window you found it up? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did there appear to be any marks of violence about that window? - I did not look then, nor since; there was a tea cup at the side of the window, and a pair of trowsers and a brush, and the tea cup was thrown down to the floor and it was not broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there was the marks of any feet, or any thing of that kind, what sort of ground is that that is underneath it? - It is a flag pavement, not soft ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Had you been in the chambers before that day? - I left the chambers about half after five o'clock the window was down then when I left it.</p>
               <p>Court. When you left it at half after five, and when you returned afterwards did you find the trunks in the same place or were they all changed? - They were all taken out of their place.</p>

             the man at the bar; the 31st of January, Thursday; he asked a price for them, and I asked him whose they were; he said he had the mould of them at home; he said he bought the pistols and the key, he did not say any thing more; I know the man perfectly well, I do not recollect ever seeing him before.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen him before? - I know him by his face, he is the man that pledged the pistols; he called again the 11th of February, he was then in custody, before that I saw an advertisment from Bow-street, the 2d of February I saw an advertisement describing these pistols; I took them to Bow-street, and took them to this gentleman's lodgings, and shewed them him; on Monday the 4th of February, he came with the ticket to redeem them, he laid the ticket down on the counter, and I immediately sent for the constable, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You took in the pistols you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen this prisoner Stone before? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him after that till he came to redeem them? - No, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. These tickets go into the hands of many persons, any person may come for the things that have the ticket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have little partitions and apartments in your shop, where people stand behind the shutters? - He did not happen to be in one of these; he was in the open part of the shop at day light.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that those pistols have been in your custody; I presume they were laid by in the shop? - No more than being in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Every body had access to them as well as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It sometimes happens that tickets are mislaid and affixed to other goods than those they belong to? - That is impossible, the ticket is on them, and he came for them; I can swear they are the pistols that was pawned; I never saw a pair like them in my life; I have seen a thousand pairs.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. In what name did he pawn them in? -

               <p>Q. What was your reason for hesitation? - I felt and found my handkerchief gone; my reason was, I was going to attend a funeral of my father at the same time. His was the side of the way opposite the church; when I got back some person was got at the other side of the way in the charge of an officer; I was directed across to him and went with them to the Rotation office near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200098"/>that spot a silk handkerchief was there produced of the same kind I lost, it was in the hand of an officer, his name is Callow I believe, it had not any private mark by which I could swear to it, the magistrate thought the evidence sufficiently strong to commit the prisoner, and bound me over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how long you had your handkerchief before this alarm was given? - I had it about my neck on my journey, at the inn, I took it off and put it in my pocket, the Queen's Head inn in the Borough, a considerable way from this place.</p>

               <p>I am an officer. The 4th of February, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner was brought home to my house in Whitechapel by a gentleman in court, Mr. Muston; and the prosecutor was sent for and brought into my house likewise.</p>
               <p>Court to Nott. I understood you was called over the way; did you go into the house? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Callow. I asked him if that handkerchief was his? he said, yes; the gentleman brought in the prisoner and the handkerchief, the prosecutor said, it was his; I took the prisoner before the magistrate directly; Mr. Nott at first declined to go, he wanted to go and bury his father, but he did go and the prisoner was committed, and the magistrate made him put the two first letters of his name on the corner of the handkerchief; the prisoner begged to go for an East India soldier, or any where the magistrate would send him. He was an old offender.</p>

               <p>I was standing against my own door, No. 37, Whitechapel, and I saw Mr. Nott and the prisoner were going past the door, the prisoner had his hand in the gentleman's pocket; Mr. Nott was going first, and the prisoner, I saw, had his hand in Mr. Nott's pocket more than four or five times, and I followed him whilst I saw him take the property from Mr. Nott, I saw him take a silk handkerchief out of his pocket of his right hand side, and after I saw him take it out, the gentleman was passing on, and I got another man, who saw him as well as myself, to run after Mr. Nott to give him information, and I went after the prisoner, the prisoner was going down Great Garden-street, about twenty or thirty yards from where he took the handkerchief, he had turned down the street; just as I came up he was pulling the handkerchief out of his breast of his coat and waistcoat to look at what property he had got.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at the time he took the handkerchief away where he put it? - I saw him putting it there; and when I went up to him he was looking at the property, and I laid hold of his arm and told him he must go along with me; he then resigned the property to me, and I took him to Mr. Callow the officer's, and from there we went to the magistrate; I have no doubt at all but the prisoner, I apprehended, was the person that I saw take the handkerchief from Mr. Nott's pocket; I saw him trying at his pocket more than five or six times, and curiosity led me to see what would be the end of it.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief produced and deposed to by Mr. Nott, as the same handkerchief that was produced at the office, and exactly the same as the one he lost.)</p>

In your deposition you say you did not clearly recollect; that gives me some suspicion that you had some recollection; I desire you therefore to refresh your recollection and tell me on your oath whether you can tell me that you recollect or not? - I don't recollect on my oath; I knew nothing of the prisoner at all, or else I should be very happy to speak to her.</p>

               <p>Q. How many might they pawn in all from the first to the last? - I cannot tell; they did not use the house long; I asked them the reason why the mother did not come? the answer was the mother was ill and could not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Rolfe there is only another question, which is, that these people living in the neighbourhood, and all these things being brought by these children, why you did not take the trouble to go down to the parents house to see whether all they said was true? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you the other question, why? - The reason was because I asked them why the mother did not come? they said, the mother was ill and could not come.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in the course of pledging property? - It might be two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were pledging things at different times for near two months and yet you would not step to a neighbour to enquire about this circumstance? - I did not step to be sure.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Griffiths. Was you at home on the 24th of December? - I left home on the 29th of November, and did not return till the 15th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar living in your house on the 24th of December? - She was; I left her in charge of my family during my absence.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you at all mention this counterpane or had any conversation about the counterpane with the prisoner? - I never spoke to her about that article, for that article was left in a chest, and I left the key at home, that was one of the keys that were lost; when I left home that counterpane was in that chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you just before you left your house see this counterpane? - I did; I had some papers that was in the trunk, and before I left home I went to the trunk and put them together, and this counterpane was there then, and when I examined the chest when I returned it was gone; I also lost a paper which entitles me to will 50 l. to whom I please, from a benefit society.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Griffiths went out of town he left me in charge of the children; with that my husband left money to pay a bill that was owing, I imprudently lent the money; I asked the children for something to make up the money; they gave me leave; I did nothing without the childrens consent, and if Mr. Griffiths had given me a few days longer I should have replaced every thing; I have had the money since and that the children know; I beg you would examine them; the eldest took all the things out of the chest and gave them to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say to the loss of this inventory of furniture? - I could wish to have it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say? tell your story? - They had no right to steal it.</p>
               <p>Q. Give what evidence you have of the fact of stealing of it? - They took them away by night in a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it you lost your furniture, or any part of it? - I forgot the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it? how long ago? - I really forget how long it is ago, a month or six weeks; Mr. Hitchins came with a cart and took all the property away; I was ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Hitchins came with a cart? - I was informed so afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners? - They were in my room and took my bed and all the furniture out of the room early in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200103"/>Q. Who came into the room? - The beadle, the constable and Mr. Hitchins whilst I was in bed, they forced the door of my room, they said, they came to take my goods out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they tell you they took your goods for? - To go into the cart to the broker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you why? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them why? - I did; they said, they were going to sell them; they said, it was their property.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they become their property? - Not by my orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them how they became their property? - I cannot recollect I did; I know they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what their claim was? - I do not; I had no notion what foundation there was for any pretence or claim of theirs to the property of the goods, they had no right to them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Hitchins? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What was Hitchins? - He is an hair dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live at this time? - In the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived in this house? - Several years, ten or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this forcing of your door by the beadle, constable and Hitchins, you had no notion of any claim set up by Hitchins to these goods you call your's? - No, I never had; they had no right to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Well now what did they do after having come for these goods? - The things where all moved out, soon afterwards they obliged me to get up and took the bed and every thing, they took down the bedstead and furniture, they moved them all away in a cart; I saw them go out, I was up in my room and saw them take them down stairs; they took all the things at one time; the cart came but once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing more than the bedstead and furniture? - They took the sheets, blankets and every thing, they carried away all the articles mentioned in the indictment and many more besides, furniture, china and articles of that description.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch taken from? - From me.</p>
               <p>Q. From your person? - Out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they took the watch? - I think it was taken out of the parlour; Mr. Hitchins had it from me and I never had it back again, some months back; I don't rightly recollect when; it was not at this time, but all the other articles were carried away at that time by Hitchins, some went before in trunks and boxes before the cart came.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this other part go? - Some days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came then? - Nobody particularly came then; Mr. Hitchins took them away himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take away? - A table cloth, and towels, and china and glass</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He claimed them as his property, but I knew they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Under what pretence did he claim them? - I don't rightly know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never told you how he claimed them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this having happened some days before and you knowing he had no claim or pretence of claim, how came you to take no steps against him relating to these things? - I did as far as I could; I kept myself locked in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to a magistrate on that subject? - I had no thought to go.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200104"/>Q. How came you to have no thoughts of it if he had taken them without the least colour of a claim? - Some days before they came and swept the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to submit to that? I was very ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. No thought of going to a magistrate? Hitchins continued to live in the house? - Not full and wholly, he was away some times several nights.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue in the house after he took these things first? - He did; he came there and had lodging, he sleeped there now and then, when he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use endeavours to prevent all this? it took up a great deal of time I suppose loading the cart with this furniture of every description? - They had a constable with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you indict the constable? had you no idea why the constable and beadle came? - They were in the house the best part of the night, but I did not know that till the morning, they were partly packed up in the evening, so that the noise was not so much heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that evening what they were about? - Why I thought that they were going to move the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know what they came for the evening before? - I did not, I had some suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in the house besides you? - No lodgers but them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago might this be? - About six weeks or better, they were there in the evening and they were packing up the things all night.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you into Potts's room? - I went in there to make the beds at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mistress accuse you? - My mistress never turned me away, I gave my mistress a week's warning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never applied to your master Mr. Curtis for money? - I applied for him to get me into the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever send to your master for money? - I never sent to him for a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been out of place? - A long while,</p>
               <p>Q. How have you maintained yourself? - I have sold my things.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never received money from gentlemen? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master came in and never said a word to you good, bad or indifferent, never called you my dear; never courted you at all? - Never said a word, but immediately threw me down on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q.You had never known any thing of this sort before? - Never before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Which part of the bed did you fall against? - It was the side of the bed near the feet and my head towards the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. When he threw you on the bed I suppose that you suspected his intention? - I did, and shrieked out.</p>
               <p>Q You never shrieked out more than once? - He put the sheet into my mouth, immediately crammed it in; the sheet was in my mouth all the time of the business, he was holding it down with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q Then he had only one hand at liberty, for one hand was constantly employed in keeping down the sheet in your mouth; that was so? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q How was your two hands employed against his one? - My two hands were behind me.</p>
               <p>Q Pray, who was it put your hands in that shape? - Seeing him bar the door I was frightened and I held my hands so.</p>
               <p>Q You suspected when you saw him bar the door? - I did not know what he was going to do, I thought he was going to kill me or something, I cried out and he immediately chucked me on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he shoved you on the bed the moment that he barred the door; how far is the bed from the door? - It is close.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had time to make one cry and no more; how came your hands to fall behind you? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. That was rather odd, was not it did you ever in your life when you fell having your hands close by your side had your hands behind you before, how could they be twisted backwards by that fall? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they remained behind all the time? - I could not get them away, I made all the resistance I could; I could not get my hands away</p>
               <p>Q. They then remained pinioned like a fowl? - Exactly so, he prevented me, he lay on me.</p>
               <p>Q The man is not two or three ton weight? - I made all the resistance I perfectly could.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200109"/>Q. How could he laying on you prevent your drawing one hand from under you? - I made all the resistance I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you really could not get one hand from under your back, that man is not a very fat man? - The moment I saw him bar the door the moment my strength failed me directly, I being in a strange place what did I suppose that that man was going to do.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you slap his face? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull his hair? - I could not get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you kick him at all? - I kicked him all that lay in my power.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you almost overturned him by your kicking? - I don't know, I cannot say but what I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Here he lays on you and you kicking about, it is natural you should almost overturn him? - I did all that was in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you kick his shins or did you not kick at all? - I did all that lay in my power to get away, I tried to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you try to get up; the moment that you fell down he threw himself on you; where was your petticoats? - He pulled up my petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pulled up before you was on the bed or after? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he manage with his other hand? - And then he laid his knee on me and in that situation he lay on me, he kept my petticoats high up with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. And in that situation he did it? - No, he did not do it so.</p>
               <p>Q What did he do with his knee? - After he pulled up my petticoats he laid his knee on me to keep them up while he pulled down his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q.He continued his knee there then? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q What kept your coats up? - He took his knee up when he unbuttoned his breeches; he was on the bed and my coats kept up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they keep up of their own accord or did you keep them up? - He kept them up to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how did he keep them up, he had not three hands, had he? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, let us dispose of the two; how did he keep them up? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How high were your clothes? - My clothes were quite up to my chin.</p>
               <p>Q. And you struggled and kicked about a good deal, did not you? - All that lay in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Still they kept up to your chin; you was quite a maid at this time? - I never knew a man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how he managed to bring his private parts to your's, can you account how he did that? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cross your legs? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not occur to you that that would be a good way to stop him; did you keep your legs a little wider than usual? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that you did not? - I don't know that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought keeping the legs close would be the best way to prevent him; do you know how he managed to introduce his private parts? where was the hand that was at liberty? one hand was at the sheet at your mouth, where was the other hand? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell me how he managed to introduce his private parts to you, because you know you was a maid? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor where his hand was? was it employed to prevent your struggling? - He laid on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Really my girl in the way you describe it I cannot see how such a thing could be effected? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200110"/>Q. You did not feel where the other hand was, you never felt how he employed the other hand? - No.</p>
               <p>Q Never felt it about your person at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how was it employed? - He took his other to put his private parts into mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my girl, how came you to tell me a minute ago that you did not know how it was employed, because I put it to you several times? - Because I was ashamed.</p>
               <p>Q. When one hand was on your mouth and the other hand was so employed a very little struggle would have put him off; how came it you did not get rid of him when both hands were engaged? - I did all in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue this hand to his private parts all the time that he did this to you? - No, not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he employ it afterwards? - I cannot tell you, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell nobody of this affair? - I had no friends nor any thing in London, or else I would have told them.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept with Hannah? - But she told such stories about, that I did not like to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the stories? - I did not like Hannah.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain to her of your parts being sore? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In short they were not sore? - Yes, very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them to any body? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do to alleviate this pain? - I did not do any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress's sister was there too I believe? - She was, she is ill I believe now.</p>

               <p>I am a silk weaver; I never saw the girl only bringing beer to my house from Mr. Curtis, he lives next door; she left her place and she brought her box, and she asked my wife to wash her some linen and she washed it for her; this was within a week or a fortnight after she left her place, I cannot say nearer; she told my wife she was going to live at No. 88, Houndsditch; she was a stranger to me only coming there; she fetched her things away and paid my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200111"/>wife for washing them, and after that she came backward and forward with some young children that belonged to the master she lived with; and in the month of June, my daughter about fourteen years of age, one night said, she was sleeping in the necessary; I was in bed and the girl came to the bed side and told me of it; I said to my wife, let Sally sleep here to night; by my permission she came and slept with my children; the next morning I said to her, I wonder you do not keep your place, it is a pity you do not keep your place, to throw yourself into the street at night; she gave no reasons at all; my wife recommended her to Mr. Dobson's, she went and stayed there a little while, a very short time, there were words arose between her and the fellow servant about a pair of cotton stockings and she came away; then she went and lived at a cook's shop, in Holborn, as she told me; then she came back again and came to my house again and slept there; on being there a little while, I perceived she walked lame, and my wife used to tell me she washed herself with fuller's earth, and said, she was chafed; I said to her, if you have any thing a matter with you I will go with you to a surgeon, I went with her to a surgeon and the surgeon examined her, and he said, he thought there was nothing a matter without her blood was bad, and then she came back again and she became very bad indeed, got worse and worse; I asked her several times if she was ever acquainted with her master; I meant joking among ourselves; it was said, that Mr. Curtis was rather fond of a woman; it was not done out of any ill design to Mr. Curtis; she said, that her master never offered any thing to her, that he never behaved any way ill to her, in a while after she came to me while I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean on the same day? - I cannot say whether it was two or three weeks or a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me when she first mentioned this about her master? - It might be about the month of July or thereabouts; about a month after this she came up to my loom side, and she said, my master Curtis, gave me the bad distemper; I asked her how she knew that he gave her the bad distemper, and she told me that he was obliged to take the plaisters off before he could meddle with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did she pretend that he had meddled with her? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from this language that he had meddled with her more than once? - I should imagine by that that she did; I said to her when she told me that, did your master promise you any thing? she said, that he promised to take care of her. Then I asked her, pray did you ever tell your master that he gave you this distemper? she said no. I asked her two or three times over, she said no, she never told him. Pray, did you ever tell your mistress of it? no she said, she asked me to ask her master to get her into the hospital to get cured; I told her no, I could not think of doing of any such thing, for the time was so long I could not think of troubling my head about the matter, and if she had any thing to say to her master they must decide it themselves; that is all I know concerning that. She told me that she had a sister at the other end of the town.</p>
               <p>Court. Just now she swore that she did not tell this to any body, because she had not a friend in town.</p>

Mr. Dimsdale immediately turned again, I had been obliged to go rather before him on account of the narrowness of the passage, and clasped his hands round me to guard my pocket and claps hold of an arm that he judged to be mine; he called out to know what I had lost, as did several others; I told him I believed a watch; I immediately looked and found I had lost my watch, I saw my watch again in the same passage, in the hands of Mr. King, he said, he took it on the prisoner; it was while the crowd was all thick about us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mrs. Litchfield, this passage was a good deal crowded? - It was, there was a good many people coming from a chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark at this time between seven and eight? - It was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any lamps at the place? - The lamps were near enough for me to distinguish the silk by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe it was under a wall? - It was at a sort of turning.</p>

             a native of the town of Birmingham, being in London on the 25th of January, was passing Monkwell-street, having hold of my arm; just as we came to the passage it was narrow, we went off the foot path into the highway and she went before me because there was a great many people; there was a man and woman that seemed to jostle her about, I immediately said, what the duce are you at? she said, somebody had got their hand into her pocket, was picking her pocket; I immediately went to clasp my friend round to lay hold of her arm, and I immediately took the prisoner by the bare arm thinking I had hold of my friend's arm; in the mean time came up Mr. Byfeild, the clerk of the Chamberlain's-office, and said, what is the matter? I said, here is a person that has picked my friend's pocket, and Mr. King, of the Castle and Falcon, picked up the watch from the ground; then directly Mr. Byfeild and Mr. King produced this watch; I kept the woman's hand in my hand all the time, and we proceeded then to the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this woman one of the persons that was jostling your friend? - So far as this, I got hold of her arm; there was a great crowd there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that woman take any active part in jostling of her for the purpose? - She did, she and the man that was beside of her, they appeared to me to be jostling of her more than the other people which were in the crowd; when we came to the Castle and Falcon, Mr. King sent for the constable of the night.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a considerable crowd? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was moving up the place, she was coming down? - I was close by the side of her almost.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said the pocket dropped? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think might be in the passage? - Some thirty or forty before and behind</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that somebody's hand was in her pocket, because she has told us a very different story? - She did not know at first it was so.</p>

            , a bye man came down. My partner's name was Welch, me, and Welch, and May, went down, we went and searched all the house over, and found nobody at all in it; we came out again, and thought we would acquaint the inhabitants to be cautious, because there were thieves about; all we came out, and the prisoner Hoyland came to the fore door in the inside, and cried thieves; the fore door was shut, and the padlock outside, he said, there was thieves in the house, we shall all be murdered: We then went down again into the cellar, the same way as we came up, and when we came into the passage, I found young Hoyland in the passage of the tap-room, he says to me, my brother is in the yard, I looked round in the yard, and I could see nobody at all, and then Lee brought a ladder, and Lee got over, and he turned Tisdell over, and we took them out, and we took them two to the watch-house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200117"/>I never saw Thomas till I came to the watch-house; when I got into the house, I saw a piece of lead lay on the table of the tap room; the lead is here, I looked at it, there is no appearance of its being cut; there was the print of the lead where they brought it down stairs from the top of the house, where they rested it, it is above half an hundred weight; the next morning we went to the place, and it appeared to be taken from the top of the house; I did not see any left at that part, it was part of a gutter, the whole of the gutter was gone; when I went into the cellar the next morning, I found another piece with a pipe to it.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, I was on watch this 21st of January;

             the watchman in Brooke's Market turned his rattle for assistance, I went to see what was the matter, he said, there was an alarm of some thieves, he supposed they were in the Jolly Butchers public house, in Brooke's Market, I went with him to see what was the matter, there was a cellar broke open by somebody; not the cellar belonging to the Three Jolly Butchers.</p>
               <p>Davis. I have a cellar under another house, which has no communication with the house, it is under, but goes directly into that public-house.</p>
               <p>Lee. Welch, May, and Ward, forced up the flap belonging to the Jolly Butchers, and went down that way, while they were down there Fincher, another watchman and I stood above, we stayed above to watch this cellar window, while they were down there, it appeared to me, that this here cellar, that is broke open belonged to the green-stall: I told Fincher to stop there a bit, and I would go down this place to see how the cellars were; accordingly I got down the cellar that was broke open, and went down into the cellar, when I went down, I found it had no connection with the green stall, but was an arched cellar, which came into the street, I then went from that into another arch, and from that to another; there were three arches; and then I got to the cellar which belongs to the Jolly Butchers, then I went up the cellar stairs, and I went into the tap room, and in the tap room I saw one of these pieces of lead rolled up, and laying on the table, I did not look any further then into the house, but went down the cellar stairs again, and got out into the street, and I told Fincher, the other watchman, how the cellars were, that they were connected all in one; Fincher said, he would go and stand at the corner, in case if there was any body they would come out backward there from the other houses; I took my lanthorn, and set it down by the cellar that was broke open, and I went and stood by this flap of the cellar of the Jolly Butchers, they were about five or six yards apart; while I was there I saw Davy Thomas, the prisoner, come out of that cellar, its him that stands in the middle, he goes by the name of Davy, I have known him many years, he came out of that cellar that was broke open, I seeing the man come out, I made up to him as fast as I could, just as he was rising from the cellar, I caught hold of him, I said, Davy, I believe I have got you, with a sudden jerk he snatched himself out of my hand, and ran up the market; he out ran me, Fincher and May, was very handy to him, I told them to run after him, and I went back to the cellar, I had been at the cellar about two minutes, and May brought him back to me, and I said take him to the watch-house, he is the man that came out of the cellar, and they took him to the watch-house, I stood at the cellar for a great while, I suppose for an hour, until such time as I heard Ward say, Lee come down, we have got one here, I went down directly as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200118"/>called me, with a ladder, which we borrowed at the green stall, and went up the cellar stairs, as soon as I got up on the top of the cellar in the passage, I saw Ward had hold of Hoyland, the prisoner, Ward said, go into the yard, I heard an alarm in the yard, I took the ladder with me, the yard is surrounded with houses, and there is a partition at one corner partitioned off, this partition is about six or seven feet high; the inhabitants were looking out of their windows, some of them said, that they saw a man get out of the Jolly Butchers, back door, and get over that partition, and they said, it was impossible for him to go through that way, and as they had not seen him come back, that he must be there now; accordingly I got over, and I found that in the yard there was a little fowl house built, and I looked about in the yard, and up in the corner, between that and the partition, I saw the prisoner,

            , he was not down nor properly up, but like down on one hand and knee, I asked him what business he had there, he did not give me any answer, I desired him to get over the partition back again, the other watchmen came up and they took him.</p>

               <p>I was one of the watchmen, I went into the house along with Ward and Welch, I went all over the house, and out upon the house, we could find nobody; Ward and I came back, and I put my lanthorn on the parapet gutter and stood still; I went and searched for them, and could not find them, on that we all came out of the house again; I went down into Leather-lane, and Lee called out there is one got out, and he told me Fincher was gone after him, I ran after Fincher, he saw him run up a pair of stairs, called the Hole in the Wall passage, I ran up these pair of stairs, and catched him at top in the passage, it is a pair of stairs belonging to a house, it has no under floor nor street door at all, I asked him what he did there? he said, it was his lodging, I laid hold of him, and told him I would help him to a better lodging, I took him back to Lee, and he said, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Court to Lee. How long had you known Thomas? - I have known him about six years, he is a butcher I believe, his mother lived a neighbour to me some years, I don't know a he served his time to any thing; I saw him every night at Gray's Inn-lane, at a house of slight character among bad people.</p>
               <p>Court to May. Did you see this lead sitted? - I did, both the pieces, they were sitted to the back part of the house over the garret window, in what they call a fillet gutter, one piece fitted very well.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I employed two men on Thursday the 24th, to fit this lead, I saw them fit one part, that has the pipe to it, a very remarkable piece of lead, and it appeared to fit; but, my Lord, I have to observe, that the two plumbers that I employed, they cut off these two little pieces of lead from the others, and threw them down; one plumber was endeavouring to fit the lead on the outside of the house, and the other was inside of the house in the garret; I walked from one side of the house to the other, presently came down one of these rolls of lead, as if it had been rolled up, in a very little time while the watchman was present came another; I don't know whether it is fair to mention it, there was some little bribe.</p>
               <p>- KING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter, I was there when the lead was fitted in the gutter, and it all fitted exactly, I don't know the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the lead that you fitted there? - The watchman had it of Lee; I got it from the office, Hatton-garden, and the two plumbers had it of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200119"/>Ward. The lead that we found in the house, me and May carried to the office; it was never carried to Mr. Davis's.</p>
               <p>Lee. I locked it up in my house, and it was carried afterwards to be fitted, I went with them and took it to the house.</p>
               <p>King. I saw it fitted, and helped the man to fit it; it fitted exactly, these pieces that were pulled off, they all came certainly from that place.</p>

I missed them the 12th of January, and I found them myself in a dust cart the same day between two and three in the afternoon; the prisoner was employed by me to take the dust out of the cellar, he was the driver of the cart, they were covered over with dust; these men had fetched my dust away for four or five months, the man came this day to take the dust, and the boy told the maid to tell me that he had got a pot; I took them out of the cart and put them in the bar, and marked them separate at the time; in consequence of the information I also went down into the cellar, the moment I was down the cellar stairs the man that was employed by this man takes the pot out of the basket, and runs and put it down in the yard by the side of the cellar.</p>

               <p>I am a looking glass grinder; I was going past Mr. Chapple's door between one and two o'clock, on the 12th of January, I asked what was the matter, and they said the dustman had been thieving some pots, Mr. Chapple said that the prisoner was in the cellar; and Mr. Chapple was contesting with him to get into the tap room, persuading him to go up stairs, he had been taking a pot out of his basket, and he drove him up stairs before him; when he came up stairs the publican said perhaps he had got some in his cart already, so he jumped into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200120"/>cart and he takes the broomstick and he stirs about a pot which he gave into my hand, he found a quart pot in the dust, and a pint pot, and he was for sending for a constable to give charge of him; and this prisoner tried to make his escape down Long-alley, the landlord pursued him, and brought him back into the tap room, and he said he should not stir from there till such times as he had given charge of him; the constable came, and he charged him with him, and he was afterwards committed.</p>
               <p>Court to Chapple. Did you see the pot taken out of the basket in the cellar? - Yes, this man the prisoner was filling in and the other man stood by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the cellar before you went into the cart or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the basket? - It stood at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose basket was it? - It stood at the bottom of the stairs. This man's partner, took this quart pot, out of the basket; I saw him do it, and ran into the back yard, and put it down on the pavement; that basket belonged to him; the basket was not in either of their hands, it was on the ground standing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep these pots in the cellar? - There were six dozen in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court to Chapple. Have you kept these pots from that time to this? - They have never been used, they have been tied together ever since; there is my name, and the name of the place, and the sign on them all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to take this gentleman's rubbish away, and there was another man with me, and he filled the basket while I was at the cart; and what he put in I don't know, for I never saw any thing of the kind, nor never touched any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Court to Morby. Was it this pot the pot in the basket, or was it the other? - It was this.</p>
               <p>Court to Chapple. Were these the servants of the dustman? - They were, and I went to the master afterwards and he gave them a very good character.</p>

               <p>I keep an herb shop in Covent-garden Market; I saw the prisoner at my shop, on the morning of the 2d of February, about half after six on Saturday morning; he came to my shop before I saw him, I was in bed, and my man called me up, and I saw a bag of mazarian roots in the shop, the prisoner had them to sell, I asked him what he asked for them, he said, he asked one shilling a pound, I told him I should detain him, and the roots, in consequence of information of some nursery grounds being robbed; I asked him where he got them? he said, he got them from a man at Paddington;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200127"/>I then sent for a constable, and he was taken to Bow-street; the roots were then produced, and Mr. Kirk then brought the tops after some little time, and a great many of them were matched with the roots. (The roots produced, compared, and several of them exactly matched with the tops where they were cut, found in the prosecutor's gardens, and the other gardens, which had no Mazarions growing in it, it being a market garden.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a wall between our garden, and the market garden of eight feet and there was the marks of feet on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trace no foot steps in your garden ground, where the tops of the Mazarions were found? - I could, and marks where they jumped down from the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trace any on the opposite side? - I did not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, how many did you lose? - I cannot be positive, there might be seventy, but I can swear to fifty, they were worth about one shilling a plant.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel to Blackwell. What do you consider the value of these things to be? - The price of the plants is one shilling a piece, but we give one shilling a pound for the roots.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackwell. What time did you see the prisoner that morning? - At half past six o'clock, we had lights burning there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Kirk. What marks have you got that you can swear to the roots against any other roots.</p>
               <p>Court. The marks are these, he does not say, that there are any particular marks on the roots, except that the roots appear to have been cut, and that by putting the top of the Mazarion to the root of the Mazarion, one part agrees and tallies with the other, that is the reason that induces him to swear to them.</p>

I was coming one morning from my wife, going to my wife's brother in Cold-bath-fields, and coming along the road I picked up this bag of roots by the road side, I brought them to Covent garden; I thought they belong to me as much as any body else; I asked Mr. Blackwell, if he wanted any roots, and when he came, he said, he had information given out by Mr. Grimwood, if there were any thing came they must be stopped.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say something came out of you or something came in? - Something directed me within; when I got up stairs I was greatly surprised at seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200132"/>my doors a little opened, I left it perfectly safe locked, I saw my door a little opened which startled me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been come out of your room? - I suppose about twenty minutes or half an hour, it was dark when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your door? - I did, and I had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of stairs is your room? - One pair; I rushed in and he stood still and never spoke, I seized on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts did you see him? - It was not quite in the middle, it might be about half a yard from the middle; he stood still in the middle of the room, not quite so far as the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a candle in your hand? - No, there was a reflection of the lamp, by which I saw the man; there is a lamp exactly opposite my door, in the street close opposite to the door of the room; there is but one room on a floor in the house. I ran and seized on him and held him with all my might, I did not speak nor he did not speak, but he seemed to wish to speak but did not; I held him with all the strength that ever I could, he rushes from me, he did not strike me nor offer it, he rushed from me, with that I scrieked murder, stop thief, he went down stairs, he rushed down stairs, and he stumbled on some of the stairs on which he was, immediately I heard a woman come out, with a candle in her hand on my alarm, and she collared him, he wrested from her, and I ran after him, and pursued him crying stop thief, in the street, till he was taken. Mr. Leclere took him; I saw him till he was taken, be stumbled over a post by the Thirteen Cantons, that was the means that he was taken in King-street, then he was surrounded and seized; I went home, when they said, that he was secured; I did not know I had lost any thing then, and went up into my lodging room, then I looked and saw that the lock was forced open, the latch of the lock was out, I put my key in to unlock the door, and it would not take the impression as usual, it appeared forced as far as that. The lock was out, and I could not return it with my key.</p>
               <p>Q. If the lock was out there must have been force to the part where the lock was? - There was some appearance, the staple was on, but it was looser than usual; when I came to look round the room, I missed some things directly out of a soul clothes bag, there were two dirty shirts, and a silk handkerchief, and a child's gown, and a pudding cloth, all the things mentioned in the indictment; a pair of stays hung up in a bag, and a clean shirt, marked J. F. No. 4.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who advised you to say that the lock was in that state? whether you was not advised to say so by the person who lives in the house? - Nobody said any such thing to me, nor was I ever before a justice or peace before this occasion, and I am ignorant of all matters. I am in my eight and fortieth year.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any conversation with the constable about this - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The constable that has laid this breaking against me lives in the house, and the first constable that took me, told me that the other constable had advised him to swear my life away for the sake of the reward.</p>

            ; the house belongs to Abraham Barrier; on Tuesday night last Mrs. Fletcher went out of my apartment to go up stairs, as soon as she got up stairs she screamed out violently, I ran to see what was the matter, as soon as I got my door open, I heard her cry stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know the prisoner before? - No, I saw the prisoner running down stairs, as he got on the two bottom stairs, he had like to fall, I ran and I got hold of him, but he soon got from me, I could not hold him fast enough, and a piece of his neckcloth came off in my hand, he got away from me, I followed after him, crying stop thief, by that means he was taken, but I did not see him taken; a man in the court took him, Mr. Leclere. I am positive the prisoner at the bar is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a bundle? - No, he had not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up afterwards to Mrs. Fletcher's room? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the lock? - I did, the lock and bolt were both out of its place, the bolt was out of the lock instead of being in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether there was the appearance of any force? - It was forced, but how I cannot tell, the catch was forced too; I am sensible it was a good firm lock and catch too.</p>

F. and one cotton handkerchief, one pudding cloth, and one check apron; I have got them here; likewise in his breeches pocket I found two false keys, and one pick-lock; the keys have been filed; I then took him into charge. (The keys produced.) I kept him in the shop, and one Mr. Barclay, constable of St. Ann's, wanted to force him from me; I took him to Marlborough-street, but the justices not sitting that evening, I brought him back again to my father's shop.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you look at the door? - I did not positively look at the door, but I looked at the lock, the bolt of the lock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200134"/>was out, it appeared to be forced open, but in what manner I am no judge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask her whether it is not a spring lock, that the lock naturally flies open? - No.</p>

I have no witnesses, they have been attending here two or three days, but they are not here now.</p>

               <p>Q. In the way you describe the blow given you, it could not be an accident? - It was this man ran at me, and done with a kind of stoop; I saw the man; I am sure of the person, as to that; but I have some reason to believe that prisoner was not the person that took the watch, because it went the other side, if he had taken it he must have taken it with the left hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether I was the person that shoved up against him.</p>
               <p>Court. He has sworn positively, he has no doubt it was you.</p>

               <p>Please your Worship, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the fifth of February, this present month, I was coming up Cockspur-street, and coming along by the side of the play house, passing by the play house, just as it was breaking up, we came to this place, where we see Mr. Woodriff. I am a patrole belonging to Sir Sampson Wright, coming up to him, he said, he had been robbed of his watch, by three, or four, or five people, he said, he had taken one, but he was rescued from him, as he was taking him from the place, where he took him to search him, by rubbing of his arm against some rails; as we found that, we said to him immediately, if you will please to cross over the way, we will try and pursue him we crossed over the way, and at the corner of Norris-street, we met some servants, that had headed him, and turned him, and stopped him; Mr. Woodriff says immediately, that is the man that was with me, but I don't believe he was the man that picked my pocket, but he was with them; we searched him, but there was nothing found on him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was going down the Haymarket, there was a mob of people coming out of the play house, I was shoved underneath the coach to let the people go by, and they shoved me against that gentleman, but with no intent to take any thing from him. I know nothing at all about it. I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Court to Baldwin. Did you find the original duplicate on the prisoner for these half boots? - Yes, the constable has it. (The boots produced and deposed to, not one pair in five hundred being cut out like them.)</p>
               <p>Baldwin. The prisoner was making them when I left him on the 13th of November.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Kendall. Have not you swore wrongfully in saying that is Mr. Baldwin's property? - I saw you at work on them, I took them up while they were on his seat, and I looked at them, and I know the man they was made for, I know them they are so small; I have no doubt about it but they are my master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These half boots I manufactured them up myself, for a man that bespoke a pair of them; and the man came and told me that he had not money to pay me for them, and I being a poor man was obliged to pawn them; this Mr. Baldwin is not a shoe-maker he never served a legal time to the business, and I think he is no judge; there was a poor man did attend here three days last week to speak for me, and he could not afford to spend his time any longer.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was he caught from your shop? - I cannot rightly tell, it is a little short street and he was quite at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was the person stopt? - He was, I think he was the person that had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean to say I think? - I cannot rightly tell whether that is the person, because he is quite in a different dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that was stopped in the street, the same man that had been in the shop? - Yes, it was the very same I am sure of that, I knew it was then, but his dress is different now; another man brought in the shoes, I did not see them till the other man brought them in.</p>

               <p>On the 1st day of February, eight o'clock at night, I ran out and I saw a crowd coming back again, I asked what was the matter? they said that the prisoner at the bar had thrown down some shoes just by the shop window; I have a cheesemonger's shop in the same street, and a little from my shop window the way that he ran, I found a pair of shoes in the kennel, I took a candle and looked, this might be about an hundred yards from Lavally's shop or better; some body looked round and they saw two more pair, and another person brought one pair; neither of these are here; the boy came and told me they were his master's; I knew where Mr. Lavally lived, and I took them to his master, the boy claimed them at once, and he said the man that the other had hold of, was the man that stole them; when I went into the shop I gave them to the master, the master wished me to appear the next day; I appeared, and gave my evidence.</p>
               <p>There is one thing which I wish to inform your lordship; the prisoner'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200138"/>friends has been treating with the prosecutor, and got him to take a bribe, I believe the prosecutor was innocent in taking it, but he has given it back.</p>
               <p>Court. He was excessively wrong in taking of it.</p>
               <p>- PEARSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was standing in my shop and I heard the cry of stop thief, and I ran out; I ran after the prisoner, I saw him running and by some means he fell down off the pavement, he was running as from the shop of the prosecutor; and I laid hold of him and pulled him up on his legs, and brought him to the light and looked at him; and when there was plenty of people round him, I went into my shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your shop to Mr. Lavally's? - Nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy at that time insist that that was the man, that had been in the shop? - I don't know. I did not go into the shop; that is the same man that he was running after, he was crying stop thief.</p>

               <p>The constable who had him in possession he has likewise took a bribe, he has taken ten shillings of the prisoner's wife, his name is Kettle.</p>
               <p>Court to the Clerk. If there is any recognizance of Kettle's let it be estreated.</p>
               <p>Court to Lavally. How came you to commit such an offence? - The constable told me it was right.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had kept the money, you would have been in as bad a condition as that man there. (The shoes produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Pearson. At the time of going before the Grand Jury, the constable and another advised the boy not to say what he did at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going on some business of my father's in Poultney-street, and I heard the cry of stop thief, and I ran and they detained me for it, that is all that I have got to say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in little Windmill-street, Mrs. Moseley has all my property in her care because I depend on her honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - Why suppose I live there. I live at Mrs. Moseley's, I am a carpenter, she has the keeping of my clothes, she had them in her care; and she always behaved honest to me, and I would trust her with a thousand pounds; the pawnbroker has got my property in his possession at this time, the prisoner was backward and forward at Mrs. Moseley's.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you missed any part of your clothes? - I only wore them on a Sunday, and then I put them in her care and keeping.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last deliver them to Mrs. Moseley to take care of them? - On Sunday evening before the Saturday, that the duplicates were found.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you done with your buckles? - She had both in her care in the chest at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200140"/>Q. Answer the question, do not run on in such a strange way. Had you any stockings? - There was a pair of silk stockings that I missed a few days before the coat was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the gold shirt buckle? - I had such a thing in Mrs. Moseley's care.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me when you ever saw your coat, your buckles, your stockings and your shirt buckle again? - I cannot say that I have seen them since that I delivered them up to Mrs. Moseley; I did not find them till I found them at the pawnbroker's on Saturday evening, between eight and nine o'clock; when I got the duplicates, I went immediately and demanded the coat and buckles last Saturday week, but I have not the things as yet.</p>
               <p>- FREERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I live in little Poultney-street, I have got a coat and a pair of buckles, I got them of the prisoner at the bar. On Monday the 4th of February, she pawned the coat for a guinea, and the buckles for fifteen shillings; she said she came for Mrs. Moseley, and Mrs. Moseley had authorised the prisoner to pledge things before now, I knew the name of Moseley.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever pledged things with you before as belonging to Mrs. Moseley? - Yes, I believe she has.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has redeemed those things? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been pledging as for Mrs. Moseley? - For the space of two or three months; she used to pledge the articles the beginning of the week, and towards the latter end of the week redeem them by pledging other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Moseley herself had never redeemed any thing herself that the prisoner had pledged? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand Mr. Phillips came and enquired for them? - Mrs. Moseley came first, the prisoner at the bar came on Wednesday and said that Mrs. Moseley and she had quarelled, and the tickets were lost, and desired me to stop the things; she mentioned that Mrs. Moseley had used her ill, and said that Mrs. Moseley had left her lawful husband, and had taken the duplicates and lived with another man, and desired we would not deliver the articles, if Mrs. Moseley should make application; we supposed the man's apparel belonged to Mr. Moseley, and if she had left her lawful husband, we had a right to stop them till Mr. Moseley made application for them; Mrs. Moseley came the Saturday following after we received notice from the prisoner to stop these articles; and Mr. Phillips came and made application, we produced not this coat and buckles, but a green coat and a pair of buckles, which the prisoner at the bar had not given us any notice to stop; when Mrs. Moseley came to redeem these articles, she said that Mr. Phillips was her brother, and he said it was his coat and not Mr. Moseley's, I delivered him that coat that he came for. (The coat produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Phillips. Where were these things kept in Mrs. Moseley's house? - In a chest belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lay them to be her property, where did the chest stand? - In the room in which I myself sleep.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Moseley. I wish to know how you have the care of Mr. Phillips's clothes? - They are left in my care; it is not my property. I have employed this woman to pawn things before, but not since the tenth and eleventh of January, which was two spoons my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say concerning the loss of your bonnet, cloak and apron? - This woman was at my room this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200141"/>Wednesday, and I went down, and when I came back this woman was not there; I left her in the room in which I live, the first floor, I am not certain whether the things were hanging on a nail or laying in a chair; but I am sensible they were in the room because I had them in my hand about a quarter of an hour before; when I came up again the landlady went first, and she said your door is open, I was following her up stairs; I had shut the door when I went out, and left her in the room; I missed my things immediately when I went into the room and I called in the landlady, I never saw them afterwards till Mr. Phillips came to fetch me to go to Marlborough-street; I believe that was the Wednesday following, afterwards I saw them there, and Mr. Kennedy the constable took them off her, they were on her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen the prisoner from that time till you saw her in Marlborough-street? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lent her these things to wear? - I had not; I had lent her them once about a month ago, or six weeks, but never since.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you employ this woman? - She used to come backward and forward very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a servant or an acquaintance? - Never an acquaintance; she first met me in the street by accident.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn.</p>
               <p>I have got the black silk cloak, a black silk bonnet and a linen apron; I took them off the prisoner at Marlborough-street office, after she was apprehended; Mrs. Moseley claimed them as her's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Kennedy knows that I said that Mrs. Moseley sent me the cloak? - She did not, Mrs. Moseley said that she stole the cloak. (The apron, cloak and bonnet, deposed to by Mrs. Moseley.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Moseley. Tell us when your husband died? - My husband left me about fifteen months ago; I heard by a person that lives at Clerkenwell, that he was dead; I never passed for a widow.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell this to any body? - I gave notice to Mr. Hartshorn, he was at home, I went in to his shop.</p>

               <p>Stevenson. I did not notice any thing particular, only as being an officer on board of her, until I got on the Keys on board at Billingsgate, where I perceived this piece of cloth concealed, sewed up in a bed in the cabbin; we came from Gravesend to come up to the Custom House Keys to deliver this cargo that she was leaded with.</p>
               <p>Court to Webb. You say with regard to these bales of goods they were delivered on board the Hoy the 11th or the 13th of December, this man says when he came to the Keys in town, he found something in a bedding; had these bales been delivered at Gravesend? - They had been delivered. When I delivered my bales at Gravesend, I went immediately to Chatham River, and then we came back again to Gravesend and this revenue officer came a board of us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. They were first of all delivered on board the Clockton at Lyon's Key? - Then they were to be delivered on board the East India ships at Gravesend; then the hoy returned and took this Custom House officer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he bring any goods back with the ship, or how did he come on board? - After I had been at Gravesend I got my receipt for the cargo, I went away from that ship to Chatham River for a load of cottons, and when I got at Gravesend they put this officer on board, and they came back with the cotton to the Custom House Key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You delivered all the cargo as you believe, and the officer of the ship gave you a receipt for the full amount of that cargo? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Had these boards any mark on them? - Not that I observed; there was the Company's mark on the canvas; I came out of the hold, and they were all then handed into the cabbin, and Edd Adams then took and cut the mark off the wrapper of the bale, and the boards with the mark of the wrapper he burnt, and the remaining part of the wrapper was hove over board; the bale contained six pieces of cloth, and each piece was wrapped in a sort of dark coloured canvas, and at one end of the canvas was painted flowers, with the Company's arms,</p>

               <p>Q. Now I hear very much to the misfortune of the East-India Company you have been three years and five months in their service; now of that three years and five months, what part have you employed in plundering them? you have been plundering them without remorse, and I want to know how long you have been in this practice? - That is not to the point in question.</p>
               <p>Q. It is to the point in question, what kind of credit the Jury can give to your testimony? - I have told you before I could not justly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years? - Not many, about nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. Nine or ten months is not a year; then nine or ten months you have had your full swing at the East-India Company's property? - No, it is not so, not always.</p>
               <p>Q. No oftener than you had a good opportunity? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then having given such a good account of yourself, I take it for granted you do it to save your neck? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now there was one thing I think you told us, that Adams told you, that he would not go down into the cabbin to get up these things, because there would be no one to give an answer to his master? - I did not say the cabbin, I said the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a lad on board besides Adams, so that that could not be the true reason, yet you have sworn it; with all that load of iniquity on your head, I take my leave of you, good by to you, you may stand down; I dare say the next time you give an account of a robbery, you will not do it so easy, you will do it at that bar.</p>
               <p>Court. You have not explained to us after you had taken out this bale of cloth, what you did with it? - They were all in pieces of canvas, there was six pieces; the whole bale was completely taken away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take care of the fastenings of your shop that night? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200150"/>usually, but that night I examined my house, about half past eight, just as the man had shut up the shop, I examined both of the shutters, and I found them safe; I left the door in the care of the man, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man sleep in the house with you? - He did, I found the bolts of the shop window all safe; about half after twelve I was alarmed by the watchman, he is here; I went into the shop as soon as I could; I got out of bed as soon as I could, and looked and saw a hole made through the shop window, both through the window shutter and the glass; the shutter was not down, there was some goods on a show board, opposite to the pane which they broke; these goods where there in the day time, and left there at night; they took out the pannel of the shutter, which was about nearly a foot one way, and the length of my arm in length, as near as I can judge; the glass seemed to be broke with the hand thrust through it, the panes are very large sash glasses, much larger than the pannel of the shutter, not so long, but wider; so that any body putting in an arm through the fracture of the shutter, and through this pane could reach the goods which were in the show window with very great ease.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the articles, which are mentioned in this indictment in this shop window? - They were standing in that window, the three pair of womens, I verily believe were standing, but one pair I am sure of; the mens I put there the day before myself; I am sure I had in that window that day the mens shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear that the pannel of the shutter had been broke, had it been cut out or knocked to pieces? - There was a hole made at the bottom of the pannel, and an iron crow put in there and raised it out; when I opened the door, they informed me there were two near the window. About ten o'clock the next day, Mr. Williams, one of the witnesses sent his man, to know if I had lost any shoes, I informed his man I had; Mr. Williams is no officer, he lives on the other side of the street higher up, no great way from me; I went and he shewed me four pair of shoes, one pair of leather shoes, and three pair of womens stuff, I knew them all, and before I went to Mr. Williams's, I had just recollected that pair in particular, as being the pair that was in the window. Mr. Williams gave the shoes into my hands; I have them here.</p>
               <p>Q. No other violence was offered to your house? - No more.</p>
               <p>Q. And you could not consequently lose any thing more, than what was within the reach of an arm? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the watchman, when he gave you this alarm, any body in his custody? - He told me he had a man in custody, but I did not see the prisoner till I saw him at the watch-house. (Produces the shoes and deposes to them.) There is no mark in the mens shoes, there is a hole in the flap which I observed, when they were brought in from the binder, a fault in the leather, which the white leather should have covered, but it did not; I observed that hole when they were cut out, and I supposed that the white leather would have covered it, but it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time had you put that pair of shoes, or remember to have seen them in your shop window? - I think it was sometime in the afternoon; I am certain it was before dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same window that was broke? - Near the spot; I have no mark on the womens shoes, whereby I know them to be mine, only that they are my father's manufactory, he is not here; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200151"/>judge of them from the knowledge of the manufactory, I think it is the first I ever had of him, I assisted him sometime before I was in business myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had these shoes of your father? - Not more than two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had they been usually put? - Some of them were put in the window, I can undertake to say, that they were a part absolutely that I had of my father; my father does not make himself, but I had knowledge of the workmen for several years; two pair of them were made by two different workmen that I know, the other pair I cannot so positively speak to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is the prosecutor the proper owner of the shoes? - The shoes are my property; I have no partner; I have only the lower part of the house, Mr. Clarke has the whole house, and lets it out in two parts, and I have the lower part; there is nobody lives in the upper part, and it was empty at that time; Mr. Clarke does not live in the house, nor any of his family; I sleep in a bedroom backward behind the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there more than one entrance to the house? - There are two, one for the shop, and one also for the use of the upper part of the house, I use both, they are both at the front, one is on the right hand side of the shop quite detached from the shop, we make use of that after the shop is shut up to go to our other apartments.</p>

               <p>I am a settled watchman of Mary-le-bone Parish; just after I had finished crying twelve, on Wednesday the 23d of January, I was in Oxford-street, a little below Rathbone-place, and I heard something crack at the bottom of the road, on the right hand side, I went down to see what it was, and saw the pannel of a shutter broke; it was as near as I can guess about two hundred yards from where I was standing at the bottom of Rathbone-place; I went down, I went immediately by the other side of the road, and I saw it was the shoemaker's, I observed the pannel of the shutter lifted out from the bottom, and the glass broke the same way, I went a little way up Oxford-street, and I saw this young man and another, a little way from the crack; I saw two persons standing still, immediately I crossed to the other side of the way to my own parish to watch them, how they would proceed in the business; I saw these two persons go, this prisoner and the other to the shop window, I am sure he is one of them, and I saw him put his arm in, and I went to him, and I catched him with his arm in, he had not taken any thing when I caught him; immediately he drew his arm out of the window, and chucked something over his shoulder from the window; this other man that was along with him took over to the other side of the way, which was in Mary-le-bone Parish, there was nobody with me; then one of the witnesses picked up what the prisoner threw away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you laid hold of him, and he had got his arm in the window, did you then see any thing in his hand? - I did not observe any thing, but I am sure I observed him throw something from him, but what that was I did not then see; I gave an alarm, and there was our patrole came, and was with me after I had taken him, and sprung the rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after your hearing the crack of the shutter, that you went down there? - I went immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at the window before you came up? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is of no service of me putting to him any questions, he will continue in the same story for the purpose of swearing my life away, he has owed me a spite for this two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200152"/>Court. Have you any spite or any ill will against this prisoner? - Never in my life; I never had any quarrel with him in my life; I always knew him to be a very hard working lad, and before this time, I looked upon him as well as my own brother, and would do any thing for him as far as laid in my power.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you had any quarrels? - Never in my life, since I have known him, and I have known him now going on twelve or fourteen years, and I always thought well of him before this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a watchman? - About four years.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you yourself observed any persons at that time, on the side of the way that Haynes was of? - I had not; he sprung his rattle, and I went over to him, and the patrole of St. Ann's came up and Haynes, and the patrole of St. Ann's took him to St. Ann's watch-house; I saw nothing of any property at that time, the prisoner was the man he took.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker; I live at No. 52, Oxford-street; I was coming past, on Thursday morning, the 23d of January, about twenty minutes before one, opposite the side where Mr. Fordred, the prosecutor lives, he lives on the left hand, on St Ann's side, and I live on the right, I was going from St. Giles's, to my own home; I crossed as I usually do, the end of Oxford-street from St. Giles's, because it is the cleanest, and my feet ran against something, I did not know immediately what it was, they were laying just as I was going across away from the small pavement way, to get from the Boar and Castle, from the end of the road to the Boar and Castle gate; I believe it is about thirty yards more towards Tottenham-court-road, than opposite Mr. Fordred's shop, not above fifty yards from Mr. Fordred's shop; they rather entangled over my ancle, I stopped to see what it was, it was a pair of shoes, and stooping I perceived there were three more pair, I found four pair, and I carried them home, three pair of womens stuff, and one pair of mens leather. The next morning I employed my young man to go and know if any house had been broke open, whether any body would own them, and I understand the first shop he went into, he saw Mr. Fordred, and he recognized them directly. I know the shoes again, they are the same shoes I found.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say on recollection concerning the distance of Mr. Fordred's house? - It was fifty yards; whoever must take them must have run towards Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Court to Haynes. You swear that you saw two persons standing there in that neighbourhood, now when you laid hold of one of them, what became of the other? - He took the other side of the road, which way he went I cannot tell, my back was to him, when he took the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner chuck something over his shoulder, did you look to observe what became of that thing that he so chucked? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the other man to the prisoner, when the prisoner chucked something over his shoulder? - Very near, close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the prisoner chucked something, or after, that the other man took the other side of the way? - After, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken into custody for this robbery, I had been to a public house, where I had met several men that I worked with, who detained me drinking there quite late in the evening, and I departed from them, and was walking towards my own home; I was walking down Oxford street, and I saw a hole in the pannel of the shutter; I drew pretty near to see whether it was a hole or not, in the mean time I was looking at it, a man about twenty or thirty yards off walked very sharp away, in the mean time I was looking stedfast at it, that man came, and took me into custody, it is impossible to break a shutter, without having instruments. I have no witness.</p>

               <p>My husband is a day labourer; I saw the person take the shawl, I saw her throw it on the ground from the counter, she wiped it from the counter with her cloak, she threw her cloak on it, and threw it down by the side of her; I saw her, afterwards she shuffled it under her clothes, she sat down on the stool, I saw her pick it up from the ground, and in paying for what she had bought, she was very much confused when she found that she was found out; when she came back, she had the parcel that she had bought inside of her muff; I am certain of it, and she laid it down on the counter; afterwards the shawl was taken from her, by that young man

            , No. 33, King-street, Covent-garden; he is a brass founder; I keep a house in Queen-street. On the 28th of January as I was going past St. Paul's, I missed my watch; at first I thought I had left it at home, being Monday, as I frequently had done in my Sunday's cloaths; I know the woman at the bar, she was at my house and did the business of my house; I never made any agreement with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your wife live with you? - Yes, she is related to my wife by her first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200159"/>husband; my wife's first husband was her uncle. I never made any agreement with her as a servant; had she acted as she ought to have done, as far as my ability, I would have rewarded her in the course of time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she to do? - I considered when she came into the house my wife was but very poorly; I understood there was some difference between her and her husband, and she came into my house and asked my wife to let her be there for a few days; she came then, and when I came home in the evening my wife informed me; this was some time in June last, and the prisoner at the bar asked me whether it would be agreeable for her to sleep there for a few days? I acquiesced in it, understanding she was some relation to my wife by her first husband. On the 28th of January I challenged her with having taken several articles; she acknowledged to some of them; I enquired after the articles, as in searching over my dress I missed my silver buckles; I lost my articles, and consequently I was to enquire after them; I found she had pledged my silver buckles I charged her with, my black coat I also charged her with; she wished God would strike her dead if she knew any thing of my silver buckles or my black coat; I charged her also with several other articles I missed at certain times; some of the articles she owned to having pledged, to the amount of about 1 l. 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to her to induce her to own to these articles? - I told her if she would give me up the duplicates of the articles that she had pledged, I would not prosecute her, but she did not give me up the duplicates, for this was on Tuesday or Wednesday; after the 28th she told me where the things were, part of them, but she told me they were pledged in Tottenham court-road; she did not give a just account where they were, nor a just account of all the duplicates; there was one duplicate brought to me afterwards by her own husband, sent by her to me. I missed many other articles besides.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the husband come to see her at your house? - Yes, he had been there several times, I cannot tell how often, as I am obliged to be away from home from morning till night, and my wife being ill ever since June last; I missed all the things in the indictment at different times; I cannot tell what is missing, because I was not in the way altogether to know; when I told her I would not prosecute her, I was not sensible of my loss.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these the things you missed before you told her you would not prosecute her, if she would give up the duplicates? - Yes, they were taken at different times; I know no more to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I suppose you had a good opinion of this woman? - I had a very great opinion of her, or else I should not have trusted her; I placed the greatest confidence in her; I believe all the things in the indictment are present.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say that you will be able to recollect a little more than what you have told us Mr. Heath, it was a long time before we learned that she was so near a relation; now you talk about duplicates and so on, and that you had a very good opinion of this woman; perhaps you had a very good opinion of a woman named Margerett Carr? - I took her up at the same time; I charged her with the constable,

               <p>Q. When did you see her last? - The last time was at the police office in Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200160"/>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - of you please; I don't know to my knowledge that I have seen her since.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether or not you have seen a woman that you have charged with a robbery? - I have not seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you attend at the police office? - On the 13th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. As it is only thirteen days ago since you see her, you can tell us positively whether you have seen Margerett Carr since? - I have not seen her since</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say before you had not seen her to your knowledge? - Because I was willing to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not mean to swear positively that you have not seen her? - I have not seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will tell you; do you know a Mr. Broughton? - I don't know the name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Margerett Carr leave your service? - On the 28th of January or 29th; I will not take on me to say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did she go to live with? - I told her not to let me see her face any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she go to live with? - She is a chairwoman I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe she is a chairwoman? - Because I understand she acted as a chairwoman at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she live as a regular servant there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect saying this, that you would certainly hang that woman there, but you would spare Carr? - I never said any such word.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you know this fact, that every one of these things, which are produced from the pawnbroker's, were pawned by Margerett Carr and in her name? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen the duplicates? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these not all in the name of Margerett Carr? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have not seen this Margerett Carr at any friend's house? - No, not since she was at the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before she was at the police office had you seen her at any friend's? - I cannot say, I saw her on the 28th or 29th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. At what friend's house? - At no friend's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this Margerett Carr has been in Newgate under a charge of felony? - I never heard that she was in Newgate, or any other place of confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, as these things have been going frequently, you have had occasion to complain of other persons who had robbed you? - I have had occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. That person was in your family down to the present time. Have you not had occasion to charge one of your children with robbing you? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to prosecutor. How came this to be a charge for a capital offence, she was only committed for a single felony from the office? - I don't know what she was committed for there, I understood I was to set a value on the things; I hope I have not over charged them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know she was so near her time? - I have heard she was with child.</p>

             the first of this month came to take a lodging of me, and came to it that night, a three pair of stairs front room, ready furnished, to pay 5 s. a week; I had other lodgers in the house, in the first and second floor at that time; I live in the lower part of the house in the parlour. On the 7th of this month the second floor was then to be let, and she took that; I never see no more of her, but I heard a noise which occasioned me to tell her to leave that lodging at the week's end; the noise was between her and some men that she brought into the house. On Thursday the 13th, between the hours of nine and ten at night, she came down to me and said, she could not leave the lodgings until Saturday, as she had then got a lodging to go to, and begged for a night's lodging over her week; I told her she was extremely welcome to the night, provided she went away quietly; I saw no more of her never, till she was taken; she went away immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200162"/>as she asked for admittance to stay an over night; I had never seen her before she came to my house in my life. On Friday I was called up by one of the lodgers who suspected she was gone, and a person ran up by my desire to see whether the things were gone or not, and I went up, and I went into the room and found the room stripped of every thing; the first thing I missed was the sopha cover; not half the things are in the indictment; I missed the cotton furniture, the window curtains, the brass candlestick and the snuffer stand; these things were found at Strangeways, a pawnbroker's, over Black Fryar's Bridge.</p>

(The things produced mentioned in the indictment, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband sent me out to get a lodging, he took the best part of the things in my absence, and when I came back again he told me if I would not take the remainder he would murder me.</p>

I searched all the prisoners twice on Monday, the day that we employed the prisoners, to see that they had nothing in their pockets, they had been at the work twice that day, and I ordered the man to search him in my presence, he stood at the side of the door when I let him out.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I live at No. 434, St. Martin's lane. On Monday night the 11th of this month, about half past eight or rather more, Heslip and Murray came to my shop; Murray came in and produced some plate which was cut in pieces, three large pieces and some small pieces besides; Murray said, we have brought you something worth your buying, I looked at it and I saw it was plate, as though it was quite blackened by the fire; on one piece I found a gentleman's coat of arms, I shewed it to them, they seemed not surprised, I asked them particular where they were working? they said, they were working by a fire by Oxford-road, and they found it in the ruins; I asked them what street? they could not inform me, they said, they did not know; I asked them who was their employer? they said, Mr. Goodwin, which was a master bricklayer; I asked them where he did live? they could not inform me, they said, they did not know; I asked them where he paid them? they said, at a public house; I asked them the sign? Murray said, he believed it was the One Tun, he said, near the buildings; I asked them where he hired them? he said, at Charing Cross, it may be about that very instant my lad went out of doors, and he found Kelly, and he brought him in, he came in with the lad, he had not hold of him, my lad said, he found him at the door; I asked Kelly the same questions as I had asked them, word for word; I believe he gave the same answer exactly; I asked how long they had been in London? they said, they had been in London a fortnight; I asked them if they heard how long the fire had happened before they went to work? they said, a few days; I could not find at what house this was; I asked them if they had heard of any accident that happened at it? they said, there was a young woman that sell out of a two pair of stairs window; from that I knew it was Lady Dover's; they did not seem to be any way intimidated or afraid; Kelly said, they would bring Mr. Goodwin, their employer, about the plate, that they lived all three together in Marigold-court, in the Strand; they gave a proper account; directly my lad and I went to this place where the fire was, I saw a gentleman's servant crossing the street, I enquired for the One Tun, I went into a public house and shewed them the plate, and I found out the steward about ten o'clock, and I shewed him the plate and he owned it directly, he said, that he and one of the executors would call at my house the next morning; Mr. Goodwin called, I told him I had not the pleasure to know him, but I would go with him to the steward.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to us that the two which first came in, namely Heslip and Murray, gave you answers to every question you asked, just as you have told, and Kelly when he came in he repeated nearly the same, every thing exactly corresponded? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the directions they gave to their own lodgings right? - It was.</p>

These books I produce, has my hand writing in every one of them; I cannot take upon me to say how long I had seen them before in my house, this man had lived with me I believe about three months; I searched his lodgings the day I received the information, the 28th of January, when I took him to Bow-street, he signed a written confession that he had stole these things my property.</p>

Was there any thing previously said to him? - Nothing by me, nor by the magistrate, neither promise nor threats; I don't know whether it was read over to him or not; I saw him sign it, and I saw the magistrate sign it; and I witnessed it; I have not a doubt but it was read over to him.</p>

               <p>In the first place Mr. Blackiter that is now come to swear against me, has been an officer in every office almost round London, and discharged, through misconduct, from every office that he has been in; and now at this present time he lives with a common shoplifter.</p>
               <p>Blackiter, I never was discharged from an office in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Percival that was taken and was brought to trial, was not the Percival that did the robbery; the words that they insinuated and drew from me, were words that I was not on my oath, neither was I before a Justice, they were only my words; I never kept any thing back from justice, I brought every thing to justice as far as lay in my power; there is no account from the prosecutor that that was the man, nor any further contradiction except my own words; them two, Harper and Blackiter, I was obliged to keep in with that I might not be turned in amongst the other prisoners; what I might have told them in liquor I cannot say. There are two Percivals. Clarke, who met us coming out of the house of Mr. Robinson's, says, it was that other Percival; he was the chief witness on Waine's trial, and is not brought forth; I thought they would have called him.</p>
