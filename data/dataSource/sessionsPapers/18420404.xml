                  </hi> I am clerk to George Harker, a dry-salter, of Arthur-street, City. On the 21st of December the prisoner called at the warehouse—I knew him by the name of Gillingham—he inquired if Mr. Harker was a buyer of Reading sauce—I said, "If it is not Cocks' genuine Reading sauce, it is no use to offer it, for Mr. Harker will not buy it"—he offered it at 15 per cent. under Cocks' selling price—Cocks' price is, I think, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and then 20 per cent. discount, which would bring it to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, that is Cocks' price—I said, "How is it you are enabled to offer it at 15 per cent. less than Cocks' price?"—he said he had made an exchange with Cocks for soy, and that enabled him to offer it at the reduced price—I said Mr. Harker was not within, and told him to call next morning—when I said Mr. Harker would not take it un<lb/>less it was Cocks' genuine, he produced a paper to me, which he called an invoice, that convinced me it was Cocks' genuine sauce—I concluded the thing to be perfectly fair—he went away and came again next day—I was present when he saw Mr. Harker—they had some conversation, and Mr. Harker bought twenty-four dozen, and gave a cheque on Prescott's bank for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner gave a receipt—I have both the cheque and receipt here—the sauce was packed in two hampers—I have tasted the sauce—it is not Cocks' Reading sauce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drysalter. In December I remember my servant Hayes communicating to me what had passed between him and a person named Gillingham—I afterwards saw the prisoner—he told me he had offered my clerk some Cocks' Reading sauce—I asked him if it was the real genuine article—he said it was, and he had convinced my clerk of that, that the sauce he offered was the genuine sauce—he said he had con<lb/>vinced my clerk of the fact—Hayes said, in his presence, "He has shown me the invoice from Cocks"—the prisoner said he had sold Cocks some soy,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040006"/>
               <p>and had taken this in barter for the soy—as he had often called before, and offered me soy, I took it for granted it was right—I think he said the price was 35 per cent, discount, that is, 35 per cent, off 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—Cocks' discount is 20 per cent., and twelve months' credit—I told my clerk he might take it—I might have told the prisoner he might send it in—I wrote a cheque for the money, and gave it to my clerk to pay him when he delivered the article—it was not delivered in my presence—Hayes afterwards returned me this receipt as given by the prisoner, and this cheque came back from my bankers in due course—if I had known it was any thing but Cocks' genuine Reading sauce, I certainly should not have bought it—it was valueless—even if it had been better, it would not have done.</p>

               <p>Cocks, we are the manufacturers of Cocks' Reading sauce. I have known the prisoner I should think from three to four years—we have purchased soy of him—the last transaction was about the summer of last year—we have sold him some of our sauce—the last time was the 2nd of November, 1840—we never sold him any but once—he has not paid for it—we have bought pickles and cayenne of him—we never had any barter transaction with him whatever—we never had any offer from him to deal by way of barter—we had a letter from a person named Gillingham, but his name is Simmonds—I never saw him on the subject—we had a letter signed "Gil<lb/>lingham"—when we bought soy of the prisoner we paid him by a cheque on Willis's bank.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, the 22nd of March, about three o'clock, I had occasion to go up to a room at the top of the house—I found the door ajar, and the prisoner inside, trying to hide behind the door, on which some dresses hung—I asked what he did there—he mut<lb/>tered something about a lady—I collared him, brought him down to the first-floor, and then he struck me a violent blow on the forehead with a hammer—a good many handkerchiefs fell from him as I brought him down stairs—he broke from me—I pursued him into the street, and saw a gen<lb/>tleman stop him on the opposite side of the way—a policeman came up and took him to the station, where he was searched, and three shirts, two hand<lb/>kerchiefs, a silver measure, and other articles found on him belonging to Mr. Osborne—the street-door was open, but the room-door was kept locked and the key kept in an adjoining room, which was not locked—there is a door on the staircase, and that was closed—it was necessary to turn the handle of the lock to get to the stairs—I can swear that door was shut—1 had seen it shut that morning—it is usually kept shut—I saw the room door locked that day, and the key in a lower room, hanging on the dresser—I saw the room-door shut about ten in the morning—I saw the key in the adjoining room about three minutes before I found the prisoner there—I went there, as I was told the key was there—I found it there, but the door was unfastened when I went to unlock it—he might have used the key and put it back again.</p>

In consequence of directions I received, I watched the premises, and on the 2nd of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, in consequence of what Mr. Dickens told me, I went into the rick-yard, and heard footsteps before me, of two men walking—I followed them, and as I thought, they got over some palings—I put my hand on one of their heads, and said, "Who are you?" but they got away directly—I went a doors and told my master, then went into the rick-yard again, and at the back of the barn there is a door opening inward—as soon as I pushed my back against the door, a man ran out—I found the prisoner coming out of the barn—I am certain he is the man—he had a sacking smock-frock on, and a red cap lined with white—this was half an hour after I had seen the two men—I pulled his cap off, and in the scuffle with him we both went down—he was at the bottom, and I on the top of him—he got away—I had known him long before, and am quite sure he is the man—he snatched the cap out of my hand—I searched the barn, and found two empty sacks, and two which had about two bushels and a half of corn in them—there was a good deal of master's corn in the barn—the sacks did not be<lb/>long to master, but I believe the corn in them to be the same corn—I went with the policeman to several places, and at last found the prisoner.</p>

About nine o'clock at night, on the 19th of March, Follett told me something—I instantly went to the front window, and missed book from one of the shelves—I went outside, and looked, but could not see the prisoner—about five minutes afterwards I saw him on the other side of the street—I went across with Follett, and caught the prisoner with this book concealed under his coat—it is the one I missed, and is my master's—the book was at least three feet inside the window—to window was not shut.</p>

It is not likely if I took the book I should pass the shop again. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was another person with him—I saw him put the book down by his left side—I should say three or four minutes elapsed from his taking the book and coining back again—one went to the right, and one to the left—they parted at the window—one engaged the young man that was minding the window in conversa<lb/>tion, while the prisoner stole the book—he opened it under pretence of looking at it, and then walked up Fleet-street with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles Hook, a linen<lb/>draper, in St. John-street. About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of March the prisoner came to my shop—I asked what he wanted—he said the servant who had just gone in was his aunt—I turned my back, supposing they were going to talk together—I had got a few steps away, when I heard him call "Mary" at the door—I missed a shawl from the counter, which I had seen a few minutes previous)—he ran—I followed, and saw him fifty or sixty yards off, in company with another boy and a girl—I took him, and asked him for the shawl he had taken away from our shop—he said he had not taken, or not got any thing—I asked what the girl bad got in her basket—he said some butter, that she had been to the cheesemongers's—I opened it, and there was some butter—the third party ran away—I have not found the shawl—I did not see the prisoner with it—It was there at the time he came in, and when he went out it was gone—no one had been in in the mean time—the servant who came in at the same time he did was no relation of his at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the service of the East and West Indian Dock Company. In consequence of suspicion which I entertained the prisoner was watched on the 4th of march last—he held the situation of cheque clerk, unconnected with the warehouse with which I was connected—his duties were performed in the office, not in the warehouse-about half-past twelve o'clock, when the men go to dinner I saw him by himself, on the floor of the warehouse, No. 2, where sampling was going on, of Bengal bags of sugar—I observed him making up a sample of sugar—he had not the slightest right to make up samples—when he had made it up he put it into his pocket—it was necessary for him to pass me in leaving the ware-house, and I entered into conversation with him, which gave me a full opportunity of observing his pocket, and it was very bulky—next morn<lb/>ing Dixon showed me a sample of sugar—it was exactly the same descrip<lb/>tion of sugar as that in the warehouse—they sample it by putting it into tubs—I am familiar with the quality of sugar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Goodwin. I re<lb/>member the night in question—there was some Spanish-liquorice, sealing-wax, and slate-pencil, inside the broken pane, close by the glass—the hole was large enough for a small hand to be put through and to reach the sealing-wax—I do not know that anybody had been in the shop that night—I remember Hungerford coming with the prisoner Tabor—I had Dot missed anything before that—I had not looked—I keep a young woman, but she had not been in the shop since the afternoon, as she was nursing my baby—I fasten the door of the shop because the parlour is a good distance from it—I have a gas-light in the shop—I had some sealing-wax like that pro<lb/>duced in my window, of the same colours and the same size—I cannot say is mine—I also had some stick-liquorice—when Tabor came it was all gone from the window—I bad seen it there in the early part of the afternoon—I had not sold any after that—my husband was out all day—I never saw either of the prisoners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Edward Cooke Bourne of No. 244, Regent-street, furriers. The prisoner was in our employ as shopman, and received money for goods from cus<lb/>tomers over the counter, and occasionally from customers on our account—he was in our service about sixteen months, and absconded on the 20th of January without notice—the prisoner took an order from Mr. D. Sombre, the member for Sudbury, for a fur coat—I was not present—if he received the money his duty was to place it in my desk in the shop, and enter it imme<lb/>diately in a book—I have the book which he kept for that purpose—my desk was accessible to every shopman for that purpose—my desk the counter from a customer he should do the same with it—there is no entry of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on January the 5th from Mr. D. Sombre—there certainly appears to have been a leaf torn out, but I could not be positive of it—if any sum was received by him between the 5th and 17th, of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. D. sombre, there is no account of it, nor for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or six guineas for a sable boa on the 16th of January—there is no leaf gone till after the date of 17th.</p>

On the 10th of March 1, was near Mr. Giblett's shop, in Tottenam-court-road, and saw Jefferys cutting at this piece of linen, which was on the lobby door—he cut it off with a knife—he went to it several times—Comber was watching about a yard off, just by the window, outside the outer door—after Jefferys cut the linen he left it in the lobby and Comber took it out—the shopman opened the door, he threw it down and ran across the road—I secured him, took him back to the lobby, took up the linen, and took him to the station—Jefferys ran away when Comber was taken—there was another boy there—when I took Comber to the station there was a crowd there, and Jefferys was in the crowd—I brought him into the station and both said they had never seen each other before—I found this knife concealed in Jefferys' both with same marks of lint upon it, which had apparently come off the linen which had hung from the top of the door, and was cut off at the bot<lb/>tom leaving the top still hanging there.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">the policeman had previously said, in Green's presence, "We have taken a man who says he purchased the tobacco at your house; he is now at the station"</hi>)—I turned to the policeman, and said, "You see this weight, it is 8lbs"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What does the parcel weigh which you have taken. with this man?"—he said, "13 3/4 lbs."—the policeman then laid, "Shall I take the shopman into custody?"—I said, "No, not at present; I am so flurried I hardly know what to tell you to do; we will go to the station"—On finding the difference in weight, I said to Green, "Independently of your rascality in exchanging smalls for long, you. knowing the relative value of each, how can you account for the parcel yon say you exchanged weighing 8lbs., and the parcel you have given away weighing l3 3/4 lbs.?"—he said, "I thought the parcel weighed l0lbs., and I left it for Mansford to take himself; I did not think he would take so much more than he brought"—I and the policeman then went to the station, leaving Green at my house—I saw Mansford at the station—I said to him, "What is the meaning of all this, Mansford?"—he raid, "I have not defrauded you of any thing"—I said, "Don't talk in that strain, this parcel only weighs 8lbs., and the other weighs 13 3/4 lbs.; how do you account for the discre<lb/>pancy?"—he said, "I was going to bring you the other portion"—I said, "You were strong enough to carry away 13lbs., but not strong enough to bring it"—we went to his house, but found nothing that I thought proper to bring away.</p>

I am cook in the service of Thomas Richter, who lives in the house in the Botanical Gardens, Sloane-street, in the parish of saintLuke, Chelsea.—On the 3rd of March I and my fellow-servant's atten<lb/>tion was drawn by footsteps—I went out and saw a boy making his way up to the gate, while I was calling to him I turned round and observed prisoner coming in a direction from the pantry window, with this plate in his hand—I called out to him—he turned round, shot it out of his hand on the ground and ran off—I pursued him and saw Payne—he was after<lb/>wards brought back in custody—the plate is master's—I saw it safe in the pantry that morning, and I think the window was down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On the 28th of January I was employed on the <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> a Newcastle trader—the prisoner was an appren<lb/>tice and was employed on board that day—be and I were engaged in handling some iron bars into the ship, between nine and ten o'clock at night—he was standing between the decks upon the beam, steadying the bars as they came in, and I was in the hold receiving them—he handed them to me, and I took them into the hold—in turning the bars they some<lb/>times touched the prisoner—that happened three or four times—he said, "You do this on purpose"—I said I did nothing of the sort—they happened to touch him again a little time after, and he took up a log of wood and flung at me—it hit me on my thumb, so that I lost the use of my hand, and dropped the bar out of my hand—I asked him what that was for—he gave me no answer, but went away on deck—I followed him, and found him on the quarter-deck, by the main rigging—I went up to him with a rope's-end in my hand, about as thick as my finger—I was hitting at him two or three times, but the rigging and the quarter-boards prevented as I getting at him—I dare say the rope hit him, but not as I intended—I then took him by the collar and pulled him out from there, and as soon as I him out he stabbed a knife into me—I had hit him with the rope before that, and was then in the act of pulling him ont and striking him with the rope—while I was doing that he stabbed the knife into me immediately—I did not see the knife in his hand, but I felt the blow—he struck me at the back of the left shoulder—I could feel that it was done with some sharp tool or knife—at the time he struck me he said, "Take that"—I left him, and showed my shoulder to Thomas Walton and the mate—I went immediately to a doctor in the Minories, who advised me to go to the Lon<lb/>don hospital, which I did, and was there from the 28th of January to the 15th of march.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. The prisoner keeps the Hoop public-house at Kensington Gravel-pits—he has got a skittle-alley. On the 7th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the skittle-alley, playing—the prisoner came to put out the lights—I said,"Don't put out the light, master, till we have finished the game"—he put them out, and lighted them again—I was playing for a pot of beer—when we had finished the game, he said we might go into the tap-room and have the beer—we all went out of the ground but four, leaving him and the pot<lb/>boy there—I went into the tap-room—while we staid there some time the pot-boy came, and said, "You had better go down into the ground if you want any beer, for master has ordered me to take it down the skittle-ground"—we went down to the door of the skittle-ground—the prisoner saw us coming, and shut the door, saying, "I will have none of you <hi rend="italic">riff-raff</hi> set in here"—I told him I did not want to go into the ground, I only wanted a drop of the beer we had been playing for—one of the young men drank out of the pot, and ordered the landlord to give it to me, for it belonged to me, for I had won it—I then stood outside the door—the young man who I had won it of remained in the ground—he then gave me the beer, and I took the pot into the tap-room—the prisoner followed me, and said, "Now, you b—y <hi rend="italic">riff-raff</hi> set, get out of my house, for I will have none of you here"—I told him I would go as soon as the beer was drank, and not before—he said if I did not go, he would fetch somebody to put me where I had been before (<hi rend="italic">I have been in jail for getting tipsy, and several times in the station-house, but never for any thing but drunkenness</hi>) the prisoner went out, and returned in about ten minutes, with a large stick in his hand—he walked up to me, and struck me a violent blow on the head—I had a round cloth cap on my head—the blow knocked me down, stud<lb/>ned me, and when I came to myself, I saw him standing over me (<hi rend="italic">the blow cut my head—it bled for about an hour and a half—this is the mark which I have now</hi>) the prisoner was standing over me with the stick in his right hand, holding it up, going to hit me again, but a young man, named John Lamborn, laid hold of him—the prisoner was standing over me, threatening that he would cut my b—y brains and eyes out, or any b—I that took my part—Lamborn came in and laid hold of him—I ran out, fearing he would strike me again—I heard Lamborn say, "pray don't hit him any more"—two young men took me to Mr. Wright, a doctor—I was nearly a fortnight under his care—I feel well now—I have not much pain from it, only at times.</p>

On the 11th of March I left my room for three or four minutes, and on returning missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were quite safe when I left the room at a few minutes before two o'clock—I went to the station to give information, and found them, and the prisoner was in custody—they belong to my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Well-street, Drury-Jane. On the night of the 3rd of April I went home with Reardon—we knocked up against the prisoner's wife in Queen-street, Seven Dials—we went to the place where she lives with the prisoner as his wife—we had been there ten minutes, to the best of my knowledge, when the prisoner made his appear<lb/>ance—during that time nothing improper passed, more than inquiring when he was and what made him strike her—I will swear I did not see Reardon put his hand upon the prisoner's wife—I was not near them—it is not a very large room—I did not join in the conversation—there was no inde<lb/>cent conversation there—he was not speaking very improperly to the man's wife—I swear that—I remember her taking the prosecutor by the collar and scratching his face and kicking him—the prisoner bolted into the room, took the knife off the drawer or table, and just <hi rend="italic">took</hi> him on the bridge of the nose, and made it bleed—the cut was not very deep—it was not a good knife—it was deeper than the skin, and about half an inch long—I could distinguish the cut from the scratches of the woman's nails—the prisoner had the knife in his right hand all the time—they bad a fight inside and outside with fists—the prisoner followed us out of the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did my wife treat you and Reardon to a glass of gin each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not state that it was a cup before the Magistrate—I said she had it in a cup and filled it into the glass—I will swear that I cannot prove that your wife said to Reardon, "I always thought you a blackguard and now you prove it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not hear it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—we had sat down is the room—she cut some bread and meat for him, and gave us a glass of gin—there was something passed about what made the prisoner strike her and run away from her in Seven Dials.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not see him kiss my wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He was in the room at the same time, I was on the stairs and could see every thing that passed. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was close to her but did not kiss her—I did not see him place his knee between hers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will swear I did not see him—he was sitting as close to her as he could, so that he could lay his hand upon her—Reardon received his cut in the room not in the street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 113.) On Saturday night, the 19th of March, about nine o'clock, I was in the Richmond-road, in the parish of St. Mary Abbot, Kensington, near the public-house—I saw the prisoner and another coming in the direction from Mr. Hutchins' potato bed, each with a sack on his head—I stopped the prisoner and felt his sack—I asked what he had got, he said potatoes—I asked where he got them, he said from Mr. Hutchins' potato heap—I took them from him and took him into custody—the other man escaped—they weighed eighty-four pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He did not see me on the premises; I bought the potatoes for fifteen pence of a man who hawked them about the street. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> He said he got them from Hutchins' potato heap, and I saw him in Hutchins' field—it was moonlight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Samuel Hutchins, who has a potato ground, about a quarter of a mile from the Richmond-road There is a large potato bed there—I have compared the potatoes found in the sack the prisoner had, with those on the heap, and am satisfied they are the same sort, and the pit had been newly opened—the potatoes are called the "long keepers" in Somerset—the seed was sent from a gentle<lb/>man, and these were the first grown from it—the pit bad evidently not been opened many hours—there were three sacks taken from it a few days before—we have lost seven or eight tons during the winter—I am quite certain they are part of the same potatoes—the prisoner had no business in the fields.</p>

On the 9th of March I sent him out with some meat—I cannot swear whether there was two shins of beef among it—there was one I know—I put a ticket of the weight on the meat—I know I lost a shin of beef by the deficiency of weight—there was 11 stone given to him, and he only delivered 10 stone 31bs.—I cannot swear to the shin of beef now product being mine—I had an excellent character with the prisoner.</p>

On the morn<lb/>ing of the 9th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Holborn, and met the prisoner with a tray of meat—he put it down near a count, took from it a shin of beef, tied it in a handkerchief, and then proceeded up Holborn—I followed, and saw him give the shin of beef to the witness Lovitt, who sells apples in the street—I followed him to my house, and charged him with the offence—he at first denied it, and afterwards said he was sorry—I asked him for the ticket of the weight of the meat—he re<lb/>fused—I gave him into custody, and the ticket was found on him at the station—the meat was 71bs. short of the weight named in the tickets, and the shin of beef made up the weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The shin of beef was for a Mr. Logsden, and was on the top of the other meat; I wanted a rest, and stopped at a court where a bar goes across; I slid the tray off my shoulder, and found the beef slipping; I tied it in my handkerchief, intending to hang it on the corner of my tray, but found I could not do it; I went on as far as Furniva-inn, and them changed my. tray from my right shoulder to my left, and placed the shin of beef between my legs; I said to the woman, "I wish you would mind this for me till I come back, I am just going round the corner." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> I saw him put the shin of beef between his legs, he seemed as if he could not tell how to get rid of it—he had come with heavier loads to my house—he was only about twenty yards from my house at the time he gave the beef to Lovitt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at the General Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there about two years—on the 1st of March he was employed in the inland office, collecting letters behind the stamper—his duty was to take the letters from the stampers' table to the sorters' table—in doing so I perceived him separating two or three letters by themselves, and place them behind a row. of letters which he had col<lb/>lected—he took the whole parcel up in his arms and conveyed them to the sorters—he took those he had put at the back part of the row with the rest—I followed him to the sorters without his observing me—I observed that he only left about half the row of the letters at the sorters' table—he kept the latter part of the row still in his hands, which contained those I had ob<lb/>served him put at the back—he carried those letters back with him to<lb/>wards the stampers' table, and on his way back I perceived him shifting some letters under his waistcoat—he put the others which he had carried back,</p>

               <p>down on the stamping table, with some others, and conveyed them down to the sorters—after he had done so I perceived him put his hand up under his waistcoat again, as he returned to the stamping table—he appeared at if he was adjusting his waistcoat—I communicated the circumstance to Mr. Hodd, a clerk in the office—(<hi rend="italic">examining three letters produced by Matthew Peck</hi>)—two of these have passed through my hands—I have marked one of these which is directed to Miss Jones—I have written "loz." on it—this is my hand-writing—it was my duty to weigh the letters—I can speak positively to this—here is another directed to Miss Terry—I recollect seeing this pass through my hands—they all bear the inland stamp of the 1st of March on them, and would arrive in due course by the mail that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the inland office, and was on duty on the 1st of March. In consequence of what Forbes said to me, I caused the prisoner to be searched by Peek, the officer, in the inspector's room-before he was searched Peek asked if he had got anything about him which he ought not to have—he said he had not—he was asked if he had any ob<lb/>jection to be searched, and said no—Peek searched his waistcoat pockets, then opened his waistcoat, and discovered two or three letters inside the waistband of his trowsers—he wore a waistcoat with sleeves, and no coat—his waistcoat was tight down—it was left up a short way and the letters thrust into the waistband of the trowsers—I do not recollect what he said on their being discovered—Peek said something to him, I do not recollected what—all three letters bore the inland stamp of the morning of the 1st of March, and the marks of the country towns they came from—it was the prisoner's duty to carry letters over the proper weight, which had not paid sufficient, to the sorter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was his duty to separate from the letters any which were to be paid for above the amount of the stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certianly not—he should carry all the "more to pay" letters to the sorters—it was his duty to carry the whole, whether there was more to pay or not, but the packets that are stamped at that table are to be carried to a different place altogether—but these are stamped with the unpaid letters and are taken to the sorters—the others are taken to another sorters table—it was his duty to carry all the letters from the stamper to the sorters, those that have the proper stamps to one table, and those that have more to pay to another sorter's table—all three of these letters had more to pay—the letters are taken by Forbes to have the stamp "More to pay"put on them.</p>

                  </hi>(police-constable H 126.) On Thursday night, the 17th of March, I was sent to watch the shop window of Mrs. Stevenson, of 143, Ratcliff-highway—I was in plain clothes—about seven o'clock I saw the four prisoners come to the window together—they separated two or three dif<lb/>ferent times, and whistled—I lost them, but they came back, and about ten minutes to eight I saw Cooper go to the window—the other three stood be<lb/>hind—he pushed the glass in and drew these handkerchiefs out—the other three remained at the window—Cooper crossed over and crossed again to Denmark-street, the same side as Mrs. Stevenson's shop—the other three kept at the window—I went after Cooper—he began to run up the street—I ran after him, and finding somebody after him he threw the handkerchiefs down in the street—they had been in company for nearly an hour together—I caught him—he said, "I did not steal them"—I said I had seen him—I brought him back to the shop with the handkerchiefs—they were identified, and he was detained—the three others were then gone—I am certain they had been together and talking together, and at the time Cooper pushed the glass in—they stood behind him dose at his back, covering him while he did it—the others might have got more things from the window when I ran after Cooper—I did not see them again until next morning, when I took Henessey at No. 1, Sugarloaf-court, Essex-street, Whitechapel, in a room where there was several girls and boys—I told him I wanted him for a robbery in the Highway—he de<lb/>wed being in the Highway—he said he was not down there—I mentioned Mrs. Stevenson's shop—he denied having been there—I took the others on the Thursday morning following, between six and seven, at No. 2, in the same court—Irons was getting up the chimney, and Gadd was in bed—I just saw Irons' feet up the chimney, and he came rolling down.</p>

A man named John Chisholm went to my residence, and by a written order he had received from the prosecutor's brother, William Gandy, who is partner with the prosecutor, obtained my harness, with as much warp through harness and reed, and on my cane-roll, as enabled him (Chisholm) to weave upwards of forty yards of silk, and at the same time he received several empty bobbins from my place, which he also returned to the wan-house; a man named Moles can prove that John Chisholm informed him, when he called upon him, that the work he was then weaving in what I had left in the loom."</p>

The prisoner was in our service about a month—I had a character with her—in consequence of suspicion I examined her box on the 25th of March—it was in the back-kitchen, unlocked—she was not present—I found in it a yard of paramatta, which is a woollen cloth, and is used to make ladies' dresses—it is my property—I have compared it with the piece from which it was taken, and it corresponds—I bare it here—when my husband came home I mentioned it to him, and he told her that he suspected she was a thief—she said it was a lie—he said how could she account for the yard of paramatta found in her box—she said it was a lie, that she had bought it at Manchester House for half-a-crown, and if I took it she should consider that I had stolen it—she was to leave that evening.</p>

I live in Lewisham-street, Westminster, and am in the employ of Mr. Reeve, a live stock dealer—he has a place in Hun<lb/>gerford-market—on Tuesday, the 8th of March, I saw the prisoner there with another boy a little bigger than himself—the other boy had a basket with two rabbits in it—the other said he was offered 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the next place, but he would not take it—the prisoner asked me whether master would buy them, whether he wanted rabbits—I said I would go and see—I brought my master up—the prisoner asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—master said he would give 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they went away, came back again, and took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—master bought them—I kept them in the hutch till next morning, and then sold the grey and white doe for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the other one died, and I have got the skin I kept it till the prosecutor came, and said it was his—it was alive then. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>—if there had been no cord, the bruise on the head would have been suffi<lb/>cient to explain the symptoms in the head—the lips were livid and the tongue swollen, which is evidence of death by strangulation or suffocation—a fall might partialy explain these symptoms—my opinion is that the child had lived—that it actually had life in the air, not merely foetal life—my opin<lb/>ion is on the presumptive evidence of the cord round its neck, that the suffo<lb/>cation was from that, but it is only presumptive having seen the cord—I cannot positively swear, but I should say certainly that death was caused by suffocation or strangulation—I do not exactly make a distinction be<lb/>tween suffocation and strangulation, for instance, the child might have been smothered at the time—not exactly in the act of being born, or the lungs would not have the appearance they had—anything getting in the throat or pat into the mouth might produce congestion on the brain—I found no<lb/>thing put in—I attribute the suffocation or strangulation to the cord—that is a doubtful opinion—it is possible the fall might have killed it, and the cord after death might have been placed round the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After a body is quite dead there will be no appearance of ecchymosis, will there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes there will, if very soon after, before the body is cold—the umbilical cord was still attached to the child, and the after-birth also—I saw the prisoner again the same evening, and again next morning—she asked if I had seen the child—I said yes—she asked if there was going to be a coroner's inquest on it—I said yes—she said, "What will my sen<lb/>tence be likely to be?"—I told her I could not tell, and that the inquest would be about three o'clock—I do not know whether it was before or after the inquest, but she told me she regretted that Mrs. Wood had re<lb/>turned to town, that she had a sovereign sent her to buy things for the child, but Mrs. Wood's returning prevented her going out for them, and the child would have been out to nurse—she said nothing about the birth of the child that I recollect—she was going on to say something more about Mrs. Wood's return, I told her she had better not say anything to me—I checked her in her conversation—on the day after the inquest she showed me two caps and a piece of flannel in her room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you speak of the child being born alive, do you mean it has actually been removed altogether from the person of the mother?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—the floating of the lungs is a certain indication of that—I mean to say, if the lungs will float in water, if we cannot compress the air out of them, that child must have been born fully—full respiration must have gone on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that an indication of any thing but the child having breathed at some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be produced by putrefaction, but there was not time for that—if it breathes once fully, and the lungs become completely distended with air, it is just as much as if it had lived for hours—that could not take place thoroughly before the child is completely removed from the mother—there are instances of a child crying in the process of parturition, but it has been found, by experiment, if a child died before the parturition was complete, the inspiration—could not be so perfect as if it was entirely detached, not so freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But would not, under those circumstances, the lungs float? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would—a person delivering herself would have considerable difficulties to contend with—the umbilical cord does not offer an impediment in the actual birth, unless it is twisted round the neck, or round any portion of the child.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In strangulation by a cord there would be what you call congestion of blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There would—there was sufficient mark on the neck to indicate that—it does not follow that there should be a considerable mark—I do not call it congestion at the neck, I said in the brain—there may be an effusion of blood, but in this case there was none, nor any extravasa<lb/>tion—she would very likely deliver herself standing, but it is impossible to say—in natural delivery the head is downward.</p>

A lodger named Paris, occupied our second-floor back-room—on the 8th of Febru<lb/>ary, which was Shrove Tuesday, the prisoner came to the house, just after one o'clock in the day, and said he saw a bill in my window, and wanted lodgings—I said I had only half a bed—he said that would do for him, as he went out early, and did not want any thing in the day; that he went out at five o'clock in the morning to where he worked on the rail-road, and must be there before six, or he should lose a quarter of a day; that he was a coach-builder on the railway—he did not say what railway—I said I must see my other lodger before he came in—he said he would be in about ten o'clock in the evening—I said I should see Paris before that, which I did—the prisoner said his father was head clerk on the railway, and his name was Nodes; and that Nodes, in New Church-street, was his uncle; that he slept</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Augustus Manning at No. 189, Sloane-street. On Thursday week the family went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I fastened up the house—I barred the door leading into the garden, bolted it top and bottom, and Placed a bell on it—there is a sliding window at the end of the passage—that was fas<lb/>tened by a screw—it has bars to it—it looks partly into the passage, and partly into the water-closet—there is an inner door plated with iron, which shuts off the water-closet—that was fastened inside by a bar and two bolts—I am quite sure that was secure—next morning, on coming down and opening the inner door, which was still fast as I had left it, I found seven</p>

               <p>holes had been bored in the panel of that door, to the iron plate, and the window wide open—the outer door was unbarred and unbolted—the glass of that window was broken, I suppose to undo the screw—it was a small pane close to the screw—a hand could then be put inside—I discovered several footmarks in the garden, of two persons, one large and one small one—I found a piece of rag inside the house, and a piece in the garden—that in the garden was bloody, but not the piece inside—there were chips of wood under where the holes had been bored—the inspector came to look at the house, and he has the chips—he took them away—he afterwards compared some boots with the marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am serjeant of the police—I was called into Mr. Manning's house the next morning—the servant accompanied me—I went about half-past nine o'clock, I found a square of glass broken outside the door in the garden, and the window put back—a man could by that means un<lb/>bolt the outer door—I found some blood on the glass, and on the inner iron bars—I found seven holes bored in the inner door—the inside was lined with sheet iron—on the next day, Saturday, I went to the prisoners' house, in Perkin's-rents—they both lodge together in the same house—I went into Wood's room first, found him in bed, and a female there, who was up—I examined Wood's hand—there were no marks of a cut on it—I then went to Draper's room, found him there, examined his hand, found a cut on the fore finger of, I think, the right, and some blood in front of his shirt, which was recently done—I took the two prisoners to the station, where they were charged with attempting to enter Mr. Manning's house, in Sloane-street, they denied all knowledge of it—I went back to Draper's room, and in the cupboard found a female's pocket with two centre-bits and a skeleton-key, and in the same cupboard I found two pick-lock keys under some glass—I went to Mr. Manning's house with wood s boots and Draper's shoes, which I saw taken off their feet—before I compared them I saw there was a mark in the heel in the mould, which Wood's boot fitted—it was a piece of loose leather, and in the mould there was a mark of a piece of loose leather—Draper's shoe was rather higher on one side than the other, and that fitted the marks in the mould—one side was rather worn down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at the parish of Ruislip, Middlesex. On Wednesday night, the 22nd of December, between one and two o'clock, I was taking my mare towards the common at Ruislip, to a rick of hay which I had there—I went down Clack-lane, and near a ditch there I caught sight of two men—I got close by them—they jumped out of the ditch, got on the bank, and struck me—they each had a stick or bludgeon about a yard long in his hand—they both struck me with the sticks on the side of the head, and both laid hold of my collar—I struggled with them—they got me into the ditch—I cried out "Murder" as loud as I could, but I was very hoarse—I had a bad cold, and could hardly speak—as I laid on my back in the ditch one of them pressed his hand very much over my nose and mouth, and my nose burst out bleeding—I told them not to hurt me, if they took my money—they rifled my pockets—one of them put his hand into my breeches and waistcoat pockets—I had in my right-hand trowsers' pocket a purse con<lb/>taining thirteen sovereigns, one half-sovereign, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and two land-tax receipts—my purse was taken—they got up, went away, and left me in the ditch lying on my back—it was a canvass purse—I have seen it since in the possession of Atkins, the constable—it was a very cloudy night, and mizzled with rain—there was a moon, but I could not see their faces to swear to them—I thought their faces were disfigured—they seemed blacked a little—I believe the prisoners are the men from what I saw of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live next door to Biggs—I have been convicted of an offence, and was away three years and a-half, till six or seven months ago—since that I have been a labourer at Harefield. On the 23rd of December I was living next door to Biggs—early that morning I heard Biggs and Holland about—it was between half-past twelve and two in the night, and after I got up I heard of the robbery of Wood-man—a few days after that I was hedging for my father, and Holland came to me—I said to him " You can lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now"—he said, "Where can I get 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—I said, "Why, you made a good job the other night you can afford to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now"—he said no, he could not, he had not got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and could not lend it to me—I kept talking to him a bit, and at last he said he would lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not to do anything for it—I thought if I borrowed the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if I could get it out of him, I should find the robbery out—I told him about the robbery, and he told me to say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040165"/>
               <p>nothing about it—that is what I was to do for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—some days after, I saw Biggs, and asked him to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—be refused at first—I told him what I knew about the transaction—he did not consent to lend me any at first but afterwards he did upon the same terms, that I should say nothing about it—he said "Don't say anything about it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

That is the truth. At the police-office I was so flurried, fearing my husband should know where I got it from, that I did not know what excuse to make, or what I said. Catherine Harley, who lives in the same house, was present when it was given me. I had not been out of the house for three days previous.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of March I went down to the bottom of the sheds—in consequence of what I heard from my companion, I went to the prisoner, and asked him his business—he would not give me any information—he got out of the cart, and went up the shed—I followed him—he came out of the shed, and began to run—he got into the cart again, and began to drive off—I hallooed to him that he was not to go till he had given me an answer—it was a dark night—I caught hold of his horse's head, and took the cart into the shed, with him in it—I called to a person to come and take hold of the cart—the prisoner slipped out of the cart, slipped on his hands and knees under the trucks, and <hi rend="italic">dodged</hi> me about—I followed him, and found him at last, lying flat on his face, pretending to be drunk, and fast asleep—I spoke to him—he made no reply, but grumbled, and asked where he was—I am sure he is the man who was in the cart, and the man I had seen <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> under the trucks—I took him into custody, and brought him towards Euston-square station—in bringing him along I noticed him attempt twice to put something from his pocket, and the last time he managed to pull a bottle of wine from his pocket, slip it down by his side, and kick at it with his foot after it was down, but he missed it—Bushby, who was walk<lb/>ing alongside, turned back and took up the bottle—the prisoner said, "I thought I kicked against something"—I distinctly saw him take it out of his pocket—I searched him at the station, and found on him a knife, and a small instrument for raising nails—no trains arrive at half-past two o'clock in the morning—the prisoner had on the same coat he has now.</p>

I am in partnership with William Bradbury, as printers, in Whitefriars—ours is the only house in London that prints "Chambers's Edinburgh Journal"—the prisoner Andrews was our apprentice, and acted as a machine-man—there are six machines in the machine-room—Andrews worked at the machine we call No. 2—there are two machines close together on the right immediately you go in at the door—when the copies of the journal are taken from the machine, they are laid down quite flat on a board by the side, on one another—they are then counted up in hundreds, and folded over once, then taken up into the ware-house to be dried, and afterwards distributed to the trade—copies are never sent out to the trade in a wet state and folded but once—they are simply folded so for the purpose of counting in hundreds—Andrews by being in the machine-room, would have the opportunity of possessing himself of a hundred numbers of wet sheets folded once—I am not aware at which ma<lb/>chine No. 528 of the journal was printed—a person named Hall worked</p>

On Friday evening, the 4th of March, the prisoner Carter came and asked me if I dealt in "Chambers's Journal"—I told him no, nothing of any consequence, I had been for the last three years conducting the business for my brother, but our business was large, and I did not enter into any other publications—he said if I did, he could supply me very largely at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I asked if they were the right copies—he said, "Yes," and went over and fetched one—I knew that the regular price was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought one over to me, which he left—I said I could not say any thing to it, I would look it over, as that was not the proper price, and the publishing day of that week was over—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade, but be would understand that was not the proper price—he said his reason for offering it was, he had dealings with a printer, that he took a certain quantity, and if he did not sell them he took them again, and that their dealings together were only in money—he said it would not be worth his while to take them unless I could promise to take 100 dozen or more—next morning, Saturday, the 5th of March, he came to me again—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade during the week—on Wednesday, the 9th, he again came over during the day—I told him that I had made inquiry among the trade, and that they would take them, provided the goods were right—I told him I supposed I might depend upon him that they were right, and I was to have the quantity named, which was 100 dozen—he said, "Yes"—he said I could have them on Wednesday if I pleased—I said Thursday morning was the publishing morning—he said I could have them on Wednesday night if I chose—about half-past ten o'clock that night he came, and brought with him these 100 copies of "Chamber's Journal" now produced—I asked him if that was all—he said, "All, to-night"—I told him I thought it was a pity, if that was all, to have mentioned it to me, because that was not sufficient to supply one publisher—he said I could have more to-morrow—he did not say how many—no arrangement was made about paying for the 100 dozen on Wednesday—I said, "You can leave them, had I better pay for them now or when you bring the remainder of the quantity stated?"—he said, "Very well, I will leave them"—after he was gone I examined the 100 copies—they were wet, and folded once, just as they come from the printers—they were not folded as I had seen them in the trade—I left them as they were till the morning—the publishers sent, and I refused to sell them—I went to a publisher in the street, made inquiry, and a com<lb/>munication was consequently made to the prosecutors—on the following morning, the witness Humphreys came to me, and I delivered to him about a dozen of the copies Carter had left with me—about one o'clock the same day (Thursday) Carter came to me again, and said, "How about Jose ' Chambers?"—I said, "I have done nothing with them, they lay here as you left them, but as you have not brought any more, I shall not think of doing any thing with them"—he said, "The party is at my house now, I will make inquiry when you can have any more"—he went away, returned in about a minute, and said I could have another hundred in the evening, that he thought that was all I could have that week, but I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040176"/>
               <p>have as many more as I liked in the following week, at the same price—I delivered that same evening to the officer the remainder of the copies Carter had left with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carter,</hi> The first time I called on you was on Thursday—I asked whether you did any thing with "Chambers's Journal"—you said "A little," but you could say nothing about them unless I showed you a sample and on the Friday I brought you a sample—you said you would ask the trade—I called on Saturday, and you said you would take 100 copies. <hi rend="italic">Wit ness.</hi> No, for 100 copies would have been of no service to me it was the large quantity you offered which made me suspect they were not stolen—I asked if I could have "Chambers's Information," also—you said you would inquire—I said one was of no use without the other, as they were both sold together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carter.</hi> I did not deal in weekly publications, and came to you for advice; I asked you whether they were about the price, and you said they were. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You asked me what they sold at, and I told you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the trade—you brought them about half-past eight o'clock on Wednesday evening—I did not examine them while you remained, or count them to see how many there were—I did not say that I had been in the habit of having twenty-six sheets to the quire, and these were but twenty-five, nor ask if that was the lowest price they would take—you said on the Thursday morning that that was the least you could sell them at, as you were allowed so little discount—they were wrapped in one of the set-off sheets—I told you that 100 was of no use to me—I bad not paid you for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If they were of no use to you why not give them me back again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were to bring me the others in the course of the day, or the fol<lb/>lowing morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief warehouseman to Messrs. Bradbury and Evans. In consequence of directions I received from Mr. Evans, I went to Mrs. M'Arthur's in Holy well-street, on Thursday, the 10th of March, somewhere between twelve and one o'clock in the morning—she showed me a parcel of the journal, No. 528—they were quite wet, apparently as if just from the machine, and were rolled up in this sheet of paper, which is one of the set-off sheets—that is, a sheet which has been through the machine several times—we never allow those sheets to go off the premises in a whole state, we always tear them up or destroy them—they are never sold—I have the custody of all the stock of this publication—it is one for which there is a considerable demand—before the weekly numbers go to the trade, they must pass through my hands—on Wednesday, the 9th of March, a portion of No. 528 had gone through my hands in sheets, to Messrs., Orr the publishers, and 8500 copies to Mr. Bone, the folder, for the purpose of being delivered by him to Mcssrs. Orr, the publishers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040177"/>
               <p>when folded—no others passed through my hands for the purpose of the trade, and no others went out of the house to my knowledge—the 8500 copies delivered to Mr. Bone were partially dried before they went—the greater portion of them had been on the lines for the purpose of drying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could they have been in the state in which those were which you found at M'Artburs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> According to the time, no—those were quite damp, as if from the machine—on Thursday evening, the 10th of March, I went with Beard and Weston the officer, to Holywell-street again, and watched there for some time; about nine o'clock I saw Andrews and another—Andrews left the other one outside in Holywell-street, and he went into Carter's shop—it is a shop-front with second-hand books, can<lb/>dles, knives, and miscellaneous things in it—the principal stock was second-hand books—there was no name over the door—a board hung at the door stating that miscellaneous property was bought, sold, or ex<lb/>changed—I followed Andrews into Carter's—I was close at his heels, and Weston was close at my heels—I found Carter in the shop with Andrews—no conversation passed between Andrews and Carter while I was present—Weston said to Carter, "Have you any Chambers's Edinburgh Journal?"—he said, "No, I have not"—Weston said, "Did you ever have any?"—he said, "No, I did not"—Weston said, "You are sure you have not?"—he said certainly, he never did, he knew nothing about it—Weston then said, "Did you ever sell any?"—he said, "No, I did not"—Weston said, "Did not you sell some to a neighbour?"—he said, "No, I did not"—Weston said, "I can assure you have," or "I can prove to you that you have"—he immediately sent me across the way to Mrs. M'Arthur's, and I brought Mrs. M'Arthur's man over with a portion of these—Weston said to the man, "Who did you purchase these of?"—the man said, "That man," nodding to Carter—Carter then said, "Oh yes, I did; oh yes, I did; but I sold them on commission"—Beard then tapped Andrews on the shoulder and said, "Andrews, what do you do here?"—he turned round and said, "Oh, I am only come here for a piece of music, Mr. Beard"—Weston then said to Carter, "Well, I shall take this young man for steal<lb/>ing the journal, and I shall take you on suspicion of receiving the same; and I will search your shop"—in searching the shop these two wrappers were found—I said to Beard, "These are ours, George"—Carter said, "Yes, they came round the journal"—as they were going along to the station, he and the policeman were talking together, and Carter said, "It was not this little one—(meaning Andrews, who had gone on before in custody of another policeman) I bought these of, but he was with him."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>wrappers are not common pieces of brown paper—they are peculiar wrap<lb/>pers, which come from Scotland with the paper—there is no mark on them, but we only have that sort of paper in the house, which comes from Scotland—I cannot say whether other places have wrappers like them.</p>

               <p>could not say till she asked her customers; she asked me if they were the right sort; I said I was not aware, I would get her one; I went and fetched one to show her; she said they were right, and what she had been in the habit of having before; nothing more passed till Saturday, when I called over and asked if she had asked her customers; she' said she had, and they were all supplied with journals for that week, but the fol<lb/>lowing week she would have some of me; on Monday I went again and asked if she bad made up her mind; she said she had, she would have some, and would let me know how many; I went over on Wednesday morning, she said she would take one hundred journals, and asked me if that was the lowest price; I said I believed it was, but I would inquire; I directly went over to the young man, who was then at my shop, to make inquiries; he said that was the lowest; I was to have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred for selling them; she gave me an order for one hundred; on Wednesday evening, about ten o'clock, the journals came wrapped in a piece of printed paper; I said, "It is late, I thought you were not coming;" he said, "The wetness of the night prevented my coming before;" I took them over to Mrs. M'Arthur; she never objected to the quantity; she asked how many there were in a quire; I said I could not tell; she counted and said there was twenty-five, which was one less than she generally had in the trade; she counted them all over; I said, "There is one hundred and seven, and the odd seven will do to make up;" she asked if she should pay me that night or next morning, or give me a note of hand for it; I said there was no occasion for that, knowing her to be a neighbour; next morning the young man called to know if I wanted any more; I went over and asked Mrs. M'Arthur; she said she should like to hare another hundred, and she would pay me when the other hundred was brought; she sent over in the afternoon to see if they had come; I said I had not seen the young man; I went to find his address, but was unable to do so, and could not procure her the other hundred; nothing more passed till the policeman came and asked if I had any "Chambers' Journals;" I said "No;" he asked if I had ever sold any; I said, "No;" he asked if I had had any; I said, "I have had some, I have not sold any, I have merely sent over the way to sell on commission;" he sent the young man over the way and fetched some over; I said there was no occasion for him to fetch them; I knew there were some there; he directly said, " What does this young man do in the shop;" I said he came to buy some music; Mr. Beard then spoke to him, and while he was doing so, Mr. White, a printer, living in the street, came into the shop; he said, "This is a bad job, especially for a neighbour; it was through me it was found out," and Mrs. M'Arthur says it was through her that it was found out; Mr. White asked the policeman if he was at liberty to speak to me; he said, "Certainly;" Mr. White asked me if I knew the party who brought the journals; I said I should do so, and if they only waited a little longer I had no doubt the party I had the others of would be there that night, but on account of our going to the station I never saw the party—as we were going to the station the policeman asked me what sort of a young man it was; I said he was taller than Andrews; he asked whether he had whiskers, and how he was dressed; I stated as well as I recollected, only seeing him once or twice; I did not say Andrews had been in the habit of coming with him; I said one evening, while the</p>

               <p>young man was in the shop, Andrews came in; he was only in the shop a few minutes, but before he left he did speak to him, and I thought by that he might know him; if it had not been for what Mrs. M'Arthur said to me, I should have had nothing to do with the journals; it was through her advice that I had anything at all to do with them.</p>

I had thirty-two yards of printed cotton on the 31st of March, which I had seen in the course of the morning, hanging inside the door, near the door—I missed it between two and three o'clock—it was brought to my shop immediately after, with the prisoner, by a young man living next door—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the service of Mr. John Frederick Archbold, of No. 17, Park-street, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westmin<lb/>ster. On Thursday, the 3rd of March, he was on the Northern Circuit—he lives and sleeps in the house when in town, and his children were there then—I went to bed that night at half-past eleven o'clock—before I went to bed I barred the shutters of the kitchen windows—the shutters are in<lb/>side the windows, looking into an area, and there are rails—the catch of the window had not been fastened that night—there are two windows looking into the area—the street-door was chained, and had two bolts and a lock, fastened—the area-door was locked—the house was all fast except the hasp of the kitchen-window looking into the area, but the window was shutdown—the housekeeper went to bed before me, and the housemaid went up with me—there was nobody up in the house—I know the prisoner he is believed to be the house-maid's brother—on the following morning, fri<lb/>day, I came down about half-past seven o'clock, and found the dining-room</p>

               <p>door open, and two bottles on the table, three wine glasses, and wine in two of them; a cork-screw, a short tobacco-pipe, and a dish with a piece of plum pudding left in it—none of those things had been in the dining-room over-night—there was nearly the whole of a plum pudding left in the larder over-night—the piece left was about as big as my hand—the street-door was found open—it had been bolted, chained, and locked over-night—I went down and found the cellar-door open—I went into the kitchen, and found the dresser-drawers open, and the things turned out on the dresser—there was a candlestick on the scullery-table, which appeared to have been used, it was so very greasy, and a candle in it had burnt down to the socket—I missed a candle from the candle-box—I found the inner shut<lb/>ter of the area had a hole bored under the bar, which would enable a per<lb/>son with a gimbelt, or anything, to lift up the bar—I saw the policeman do it easily afterwards—a person could then enter the house and go out by the street-door—the house was examined—I missed a violin and bow, an accordion, a silver mug, and two opera-glasses, also a shilling and sixpence belonging to the house-maid, Priscilla Lawrence—it was taken out of her box—this is master's violin and bow, opera-glass, accordion, silver mug, and double opera-glass—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles.</hi>)</p>

On Friday, the 4th of March, I was asked to sleep in the house—I had a bed made up in the study—I have slept there until last Friday, when Mr. Archbold returned from the circuit—I was disturbed on the night of the 9th while sleeping there, and on Sunday, the 13th, about six o'clock in the morning, I was again disturbed—I heard the policeman come and look over the rails and go away—I then heard him in Queen-square—part of the house looks into Queen-square—he came and looked over the rails, and as soon as he was gone I heard a noise in the area opposite the window—I looked out and saw the prisoner there with his hand on a pane of glass—I got out of the study windows over the rails—I saw him get over the rails—I ran after him into Dartmouth-street—he was never out of my sight till he was secured.</p>

On the 22nd of March, about twenty minutes before ten o'clock, I was going down by the side of the canal, something attracted my attention lying on the ground—it appeared to be somebody asleep—I was going with another woman to look for her husband—I then saw it was two men lying there struggling—I went close to them, and put my head down to see who it was—it was not the man I was in search of—I turned back and was much alarmed—there was a man on the top of the prosecu<lb/>tor—he got up and ran away—I cannot say who he was—I went to fetch Mr. Burton—we found Kemp very stupified—he was insensible, and bleed<lb/>ing very much in the face—he had neither jacket nor waistcoat on—his trowsers were torn at the pockets—a soldier's jacket, cap, and belt, were there—I delivered them to Burton the lock-keeper.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WALLER. I am an inspector of police. On the 24th of March, I was at the station in Tower-street, and remember the prisoner coming there with Mrs. Lewis—he charged her with having two pint pots and some pewter in her possession, and not giving a satisfactory account of it, and she said she knew nothing about it, she never saw them in her shop till the prisoner showed them to her—there was no prosecutor to substantiate the charge—I took bail for her appearance, and she was discharged—she returned to the station in about three hours, or three and a half, with Mr. Cox, her bail—nobody else that I know of—a complaint was made of her having been robbed—in consequence of what was communicated to me, I sent for the prisoner, and stated to him that the prisoner he had brought to the station came and complained she had been robbed, and I asked if he knew any thing about it—he said, "No"—I told the prisoner she had been robbed of a time-piece, a cloak, and several other little articles, but she could not say what she had lost, that her drawers were all ransacked, and the place covered with property—I asked the prisoner if he went to that house to search it—he said,"No"—I then sent for White, being the constable on the beat, and asked him in the prisoner's presence if he had seen the prisoner there—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what time he saw him there—he said, "About half-past ten o'clock—the prisoner said, "No, you did not see me there"—White said, "Yes, I-did, I gave you a light"—the prisoner strongly denied taking a light from White—I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about the time-piece and cloak, or the robbery—he said no, he knew nothing about it—White repeated his state<lb/>ment in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner said, "No, you must be mistaken, I had no light from you, and I was not there"—in the morn<lb/>ing he was in conversation with one of the sergeants—I asked him if I could assist him in any way, as there was another person with him, whether he knew him or not, if he could tell me his name, or where he lived—(meaning his informant)—he said, "No, I thought I had the name and address in my pocket, but I cannot find it"—about seven that morning I asked him to tell me the truth, and if I could assist in ap<lb/>prehending his informant I would do it—he then said his informant took the cloak out of the room, and brought it down stairs, and stated to him that he knew a person the cloak belonged to, that he would bring the Party to the station to identify it by nine that morning—he said both he and his informant went into the house together, and went up stairs—he did not say how they got in—I asked what was his reason for leaving Mrs. Lewis at the station in Moor-lane, as the charge did not come to my station before twelve, and Mrs. Lewis was taken into cus<lb/>tody about ten—he told me he was going to find the thief—on the Satur<lb/>day I attended before the Magistrate, and Mrs. Lewis was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man public-house, Muswell-hill, and have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he is a navigator or labourer. On the 10th of March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, he came to my house accompanied by Page, who is not in custody—it was about a quarter of an hour before dark—I did not see them come in—I found them in the skittle-ground, making use of very bad language and conducting themselves in a disorderly way—they did not ask for any liquor—I desired the man not to take any light in when it became dark, until these parties had gone—they came into the house, and while there, a man in my employ brought in a pewter pot bent up and destroyed—when I went into the tap-room the prisoner had got one of my tap-room tables turned bottom upwards, and himself on the top of it—I asked who of these parties had been villain enough to destroy my property in that manner—the pot had been sent into the skittle-ground with beer—they both made use of most filthy language and conducted themselves so, that I ordered them out of the house—they would not go, and I sent for a constable—I gave the prisoner and his companion in charge—they used the most filthy language, and said I might look out for myself, they would do for me; and they were taken out of the house after some difficulty—I afterwards told the constable I did not wish to give them in charge if they would go quietly away—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes they returned and went to the skittle-ground again—I told them to go away—they would not—I sent for the constable again and gave them in charge—as soon as the policeman proceeded to take them, I received a fall in some way, a blow which deprived me of my senses—I do not know where it was struck, and knew nothing more till four o'clock the next morn<lb/>ing, when I recovered—I was kept in bed three weeks, and am not quite recovered yet—I found I was injured on the top of my head—the skin was cracked very lightly.</p>

               <p>JAMES MALLETT (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 34.) I was called to Mr. Tyrrell's house on the evening of the 10th of March—there was a complaint about the prisoner and another being disorderly—I requested them to go, they said they would not, but with a great deal of difficulty I got them out—Tyrrell said he would withdraw his charge—they went away—I followed them home to their lodgings—they returned in a quarter of an hour swear<lb/>ing they would be revenged on the b y b I heard the prisoner swear</p>

               <p>he would lay wait for the b, and Page often mentioned that he would be revenged on the b he said so in the prisoner's presence—I was fearful of their threats, and went up to Tyrrell—I got there as they ar<lb/>rived at the door, and requested them to go home or they might rue the con<lb/>sequences—they said they would not, they did not care for any policeman, they would go in defiance of me, and they entered the skittle-ground—I was afterwards called in by Tyrrell—he and they had some words—he insisted on my taking them in charge for wilfully damaging his pro<lb/>perty—they made a violent resistance, and knocked me down—Tyrrell came to my assistance, they both struck him and knocked him down—he lay as dead—I saw the prisoner strike him—I did not see any weapon in his hand—he struck him somewhere in the chest, and knocked him down as if dead—somebody said the man was dead—I got up, seized the prisoner, he knocked me down, seized me by the throat, and would have strangled me by holding my throat, but assistance came—he had got me by my stock twisting my neck—we took him to the station with the assistance of Marshall.</p>

On the 18th of March I was on duty in Mr. Larking's neighbourhood; my attention was attracted by several of his men watching about the end of Irish-court, which leads to the back of his premises—I continued to watch for about half an hour—in the course of that time I saw Baker come to the end of the court and cross into the middle of High-street—he stopped for a carriage to pass, then came to the side where I stood, and stood in front of a tobacco shop—there was a strong gas light in the window of that shop, which is immediately opposite the entrance of the court—he showed him<lb/>self in front with his back to the light, and his face towards the court—I consider that was to show his person—he put his back against the window, which would enable a person in the court to see him—Boughton came out of the court in a second afterwards, carrying a butter-flat—I followed him into Petticoat-lane, which he went up, stopped him, and asked him what he had got there—he said he did not know what it was, a man had given it to him to carry to the Ship public-house, Artillery-lane, and was to give him a shilling; and as he was a poor man he was glad of the job—I had left Baker standing with his back to the light—I took Boughton into custody—I afterwards took him to Mr. Larking, the cheese-monger, in High-street, opened the flat, and it contained two hams, two Dutch cheeses, and a bladder of lard, which Mr. Larking claimed-Boughton gave the same account to Mr. Larking as to me—I found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a silver watch on him—he had said he was a poor man, glad to get anything—I took Baker into custody in High-street, next morning, as he was coming to work—I told him I had orders from his master to take him</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Larking. I came home with my horse on the 18th of March, about a quarter past six o'clock, and went into the stable—I saw Boughton come in just after me—he did not say what he came for—I put my horse up, and before I came away Baker came in—his horses were in before mine, but he came in without them—Boughton was there then—they talked to one another before I left, to the best of my knowledge—they were not strangers—Baker seemed to know him—I left them together in the stable about a quarter after seven o'clock—Boughton conversed with me about the horses.</p>

I never thought of such a thing"—I called for the police, and they walked away towards the dry arch of London-bridge—by the time I called for the police again we had arrived at the steps of London-bridge—Jones made a <hi rend="italic">bolt,</hi> and got</p>

               <p>clear from me—I had hold of her cloak at the time, and was calling for the police—I had not hold of Price—Price immediately laid hold of me—Jones got away from me, and ran up the steps of London-bridge—I got away from Price, and followed Jones—I overtook her near the top of the steps, and gave her in charge—I left her in charge, and told the policema there was another concerned in it—I went after Price, and found her standing outside the court—I laid hold of her, and about that time the other officer came up—I gave her in charge—I suspected they had dropped the purse, and found it in the kennel outside Fann-court, within a foot of where Price was standing—this is it—there was a sixpence left in it—the three sovereigns and a half were taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist Clarkson occasionally. On the 23rd of March I was at his place, and saw the prisoner come there with some brass and lead—Clarkson bought it of him—I forget what the amount was—it was weighed—Clarkson went out, and while he was gone I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "You have been shaking the dead, have you not," (I had looked at the brass on a former occasion, and saw what it was)—he said, "It is a perquisite I and my mate have, we belong to the churchyard, and we dug it up"—I afterwards saw the plate unfolded, and saw the name of "Lucy Goddard" on it—I sold that with other brass at Mr. Frost's, a large dealer, who buys it for melting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Berwick-street, St. James. On Monday, the 4th of April, the prisoner came and took a furnished room in the name of Coutts, representing herself as a married woman—a/ man came as her husband on the Sunday following—she was there alone on Friday and Saturday, as far as I know—I did not see any one else—I saw the articles stated safe in the room between seven and eight o'clock on the Friday evening, when she came—on the Thursday morning following I looked through the window and missed the carpet—the door was locked, and the prisoner had the key, and also a latch-key of the street-door—I went into the room on the Thursday morning with my wife, and missed the articles—I sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge—she said she knew nothing about them—she afterwards delivered up three duplicates to the officer, and said she intended to re<lb/>deem them—the things now produced are mine—I have never seen the caddy or picture-frames since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Star-street, Paddington. No the morning of the 5th of April I was at work at Hyde-park-corner, open ing a drain—I hung my jacket on the rails by the triumphal arch, near where I was working—I had a tobacco-box, a knife, a chisel, and two keys, in the pocket—I saw the prisoner standing by, just before a coal-wagon came by—I looked round the hind part of the coal-wagon, and saw him running away with my jacket—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief," and he dropped it—I took him, and my fellow-workman picked up the jacket, and gave it to the policeman—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Vauxhall-street, Lam<lb/>beth. On the 5th of April I was in Tothill-street, Westminster, going home, and saw the prisoner—I did not know her—she spoke to me first, and took hold of my arm—I desired her to go her way, and leave me to mine—I believe she observed a policeman, and she did leave me for a moment—after I had walked about twenty yards, she came to me again, took my arm, and asked which way I was going—I told her to leave me altogether—she did not, but took hold of my arm, and in a minute gave me a turn round the corner of a street—she directly put her fingers into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and took out 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had changed a soveregin not long before, and had counted my money before I met her—I had it in my waistcoat-pocket not ten minutes before I met her—after she had taken it I felt in my pocket, and missed it—I did not like to accuse her of robbing me, and walked about twenty yards down the street with her, expecting to find a policeman—I then asked her whether she would, or would not, give me up the money that she had taken from me—she directly got from me, and ran away—she gave me chance down two or three turnings—I was close on her the whole time—I did not lose sight of her—I caught her again by Duck-lane—she instantly called out for the assistance of a man or two—she called out "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>" and a man directly came up with a girl—directly she found the man had come up she threw the mo<lb/>ney away—the man and girl picked some of it up—the prisoner then wanted to get away from me—I 'still kept hold of her—she then caught my hand</p>

I was in company of a young man at the time—the mother was showing the child, and put it over the table. I said, "What age is it?" she said three weeks. I looked at the young man with me and said, "Three weeks old, and the mother tipsy;" she said, "Will you take it?" I took it in my arms; she said, "Come with me to the Sugar Loaf public-house." I went there with her; she and I were out together; she had the child in her arms afterwards, and when we came back the husband was gone out; she said to me, "Take hold of the child." I took it, and she never came back to me. I sat there half an hour, and said I should not stop there any longer, and I went home. I did not know what <hi rend="italic">to</hi> do with the child; she has told a great many stories, but that is the truth.</p>

Mr. Page, living in the cloisters?"—he said, "Yes, I am living with him, he has sent me to order half a ham, three or four pounds of good Cheshire cheese, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of eggs, he is going to have company to-morrow, and wishes them to be particularly good—I want to see them"—I cut him off some cheese, showed him half a ham, and asked how long he had lived with Mr. Page—he said between eight and nine months—I did not let him have those things—I should not have let him had the bacon if he had not represented that he came from the Miss Pages—I charged for it when I sent in the bill, and they would not pay it.</p>

Oh, my dear <hi rend="italic">chicken,</hi> what shall I, shall I do; I knew this would be the consequence; I wish I had staid at home and minded</p>

I am yours. What shall I do if they think your name is Davis?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, who are now at Manchester. The prisoner came to London from Bristol, the latter end of November, or the beginning of December—I was in the habit of seeing her from time to time—my son and his wife gave her a residence under their own roof, until she saw the father of the child—(she came to London with the expectation of seeing the father)—she resided with them till business was so bad they were obliged to leave London, and then the went to this room—during the time she was with my son, she behaved to the child with the greatest kindness, as far as I saw, and she was par<lb/>ticularly partial to any one that would do any little thing for it—I never saw her at Easton-street, nor since she left my sons, until yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of last witness. I saw the prisoner when she was living at my brother's, and slept with her and the child for upwards of a week—she was very kind to it—she used not to nurse it much because the doctor ordered it to lie on the floor on its back—I saw her when she was in Easton-street—I slept there from the Friday till the Monday—the child was ill—she said it was like that from three months old, that she put it out to nurse, and the people tied its arras down, and made that deformity in the arms—when I saw her in Easton-street she was very kind to it, the same as usual—she bad only been in the room two nights when I went to sleep with her.</p>

I employed the prisoner about the 10th of January, and she continued to work for me about eight or ten weeks—she came at eight o'clock in the morning, and staid till seven at night, never later, but she has frequently taken home four or five hours' work at a time, and done it at home with her own hands, I am certain, and nicely done—I never saw the child till she was taken up—she could not earn more than 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, working as hard as she could, needle-work is very badly paid for—I know that she</p>

I was at the Castle at Woodford, about three o'clock on the 2nd of March—the prisoner came in and had some beer—I saw something lying on the table like a packet of papers—I took it up, thinking it was a bit of waste-paper—one piece of it fell down—I looked at it, and it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—soon after I picked up another piece and found that to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I handed them round the room to see if any one owned them, but at that time no one did—the prisoner was in the room at the time—I should fancy he could hear me ask for the owner—there were only four persons in the room—he pulled a key from his pocket, and I observed what appeared to be another note, squeezed up in the same manner as the other two were—he said, "Has any one found anything?"—I said, "I think I have"—he said, "I have lost some money"—I said, "What have you lost?"—he said, "A 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> note"—I said, "Then, they can't be yours"—he said, "Perhaps there may be two five's, I am not positive"—I said, "Do you claim this as your property?"—he said, "I do"—and I immediately handed them to him—he was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in the Broadway, Deptford. On the 30th of March, about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning, I was in New Cross-road, in the parish of St. Paul's, Deptford—I met the three prisoners—they all three passed me, and then Merry returned, and said, "My dear, where are you going?"—I said, "I am going home"—she said, "You had better go along with me"—I said, "Be off about your busmen, I have nothing to say to you"—the prisoner Jones came behind me, and raised the tail of my coat pocket—I said,"There is nothing at all there, be off about your business"—they followed me down the road, about sixty or seventy yards—when they found I would have nothing to do with them, Merry put her hand into my left trowsers' pocket—Jones put her hand into my right-hand pocket—I had a tobacco-box in my left-hand pocket, and in my right 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at least three penny-pieces, two or three halfpence, and two farthings—I hollooed out "Police," and then the prisoner Lockett came up, and struck me over the ear, and knocked me down—it was a very severe blow, and he made an attempt at my watch—I happened to have my chain round my brace, and with pulling it he could not get my watch out of my pocket—some people were coming along, one of whom, Mr. Bond, I knew—I said, "Mr. Bond, is that you?"—he said, "What is the matter?" I said, "These people have been robbing me"—he said, "Which is it?"—I said, "All of them have tried, and two of them have robbed me"—Lockett made a kick at Bond, and I believe Bond struck him—a police<lb/>man came up, and after that I missed my tobacco-box, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the three penny-pieces and the two farthings from my two pockets—I gave them all three into the custody of the policeman—my tobacco-box was produced at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Morgan's-lane, Tooley-street, on Monday, the 27th of March, from nine o'clock at night till six o'clock next morning—I know the prosecutors' warehouses, they were all safe in the morning, when I went off duty at six o'clock—I returned again at nine o'clock the same evening—it is my habit to examine the fastenings every night, as I come on my beat—I did so to the prose<lb/>cutors' warehouse, a little after nine o'clock, and found this padlock hang<lb/>ing on the staple of the door, with the bottom upwards—it was unlocked, but hanging as if it was locked—I tried it, and found it came open—the outside iron bar was up as usual, and the lock on the staple—I looked about a little, and saw Rice, standing about twenty yards off—he walked past me, close by me, and when he had passed me, six or seven yards, he turned back again, and examined a bill that was on the door, and as he walked away from the bill, he asked me if the door was unlocked—I said, "Why?"—he said, "For nothing"—I asked him if he belonged to the premises—he said, "Oh no," and walked about eight or ten yards, and turned up against the wall, as if for a necessary purpose—when he left, I went and examined the place where he had been standing, and found it perfectly dry—he walked opposite the public-house adjoining the ware-house, and went in at the front-door—after speaking to the watchman I went back to the warehouse-door, which I had left about four minutes to call the watchman—on my return, I found the padlock had been turned up the other way, and locked in its usual way—I saw Rice again in about half-an-hour, coming down Morgan's-lane, towards the warehouse—I said something to him—I did not say it would be better or worse if he said any thing—I said I should take him to the station, on suspicion of doing something wrong—he said, "Very well," he would go along with me, which he did quietly—I asked if he had got any keys about him, he said, "No"—I said, "I dare say you have no objection to walk down to the warehouse-door," which he did, and the watchman asked him if he had any keys about him—he said "No" again—the watchman said, "If you have got the key, you had better give it up"—he said he had not got it—I took him to the station—on the road to the station I saw him try to pass something to a boy who he met—I looked to see what it was in his hand, and saw it was a key, with this wood to it, marked D 1—I took him to the station, took the key, went back to the warehouse, and found it would unlock the lock—I unlocked the door with it, took the padlock off, turned the iron bolt down, and found the door fastened inside—I could not get in—we got a crow-bar put in between the two doors, (it is a double door,) and wrenched the bolt back—it took nearly an hour to do that—when we got inside we found the prisoners Lodan and Gravestock inside, standing behind a crane—I told them to come to the station, and asked if there was any body besides them inside—they said there was not—I locked the door, took the key with me, and took them to the station—they said it was a bad job—I came back, and found four tin cans in the warehouse, hold<lb/>ing about four gallons each—two of them were full of oil—I found a great</p>

               <p>many barrels of oil in the warehouse, and the remains of a candle which had been burning—my brother constable picked it up from behind where the prisoners had been standing—I was with Berry when he examined the barrels—I found one side of one barrel was wet and the other dry, as if the oil had been running down from a spile-hole—here are two phials, containing a sample of oil, one from each of the full tin cans—and Berry has a sample from two different barrels, both of which appeared to be wet.</p>

Silva—I did not know him before he came into their service—I have known Lodan many years—he was occasionally em<lb/>ployed by master, but seldom—he knew all our warehouses very well—I do not know Gravestock—we keep candles in the counting-house—the candle which was found did not belong to us—we do not use candles in the warehouse, but oil.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a president of the Twopenny Post-office. I know the receiving-house in East-place, Lambeth—it is conducted by Mrs. Wea<lb/>therhead—I saw the prisoner there for the first time on the 1st of April—a letter posted at that office on the 12th of February, between four and five o'clock, would arrive at the office in London the same evening, and be forwarded to Kensington for delivery next morning—on the 1st of April, in consequence of directions, I went with Peek to the prisoner's mother's—we had some conversation with the mother, and while the officer was searching, the prisoner came in—I saw Peek find some property, and among other things, this box with the lid on—this purse was in it, wrap<lb/>ped up in this blue paper—the prisoner was not there when it was found—the mother and sister were—the prisoner was present when Mr. Peacock took up the purse, and said, "To whom does this purse belong?"—the prisoner said, "It is mine"—she was asked how long she had had it, and answered, about three months—"Where did you get it?" said Mr. Pea<lb/>cock—She said, "I bought it"—he said, "Where did you buy it?"—she said, "A friend gave it to me, and he bought it some where in the Strand"—I am not certain which she called her friend, he or she—on being asked who gave it to her, she said, "It is not mine, it was given to my sister"—her sister was present.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What words did she use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said to her sister, "You know it is yours"—the sister replied, "It is not mine, I know nothing about it"</p>

               <p>—the prisoner was again asked who gave it to her—she made no answer—I afterwards went to Mrs. Biggs's house with the purse, returned, and the prisoner was told the purse had been identified as one sent in a letter, and she must accompany the officer to the Post-office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a letter was put in at Lambeth between five and six o'clock, what time would it find its way to the General Post-office London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between six and seven o'clock, or probably before six—Peek, the officer, found these other purses—I was not present when one was found, but was when this other was found by Peek, with his own hand—I saw him find this one in the back room on the first floor—I was not present when this other was found—Mr. Peacock, Peek, and the women were present at the house, nobody else in that room—I do not know whe<lb/>ther there is a family living there besides Mrs. Weatherhead's—I did not see any other person—I did not see the paper box till Peek produced it—the prisoner was not present, but the sister was—I think the question was asked as to whose box it was, and either the sister or mother answered, "It belongs to us all"—the prisoner was then absent—I cannot recollect that the sister said it was her box—I will not say she did not—I do not remember hearing her say so—I understood it to be common property among the whole of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Green and Clark, wharfingers. I have known the prisoner five or six years—I employed him to help me to unload my wagon, and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and part of his victuals—I paid him with my own money—on the 26th of October, about five or six o'clock in the evening, I told him to go to Mrs. Edwards's, of King's-cross, with five sacks of flour, and to bring back the money, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or the flour—I thought he was a long while gone—at last I went to look after him—he had taken the horse and cart and five sacks of flour with him—I left him with them by Barclay's brewhoase—I saw the hone and cart about ten the same night, in the Borough-market, by itself—I did not we the prisoner again till he was in custody—I then said to him, "Good morning to you, you are quite a stranger"—I did not tell him it would be better for him if he told me any thing, or worse if he did not—he said a harness-maker down the Kent-road had persuaded him to keep the money, and that the harness maker was looking through a beer-shop win<lb/>dow at the time—he asked me if I knew the harness-maker—I said I had seen him—I had seen him the same night the prisoner went away—next morning I went to the harness-maker's with a policeman.</p>

On the 26th of October, some flour was brought to me by a young man—I cannot say it was the prisoner—it was a much younger person than generally came—I had never seen the person before—he looks better than he did then, if he is the person—he brought me a note with the flour—it was written on the back that he was to take the money back with him, and I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he wrote on the note, "Received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., John Cook"—I put it on my file, after<lb/>wards took it to Union-hall, and have since lost it—I have looked for it every where.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a velvet-weaver, and live in Straits-mouth, Green<lb/>wich. On Friday, the 4th of March, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was in a public-house near London-bridge—I had four half-sovereings in my pocket—I changed one, and put the change, which was two half-crowns and five shillings, with the other three half-sovereigns in my right-hand trowsers pocket, expecting to have to pay a few shillings on my road to Deptford—I was going by the railway but it had just closed—I spoke to the prisoner Dust, who is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> mau, or he to me, to take me—he asked me how far I was going—I said, to Greenwich, that I was going over the way, and if he would come with me I would speak to him—he fol<lb/>lowed me to the public-house, and I agreed with him to carry me to Dept<lb/>ford-cross—he went out, came in again, and asked if I had any objection to allow a young woman to ride part of the way with me—I said, "Why if it is any benefit to you I have no objection"—he went in and out seve<lb/>ral times, at last the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was ready—I got in and was very glad to find no one in it—he drove some little distance, and by a turning as I thought by St. George's church, he pulled up all at once, in the dark and took in two females—I consider it was by St. George's church, but it was dark, and I could not be on my oath as to the exact spot—St George's church is in the road, but he turned down into Kent-street—I had two coats on—I clapped them over so that nobody could get at my pocket—the women came in, sat one on each side of me, and put their hands about me—I put their bands off as well as I could, and said, "You are mistaken, I am an old man, when I was a young man-of-war's-man I might joke with you"—they forcibly dragged my clothes open—one of them <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her hand right into my trowsers, took hold of me in an indecent manner, and pulled me so hard that I was in pain, and to get her hand away I was obliged to turn to her, and while I did so the other one took every thing I had clean out of</p>

               <p>my pocket—I buttoned up as quick as I could, remained still, and took no further notice—I did not find out that my money was gone till I got out at New-cross—I then immediately put my hand into my trowsers' pocket and walked into Seabrook's public-house—my pickets were very deep, I could hardly get my hand to the bottom myself—I found all my money gone from that pocket—I had a trifle in my waistcoat-pocket—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> first—immediately on missing my money I said to the <hi rend="italic">cab-man,</hi> "I have lost three half-sovereigns"—I do not know exactly what reply he made, but he wanted to run off with his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he did not drive off—he was not on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> but on the ground—he attempted to get on the box—the women were then out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—one of them jumped in again, got out at the other door, and escaped—the other one was standing to <hi rend="italic">go</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">cab-man</hi> did not say a word to the women when he first of all let them into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> nor they to him—they got in immediately he stopped—they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> in, I could hardly see what they were, and should not have known them again—he helped them in, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> them in—I heard no agreement made where they were going, what they were to pay, or any<lb/>thing of the kind.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you were a velvet-weaver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider I am—I am also a Greenwich pensioner, and support three orphan children, besides my wife and family—I had come up to London on business that day—I had had three half-pints of beer in the morning, and 4<hi rend="italic">d,</hi> of rum and water in the afternoon—that was all I had drank until this occurred—I was not ten minutes in the public-house by London-bridge—I did not sit down there—I called for a pint of beer, as a shipmate asked me to have a glass of ale with him, but I gave it away to anybody that would drink it—I do not know the exact place where the women got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I swear I was sober at the time, and collected in every respect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the women behaved so indecently, why not call out to the cabman to stop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it was no use, for they might have got out and taken away the money altogether—I thought it better to let them be till I caught sight of somebody else—I did not know for certain that I had been robbed till I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the Rose public-house, New-cross—I went into the Rose, but was not there a minute scarcely—if the women went in I never asked them, and knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you all four go into the Rose public-house after getting out of the cab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Like enough—they were no company of mine—I do not know whether they were inside or outside the door—I was not positive I had lost my money till I got into the house—I did not give any money to either of the women in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I am certain of that—I had never seen them before they got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I might have passed them on the road and not have known them—I never had anything to say or do with them—they might have been in the same public-house where I was, but I never saw them to my knowledge—I have been married thirty-two years, and was married at Hackney church—my wife was in the Court at Greenwich when the examination was going on—I did not say then that I did not like to give any particulars about what passed with the women in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> because my wife was there—I said nothing like it—I told the Magistrate that they behaved very indecently—I did not mind my wife hearing it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dust.</hi> When we got to the Post Boy, you told me to go on further; we went on to New Cross; you asked me what the fare was—I said, "Two-and-fourpence, but I hope you will give me half-a-crown;" yon said, "Come in here, and I will pay you;" we went inside; you called for <hi rend="italic">id.</hi> worth of rum and water, and gave me half-a-crown; you kept feeling your pockets, and said, "I think I have lost my money"—I said, "If you have, you had better make it right before I go away." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You might have said so, but not as I recollect—I paid you your fare, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. over—I said, "I am robbed," and followed you to the door—you were outside the door—you did not offer to run away when the policeman came.</p>
               <p>Fraser. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were we not at the public-house, by London-bridge, eat<lb/>ing bread and cheese when you came in. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know anything about you—I did not give the cabman 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi> on the road, to pay for a pint of rum—I did not say that two was company, and three none, and say I would give you a trifle if you got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I bought a set of ra<lb/>zors at the foot of London-bridge, and gate 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—the man did not show me a piece of cloth for velvet, nor did I say I would not wear such a paltry thing, that I was a velvet-weaver, and could always <hi rend="italic">cabbage</hi> enough.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>got about them was one silver sixpence; they were willing to be searched there and then—I said, "You must all of you go with me to the station"—at the time the female prisoners got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and out again, Dust was standing at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door which they got in at—I said "You must drive to the station"—he said, "Who is going to pay me?"—I said, "Never mind about paying; you will be paid, no doubt"—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

We got into the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> we had not been in five minutes before he said, "I did not know that two of you were coming, two is company, and three none." I got out and rode with the cabman; when we got a little way he knocked at the window, and asked the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to get some<lb/>thing to drink, and to get what he liked for himself; he went and fetched half-a-pint of rum, and when we got a little further we had a quartern of gin; when we got to New Cross he pulled out 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he wanted some rum and water; he asked me if I had got a penny. I said no, I had only got a half-a-crown and a halfpenny, which I had to take home with me, and Thornton knows the same.</p>

On Friday evening, the 10th of March, about five minutes past ten o'clock, the prosecutor came up to the railway to go down by the train, but he was late, and the gates were shut—Dust was on the stand—he asked the prosecutor where he wanted to go, that he would take him as cheap as anybody—they made an agreement, and the prosecutor said, "Come over to the public-house, and we will have some<lb/>thing to drink, I have got a friend or two there"—they went in, and I stop<lb/>ped by the <hi rend="italic">cab-door</hi>—in about a quarter of an hour I saw the women come out of the public-house with the prosecutor—one of them wanted to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I said, "No, no, you had better not"—the prosecutor said, "Let her come in, she is a friend of mine"—I would not let her in, but kept my hand on the door—I did not think them proper persons to get in with him—he was intoxicated—I never saw any of them before.</p>
