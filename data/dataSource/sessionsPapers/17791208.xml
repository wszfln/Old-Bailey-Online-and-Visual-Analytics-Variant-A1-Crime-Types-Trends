Wood clapped a pistol to my breast and said he would shoot me dead if I did not give them my money; my brother was in the cart, but he was asleep, and knew nothing of the matter. They searched my pockets and asked me for my watch; I told them I had not a watch, and that I had nothing about me but a bad sixpence and sixpenny worth of half-pence; upon which they said poor fellow, then let him go; and they did not take my money.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to discover these persons? - Yes, it was a star-light night; the moon was going down but it was very light. I am sure they are the men. They went away as soon as they had searched me. I saw a watchman about a quarter of an hour afterwards at Edmonton; I described the men to the watchman, and then I went on towards London. I sold the fruit I had in my cart, and as I was returning into the country I met the two prisoners in custody of the constable, who was taking them to Mr. Townsend's; immediately as I saw them I said they were the men who had stopped me.</p>

I jumped out like between them, and wished them a good morning, and they wished me a good morning. I took a little notice of them as they passed me. The prosecutor afterwards came and told me he had been stopped by two men, and described them to me. At about four o'clock the prisoners came back again towards London; as they answered the description the prosecutor had given. I stopped them. This pistol (producing it) was found upon Wood. As we were taking them to Mr. Townsend's, Kinsey came along the road; he immediately said, these are the men that stopped me last night; I will swear to them.</p>

After I had been there half an hour, the prisoner went down; I desired him to bring up a candle; he came up again without one; he then laid hold of me in the dark, put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out what money I had, which was two shillings and sixpence. I had my clothes on, I had not undressed myself. After he had taken my money he went and fetched a candle and locked the door, drew his bayonet and swore he would have my life or I should give him my great coat and boots; he struck me, gave me three wounds upon my head, besides several bruises upon my body; the other man stood by, but said nothing.

After I went up into the room I pulled my coat off and went down into the necessary; when I returned again into the room, he said he had lost his money out of his pocket, and he accused me of taking it; I said it was a wrong thing. I did not say any thing that I would have his money and boots and things. I was much in liquor; if I had an unlawful weapon in my hand, it is more than I know of. I never had my hand in his pocket.</p>

They desired to see some muslin, which I shewed them; they said it was too high priced. They then desired to see some book muslin; I shewed them some.

             stoop down, and she seemed rather confused, upon which I looked on the counter and missed some muslin, I asked her if there was not some muslin dropped down on her side, as I was certain I missed some off the counter. They immediately said there was not any at all.</p>
               <p>There was, I suppose, a counter between you? - There was.</p>
               <p>Who told you there was none dropped? - They both said there was none dropped. As I thought there was, to give myself an opportunity to look over the muslins, I sent out for change.</p>
               <p>Had you any of your own people in the shop? - Nobody else. They offered me a guinea to change to pay for what they had bought, I rang the bell for the maid, in order to send her for change; she not being in the way a gentleman's servant who lodged in the housewent. During the time the man was gone for change, the person whom I suspected to have taken the muslin, went to the door under pretence of looking for the servant that was gone for the change and she went away; upon which I told

             that her friend was gone from the door. She said it did not signify, she perhaps might see her again, but if she did not it was not material; I said her going away confirmed me in my suspicion that she had taken the muslin. At this time the man returned with the change; I told the man, whose name is Hallet, that the other woman whom he had seen in the shop had stolen some muslin and was gone away. I did not know what to do, I was extremely intimidated. Plodrow said directly that she was very willing to surrender herself to be searched, to shew that nothing was upon her. She desired me not to be positive that I had lost the muslin, as I was in so great a flurry; but to look over them more carefully. I had taken an account of them myself but the day before; they are entirely in my charge; I lost three remnants of muslin, making in the whole fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>What is it worth a yard? - They were different prices, one at four shillings, another at five and sixpence, and the other at five shillings a yard. I sent for a constable to take charge of Plodrow; she said she did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080006"/>know where to find the other woman. Plodrow was taken before Justice Hyde, who committed her. Justice Hyde sent for me again on Thursday evening, and said he had learned where this other woman was, but that I must go and look at her to see if I knew her. I went, and as near as I can tell, from the great intimidation I was under at the time, and from the situation of the house I went to, I think that the prisoner Taylor is the person.</p>
               <p>Do you now believe it to be so, though you are not positive? - I do believe her to be the person, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>What dress had she on? - I did not remark particularly, only that they had both black cloaks; one I think had on a crape gown, but I cannot be positive to that.</p>
               <p>Plodrow. This Lady (the other prisoner) is not the person who was in the shop with me.</p>

I went along with Miss Gollop, and the Justice's clerk, to seek for the prisoner, Taylor. I told Miss Gollop we would go to the houses about St. Giles's with her, and if she saw the woman I told her not to mention it immediately for fear of any disturbance. We went into an alehouse where she saw the prisoner Taylor; she said she believed she was the woman, but she could tell better the next morning. The next morning she said she believed she was one of the women.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner belong to that ship? - Yes; as a king's officer; he is what we call a tidesman. When they had apprehended him, they came to me to know what they should do with him. I ordered them to take him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>I was an officer on board the ship. I went on shore to do my occasions. I saw two men go up the passage. I pursued them; they dropped those raisins. I took the frail on my back, and was going to deliver it at the king's warehouse when they stopped me.</p>

I gave them a few shillings; they demanded my watch. I said it was an old metal watch not worth their taking. I argued with them a great while about the indifferent value of the watch. They were resolute, and took my watch. My friend who was with me was robbed too. The postboy drove on. Soon after we were informed that a man was taken a little behind the chaise. I got out of the chaise, and saw him lying upon the ground, and several men were standing about him. I cannot swear to either of the men, my eye-sight is bad, and there was a small rain at the time, and it was a dusky night. I cannot possibly swear to the watch, because the outside case was lost; it was a watch Mrs. Ogg wore, which I borrowed to go out with; as I did not expect to be robbed, therefore I took no particular notice of it; it was a metal watch with a kind of enamelled case to it; it had to it a steel seal, with the impression of something like a Griffin upon it, and it had a striped ribband; (looks at it) I believe this is the same seal and ribband.

               <p>I am a corporal in the Oxford Blues. I was returning from London to Brentford in a stage-coach, on the evening of the robbery. Between Kew-bridge and Turnham-green the coachman said he saw two men robbing a post-chaise. Myself, and three more, who were in the coach, being told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080008"/>this, got out in order to apprehend them. The coachman showed us where they were. I did not see them stopping the chaise, but being pointed out to us we crossed the road, and seized the prisoner by the collar; he at first made a great deal of resistance; he struck at me with a drawn hanger, and cut me through the hat, not withstanding this out I secured him, and found two watches in his pocket, and upon the ground close by him I found a hanger, with which he had cut at me, and this watch which has been produced close by it, and nine shillings and sixpence in silver in his coat pocket; that metal watch was found by him without a case, and that dirty ribbon was to it, and a steel seal to it. I saw them at Mr. Drinkwaters, and the prisoner being asked how he came by these watches, said he bought them at different places which he named.</p>

               <p>I was driving this coach. When we were about one hundred yards on this side Gunnersbury-lane, I saw one man, but that man was not the prisoner, stopping a chaise. I suppose the other man was on the other side. I was a little behind at the time the chaise was stopped, but in driving up I came close to them. The fellow who stopped the chaise, who was in a smock frock, said if I did not drive along he would blow my brains out; in consequence of that threat I drove on. When I got to Gunnersbury-lane end I told the passengers, there were but two of the footpads, and I apprehended we were strong enough to take them; the passengers got out. I fastened the horses to a post, and we pursued the two men, one was in a smock frock. The prisoner, and the man in the smock frock, were the persons who stopped the chaise. The corporal ran towards the prisoner, and the prisoner struck at him. I am sure the man in the smock frock was the person who stopped the chaise, and who held the pistol to me, and threatened to blow my brains out if I did not drive on, and I am equally sure the prisoner is the man who was in company with the other person that stopped the chaise, and they seemed to come in the same direction as if they came from the post-chaise. The prisoner struck at the man with a rusty naked hanger. It was moonlight; it was a full moon, but it was rather a dull night. The prisoner being searched these watches were found upon him, and the other watch was found upon the ground, together with this hanger.</p>

               <p>I live at Brentford. I was a passenger in the coach that night; I jumped out of the coach when it stopped; I saw the footpad hold the pistol to the coachman before, swearing he would blow his brains out if he did not go on; the coachman then drove on about an hundred yards; we got out of the coach; I saw one of the men in a light coloured frock, who was the person who swore he would shoot the coachman if he did not go on, and the prisoner was in company with him, they were as near as this young man is to me (close to the witness's elbow) going along with him; when he was taken, the corporal of the Blues held him while he was searched and took the watches. We found this watch upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor (inspects the watch) I could have better sworn to the watch had it had an outside case; it had a kind of enamelled case which was particular, I could have known it by that, but I cannot swear to the inside case only, which I seldom saw, it being my wife's watch, and I seldom had it in my custody, but the seal has exactly the same impression with the seal I lost; the ribband is the same pattern, and is equally dirty with that I lost, and has the same appearance.</p>

               <p>Who was you stopped by? - Two footpads.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of their persons? - The prisoner was one, he had a sword in his hand.</p>
               <p>How was the other dressed? - In light coloured clothes. The prisoner held the sword to my breast, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any money? - Seven shillings and six pence; then he asked for my clicker, and kept pushing at me with the sword all the time.</p>
               <p>He did not wound you did he? - No.</p>
               <p>By your clicker he meant I suppose your watch? - Yes. I did him take it; he felt the watch, but could not find the string, it was put in; I puiled the watch out, and he snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>What was the number of the watch? - I do not know; it was made at Huntingdon. It has not been found.</p>
               <p>What sort of a sword was it? - (looks at the sword produced on the former trial) That is the sword.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that the very instrument? - I believe that to be the very instrument.</p>
               <p>Greenwood. That is the sword I found.</p>

On the 9th of November, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were on the leads of the house about ten minutes before I missed them, I saw them there then, that was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner go up stairs into his own room; he lodges in the house; I heard him go over the leads and then I saw him come down stairs with a bundle; I ran up stairs and saw my property was gone; I went to a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood, who told me the prisoner had left his coat there, and that when he came to fetch his coat he would give us intelligence of him; he came to the pawnbroker's about five o'clock, and was stopped. I saw the cotton stockings taken out of his pocket, and the shirt off his back, at the justice's.</p>

               <p>Knight. I was in my own room; the prisoner's room is above mine; my room door was a-jar; we can hear every foot that goes on the leads.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of October, between four and five o'clock, I believe it was, but cannot be particular to the time, I saw the prisoner go up stairs into his room as I supposed, and I heard him go upon the leads which are over my room; I saw him come down stairs very soon after, with a bundle in his apron. There was nobody else besides the prisoner went up or down; my room door was at that time between open and shut. Mrs. Knight ran up stairs and cried, Oh, Mrs. Yorke, my stockings are all gone! Having observed the prisoner came home the night before without his coat, I concluded he had pawned it at a pawnbroker's just by, where I knew he had before pawned some things; we went to the pawnbroker's, and he promised us that when the prisoner came for his coat he would let us know. Accordingly the same night he did come, and they sent for the prosecutrix and me, and I saw a pair of cotton stockings taken out of his waistcoat pocket, and the shirt taken off his back.</p>

I lost the things mentioned in the indictment last Wednesday night, the 1st of December, between the hours of eight and nine; the prisoner came into our house, and called for a pint of beer, and paid for it immediately; she staid about five minutes; when she was gone out my daughter asked me if I had taken the tea-kettle away; I said no; she then said she supposed the prisoner had taken it. I went after her immediately, and overtook her about eight or ten yards from the door. I laid hold of her shoulder and stroked her down, and to my great surprize I found, what I had not missed before, a pair of bellows hanging down before under her petticoats. I took her back to the parlour, where there was a constable, and presently delivered her of the bellows; as we were stroking her down some water ran about the floor, and we found the tea-kettle under her petticoats on one side, about half full of warm water. My daughter then said she missed a flat-iron; we searched her, and found it in one of her pockets, and a brass candlestick, but that was not mine, the rest are. I gave the constable charge of her, and he took her to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Inform the court and jury of the particulars. On the 20th of Nov. at night, near the hour of ten, the prisoner came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Was he belonging to the shop before? - No; I never saw him in the shop before.</p>
               <p>Yours is a retail grocer's shop? - Yes; the prisoner said he was an officer of the Excise.</p>
               <p>Had he any one with him? - There was a man in the shop at the time we supposed to belong to him; he came in before the prisoner, under a pretence of buying an ounce, or half an ounce, of tea. I do not know which. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said he was an Excise-officer, what did he say he came for? - He said he came to see some tea weighed, and to examine some tea.</p>

               <p>Did he show you that paper? - He showed me a paper. I asked to see it, that I might know the contents; he refused to show it me, and put it into his pocket again.</p>
               <p>So you do not know the contents of the paper? - I did not then; I have seen the paper in court since.</p>
               <p>How are you sure it is the same paper? - I am not sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>He said he came to weight some tea, what did he do then? - He laid hold of a parcel of tea, and asked if there was a permit for that tea. I told him there was, and showed it to him; he then insisted upon weighing it, and we put it in the scale and weighed it, it weighed twenty-six pounds; it was green tea. After we had weighed it, and found it agreed with the permit, and had taken it out of the scale, he examined it by the candle to see that it was green; he then put it in the scale to weigh it again; then he took out a small quantity to examine, and took out a large quantity in the other hand; we detected it in his hand afterwards; when we detected him with the tea he threw it down, some on the floor, and some in the bag, and

               <p>Who was in the shop with you? - There was my wife.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he draw a knife? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What sort of a knife was it? - A long penknife.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing when he produced the knife? - No; he kept it in his hand open; my wife, who was behind the counter, was alarmed; she was serving the man that came with him; she ran out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Did he and the other man speak to each other? - The prisoner, while he had the tea in his hand, called to him to aid and assist him in seising that tea, when he had made it disagree with the permit by taking a handful out, by which means the scale turned the other way.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance? - Yes, I did, when he was detected by my wife with the tea in his hand; I did not see it in his hand at first; when he threw the tea down, and had the knife drawn in his hand, as I said before, my wife ran out frightened, and left the till open; she went to call an opposite neighbour; the prisoner stood with the knife open in his hand, close against the counter; he looked over the counter, which I understood was to see if there was any tea behind it or not; then he clapped his hand into the till, and took some cash and a bank note.</p>
               <p>Do you know what cash he took out? - I know he took to the amount of 4 l. 10 s. by the quantity that was in the till afterwards, and from the quantity that was in it before.</p>
               <p>When had you told it before? - At nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>There was 4 l. 10 s. less than there was at nine o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know, I suppose, what species of money it was in? - Yes I do; there was in the till at nine o'clock five guineas, three half guineas, and about 1 l. 13 s. or 14 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>What was there left after the prisoner had put his hand into it? - Two guineas, two half guineas, and about 18 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Had you paid any money during that time? - No; not any at all.</p>
               <p>Then there was missing about three guineas, a half guinea, and 16 s.? - There was.</p>
               <p>That you are positive of? - That I am positive was missing; there might be some shillings more, I cannot be positive how much; there was a bank note in the till.</p>
               <p>Do you know the number of the note? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you see that in his hand? - Not particularly; I saw him put in his hand and take out as much as he conveniently could. The note was for 10 l. It was No. H 233, dated the 28th of May, 1779, payable to

As the prisoner took it away he dropped some in the till and some on the counter; then he ran out of the shop as hard as he could; the other man staid in the shop, when the prisoner went out, and stood in my way, as I suppose, that I should not go out after the prisoner. I did not think at that time that he stood purposely in my way, but that it might be done through ignorance. I followed the prisoner and endeavoured to kick up his heels; I kept in sight of him; I was not more than five or ten yards from him at the farthest distance. I took him in Grace-church-street. The shop is in Fenchurch-street. I took him after running a good chase after him. He got away from me and ran round the coaches, and wanted to get up White-hart-court, but was interrupted by some gentlemen, and I secured him. There was a constable on the spot, and he insisted upon my delivering him into his charge.</p>
               <p>Did you search him? - No; the constable insisted on my letting him go to him. I did not understand it. It was half after ten o'clock when I got home again. The constable took him to the watch-house, and a man went home with me.</p>

               <p>This was about ten o'clock at night? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You had not been out of the shop? - No.</p>

               <p>Had you been stopped by any body that afternoon with a bundle? - I brought home this parcel of tea in the afternoon, from Holborn, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you been stopped by no man in the way as you was bringing that home? - No, I was not obstructed by any body.</p>
               <p>You came home then between seven and eight o'clock, and was never out afterwards? - I do not recollect that I was.</p>
               <p>This tea was in a bag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came in he said he wanted to look at the contents of that bag? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who was left in the shop when your wife went out? - I, the prisoner, and the other man.</p>
               <p>How far was you from him when he put his hand into the till? - I was behind the scales at about four yards distance from him.</p>
               <p>He ran out of the house, and you ran after him and secured him; where was he carried to afterwards? - To the watch-house, that night, I believe.</p>
               <p>When you came back you counted up what you had lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was Saturday night, did it never occur to you or your master to go and search this man for the bank-note? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to have this perfect recollection of the note? - I had it down, I put it down that day; I had received it that day of a Mrs. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Did you give this description of it to the people at the Bank? - Yes, the number of it and the date.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper (shewing a paper to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080015"/>witness) Is that the description you gave of it, at the Bank? - Yes, it is, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. When Did you give that description? - On the Monday.</p>
               <p>That contains neither the date of it nor the name of the person to whom it was payable? - I did not understand it, for my part, they set that down for the printer to print it; we did not give the full description of it.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Davis? - Not long, not above half a year I believe.</p>
               <p>What was you before? - A grocer, I was servant to

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>You was at Mr. Davis's shop with your husband, on Saturday the 20th of November? - Yes, the prisoner came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop when he came in? - My husband and myself.</p>
               <p>No body else? - No body else but a man that came with the officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is the officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner and the other man came both in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What business did they pretend to have there? - The prisoner said he was an officer, and he demanded to take stock, the other man came with a pretence of wanting an ounce of tea, which I served him. One spoke to my husband, the other spoke to me. I was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Who spoke to you husband? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>You had no other customers in the shop before? - Before we had, but not at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you serve him with the ounce of tea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the officer say to your husband? - He demanded the weight of the bag of tea which stood in the shop; he had the tea weighed and it was weight. Then he demanded the permit, and took out a handfull of tea to prevent its being weight; upon that he said the tea was seiseable, and ordered the man that was in the shop to aid and assist him.</p>
               <p>Did he say he would seise it, or only that it was seiseable? - He said he would seise it.</p>
               <p>The man he ordered to assist him was the man that came in with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to be acquainted as they came in? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to know one another? - I cannot say that they did; I perceived rather an intimacy between them; he stood beside the other to see him weigh the tea; and though he saw he had a handful of tea that made it not weight, he never spoke of it till I did to my husband, who was on the other side of the scales.</p>
               <p>Did the other man pay for the ounce of tea which he had? - Yes, and I gave him change to take for it.</p>
               <p>When he had paid for the tea and received his change, he did not go out of the shop? - No, he stood still in the shop.</p>
               <p>When you saw the tea in the prisoner's hand you took notice of it? - Yes, and then he threw down the tea on the ground, and pulled his knife out of his pocket and opened it, and kept it open in his hand.</p>
               <p>Was it a knife that was fixed in the haft, or a clasp knife? - I cannot recollect that, I saw the knife open in his hand.</p>
               <p>What sort of a haft had it? - The haft he held in his hand, I did not see the haft.</p>
               <p>But it was a penknife you are sure? - I think it was a penknife.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said nothing, only used ill language to my husband; he called him names and said he was a flat; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080016"/>did not see him make use of the knife; it frightened me, I ran over the way to call a neighbour; when I came back the prisoner was coming out at the door.</p>

               <p>How did you employ yourselves during that time? - We served the customers between whiles.</p>
               <p>Did you do any thing else? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Who kept the key of the till? - It was not locked.</p>
               <p>You take the money out every night I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the money in the till is the sum taken that day always? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what had been taken that day? - I believe near eight pounds besides a note that was taken of a young lady that was going to the play that night; I took it of her and gave it to my husband, and he put it into the till.</p>
               <p>What is that lady's name? - Lawrence.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect the description of the note? - I cannot recollect any thing of that.</p>
               <p>You now and then receive Bank notes in the course of your business? - Sometimes, and my husband takes care of them.</p>
               <p>Does your husband keep a bill-book? - I believe he does.</p>
               <p>What time was this note received? - At about five o'clock I received it, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Did he enter it in a bill-book? - In a sort of memorandum book.</p>
               <p>You put down every thing in some book I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it put down in that book? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lawrence is an acquaintance of yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - At Burford in Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>She only left the note with you to take care of it till she came back from the play? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you had this tea which was in the bag? - It came in the evening about dusk; my husband brought it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. This tea your husband brought home about dusk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he brought it from? - From Holborn.</p>
               <p>Not from the Borough? - No.</p>
               <p>He pitched upon this bag as the first thing he wanted to weigh? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Miss Lawrence staid in town some time after this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was at your house that evening? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you ask her? - No, my husband might.</p>
               <p>As the note was only left to be taken care of, and to be returned to the lady when she came back, how came it to be entered in the book? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>How came it to be entered in Mr. Davis's book? - My husband was left in trust, and therefore he would take care of one thing as well as another.</p>

            's, a leatherseller, who is very particular with regard to the time of going to bed, seldom sitting up later than ten o'clock, I should not have concerned myself about it at that time, had he not, upon my crossing of the way to go home (Mr. Beck's house being on the contrary side to that we were both on) immediately followed me, and upon coming up to me, gave me a kind of push, as though evidently meant to insult me (he being to appearance in liquor) and accosted me with these words, he supposed I had a suspicion of his having something he should not have, and that if I had, then was an opportunity for doing my duty. Upon which I asked him what reason he had for thinking that, unless it was so, and told him, as it is a common expression, that a guilty conscience needs no accuser, and since he had thus accosted me, when I did not mean to have said any thing to him, and as I knew very well where he lived, and it was not far (Fenchurch-street) and I thought as it was not ten o'clock, that I had time to go to his home with him, which I told him I would, and as I had the authority, I would go and see what it was he had got, which after having done, by examining the said parcel, and confirming my suspicion of its being tea, I accordingly required to see the permit in order to satisfy myself that it was a legal one (goods being often conveyed with illegal ones, with regard to dates, quantity of such goods, or the proper name of the person to whom going) that is, its corresponding in weight and quality with the tea he thus had; it specifying twenty-six pounds of green, I accordingly took a little in my hand to the candle, which was standing on the counter to see the quality, which being satisfied in, I then took and put it in, after taking off the loose bag he had over it, putting it into a large pair of scales, hanging in the middle of the shop on the outside of the counter (the inside of which my business did not lead me to) when it was deficient, with paper and package included, which is usually<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080018"/>estimated at a quarter of a pound - three or four ounces - but which difference from the permit not thinking sufficient ground for seisure, I was, after having done all this, (during which time I was abused by both him, his wife, and a man who was standing on the outside of the counter, who seemed to have been a customer) coming out of the shop, when I observed, that while I had been thus engaged, his wife (who was in the shop when Lloyd and I went in) had slipped out of it to call some people from a shop over the way, nearly opposite, and which I believe is a hosier's. When I had got but a little way, I suppose about six or seven doors, I perceived this same Mr. Lloyd and these people coming after me, and although I was conscious of not having committed any crime, or with doing any thing more than I conceived to be my duty, I knew it could be with no other design than to use me ill, by collecting, as would consequently be the case, a mob about me, and which, well knowing the inveteracy of people against officers of the Revenue, I immediately attempted to prevent; when I had not got farther than to White-Hart court, Grace-church-street, they all beset me, and began by striking, and other means, to use me ill, until a peace-officer came up, one Foshart, to whom they gave me in custody, for having, as they said, robbed his till of a handful of gold, silver, and halfpence (but no mention of a Bank note at that time) by putting my hand into it, and taking them out together and indiscriminately, upon which I was, without being searched, had to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>To Lloyd. Did you know this man before? - No, I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be an Excise officer? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you meet him in the borough? - No.</p>

               <p>You said you was not at home till six or seven o'clock; your wife says you was at home at dusk? - I do not know particularly as to the hour, it was about dusk. I will explain the matter of the Bank note to your lordship more particularly, if your lordship pleases. Miss Lawrence had bought an urn of Mr. Gosling, in Fenchurch-street, and some things in Moorfields; this note was to pay for these things when they came in. I put it in the till for the purpose of paying for them; she was to have some things from our shop. I entered the bill in the book. I was to give change for it.</p>

               <p>PHINEAS BOND, Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Hudson? - I think my first knowledge of him was in the latter end of 1773, or the beginning of 1774; about that time the administration of an estate of considerable consequence fell into my hands. I sought about for a proper person to manage that estate, and to collect a considerable quantity of outstanding money due to that estate. This man was recommended to me in as warm language as ever man was recommended. I employed him a considerable time, and during the time he served me, I remarked him for his honesty, attention, and industry, and I thought he merited the character I had of him.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a barrister of the Middle Temple; the troubles of America brought me to this country, and I believe brought Hudson. I gave him letters to some of the best of my friends here to employ him when he came over.</p>

               <p>I am an American of Pennsylvania, belonging to the Attorney-General. I have known Mr. Hudson since the year 1761. I was returning from the Temple to Pennsylvania. My father wanted a number of persons to act as clerks. Mr. Hudson went over in the ship with me, and lived with my father all the time of his apprenticeship; he had a great deal of money passed through his hands; he behaved with the greatest honestly and industry; he has always borne the most unexceptionable character. I never heard any thing against him.</p>

Hudson has frequently stocked me in the course of two or three years; my clerk, who has attended him, and I, have found him a very troublesome man, and I have never wronged the revenue. One day in particular, when I was going out to dine with Mr. Dunnage, he came and said there was an increase in my stock, and he should seise. I said to my clerk I know nothing of it, whatever he had a mind to take away, I bid my clerk charge him 14 s. for the rum, and 18 s. for the brandy. I said if he took it away I should arrest him for it; I had nothing to do with the commissioners.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I beg to mention to your lordship Mr. Dunnage is a partner with the gentleman who has spoken so disrespectfully of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Dunnage. Are you partner with Mr. Hayward? - No.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - A brandy merchant in one branch, and many other branches of business.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the character of this person? - My lord, and gentlemen of this court, it is an extreme disagreeable business for me to speak in. I have been forty years in the trade, and of all the officers that have surveyed me I never had such a troublesome one as this; it is his general character.</p>

               <p>Court. It is his moral character that is in question before the court, not any squabbles between him and others? - He is frequently making increases in our stock, and taking them away, what is his motive I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does the profit of the surplus in the stock go into the pocket of the prisoner? - Part of it, and he has done many unjust things of that kind.</p>
               <p>- FINLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many officers have been turned out in your district for neglect of duty? - Several; I am general surveyor. I have known Hudson about three years; he has been an officer under my inspection.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080020"/>What has been his character since you have known him? - He has been very anxious for the good of the revenue, and to take care of the division; those that wish to carry on frauds, I believe, would wish him out of the division.</p>
               <p>And many officers have been turned out of that division for neglect? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. They were turned out for being too civil.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever any complaints against him for making increases in an improper manner? - None but what he could make out to my satisfaction.</p>
               <p>When an officer detects an encrease in the spirituous liquor branch does the profit go to the officer, or to the publick, or part to one and part to the other? - Part goes to the officer to be sure by law.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I wish to call an officer of undoubted reputation, who has made seisures at these gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot go into that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It would seem that I was a fool-hardy thief that would act thus in the face of an avowed enemy, and I flatter myself I had no need to commit this robbery; can it be conceived by any one, that knowing my accuser, knowing myself in an avowed enemy's house, where it was extremely necessary that I should be very circumspect and careful what I did, that I should be guilty of this charge. - I am sorry I cannot call evidence to the badness of Mr. Lloyd's character.</p>

               <p>What time in the day was it? - I think about six o'clock in the evening. I was in the shop, about two yards beyond the box. Mrs. Smith had come to town that afternoon, and left it in the shop on the tub. I was either with my side or back to the door, I cannot say which. I imagined I heard a noise, which occasioned me to look towards the door, and I saw a man going out of the shop with the box.</p>

               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No; I saw him run along the highway till he turned the corner of the street; then I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was brought back? - Within five minutes, I believe.</p>

               <p>Was the box ever brought back? - Yes; in a quarter of an hour after, by a woman who sells greens at the corner.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this at all? - Not to my knowledge; we sent for a constable; he was secured, and has been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you saw go out of the shop, and run away with the box, is the man that was brought back? - I cannot say that I am quite sure.</p>

               <p>Court. You cannot give that in evidence.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what the things were from seeing them in the box? - I did not see them till the prisoner was before the alderman the next day.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, as I was coming by Mr. Bowley's door, I observed the prisoner, and another man with him, looking into Mr. Bowley's shop; judging their intention by their appearance, I rather stepped by them, and turned round, when I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Bowley's shop. I saw him take up the box, containing the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>How do you know what the box contained? - I know it since by seeing them. He brought the box out of the shop. I stepped up upon the step of the door, and heard Mrs. Bowley cry out thief! he ran into the middle of the street, and came on the pavement again, and turned down Camomile-street. I pursued him, and overtook him in Camomile-street. I never lost sight of him from the time he came out of the shop till I overtook him; he dropped the box in the middle of the highway at the end of Camomile-street. I laid hold of him, and carried him back to Mr. Bowley's shop.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man? - I am very certain he is the man; he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you know what things were in the box? - The next day at the Mansion-house; they have been ever since in the custody of the constable.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Bowley. Is the prisoner the man that was brought back to your shop? - That is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Russel. Whether you brought me into the shop? - I did, and then went back to see for the things; a woman, who keeps a stall at the corner of Camomile-street, had taken the box up.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the box never opened when it was brought back to Mrs. Bowley's shop? - Not to my knowlege.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How far was you from me when you saw me drop the box? - About two yards; I was obliged to jump over the box to prevent myself falling.</p>

               <p>Did you, on the 29th of October, leave a box in the shop of Mr. Bowley? - Yes; a paper band-box tied up in a handkerchief; it contained the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I left it about three o'clock; it was tied up in a white cloth, and corded as I brought it from the stage. I was in the house at the time. I put it on a tub, or something that raised it from the ground as high as the counter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Russell. At how far distance was you when you saw me go into the shop? - Close by the shop-door; the other man, who was with the prisoner, saw me, but the prisoner did not, as his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Bowley. Did you see Mrs. Smith set down the box? - I cannot say whether Mrs. or Mr. Smith set it down; I saw it immediately after.</p>
               <p>Was it corded when you saw it? - It was.</p>

            . On the 20th of October I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I went out between five and six in the evening. I left no one but the prisoner in my apartment. I am certain the things were all there except the two handkerchiefs, when I went out, because I put my drawers to rights that day, she had taken them out of the drawer on the Monday.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay out? - About three quarters of an hour; when I returned she was gone; she had left the doors open. I lodge in the lower apartment; there is no one lodges in the house but me and an old gentleman, he was out; the prisoner had said she was ill; I thought she was gone to lie down; I went up stairs to look for her, and when I returned to my own room, I found one of my drawers open.</p>
               <p>Did you, before you went up stairs to look for her, shut the house-door when you came in? - No; I did not, I left it open.</p>
               <p>You did not see your drawers open when you first went in? - No; I did not observe that.</p>
               <p>How long was you out of the room before you returned and found the drawers open? - I suppose not more than half a minute.</p>
               <p>How many rooms in the house did you go into to look for her? - Only one, a one-pair-of-stairs room. We found her on Friday evening the 22d, in Dyot-street, in a bad house, and she had my clothes upon her; her father and mother came to my apartment, and fetched me to their house, where the prisoner was.

The prisoner came to my house on the 22d of November, and called for a pint of purl, at about a quarter after eleven in the morning; he sent me a shilling to change by my servant which I disputed. I went to him in the tap-room, and told him I thought it was not a good one; he begged the favour of me to let him leave a parcel. I told him he might; he said he would call or send for it. In the morning of the 23d I was looking into the newspaper for a particular thing I wanted to see. I saw an advertisement that answered the description of the prisoner. I immediately sent to Sir John Fielding's. I did not know how to act.</p>

I lost a gold ring last Sunday night, a little after eleven o'clock, as I was going home; the prisoner followed me; he touched the lace of my cloak, and asked me, did I want a coach? I held out my hand and said no; he catched hold of my hand and held it fast till he got my ring off my finger; I had no glove on either hand; I had hold of him, and called the watch, before the ring was quite off; it was off when the watchman came up. The watchman took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Was the ring ever found? - No, he said he was waterman to the horses.</p>

            . It was the first day of the quarter sessions at Westminster. When I came home my wife told me she had bought some of these things.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Shade. What time did the prisoner bring them? - Between ten and eleven o'clock; she said she bought them at a gentleman's house; that a lady was dead in the family, and that these things belonged to that lady. As they seemed to be one person's wear, I thought it might be so.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her who she was? - No, I had some slight knowledge of her; I had seen her with her sister, and knew her by name; she brought the things at five different times; I looked upon her to be a dealer. She said she did not bring them all at once because she had not money to pay for them. There were two or three days difference between the times. I gave her 8 l. 8 s. 6 d. for the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time question her more particularly how she came by them? - She always said the same thing; I looked upon her to be a dealer; I knew her sister to be a dealer.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that the prisoner is the person who sold you these things? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the same things you bought of her? - Yes, they have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080029"/>in my possession ever since. I told the lady there had been one apron and a petticoat sold in the course of the time.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in Court and deposed to by Miss Kirkpatrick and Miss Pointon.)</p>

               <p>Then you do not know any thing but the shifts? - Yes, I know the gown to be mine.</p>
               <p>The trunk was taken from the chaise in the Strand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was a large trunk and very heavy I believe? - No, it was not a large trunk.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner near the chaise that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not she first charged with receiving them? - Sir John ordered her to be committed for the theft; there was a part of the riding-habit found upon her, and some lace that belongs to us.</p>
               <p>Was you before the justice? - I was.</p>
               <p>You had no suspicion at that time that the prisoner stole them I believe? - I cannot say that she stole them, I did not see her near the chaise at the time. Some things were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shade. I took her up.</p>
               <p>Did she make any confession in your presence? - None.</p>

It is usual with me to go with my servants of a night, to see my horses racked up; I did so on the 16th of November, at about eight o'clock, and then went in as usual to supper; after supper I saw all the family in bed.</p>
               <p>About what time did you see all the family to bed? - About nine o'clock; I then went down into the kitchen and saw the kitchen window was fast; I went into the hall and saw the hall door fast; I went out and made water under the parlour window, and saw it was shut, but I did not go into the parlour, to see if it was fast; I locked the parlour door and went up to bed.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080030"/>Was the parlour the place where the burglary was committed? - It was; I was in my chamber when the clock struck nine; I had just got up. It is the usual way for my servants who mind the horses to get up at five o'clock; I came down about six the next morning and went into the stable to see after my horses; coming back to my house I saw the parlour window open, that was about a quarter after six, the shutters are seldom shut there is a wall round my house; it has formerly been a kind of fort; it is a sash window.</p>
               <p>Was there any screw in the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shutters were shut? - No, the shutters are seldom shut, the sash was.</p>
               <p>Was it daylight then? - No, it was not. I halloo'd immediately to

            , to know if he had been near the house; he said no; I bid him come then for I was afraid there was some body in the house.</p>
               <p>How many had you in family? - My wife, myself, two girls, two boys and a man. the housekeeper was sick. The boys are always first up. I went into the room and found the parlour door locked as I left it.</p>
               <p>You left the key in the parlour door when you went to bed? - Yes; there is a staircase in the parlour that leads into the cellar; opposite this staircase there is a light twelve inches wide and eighteen inches high, that light was pulled out of its frame and broke to pieces. I missed two tea-chests, one of them a plain one, that stood on the sideboard which had been used at seven o'clock the night before. I missed china cups and saucers, which I breakfast with every morning; they stood on the mahogany breakfast table like a sideboard, with the plain tea-chest; I had used them the morning before; and a china slop-bason. There was a clothes-press in the room; the maid said there was a table-cloth taken out of that.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing lost out of the cellar? - They had broke a hole through the wainscot into the wine cellar; I missed some Lisbon wine, and some Mountain. I went to a pawnbroker's at the end of Hounslow, where they sell china, to see if I could find my china.</p>
               <p>Did you find any china? - No; but the girl said there had been a woman there with some, and she gave me a description of the woman and her mother advised me to go on to Brentford. Just at the end of Hounslow, I saw the prisoner on the Maidenhead coach; she was mussled up, I could not see whether it was her or no.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was this? - Between eight and nine o'clock, a little after eight. The prisoner had lived a servant with me about a twelve-month before. I was on the off side of the coach, then I went on the near side, and saw it was her, and said Maria, where are you going; she made no answer. I asked the coachman where he took her up; he said at Colnbrook. I desired the coachman to stop, that I had a strong suspicion of his passenger; he was very morose and would not stop, but drove on suriously; I then rode on to Mr. Polliant, a constable, at Brentford, and got the coach stopped; the coachman would not let the constable take her off the coach till I had paid her fair, which I did, and which was one shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you search her? - The constable asked for her bundles; she said she had none. Polliant said she had; the coachman then got down and put two bundles out of the coach; as soon as I saw them I knew they were my things; there were the two tea-chests tied up in the table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Did you find the china there? - Yes. We took her to the King's Arms, and then to Mr. Drinkwater the justice.</p>
               <p>Did she own her bundles? - I cannot say that she did, I did not ask her.</p>
               <p>Did she at any time after? - I do not know that she did.</p>
               <p>Was she committed? - Yes, on suspicion of the burglary.</p>
               <p>- POLLIANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I know nothing of the matter but only taking the woman off the coach; the coachman delivered the bundles out.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner acknowledge they were her bundles? - No, not positively, I believe.</p>

I suspected the prisoner of taking things, from his pockets appearing to be loaded when he went out of the shop; upon the 8th of November he was going out about some business, his pockets being loaded I stopped him; I desired to know what he had got there; he made answer nothing but his own property; I told him if it was his own property he need not be afraid to show it me; he refused to let me see it. I got him into the counting-house; he said then if I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080032"/>promise to let him go about his business he would give me the things out of his pocket, and go away and never come near the house any more. I told him I could say nothing to that, I must see what he had in his pocket first. A customer came into the shop at the time; the prisoner desired me to go and serve the customer, and then he would pull the things out of his pocket. I went and served the customer; in the mean while I locked him into the counting-house, but he made his escape out of the counting-house window.</p>
               <p>That was on the ground floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did that window go to? - Into Bridge-street. I pursued him into Black-friars; a gentleman who stood at the door when he made his escape told me which way he was gone. I called out stop thief, and a gentleman stopped him and brought him back again. I got him into the counting-house again, and Mr. Spaughton, an officer, came in, and I gave charge of him; he searched him, and found in his pockets more than two pounds of stone blue, about six ounces of wax-taper, and some flat prunella, and three keys; one a kind of a pick-lock key, which will open the shop-door.</p>
               <p>Did you try it? - Yes; there was another key that opens the boiling-house at Windmill-hill, where we boil oil, and the other key opened his box.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to any of the articles which were found upon the prisoner being your master's property? - They are articles we cannot swear to. He was taken to Guild-hall; from some talk in court I had a suspicion that his brother in Goswell-street was concerned with him.</p>

I went to them; the shopman told me he had a suspicion of the prisoner's brother. I went to Justice Blackborough, and got a warrant to search the brother's house. When I came back, the sitting alderman was gone, and the hearing was referred to Wednesday; on coming out the prisoner desired me to be merciful to him. I said nothing to it; that was all that passed. I went the next day over the water to one

I went up stairs with him and searched the prisoner's box, there I found a pair of shoes of mine which I had in the summer, but they were rather too short for me, and a piece of a silver spoon that was my property. I had missed the shoes, but, as my house was repairing, I thought the workmen might have taken them, and therefore said nothing about them; my name is wrote in the shoes. I am sure the piece of a spoon is my property; I had sold the bowl of it some time before among some old silver.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of the things that were lost from Mr. Griffin's. - There were many of them found in my apartment by the shopman, and some people that came with him.</p>
               <p>How long have you left Mr. Griffin's service? - I left his service at the end of February, or the beginning of March last.</p>
               <p>Did you use to go there frequently after you left his service? - No; I did not. I lived fellow-servant with the prisoner. I thought him a civil, honest, just man. I thought of going into a little business; he offered to help me out. I knew that he knew better how to buy things then I did; he sent some of the things, and brought others.</p>
               <p>To Parker. Was the prisoner with you at the time you searched this woman's lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect any of the things that were found in her lodgings? - There were some brushes of my master's with my mark on them.</p>

               <p>The piece of a spoon is mine, it is marked 1 E.</p>
               <p>Are the brushes your's? - Upon my oath I believe them to be mine; I cannot swear to them, they have the maker's mark upon them, but no mark of mine; there are many things in a hamper here that were found at Gaston's that I can swear positively to, and which the prisoner confessed to.</p>
               <p>Spraughton. I am a constable. As I was going by I saw a concourse of people at Mr. Griffin's door; I went in; the shopman told me the prisoner had robbed his master, and he gave me charge of him; I searched him, and found some Prussian blue upon him, and a key that will open the shop, door, and another that will unlock the padlock of the boiling-house at Windmill-hill, Moorfields.</p>

               <p>As the house was repairing, and the workmen about, I suppose you bid your servants take care of the things? - I did bid the prisoner take care of the things to be sure, but not to lock them up in his own box, and not return them to me.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had the house been repairing? - It had been about three months, I believe; it began in July; it is not to rights yet.</p>
               <p>Did you ever enquire after the shoes, or piece of spoon, during this time? - No; the keys of my garret and cellar, and places where my goods are, are kept in the shop of a night, so that by means of the pick-lock key he could get at the other keys.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Griffin. On the 8th of November, when the prisoner was detected, I went into the counting house to see what was the matter. Parker said he wished he had a constable. The prisoner desired I would not get a constable, and begged me to intercede with his mistress for him. When he was in the Compter he sent me a note, desiring me to come to him. I went; he then said he should be glad if I would intercede with his master to be favourable to him, and he would give him all his clothes and all his money, and go into the country and amend his life. I said the best way to obtain his master's favour was to tell where he had deposited his master's effects.</p>

               <p>Do you remember fastening up the house on the night of the 25th of October? - I do not recollect fastening the house that night; I had just come out of a fit of illness, and went to bed sooner that night than some others of the family.</p>
               <p>Was you in the garret that night? - Yes, at about eight o'clock. I did not miss any thing then, every thing appeared as usual.</p>
               <p>When did you go into the garret in the morning? - About seven o'clock; there were seven or eight shelves empty; a great quantity of linen, and different sorts of handkerchiefs were taken away; there were found about 352 in the prisoner Howell's bed afterwards, there were eight tiles taken off the roof of the house; there is a space between the roof and the joists of about twenty-five inches, which is rather too flat for a man to get in, without straining himself very much; he must have squeezed through there; about the distance of a foot, then there was a hole through the lath and plaister into the garrat, big enough to let in a large man, that was the way the person must have got in; in the inside of the tiling I found two buttons, and have them now in my possession.</p>
               <p>Did you give any account of the loss to the pawnbrokers in the morning? - Yes; and in consequence of an information I went about eleven o'clock to the second or third house in Dunning's-alley, which is about twenty yards from our house. I enquired if

             lived there; I was told she did. I went up stairs, and enquired if she was within; the prisoner Howell said she was not. I said she was just come up, and I was sure she was there; he refused to let me in; I put my hand on the door, and went in; I laid hold of him by the collar, and said he was the man I wanted.</p>
               <p>Was there any body with you?</p>
               <p>Yes, Mr. Davidson's boy. We found, before the constable came, upwards of 300 handkerchiefs, on the bed and under his bed, in his room. I observed, before several persons, that I had found two buttons; there were two buttons missing from the bottom of Howell's waistcoat, and one that was left on corresponded with the two I found; that button was cut off, and delivered to the constable. (The buttons were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Court. It was seven in the morning before you went into the garret? - It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080035"/>It was light then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How high is the cieling of the garret? - Between nine and ten feet; the cieling was cut with a knife, and taken out by pieces; there was a ladder in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you go first into the room in the morning? - No; the boy, whose name is Cameron, went into the room first; I went in about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you there was any thing missing in the room? - He did not.</p>

               <p>Did he tell you the cieling was broke, and somebody had been in? - He did not; when I saw him he was not in that part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>He had been in half an hour before you? - I cannot be certain; he had been in some time before; it was not in the room where the cieling was broke that the goods were taken from, there was a door between the rooms not shut.</p>
               <p>Which of the rooms did you first go into? - Into the room the goods were taken from.</p>
               <p>Did you immediately miss the goods on going in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Which room did the apprentice go into first? - Into the room the goods were taken from.</p>
               <p>Did he take any notice of it? - He did not, as he told me when I asked him.</p>
               <p>Where is the apprentice? - He is at home.</p>
               <p>There were some ladders in the room where the hole was? - Yes, which we make use of to remove the goods from one shelf to another.</p>
               <p>How near was the hole in the cieling to the wall? - Close to the wall by the window.</p>
               <p>When you went in was there a ladder standing near that hole? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Where does the window open to? - Over a parlour sky-light of our own; it was a two-pair-of-stairs window; there was a shelf near the hole that a man's foot could reach from the hole.</p>
               <p>How high is that shelf from the floor? - About four feet.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of October I was informed by Mr. Davidson's young man that Mr. Davidson had been robbed, and lost a great number of handkerchiefs and other things. About an hour after that the prisoner Brown came to my shop, and brought two handkerchiefs pinned up, as pawnbrokers pin their handkerchiefs up, when they put them on a shelf. I bid the boy make out a duplicate, and I would give her the money. I told my boy I had a suspicion of her, and bid him keep her till I came back. I went to Mr. Davidson's; when I came back she was gone. I went to the room in Dunning's-alley, and saw the two prisoners. I knew the woman again directly; there were three hundred and odd handkerchiefs found in the room. Mr. Davidson and M'Lane claimed them immediately. Upon Mr. M'Lane saying they found two buttons I said I thought it was proper to examine him to see if there were any like them on his waistcoat. I saw there was one like them, and I desired Prosser to take it off; he did; I got a coach; as he was going into the coach I said he seemed stuffed about the breeches; he said stay till I get into the coach, and I will give you all I have, and he produced thirty-seven handkerchiefs out of his breeches, and from his coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Was there any enquiry made of the prisoners how they came by the things? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you hear either of them say any thing about them? - I think, to the best of my knowledge the man said he dealt in those things.</p>

               <p>I went up to this woman's room; she showed me these handkerchiefs, and said she had bought them; she asked me if I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080036"/>dispose of them; I said I believed I could. This man came up to the room; I let him in, and he called up Davis; they found some things in the box. I know nothing of them.</p>

I put them under the bed; he said he would come back presently; he did not come, and at about twelve o'clock I went to pawn two of them. I have no witnesses.</p>

When I was going to bed I perceived I had lost wearing apparel out of my room to the amount of 10 l. I had put them some time before into baskets to sell. I had seen them there the same day. The baskets were left. They were taken out of the one-pair-of-stairs room. The one-pair-of-stair's window was opened, and the shutter forced in and split through the middle, so that there was room enough for a man to get in; that window is about twelve feet from the ground. My drawers were broke open. The prisoners were all in my house drinking almost all day, till ten o'clock at night. Wiley, Woodmore, and Mulvey, had been at my house once or twice before. I knew them, but did not know the others.</p>
               <p>Are you sure Fetter and Steward were in their company? - Yes; they were there before I was up in the morning, and staid till ten at night; Mulvey and Fetter went out first about ten o'clock; they left Wiley and Woodmore behind.</p>
               <p>What became of Steward? - I do not know any thing of him. I cannot say whether he was in the house or not. Wiley and Woodmore staid half an hour after Mulvey and Fetter; then they went away. When I missed the things the prisoners were all gone. I fastened the doors after they went away, but had not been in the room from whence the things were taken all the evensing.</p>

               <p>I know Mulvey, Woodmore, Wiley, and Fetter. I went to Mr. Farley's about half past nine o'clock to have a pint of beer; they were all there then. I staid till a quarter past ten. When I was going away Wiley said I should stop and go along with him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080037"/>When I went out at the door Fetter was in the one-pair-of-stairs room, looking out at the window, and Wiley, Woodmore, and Mulvey, stood on the other side of the way. I went out twice; the first time to make water; at that time I saw Fetter at the window, and the others on the opposite side of the way; when I came back again into the house (I did not stay above five minutes) the prisoners had all gone out just before me; I staid behind; Wiley said I should go home with him, but did not bid me stay for him. Fetter, when he was looking out of the window, said, are they up? Wiley said, d - n your eyes! no. Fetter chucked the things out of the window; Wiley and Woodmore took them up; this was not till after the second time, when I went out to go home that this happened.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said the first time you went out? - No; Fetter stood looking out of the window, and the others stood on the other side of the way. It was a dark night. When I went first to the house three of them were sitting on the bench at the door. Fetter was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prosecutor, when you went in again, that you saw Fetter in at the window? - No; Wiley said, if the old man comes out, d - n my eyes! I will knock him on the head. I thought my life as sweet as any body's.</p>
               <p>Did he say that when you went out to make water? - No; when I went out to go home; (my uncle and aunt live about three or four hundred yards off) I ran home and told them, but they did not take any notice of it that night. I was afraid to stir out again that night. I knew Wiley and Woodmore before, but I did not know Fetter and Mulvey's name. In the morning my uncle sent for the constable, and I and the constable went down to the prosecutor's house.</p>

               <p>How old are you? - Sixteen years old. I was at Mr. Farley's house at half past nine o'clock. I went to look for Kilby. I did not find him there. I went there by appointment. The prisoners were none of them there then, neither upon the bench at the door, nor in the house; they came about five minutes afterwards,

             sworn,</p>
               <p>On the 16th of November I met two men in Crawford's Passage with two bundles.</p>
               <p>Is that the passage from Mr. Farley's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - Mulvey and Fetter. I saw them by the light of the lamp; I believe it was them, but I cannot swear it. From what I could see of them by the light of the lamp I think it was them, they both had bundles. When I came opposite Mr. Farley's window I picked up something white, Wiley laid hold of it, and cried halves, and took it from me; it was something like a clout, but what it was I cannot tell, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Mulvey. At the justice's she said she knew no more of me than the child unborn; that she could not tell them from Adam.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On a Wednesday, I think it was the 17th of November, I was sent for before I was out of bed by Mr. Hilliard, who is Kilby's uncle; I got up directly and went to Mr. Hilliard's, and then went to Mr. Farley; on being informed he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080039"/>robbed, I went up stairs to see how it had been done. I saw the glass of the casement was broke, and the inside shutter split a great length. While I was there the two lads came in to acquaint Farley about the matter, and in consequence of what they told me I got two brother officers and went after them; we took Fetter and Mulvey; we searched them, but found nothing upon them. I searched Fetter's lodgings, but did not find any thing; Mulvey refused to tell us where he lodged. In the evening I went into the Cock and Hoop at Holborn Bars, and found Wiley and Woodmore there by accident; I tied them together, and put them in a coach; I searched them but found nothing upon them; I could not find their lodging.</p>

             he answered no; (Govin is ordered to withdraw) the alderman asked him again whether she had not bought a silk gown of him, he said, no; he asked him again whether he had ever had any dealings with her, No, was his answer.</p>

               <p>Did you ask him any thing at any other time? - When the girl (the prosecutrix) was arrested, I bailed her, I thought her ill used in the affair, I thought it would be a piece of justice to bail her.</p>

               <p>Court. When did the conversation you are now going to speak of pass? - That was just after he was indicted; I was at Mr. Gabriel's when an execution came into the house on account of the nonpros; it was just after he was indicted the first time.</p>

               <p>Did he say what money he wanted back again, whether it was what she owed him before, or money she had put him to the expence of? - Money that she had put him to the experience of by putting him to his trial here.</p>
               <p>And what way did he propose to make out this charge? - He asked my advice which way was best to do.</p>
               <p>What did you advise him to? - I told him I did not understand making out such bills as that; I did not choose to do any thing in it; they both said to me at several different times, which do you think it will be best doing? - they asked me to make the bill, they said, Why we shall be too late, or shall we put it up in chalk against the door, or make it out in writing or what?</p>
               <p>What did the defendant want made out? - An account that she had such a day, such goods, and such a day, such goods; to make out an account of goods sold and delivered to her.</p>
               <p>He did not pretend at that time, did he is his wife, that any goods were really sold to Mrs. Levi? - No, they did not pretend any such thing.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080044"/>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Are you perfect in your memory now as to the time you are swearing to? - Very perfect, I did not swear to any exact time, but I know it was after Gabriel was indicted.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect exactly what that time was? - I know it was after the nonpros of the writ, that an execution came into his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the conversation that you speak of after the nonpros in the first action? - Yes, after the nonpros in the both actions.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it clearly has nothing to do with this indictment; the evidence of the witness is this, that in a conversation which he had with him, which now proves to be after a nonpros in the first action, for that is the subject of this indictment, he wanted to make out a charge against this woman for goods sold and delivered on account of an expence that he had been put to on his indictment which he says was soon after; and which was after the time of this first action. Then this indictment is for a false affidavit made before that indictment was preferred; and therefore this conversation cannot refer to that affidavit, it may refer to a subsequent affidavit.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. My Lord, this was a conversation that had passed between the prisoner and this man, after the indictment for perjury was preferred, he knowing what he had sworn was false, was preparing that defence to meet that accusation.</p>
               <p>Court. This would be the very reverse of a defence to that indictment because his defence there was that he never had sold her any thing.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. He applied to this witness to make out a Bill by way of proving that there did exist such an account, and therefore he wanted this man to prepare that kind of defence for him.</p>

               <p>Court. This was clearly after the trial of the indictment, for it was for the expence he had been put to upon his trial.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was not this after the indictment for the perjury? - It was.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. There was first of all an indictment against this man for stealing those goods.</p>
               <p>Court. What indictment do you speak of? - The indictment that was found against him for the perjury.</p>
               <p>Court. That is quite a different thing, now you must fix the time when it was.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. He now swears it was after the indictment for the perjury, and that Gabriel and his wife advised with him how to make out a bill, in truth, they had actually sworn to the debt long before that.</p>
               <p>Court. I see that, but this evidence is certainly admissible. Now endeavour to fix as near as you can how long ago it was.</p>
               <p>It was the very session after the nonpros came, I cannot be upon my oath as to the exact time when it was.</p>
               <p>Was it a twelvemonth ago? - No.</p>
               <p>A month ago? - I look upon it according to the best of my memory, it was about three or four months ago, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Court. Which are you most inclined to believe, that it was three or four? - I cannot be positive in the affair, I know it was the session after the nonpros; that I am clear in.</p>
               <p>Was it in the summer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of the summer? - It was somewhere about August.</p>
               <p>Court. Fix as near as you can the time when you think this conversation passed? - I cannot fix it better than this, I was in the house when an execution came for the nonpros; the attorney came in and said, I have an execution, and if you do not pay the money I will bring officers into the house.</p>
               <p>How long after that happened was it? - About a month.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was as much as three weeks after the judgement of nonpros? - I cannot say whether three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks; I think it was there away.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after they threatened to take an execution out against him? - I cannot recollect the days nor weeks, I think to the best of my recollection it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080045"/>four or five weeks, or three weeks. I know it was the very session afterwards, because the attorney desired him to settle it with this Cook or he would be indicted; he took no notice of it, and therefore the next session, Gabriel was indicted.</p>
               <p>Defendant. When he says that nonpros came home I was cast at Guildhall, and was confined in prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did this conversation pass? - After he came out of prison at his own house.</p>
               <p>Court. What had he been in prison for? - About striking the constables, he was confined for three months.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. Do you know any thing of a Mr. Bowers an attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect waiting upon him at any time relative to Gabriel's business? - Yes, I was, along with Gabriel.</p>
               <p>What did you tell Mr. Bowers; - Mrs. Gabriel told me that Mr. Bowers had sent her a line that they were going to file common bail; Mrs. Gabriel said, this woman is going to Holland.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, what you said to Mr. Bowers? - The very words which Mrs. Gabriel told me, I should tell Mr. Bowers, that I said -</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. What did you say to Bowers? - The words Mrs. Gabriel told me, that this woman would go abroad, and if she was put upon common bail, she should loose all her money.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Bowers that he need not proceed in that second action; that it would be of no kind of use for him to do it? - Those were the words I said to Mr. Bowers as I said before.</p>
               <p>Then you deny telling Mr. Bowers to discontinue the action? - I cannot recollect that I said any thing about having him discontinue the action, though I know I went afterwards to Mr. Bowers and asked him the reason why he had superseded it; I said I understood that this woman was going away and that it would be of no service to go on.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect making any application to Gabriel for money at any time? - I never did make any application to him.</p>
               <p>That you deny? - I do deny that.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your being in custody at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not a messenger sent to him then? - I was bail for Mr. Cavernor; I was taken in execution; Mrs. Cavernor desired me to send to Gabriel, that she would give

             a pledge, to send as much money as I was taken in execution for.</p>
               <p>Did not you send to him for money? - Not for myself, it was for Mrs. Cavernor.</p>
               <p>Gabriel did not send you that money? - I never had any answer, because Mrs. Cavernor came to town and paid it herself.</p>
               <p>Did you send any threats to Gabriel, that if he did not send you that money, of something you would do? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect sending word that if Gabriel did not send you the fifteen guineas you would make it four for him? - I beg your pardon, you are mistaken.</p>
               <p>Court. The money you sent for was for a Mr. Cavernor? - Yes, I was bail for him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to send for that money for him? - Because I was taken in execution for him, being his bail.</p>
               <p>Court. The money was to discharge you out of execution was it not? - Yes, but it was for him, because Cavernor would give him a security for it.</p>
               <p>Court. And it was refused? - He never sent any answer.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. And you deny making use of any threats respecting the defendant? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell Mr. Bowers that it was hard this woman should be put upon common bail, and so on, when Mrs. Gabriel was there herself? - Because she desired me.</p>
               <p>Court. Though she was present herself? - Yes, because she thought she could not speak it plain and proper to Mr. Bowers, as she cannot talk English so well.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she desire you in the presence of Mr. Bowers, or had she told you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080046"/>before to say it? - I went along with her at her request to Mr. Bowers.</p>
               <p>Was this after they had desired you to make out this false bill? - No, it was before.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. Gabriel, before you went to Bowers, did say this woman owed her some money? - She did not say she owed her money, but that she was under an arrest.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not she say it was very hard she should loose all her money if Mrs. Levi went to Holland? - She meant the expences that would attend a trial; she would not let the attorney go on with further expence upon that account.</p>

               <p>Court. For what did he offer you the guinea? - To swear that I saw him sell some muslin to this Mrs. Levi.</p>
               <p>Court. You refused that offer? - I would not take 500 l. to swear false.</p>

               <p>It is pretty remarkable that Gabriel, who was no acquaintance of yours should make such an offer? - His acquaintance brought me there, then they made me this offer; I said I would not forswear myself for a thousand pounds, nor all the money in the world. His friend took me there. I asked in what case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080047"/>I should earn this guinea; I went there to hear.</p>

               <p>Can you tell the month that you took this bill down from the wall? - It is not a year and an half ago. I know it was much about that month; this affair you asked me about before happened about last October was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>What have you to bring it back to your recollection that you took it down on the 12th of last October? - It was just after we came back from the country; as he had been at a great loss in the affair of Mr. Kitchen, he wanted to recover money due to him.</p>
               <p>You was in custody just after you came back? - I was in custody for my foolishness. I had sufficient bail there, but went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080049"/>to drink with my friends. I return 2000 l. a year, and am a man of property.</p>
               <p>Yes; I know you swear that often in the King's Bench? - I never justified bail in my life in that court. I bailed this affair of Barew and Gabriel because I knew it was a spiteful affair.</p>
               <p>So Gabriel asked you, a man of property, that returns 2000 l. a year, to come to his house and take this down? - I keep his Excise-book, as he cannot write or read.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the other books? - They keep no other books; it is all upon the wall; they do not do any great deal of business.</p>
               <p>She cannot write can she? - Yes, in Dutch; I took it all off by our little almanacks.</p>
               <p>What kind of wall is this; a white plaister wall? - No; it is not a plaister wall; it is much about the colour of the wainscoting of this court. There is chalk there.</p>
               <p>Counsel. No doubt of that; was it the whole side of the room that was chalked? - A little more than the size of that book, (about twelve inches by six) may be not more than that.</p>
               <p>And the articles were at full length, just as you have taken them down here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you took it down exactly as it was upon the wall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you wrote the debts down from the chalking upon the wall, fairly as it is here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have got a copy of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not keep the copy? - No; I made it, and gave it Mrs. Gabriel.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that it is the exact copy? - Yes; because I have it in my pocket now, you may see here that it is not a fresh made one.</p>
               <p>You have kept one copy? - No; I did not keep it. Mrs. Gabriel gave it me now upon the trial; it was given to me to prove the original.</p>
