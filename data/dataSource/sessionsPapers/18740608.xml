                  </hi>. I am an out-door officer of Customs, at the Red Lion and Three Cranes, bonded wharf—on Thursday morning, 14th May, about 7.45, I saw a man coming down Three Cranes Lane, which leads from Thames Street to the wharf—he had a cask on his back or left shoulder, it appeared like a sherry cask—he laid it down by the vault door, and left—I did not ascertain whether there was anything in the cask, I should imagine from the way in which he carried it, that it was empty—the proper hours for opening the bonded warehouse is, 8 o'clock in the summer time; that is the time we usually open at Red Lion Wharf, there being a great number of locks to take off, we generally start before 8 o'clock, so as to get done by 8 o'clock—the place where the cask was put down, is called the Bridge Vaults—there are two storeys to those vaults, the base<lb/>ment and the first floor, the Crown has one lock on the door and the Customs another—I believe wine was, stored in the basement, inside a kind of cage—and on the first floor there were two compartments, one containing wine and the other spirits, there is an iron door separating them, with a Crown lock and a wharfingers lock on it; there is a door leading into another compart<lb/>jment where there is a large hole and crane for the delivery of goods—I saw Mr. George in the lane at the time the man brought the cask down—did not notice whether he spoke to the man, I was some distance off—George asked me if I would unlock the door against which the cask was standing—I did so, and he unlocked the Company's lock, and put the cask inside—I may have passed the remark "a racking operation I suppose," and he replied, "Yes"—I don't know whether he said it was a racking operation or whether I did—he then requested me to take the lock off the iron door up stairs—I did so, and left him there—about 4 o'clock that same afternoon, I saw George again by the entrance to the Three Cranes Vaults, on the other side of the lane—he asked me what time I was coming the fol<lb/>lowing morning—I said at 6 o'clock—the builders were at work there at that time, and they commenced work at 6 o'clock, and it was necessary for me to be there to attend to the locks—George said he should be there early, about 6.30 o'clock—I have been on duty at this wharf, two years—I have never known George come there before at 6.30, not round that side, his usual time was shortly after 8 o'clock—next morning, the 15th, I saw George shortly after 7.30, he came into my office and asked me to take the lock off the wine floor, so that he could get in the Bridge Wine Vaults; he said that he had reported to Mr. Brown that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080014"/>
               <p>found a cask, and he really had not looked for it the evening before, and he wanted to get in as soon as he could before Mr. Brown came round, so that he should not be found out in a lie—I did not open the lock at that time, I did when the wharfinger's-constable came, about 7.45, and George went inside—he then asked me to open the door of the brandy vaults, the iron door on the first floor; I did so, and he went inside, I left him there—I afterwards asked him if he had found the cask he was looking for—he said the first cask that he had got his eye upon—at noon that same day Wiggins came to my office—Mr. Cockerell, another locker, was present—Wiggins wanted a lock taken off the spirit place—Cockerell went with him to unlock it—about four o'clock that afternoon I examined the the spirit floor with a lantern—I began at this time to have a suspicion with regard to the cask that it was not right—on examination I found nothing in the shape of a cask in the spirit place—I locked the iron doors, and went into the wine place, and there found it stowed among the tier of wines—I called Cockerell, and pointed it out to him—we ascertained by smell that the cask contained brandy, and was apparently full—I put my initials on it—on Saturday the 16th I reported to Mr. Hughes, the Surveyor of Customs, and after about 1 o'clock, I kept a watch from the warehouse opposite the vaults for half or three-quarters of an hour, I then saw George come to the door leading to the vaults, the same door that the empty cask went in—he took the company's lock off and stood by the side of the door—I then lost sight of him for a few minutes—I then saw Wiggins go in at that door with Pechell, one of the labourers—I then saw a van drive down and George standing by the tail of the van, apparently speaking to Wedge, the driver—the van then went lower down the lane and came round under the loop-hole—Wedge went on to the floor, and came down and said to George that the lock was on—George said "Go for the locker"—Wiggins left, and came back again with Cockerell—they went in at the door—about a minute or two afterwards I saw Wiggins rolling the cask along to the loop<lb/>hole under the crane, and Pechell with him, the hooks were then hooked on to it, and then it was lowered into the van—George was standing by the van at the time—I could not catch the words that passed, but apparently he was hurrying them along just as he would on an ordinary occasion—he apparently spoke to the men at the loop-hole—I had given Cockerell instructions to call, the surveyor when he took the lock off—I went down into the lane, the van was just about starting—I stopped it, and spoke to Wedge, he produced this paper to me—it is not usual to remove brandy without an order from the Customs—Mr. Hughes, the surveyor, was then present—I seized the cask—Mr. Major was sent for, the cask was examined, and was found to contain brandy—someone, Mr. Brown, I think, asked me what it was all about—I told him to ask Mr. George, he knew all about it, he had just delivered it—I then gave George into custody for the illegal delivery without payment of duty—I told Wiggins that I gave him in custody for assisting in the illegal delivery of a cask of brandy; and Pechell being there, I said "And you too"—Pechell said "I am only a labourer act<lb/>ing under orders"—I don't think Wiggins made any reply, but wanted to go and get his coat, he said to Pechell "Don't go"—the four were taken to the station, and the cask to the Queen's warehouse, and was pointed out to Darby.</p>

I think I can identify this brandy, I think it is a mixture of brandies—We have no such brandy in any one cask, but we have in five or six which have been compared by the Customs—we found deficiencies in several casks that would not arise from guaging or sampling, we did not know the extent of the deficiencies till the Customs went through the stock.</p>

I am Registrar of Marriages for the district of Islington—I produce a notice signed by the prisoner in my presence and attested by me—I received the information from the prisoner, who said that the marriage was to be solemnized by license. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st April, giving notice to the Registrar that a marriage was intended to be held by license within three months, between the defendant, W. S. Midwinter, bachelor, aged twenty-six, and Laura Tomlin, spinster, of 5, Campbell Terrace, aged seventeen years; and it stated:</hi>" I hereby solemnly declare that I believe there is no impediment or hindrance of kindred or alliance or other lawful hindrance to the said marriage; and I further declare that the consent of Emma Tomlin, whose consent to this marriage is required by law, has been duly given and obtained thereto.") I posted that notice to the Superintendent Registrar, and on that a license to marry would issue—this is the license (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—an appointment was made for the 23rd—I went to the Superintendent Registrar's office, and the defendant did not attend, but he came to my office that day and explained that the lady was ill, and the wedding could not take place—he asked me how long the notice would run; I told him three months, and he went away—I saw him again on 23rd July, when he gave me a fresh notice, which was filled up by my deputy in my presence, and the prisoner read it over and signed it, and said that he wished the marriage to take place two days afterwards, on the 25th—I sent off to the Superintendent Registrar, and was there on the 25th; the young lady was there, and the marriage was solemnised by me—this is the register (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is the original entry of the marriage, filled up by me, and signed by the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This certified the marriage of the prisoner and Laura Tomlin, on 25th July</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">and was signed by the parties in the presence of Catherine Hicks and Jane Goodwin.</hi>) Catherine Hicks is the daughter of the Registrar, and Jane Goodwin is his servant—they brought no witnesses with them—it is signed by me and by the Superintendent—a printed caution relating to marriages is hung up in the office—I saw the prisoner write on three occasions—these two letters, dated 7th August and 28th September, 1873, are in his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took the letter out of my pocket and said "Laura, here is a letter, shall I open it or give it to the trustees?—she said "Open it after dinner," and I opened it, and she read it over my shoulder—I gave it to the trustees—(<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "August 7th, 1873. My dear Mrs. Tomlin, I cannot help writing to thank you for telling Laura you would do all in your power to further our wishes. I think it extremely kind of you, and I for one shall never forget it. With regard to my position I can explain it both to you and Mr. Winn's satisfaction. I have not asked to marry Laura, and I must say that I consider all this fuss premature, for as you know we are both young and can afford to wait, but I can explain all this better when I see you. Again thanking you for your kindness, believe me, yours faithfully, W. J. Midwinter.") <hi rend="italic">The second letter was dated 28th September</hi>, 1873. <hi rend="italic">It commenced</hi> "My darling wife," <hi rend="italic">and was signed</hi> "Your darling and devoted husband, Walter." <hi rend="italic">It stated</hi> "Darling, why do you blame me for marrying you? when I had a chance, could I help it? Perhaps it would have been better to have waited, but I did not think so then, neither do I now, and I am sorry that you should think so"—"I do not think, darling, that you will have to wait until you are twenty-one. I feel certain I shall be able to succeed in obtaining your guardians' consent before that, unless they are opposed in every way, &amp; co. If you show that you really care for me they will give in"</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. You knew that the defendant had been intimate with your family for years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my sister would not allow us to have any peace whatever, she was very much attached to the defendant—some of the family thought it might end in a marriage soon—I opened the letter, but it was a letter from a young man who had permission to correspond with her; we had a meeting and discussed the question of the courtship; mamma wanted to know where she had been all day, we had had no idea there was anything of the sort going on—the intimacy between them ended in their falling in love, and wanting to get married, and mamma did not like it—having no father, and being much older than she is, I felt deeply interested in her.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 31st April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and professed to give a history of the transaction; it stated that after leaving the home the prisoner told him (Alexander) that she had left her baby with a woman, as she had previously arranged; but that three weeks after she said she had left it upon a step in the Hampstead Road—that from motives of compassion he had abstained from mentioning it, but as she now persisted in accusing him of having murdered the child, he was determined to have the whole matter settled; and as it was in the hands of Kelly, the detective, he should advise her to get out of the way for a long lime to come.</hi>)—Mrs. Young was my landlady in Wood Street—I saw Clifford the next morning after the row with Alexander—I went to her apartments at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Pierpoint terrace—I first sent Bertha Colvin to ask her to come over to the public-house, where I was—she did not come; and I and Colvin went to her—I asked her what she had done with my baby—she said that was her business—I said "If you will tell me where it is I will bother you no further"—and Colvin said "I should think you are sorry you spoke; you spoke out of your turn"—Clifford again said that was her business—we tnen left—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shawl my baby was wrapped in when she was taken from the hospital, which I have seen both the prisoners wearing; but it has been altered since—I saw it round the prisoner Clifford's shoulders' that very same night about an hour and a half after I had parted with my child when she came home—I did not see it again after that till the last cold weather, about four or five months ago, because it was pledged—I then saw it around Alexander's shoulders at the Victoria public-house, Kings Cross—that was before the row in Upper Street—we had some rows before that, but nothing to speak of—Clifford told me that the shawl was pledged the morning after I saw it round her shoulders, the morning after I came home from my confinement; they said they were short of money—this is the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Clifford took the child away this linsey was wrapped round its body and this shawl was also wrapped round it and within an hour and a half of my return to Sermon Lane I saw the female prisoner wearing that same shawl—I wore it before I went to the hospital—it is Clifford's shawl—she lent it to me to wear from time to time before I went to the Home to be confined—I know a Mrs. Field—I did not ask Clifford to lend me the shawl before I went to the Home in order that Mrs. Field might not detect that I was in the family way—I asked her to lend it me to keep me warm—it was not because I had not one of my own, I had one of my own, I did not wear it because it was of too bright a color—that was my only reason—I believed the story they told me that night that my child had been put out to nurse—I asked where it had gone to—they said it was all right; that was all I asked about it that night—I made no remark about the shawl—it was about three or four months after that I heard the child was twenty miles in the country—I did not ask where it was till then—I had often asked them where it was, I used to ask them every time I paid the money and that was every week and they always told me it was all right and well cared for—I did not understand you when I said I did not ask for three or four months—their answer did not quite satisfy me—I asked for the address where the child was, they said if they gave the address it would be making them out story tellers—that conversation did not take place at the time they said it was twenty miles off, it was before that—it did not satisfy me—I did not ask them any further questions upon that, I asked them each week where the child was—I asked them who took it into the country, they said the woman they had left it with—they did not say where they had left it with the woman—I did not ask them—I did not ask whe<lb/>ther Clifford had taken it down into the country that night to the woman—I asked where the woman lived, not that same night I did not, I asked them the night they said it was twenty miles away—I asked the name of the place—they said it was only about twenty miles away—they said the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay their fare; I believed that to take us three twenty miles into the country—on the night of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Islington with Alexander, he did not to my knowledge make any answer to what I said—he did not call a policeman, to my knowledge—I said before the Magistrate "I don't know what answer he made, I was so excited, I repeated it several times and he call<lb/>ed for a policeman"—he did call for a policeman—I don't know whether the policeman came, I was dragged away—I did see a policeman but I don't know whether they were coming for me or not—I saw two sergeants coming down the street—I did not see whether he spoke to them or not—I could see that they were police sergeants by the stripes on their arms—I had not an opportunity of seeing whether he spoke to them or not, for I saw them coming down the street before I had any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him at all—I heard that he went to the station with them—it is correct that I went to Clifford's apartment the next evening—there is no mistake about that—it was be<lb/>tween ten and twelve—it was not the same night—I said before the Magis<lb/>trate" the night I called out to Alexander in the street I went to No. 5.

I 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go in—it was all composed of my own money—I entered in the name of Jessie Smart—I had not said anything to Clifford before I went to the Home about my fear that the child would suffer from the same disorder that I had while I was in the family-way, not that I remember—I think I did say so—I had already had a child named Lilly—that child was not suffering from scrofula—that was the child that the trial was about—it was born in June, 1871, after the trial—it was affiicted with a touch of the bad disorder which I had suffered from before its birth—I remember a conversation with Clifford, in which I mentioned to her that Lilly was suffering from the remnants of the" had disorder, and I think I then expressed my fears that my second child would be affected in the same way—I said I did not wish the girls in the neighbour<lb/>hood to know it, if the child was born in that state—Clifford came to the Home to see me before this letter was received from Alexander—she saw the child—she came about three times and saw it on each occasion—I don't know whether the child was suffering from the same kind of symptoms as Lilly had been suffering—it had sore eyes—I think I said something about</p>

               <p>it to Clifford—I did not express my fear that it was diseased—I said I should not like the girls to know that it was born with sore eyes for fear they should think it was that—I was not astonished at receiving this letter from Alexander in which he passes himself off as my brother—I knew he was coming—I wanted to leave the Home—Clifford knew that before I went there, and I told her when she came there that I wanted to get out as quickly as I could, and it was arranged between us that Alexander should write this letter—it was not arranged between me and the prisoners, that the child being born in that state, it should be given out that it was dead; I could swear that: I never did—I never did arrange or consent that it should be given out that the child was dead, not for that or any reason, nothing of the kind—I have never myself said that the child was dead—I know a woman named Bustin and another named Orton—I have never said to either of them that my child was dead, or mentioned my child to them—I saw them at the prisoners' house the same night I came from the Home—I did not say in their presence what a lucky thing it was for me that the child was dead—I did not mention my child to them at all—they lived in the same house, they knew I had gone to the Home, and what for—they never asked me what had become of the child till latterly—all they said was that they were glad to hear that I had got over my trouble so well—they did not ask me whether the child was alive or dead, and I never said anything to them about it—I never told them about the child being taken away by Clifford—about Christmas, 1873, Clifford and I did not have any disturbance about a-waterproof—she did not charge me with pawning a waterproof of her's, it was a macintosh coat—she charged me with illegally pawning it, about Christmas, 1873—the ticket was destroyed—it was pawned by a Mrs. Corfield for me—I destroyed the ticket—I made an affidavit of it before the magistrate at Clerkenwell, and got another ticket, and got it out—Clifford sent me a message that if it was not taken out she would give me into custody—it was long before that, that I made the accusation against them with regard to the child—I sent the waterproof home to Alexander; it was his property—on the morning I left their house they turned me out without any breakfast, I had stopped with them over-night, and I had no money; so I took that—she saw me take it—I pawned it—I never saw her to speak to her about it—I was not lodging with them at that time, I had left them some months—that was the night I slept with Alexander—Clifford brought me home that night; I was rather the worse for drink, and she made the bed, and told me to lie down on the bed, and when I woke up in the morning I found Alexander there with me—Clifford had left the house—we had a disturbance in the morning; a very serious one; I was not violent; she threatened to strike me—that was about a month or six weeks before the row with Alexander, in Upper Street—I did not say at the time the waterproof was sent down that I could give her in charge for something, and I hoped I should get her two years; I swear that—I said nothing about giving her in charge—the prisoners took my eldest child, Lilly, to live with them after I left them—she lived with them about six weeks, in 1873; that was because Mrs. Master's daughter was ill—it was before the disturbance about the waterproof—Clifford came to me one night and said that the child was out in the street—that was the very night I took her away from the house—I had connexion with Alexander at St. George's Road—that was not before I went to Sermon Lane; I never had</p>

I am surgeon and medical officer to St. Pancras Workhouse, and am a M.R.C.S.—on the night of 28th February last year, shortly after 9 o'clock, I saw a female child at the workhouse—it had great difficulty of breathing; it seemed in an exhausted condition; it was also suffering from opthalmia, inflammation of the lining membrane of the eyelids, what would be properly called sore eyes; and it was a thin, delicate child—there was nothing specially to indicate that the opthalmia arose from any syphilitic complaint; it would not be unlikely—I did not consider it with that view; it frequently arises simply from cold—the child appeared to be about ten days or a fortnight old—it was suffering from congestion of the lungs; that became worse, and passed on into inflammation of the lungs and bronchial tubes—the congestion had evidently not existed long; it was in the first stage of inflammation; it might only have been an hour, or a few hours; it comes on very quickly in children—I saw the child from day to day—it died on the evening of 12th March—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was congestion and inflammation of the lungs—exposure to the cold in the way described would be a very likely cause of that—the brain and other organs were all fairly healthy;</p>

Have you murdered it?"—a young woman, who is now dead, laid hold of her arm, and took her across the road—two policemen came up and spoke to Alexander, but I did not hear him say anything—he went across the road to 4, Pierpoint Terrace; he then went to the station, and I followed him, and heard him make a complaint about a female annoying him in the street—I afterwards went with Taylor when he apprehended Clifford—I took Alexander on 7th May, about 12 o'clock—I said to Alexander "I am going to take you for being con<lb/>cerned with a woman you are living with in detaining a female child of Jane Southey"—he said "Very well"—he afterwards turned round to two prosti<lb/>tutes who were with him and said "I am going to be taken for that child of <hi rend="italic">Jennies</hi>"—he was then conveyed to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said "I shall go to the station and complain of the constable, because he would not go across and take her in charge without I told him what it was for"—two constables were present; not sergeants with white stripes on their arms; constables wear no stripes—he did not at first say at the station that, a female had been asking him for her child—I did not hear all that passed—I did not go near the window.</p>

On Friday night, 1st May, the pri<lb/>soner was brought to Chelsea station in custody by Dent—while I was inves<lb/>tigating the charge, a letter which had been thrown down the area of Bacon's hotel, was produced, and in the prisoner's presence I asked Miss Stewart if she knew her mother's writing—she said that she did, and that letter was in her writing—the prisoner said "Yes, I bought it at a stationers shop in Queen Street, Drury Lane, and wrote it in a coffee-house opposite"—I said "Look at the letter, see what it contains, and say if you still adhere to your statement"—she took the letter, looked at it, and said "Yes, I wrote it"—that was all that passed then—she was charged with stealing the child, and I took the charge—The letter was read to her, and the previous letter sent by post, she said that she wrote the letter—she declined to make any statement, but said that at the proper time she would say all—that was all that passed—she was taken next day to Westminster Police Court—some of the witnesses were examined, and I heard the prisoner make a statement—the clerk from the Police Court is here—she was re<lb/>manded till the following Friday, the 8th—the body had not then been found, and I asked for a further remand—I afterwards heard that the body had been found, and took Mrs. Scrivener to the dead house at Poplar, and showed her the body of the child, which she identified.</p>

I live at 51, East India Road—at the request of the Coroner's officer, I went to the dead-house, Poplar, and saw the body of a child—there was only one—on Tuesday, the 12th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—it was a very large male child—there were no external marks of violence; the head was so much decomposed that I could make nothing out from it—no decomposition had taken place inside or outside the body—all the internal organs were quite healthy, both sides of the heart were empty, and the whole of the blood in the body was quite fluid—the stomach was full of indigested food, which appeared to me to be ginger bread—the intestines were empty, and there was a small quantity of urine in the bladder—there were four front teeth in the lower jaw and two in the upper, which convinced me that it was a twelve months' old child, and it appeared older—from the fact of the cavities of the heart being empty, and the blood being fluid, I came to the conclusion that the child died from asphixya, from drowning—the weather was very cool, and a certain amount of gas forms in the body which kept the body covered and the head exposed—I should say that the child had been in the water six or seven days—the weather was very temperate—I can speak with a degree of certainty, because we have a very large number of bodies our way, being near the water, and I have a good deal of experience.</p>

I live at Cowley Hall, Uxbridge, and have a lease of the property—the prisoner is a labourer and occupies a cottage in the vicinity of my rabbit warren—I know him perfectly well—he has been in my employ but was not so on 24th May—I had had occasion to Speak to him more than once about losses in the rabbit warren—I did so on. Saturday evening, 23rd May, about 8 o'clock and he said "They have been in your rabbit warren all the while you have been away"—I said "I am now determined to catch you and prosecute you"—on 24th May at a little after 4 a.m., I was in bed and heard shooting on the grounds—I arose and took a loaded gun, a revolver, and a dog, got into my boat and rowed down to the bottom of the long water, which is close to the plantation—the warren is all over the place—I went through some bushes 8 or 9 feet high till I. could see the wall at the bottom of Fox's garden—I then fired off my gun in the air with both triggers—I usually do that in going my rounds—I then saw Fox look over his garden wall at me—his garden is just on the other side of the wall and he was standing in his garden—I saw his face and run to the wall, climbed up the 7 feet wall and Fox's cottage door was open and Fox was there—it is a brick wall and is a continuation of all the cot<lb/>tages, there are six cottages and a garden wall at the back of them—the centre of the wall is where the water closets are, and he put his head up—"' the 6 feet wall is between the gardens and the plantation, and in the middle of that wall there is a water closet, at which I saw the man's head looking over—I walked along the side of the wall, put my foot in a hole in the wall and in that way climbed it, rested my hands on it and saw Fox's cottage door and Fox in his every day clothes; these are his Sunday clothes—a man named Weatherley was standing by Fox—he looked at me and I let one: barrel of the revolver off to show that I was not un-armed—I then went.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Uxbridge—I examined Mr. Mosse on 24th May, and found that he had been shot in thirty-eight or forty places—I extracted one from his finger, and the other thirty-seven are still in his body—some of the holes were larger than others, and I have a notion that the shot were of two or three sizes—they were scattered all over his body—they would have made a dangerous wound if they had all been in one place—they were all in to a considerable depth.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner upwards of twenty years, and sometimes assist him in cultivating some garden ground he has—on Whit Sunday I was sleeping in the middle room at his cottage, and he and his wife were in the room beyond—I had never slept there before—about 4.30 a.m. the report of a gun in the plantation awoke me, and I hallooed out to the prisoner, "George, are you going to get up?"—he said "No, I ain't particular this morning for an hour, as I have nothing par<lb/>ticular to do. Have you heard anything? what is the matter?"—I said "I don't know; the report woke me"—he got up, and came and opened the back door, and did not go a yard from it—he had nothing on but His shirt—I said "I will go up the lane, and see if I can see anyone"—he said "You stop here, you b----fool;" but I went, and when I had got. 20 yards I met Mr. Duce, who spoke to me, and when I went back the prisoner dressed himself to go to work—it was then nearly 5 o'clock, and we went up the towing path, but it rained so hard that we went back home, and put the kettle on and got breakfast—I did not see him use a gun or mount a wall—he bears a good character, and is a kind hearted man; I don't believe he would hurt a worm if he could get out of the way of it—he has been working twenty years with Mr. Piggott, the brickmaker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company—the prisoner was also a clerk employed there under my superintendence—Mr. Beck was the cashier for the Western Dock previous to May, the prisoner had the right to" make requisitions upon Mr. Beck, for the payment of the labourers' wages, during the week—in case any mechanics and labourers had to be paid before the proper pay day, he would draw money from Mr. Beck to pay them, or if he was instructed by me he would draw any money that he was told—there are labourers employed at the docks by the hour, and if the men so employed leave after a day, or a day and a half, they must be paid before the proper day—the prisoner would have authority to make requisitions without my knowledge to pay those men, it would be done in this way, if the men had to be paid off, the foreman would instruct the time-keeper, who would send in their time, and the prisoner would draw the money to pay them the amount would vary very much—we employ as many as 300 men sometimes—on a general average, he would require 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but sometimes much less—I have known occasions when no money at all was required to be drawn on account, in other words, that no labourers had been paid off—I did not give the prisoner any authority on May 2nd, to request an advance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Beck—the prisoner did not speak to me about paying Bruce before that—if Bruce wanted money he came to me himself—Bruce is a stonemason, working piece work—Bruce had not made any request at</p>

               <p>all to be paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor had the prisoner mentioned Brace's name in con<lb/>nection with the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in any way—he we would not have authority to draw 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay Bruce in that way—May 9th, was Saturday, which was pay day,; I was going to pay the men myself, and consequently I went through the accounts with the prisoner—he produced his book showing the amount drawn on account during the week, and what he had paid—on the debit side, beside two small sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he debited himself with a sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in one amount received from Mr. Bruce, on 2nd May—and on the other side he discharged himself by entering "Bruce, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and a second time on the same page, "Bruce, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I did not speak to him about it at that time, but on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, I sent for him and told him in Bruce's presence, that I had discovered that the receipts he had given were not genuine, and that the money had not been paid to Bruce—he had produced two receipts purporting to be signed "Edward Brace"—he turned to Bruce and said "I had your authority to sign those receipts," Brace said that it was no such thing—I told him that having discovered Bruce had not received the money, it made a deficiency of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his accounts, and by the Saturday following he must make the balance up, and if the money was not returned by that time I must inform my principals—he said it was a bad job, but he must endeavour to get the money—that was all that took place at that time—I saw the prisoner of course daily, but not to speak about this—I reported to my superior on the Wednesday following—I was obliged to allow a Saturday to pass, my principal being in Manchester, on the Company's business—I had no accounting with the prisoner on Saturday, 16th May, the whole matter was then in my hands, and I waited for the return of my principal to report him, the money not having been returned—I asked him on Wednesday, the 20th, if he had got the money a few minutes before I spoke to my principal, he made no re<lb/>mark, and I said "I must now tell my principal"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his book in his own writing—I struck through the two payments of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Bruce myself—I left the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the debit side standing to be accounted for to the cashier—these are the two receipts which he produced to me—they are printed forms from the office—the month is" filled in, but not the day—when I was discussing it with the prisoner on 9th May, he said one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on Saturday, 2nd May, and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Friday, 8th May—this little book is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the draft of a letter to a Mr. Webb, stating that he had lent a friend</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">out of the money belonging to the Company, which he had not been able to pay back, and that he was now sud<lb/>denly called upon to refund it, and asking Mr. Webb to advance him the money or any part of it.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After I discovered the deficiency he was at his work daily up till the time he was arrested—I have always found him an honest and trustworthy servant up to this time, and I have no doubt that induced me to give him time to refund the money; I did not believe him to be bad—he had no knowledge of Brace's work at all, and would not know without asking me or Bruce, what was due to Bruce—he never asked me how much was due to Bruce—the prisoner was what is railed prime cost clerk in the engineer's office, and Brace was in the habit of working for that office upon contract—it was the prisoner's duty to make out the costs of the jobs performed by the labouring staff, and to return the cost of work done; but Bruce's work was done without reference to the prisoner—if he liked to take the trouble he could</p>

               <p>estimate the cost of Bruce's work, but it was not part of his duty—he told me in Brace's presence that Brace told him he might sign those receipts—he said before the Magistrate "I have got two witnesses who can prove it"—I don't recollect him making that statement at the time you speak of—I am not sure that he did not, but I have no recollection of it—the prisoner would have to pay out about 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on an average, sometimes less, sometimes more—I gave those figures at the police court—he has mentioned once or twice to me that he has been short in the money, and on one occasion he handed me back some money which I had overpaid—there were two or three sums I think on that occasion—I am not surprised at his getting into difficulties occasionally with his money in consequence of the large amounts he had to pay, and undoubtedly it might happen without any intention to defraud the company—I checked the accounts on 9th May, because I was going to pay the men, and I was obliged to see the amount of money drawn and paid—I could not check the pay lists at that time because the men were not paid—I considered the prisoner's book a sufficient voucher at the moment that Bruce had received the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was sufficient debit to to account for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid out, and I should have thought so if Bruce had had the money—the prisoner had paid Brace, of course, a number of amounts upon prior occasions, upon instructions—his explanation of the whole matter from the beginning to end was that this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been received by Brace's authority—that was what he told me—I have since heard that they were on friendly terms—I have had to pay money myself when I could not get the accounts exactly square—if a man comes up to you and disputes an item, it is very often forgotten at the time, and very often I have had to pay money myself—in the course of the fourteen months in which the prisoner has been in the employment he has paid out about 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has had pay sheets to pay by—the greatest error I have made was under 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it has generally been a few shillings—I did not know at the time the prisoner produced the receipts that they were not Bruce's writing—he brought me one receipt first, and said "That is for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I paid Bruce last Saturday, and he wanted some more money last night, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then"—or words to that effect—on the following Wednesday he said that Brace had authorised him to sign the receipts, and Bruce denied it.</p>

I am a bookbinder at 7, York Place, Hoxton—On the 25th March last, in the afternoon, I was in a public-house in Quicksand Street—between 4 and 5 o'clock the prisoners and three or four other men were there, and a sailor—I didn't notice them particularly—they were ordered out of the house—I went out afterwards and watched them out of the street—they were ordered out because they were trying to pick the sailor's pocket—I <hi rend="italic">followed</hi> them into Finch Street—they saw me watching them, and they came up and hustled against me—I was struck by Moss on the mouth and fell to the ground, and while on the ground I was kicked; I cannot say by whom—there were more than the four men—I went to the hospital, and when I came <hi rend="italic">to</hi>, I saw the constable, who asked me if I had lost a purse, and I said yes, and I then identified it as my own—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is my purse—nothing was in it when I lost it, except a key and a ring.</p>

I am a bookbinder, living at 38, Quicksand Street—on the afternoon of 21th May, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in this public house—I saw the prisoners there, there were about five altogether—I noticed the two prisoners, they had got a man in the corner, he looked like a seafaring man—they were trying to rob him, for which they were ordered out of the house—I went out and watched them go down the street—I saw they had got hold of this sailor, arm in arm, I watched them turn Finch Street, and I looked for a constable, but could not see one—I saw Davis walking along, ahead of the prisoners—I went for a policeman, on returning I saw Davis had got his nose all cut and smothered in blood—I went to the station and identified the two men.</p>

               <p>bleeding very much from the mouth and nose, and the two prisoners were in a stooping position—I distinctly saw one of their hands coming out of his pocket—I was 50 yards off—I will not swear whose hand it was—as soon as they saw me they ran away to Prospect Place—I ran after them and caught Moss in Prospect Place, and Smith ran to the end of the court—as soon as Smith saw me lay hold of Moss, he ran back again, using very bad expressions, and said "God blind me, Jim, don't you go with him"—I took Moss into custody, and charged him with assaulting and robbing a man that was lying on the ground, in Finch Street, he said nothing, except that be would go quietly—Smith followed on until such time as other constables came up, and I had him taken in charge, took Moss to the station, and went back to look after the prosecutor, and found he had been to the hospital, where also I went and found he had had his nose and mouth dressed, and on my way back I overtook the prosecutor, and took him to the station, when he identified the two prisoners as being the men—Moss did not resist in any way, he went quietly to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the Metropolitan Meat Market—I have known the prisoner three or four years—he has consigned pigs to me for sale, and I have paid him for them at the time—I had never lent him money previous to 20th April—on that day, he came to my place about 10 o'clock in the morning—after a little conversation ho said "By the bye, Broome, I have bought two horses, and I have not enough to pay for them with me, will you lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till I get home?"—I said "Yes, I don't mind, if you send me the money as soon as you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> back?"—he said "The fact is I am buying a third horse, and if I buy that I shall want more, and I will lot you know how much in an hour or two"—it was distinctly understood that he was to send me the money as soon as he got home—he went away, and returned about one o'clock in the day—he then said he had bought the third horse, and had not enough to pay for it by 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would I lend him that—I said "Upon condition that the money comes back;" to which he consented—he said he was going to send the horses to Belfast—I drew this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been returned to me by my bankers—this is his endorsement on the back—when he got the cheque he went away—I wrote for and obtained his I 0 U for the amount—he said "There is no necessity for that, you will have the money as soon as I get home"—I said "Well, accidents may happen on the way home, and then your wife would not know you had ever had the money"—he then gave me this I 0 U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my knowledge of him in business, and what he said, induced me to lend him the money—I should not, have lent him the money as a mere loan, it was his statement about the horses caused me to do so—the next communication I had from him was this circular notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to creditors—in cones<lb/>quence of a letter I received I sent over Mr. Gore to Belfast, and, on his return to London, Mr. Gore applied for a warrant on my behalf.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I have known the prisoners about two months, prior to day their apprehension—I have seen them repeatedly together in Hackney, and the city too; say four times a week, at all events, and more than that sometimes—I was at the Royal Exchange on 1st May; I saw the two male prisoners outside, and the two females inside an Old Ford omnibus—they got out and walked away together—they walked as far as the Royal Exchange, conversed together, and then went down Queen Victoria Street, and at the Mansion House I left, in consequence of something that occurred—I subsequently saw Dodd and Turner in custody at the Bow Lane station—Dodd said he didn't know that lady, and she said, in return, she didn't know him—they refused to give their addresses—I went with three officers to Goldsmith's Row, Hackney Road—I met Roxby and Williams walking together—Williams carried this parcel—we followed them as far as the Nag's Head public-house—they met another man and woman, and went in—when they came out I spoke to Roxby, and told her the charge; she made no reply—I then went to 7, Blanchard Street, London Fields—I went into the back parlor where Turner and Dodd reside, searched the room, and found certain property there, valuable articles, quite new—I showed them to Dodd at the station-and told him the circumstances of my finding them; he said, "My room! I don't live there," or something to that effect; "I know nothing about them; I never saw them before"—I showed them to Turner; she said, "My lodgings 1" I said, "Yes, and this is what I found in your room;" she said, "I know nothing whatever about them"—on the 14th April I saw the two women and Dodd together, in Friday Street, City—they went into Messrs. Boyd's warehouse.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 13, Homer Road, South Hackney, and am a seal<lb/>skin dresser—the deceased Margaret Ball was my wife; she was twenty-seven years of age—we occupied the front parlour on the ground floor, and the back bed room on the first floor—the prisoner lived in the same house, with his mother, two sisters, and three brothers—they occupied the back room downstairs and the front room upstairs—the house is only one floor high; it is a four-roomed house—on Tuesday, 5th May, I left home to go to Messrs. Collins to work, in Earl Street, Finsbury—I remained there all night—I did not see my wife on the Tuesday before leaving; I saw her on the Monday—she made no complaint to me; she was quite cheerful, as well as I ever saw her—on the Wednesday morning, while I was at my masters', my wife came to me, as near upon 11 o'clock as possible—I went with her to the White Hart, at the corner of Earl Street, and remained there with her nearly half-an-hour—she had brought something with her to eat, and asked me to take it; I said I did not want it—we had two pints of ale together while we were talking—I don't suppose she drank as much I did—there was no one with her; she was cheerful—we had no words or any quarrel of any kind—I left her as near 11.30 as possible; she said she was going home; that Mrs. Coulson was out doing a day's washing, and she must make haste home to give the children some dinner when they came home from school; they were my two children, one is seven and the other four—they lived in the house with us, but went to a day school, and came him e to dinner about. 12 o'clock—I was aware that my wife was in the family<lb/>way—when she left me she was not at all affected by the drink she had, not the slightest—I never saw her again alive—I did not see anything of the prisoner—my wife left me against the door of the public-house, and I went back to my work—she would have about two miles or two miles and a half to go home—I did not see the rope that was found round my wife's neck until I saw it at Worship Street police-court—I did not know it; I don't know that I had ever seen it before—my wife was wearing a very small pair of earrings when I parted from her—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them; I can swear to them.</p>

I am a surgeon, I was called to 13, Homer Road, about 430 o'clook, on this day—Harris, the constable, was there at that time—I saw the body lying in the entrance passage at the bot<lb/>tom of the stairs, between the staircase and the door—the rope had been removed from the body and also from the banisters, the body was warm—I could only judge from my previous experience how long she had been dead, I could not say within half an hour; it is possible she may have been dead half an hour, or an hour—heat will remain in some bodies longer than in others—I should say she could not have been dead more than an hour—the dress was slightly disfigured about the neck, it opened in front, and two three, or it might be four hooks were open; that might have been the way in which it was worn, there was no sign of either of the hooks having been forced, or of the dress having been torn; there was no indication of any violence having been used to open it—there was a bruise round the neck, such as might have arisen from pressure by hanging—I saw nothing more on that examination; afterwards when the clothes were removed, I saw some marks—the bruise on the neck from the compression of the rope would not be produced upon a body hanged when insensible, where there is pressure on the windpipe of that nature insensibility will take place instanta<lb/>neously—when a man is hanged a bruise may he produced by the pressure of the rope—as long as animal heat exists in the body, I believe a bruise can be produced—in this case animal heat existed for half an hour, and possibly an hour—I believe during that time, a bruise might be produced-upon making a post mortem examination on the 7th, I found three bruises on the left side just over the hip joint, two were very indistinet, one was very distinct in<lb/>deed, and seemed of recent date, I should say within twenty-four hours; the others might have been caused a week before—the recent one was the worst, they were in row horizontal, or oblique rather, that mark may have been produced either by pressure or a blow—there, were some marks on the inner part of the thigh and leg which might have been ercohy-mosis, or they might have been some old standing disease of the skin—I think that was all that I noticed externally—I then made an internal exa<lb/>mination I opened the head—I found the brain healthy—there was about half an ounce of fluid between the bone and the membranes of the brain—the membranes were gorged with blood—that would probably be caused by pressure on the two vessels at the side of the neck, in fact from hanging—they are indications of strangulation—the lungs were healthy, but gorged with blood, that is another indication of strangulation—the stomach showed that some very unsubstantial food had been taken, within a few hours, it was only an indication of partially digested biscuit or something of that sort—the left verticle of the heart, the muscular portion was hyper<lb/>trified, there was thickening of the walls; I mean by that, diseased—the liver was fairly healthy—the uterus contained a foetus of about seven months—the other organs were, healthy—some severe pressure had. Been put upon the windpipe, causing some of the rings to he partially broken through—the woman unquestionably died from strangulation, and my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080080"/>
               <p>opinion is that it was from continued pressure, not instantaneously as by a jerk from the footing being removed, but as if done by a bowstring—I should say there was no doubt that the injury to the windpipe was from the pressure of the rope—I did not measure the height of the body at the time, I did afterwards, but I can only give my opinion about it, because bodies lying after death will sometimes elongate—I should say when living she was about 5 feet 4 inches, or something of that sort, and her weight about 10 stone, that is allowing for her pregnancy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 12, Portland Place, Clapton—I was called in to see the body of the deceased on 6th May—I found the mark of a cord, applied in such a direction that it came round the front part of the neck and obliquely up behind the ear, the back part of the neck was free from any mark, the whole of the front and sides of the neck was marked by the cord, but it was not absolutely circularly round the neck—there were no other marks of violence whatever; the general aspect of the countenance was compatible with that of a person who had been hanged—that was the only thing I noticed—I was not at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I can, therefore, only speak from the external appearances—the cause of death was suffocation from hanging—I think there is a distinction to be drawn, not between suffocation and strangulation, but between stran<lb/>gulation and hanging; if a person wants to kill another by suffocation that would be strangulation, but there was no mark of that—I think she died by hanging and not by strangulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I observed no marks or abrasions to denote a struggle—in my opinion the symptoms were perfectly consistent with her having hanged herself, and I think they were incompatible with anyone else having done it against her will—I think there would have been evidence of struggle and of far more violence—I saw the prisoner and I saw the build of the woman—in the event of any struggle I think she would have been a match for the prisoner; she was a muscularly-developed woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I used the term, "against her will," I, of course, assumed that she was able to exercise her will—I do not think the appear<lb/>ances were consistent with her being rendered insensible suddenly by pressure of the rope round the neck—that is just the point I was insisting upon, had the rope been tightly tied round the neck it would not have been in an oblique direction, but horizontal—I formed my opinion upon the mark of the bruise round the neck—I do not mean to say that insensibility may not be produced by sudden pressure on the wind-pipe without leaving a mark—I say that strangulation could not, in my opinion, have been exercised, otherwise the marks would have been different.</p>

Suffocation is a general term; I should" call it death from deprivation of oxygen—strangulation is that form in which, by a constricting band passing round the throat horizontally, a person is deprived of oxygen, like a person strangled by a bow string—in both cases they are deprived of oxygen, but there are hundreds of cases of suffocation to one of strangulation—one form of strangulation is by a ligature like a bow string, another is by hanging, which is not by a ligature horizontally round the neck but obliquely, and another is by throttling—those are all distinct things my opinion is entirely dependent upon the mark round the neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—I was called on Friday, 1st May, about 6 o'clock in the evening, to Mrs. Elliott's house—I saw the deceased girl lying dead upon the bed—I think she was nearly dressed—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination the next day—externally there were no marks of violence, internally the body was well nourished—there was a little bronchitis in the lungs, to a very alight degree; not much more than a common cold—the chest was healthy—there was no sign of injury in the trunk that would cause death—I ex<lb/>amined the head and found a quantity of <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pus</hi>, or something between <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> into and under the membranes of the brain on the right hemisphere from front to back, over the whole convexity—death was due to inflammation of the brain, of which those were the indications—those indications were consistent with a blow or fall—they might be con<lb/>sistent with disease of the bones of the ear; I am not aware of any other cause—there was no disease of the bones of the ear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the clerk of this Court—I produce the recognizances of Emily Easterby, taken on 8th April, 1873,. at Highgate, to prosecute Courtney Thomas Diprose, Courtney John. Diprose, Peter Jermyn, and Henry William Hammond for conspiracy, and another recognizance of the same date to prosecute Courtney John Diprose for larceny, and another to prosecute the same four Defendants for endeavouring by false pretences to induce her to place her signature on a paper, in order that it might be. Dealt with as a bill of sale—I also produce the recognizances of those four defendants to appear at the May Sessions of this Court, Monday, May 5—I have before me a book containing the proceedings of the Court, and at that Session bills of indictment were preferred against those four Defendants, and five true bills were found—one was against. Courtney Thomas Diprose for inducing Mrs. Easterby to put her name to a paper that it could be dealt with as a valuable security—her name and Mr. Harris's appear on the back of the bill, and bear against them the initials of the foreman of the Grand Jury, the Act, 19 and 20 Victoria, c. 24, requiring that the witnesses ex<lb/>amined by the Grand Jury shall be initialled by the foreman—I produce another indictment against Courtney John Diprose and Jermyn for a similar offence, and Mrs. Easterby's name and Harris's both appear on the back of it in the same way—I also produce a third indictment against Courtney John Diprose and Peter Jermyn for larceny of the goods of Emily Easterby—Harris's name is on the back of that bill both as attorney and witness, and is initialled, and so is Mrs. Easterby's—I produce another indictment against the same four Defendants, the name of Mrs. Easterby is on it, not initialled, and the name of Mr. Harris is on it, but the foreman's initials are placed in such a way that I cannot say whether they apply to that name or that of the next witness—I have another against Courtney John Diprose and Jermyn, for forcible entry into Mrs. Easterby's house; Harris's name appears upon that with <hi rend="italic">"Atty</hi>." after it—true bills were found in all those indict<lb/>ments at the May Sessions, and on Thursday, 8th May, Serjeant Ballantine' applied for the postponement of the trial, and it was ordered to be postponed till the first day of the next session, and the recognizances were enlarged upon all the indictments and the Defendants admitted to bail on the same bail as before on renewed recognizances—the next Session began on Monday June 9, and the case appeared on the paper on the first day of that Session—I know that it was postponed to the following Thursday, but it being only a postponement from one day of the same Session to another there is no entry in the book—on Thursday, 12th June, on the application of Counsel for the prosecution, the trial was put off till the next Session, and the recognizances of all parties respited till then—at the next Session, 7th July, there was another postponement and the recognizances of all parties were enlarged, except Mrs. Easterby's, which were ordered to be estreated, but the process suspended till further order—bail was renewed for the Defendants—on Monday, 18th August, on the application of Counsel for the prosecution and on reading affidavits, the trial was further postponed and the recognizances enlarged, till Wednesday, 20th August, to afford opportunity to Mr. Harris, the attorney, to answer the matters in an affidavit, and on 20th August this affidavit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of Mr. Harris was filed—the trial was further postponed till the next Session, and the recog<lb/>nizances</p>

               <p>of all parties, except Mrs. Easterby, renewed, and the bail was renewed—on Monday, 22nd September, on the application of the Counsel for the prosecution, the trial was postponed to the next Session, the recog<lb/>nizances being enlarged and the defendants admitted to fresh bail—at the Session which begun on Monday, 27th October, the Defendants all appeared and surrendered; Mrs. Easterby did not appear, no evidence was offered, and the Defendants were acquitted—I recollect that there was on that occasion an application for a further postponement by the Counsel for the prosecution—here is an information of Robert Stanley Harris attached to the depositions against, the then four Defendants, it is dated 31st March, 1873—I also produce another information of the same date sworn to by Harris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, carrying on business at 3, Cloak Lane, City—we act as agents to the solicitor to the Treasury on occasions—on or about 20th May, 1873, I received instructions to take charge of the prosecution which was pending against the two Diproses, Hammond, and Jermyn—I produce a letter dated 15th May, signed by the defendant Harris, but the letter is not in his writing—I have the original (<hi rend="italic">This was an application addressed to the Secretary of State, by Harris, stating the whole circumstances of the case and praying far funds, as strenuous efforts were being made to arrange the matter and defeat: the ends of justice by tiring the prosecution out.</hi>) Mr. Harris afterwards called, and saw my brother, who is my partner; and on 2nd June, he called and saw me—I had a long conversation with him about the case—he told me he had been put to very great expense in the matter, and had had a very great deal of trouble, and he thought it very hard that the prosecution should be taken away from him at that time—I explained to him that the Treasury had only taken the usual course.; that we always acted for them as their agents in cases which they did not do themselves; that they never left private solicitors to do a case; they always sent to us—he then asked me if there was no chance of the Treasury paying his costs—I said that, as far as my experience went, they did not pay costs incurred before they took a case; but that as he had been put to considerable trouble, if he liked, When the case was over, to make an appeal to the Treasury, if my recommendation was of any service to him, I should be very happy to recommend the Treasury to pay him—he had not got the papers with him, and said that he would call next day and bring them, which he did; and as he handed them over to me he said, "Well, I rely upon you that you will assist me ail in your power to get my costs"—I said "Yes," and he gave me some further information—I went through the papers, and prepared the case for trial—Mr. Harris, the Counsel, had a brief, and the usual Counsel for the Treasury—I saw Mrs. Easterby I had nothing to do with finding the bills—I was present at the Sessions on Monday, 9th June—I. had seen Mrs. Easterby, I think, on—the previous</p>

               <p>Tuesday, and I directed her to attend here at 9.45—Harris, besides being the attorney, was a witness in the case—I also wrote to Mrs. Easterby and the other witnesses, telling them to be there—I knew that the case would stand first in the list—she did not appear, and the matter stood over till 12th June—in the meantime I received a letter from Mr. Harris and wrote to him—this is it; it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Messrs. Wontner and Sons, and signed R. S. Harris, stating that it would be impossible for him to call on them, they having already trespassed upon his time to a great extent.

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I formerly lived at Wentworth Villas, Finchley—I kept a school next to the post-office for twelve months, and then went to Wentworth Villa—I was living there at the end of 1872 and the beginning of 1873—at the end of 1872 I was in pecuniary difficulties, and in consequence of an advertisement I applied to a loan office at 3, Kingsland Road, to borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I received some time in January, 1872, and signed some paper—on Saturday, February 1st, I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 82, Blackman Street, and signed a paper with reference to that which was brought to me at Wentworth Villa by Peter Jermyn, one of the defendants in the other case—I had seen Thomas Diprose at Kingsland road—on Monday, 3rd February, about 6 p.m. I was at home, and a man came first about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then seven or ten men came; C. T. Diprose, senior, was one and Jermyn was another—there was a van outside, and they proceeded to clear away my furniture—they put everything into the van, even the stores in the cupboards, wearing apparel, books, coals, and the keys of my desk—I had no bed or mattress left—it was about 9.40 when the things were finally taken away—I was alone and had to go out into the snow which was on the ground—on the Tuesday morning I consulted the defendant Harris, an attorney of White House, Hadley, Barnet—.1 paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—his fee was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but he had no change—I instructed him to get back-the worth of the furniture, and he undertook my case—I know Mr. Martin, a gentleman living at Finchley—I know that subscriptions were made for the purpose of paying of my law expenses, as I <hi rend="italic">had.</hi> no money—a charge was afterwards made at the Police Court, Highgate, and a warrant was obtained against C. J. Diprose, senior—I went with Baweu, the officer, and Mr. Fortescue (who I also know as Holman), and Mr. Harris went with us—I identified the person who was arrested—after wards at tie Highgate Police Court, Peter Jermyn and Hammond were charged—there were several examinations, Harris acting for me as my attorney, and he instructed Mr. Richard Harris as my Counsel—the defendants were represented by Sergeant Ballantine, and were held to bail to answer the charge at the May Sessions, and I was bound over to give evidence—at the May Sessions I was in Court ready to give evidence, but the matter went over to the June Sessions—between the two Sessions Mr. Blanchard Wontner wrote to me—I saw him, and he took charge of the case—I knew that the trial was to come on on Monday, 9th June, and twice in the week before that the defendant Harris came to my house, and he came again on the Monday evening after I had seen Mr. Wontner—that was before 9th June—he had some conversations with me on those occasions—I cannot be certain, whether he said "Square it up" or "Make it up"—I forget what the first word was, but I have told you before, if you will give Meahint of it—I said "I shall have nothing to do with it, don't bring these men here, for they will do me more harm' than they did at first, do as</p>

               <p>you please"—this was in the week before 9th June—he said that he would call and see me again in a few evenings—one evening after that I was standing at my window and saw two gentlemen talking, I recognised Harris—a knock came, and Harris said "Mrs. Easterby this is a friend of mine—this was on a day in the week before 9th June—I asked them in and we had a long conversation—I asked the gentleman his name, he said "Fell"—I asked him if he lived there, he said "Not exactly"—I said what are you, Sir—he said I am a solicitor, and I am a great friend of Mr. Harris—Fell is the first gentleman there (<hi rend="italic">In the dock</hi>) looking towards me—Harris said "Mrs. Easterby, it will pay me better for you to go away, for you are in ill health and in a nervous state, and it will do you good"—Fell then said that he should like to go to Paris if he had a chance, and he said "Go away Mrs. Easterby, go to Paris for six months"—I said that I should not go away, and Fell said "Look here Mrs. Easterby, will 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pay you for your losses"—I said "Yes"—he said "Suppose' you have 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your pocket-money"—we had a long argument about it, and he said that he and Mr. Harris would call again in a day or so, or the next afternoon—Harris said that I must not proceed in the matter, and he said "What would it profit you to punish these men, will the public keep you it will pay you better to go away"—I should have mentioned that before, it was when he came in and said "Good evening"—Fell said that he would call again tomorrow which was Saturday—Barnett had called on me a week before that at my house, I did not know him then, he said "Will you open the door Ma'am and speak to me"—I said "No, I can't open the door," and I opened the window, and he said "Oh, have mercy upon these men"—I said "You must go to the Judge, and everything that is proper to do will come"—he said "Put a price upon what you have lost, and if it is a 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will bring it in less than two hours"—I said "Don't come here again I don't live here," and shut the window—I did not know who he was then, I had never seen him, and he gave me no name—Fell called again on the Saturday afternoon, that was the Saturday before the Sessions—I had written a letter that morning and gave it to my little nephew at 7.30 to take to him—he took it out and came back without it. (<hi rend="italic">Robert Helton, clerk to Messrs. Wontner proved serving a notice on the prisoners and on their solicitors, to produce the letter, but it was not produced.</hi>) I said in the letter, that I was surprised and astonished, and asked him to give me a call that afternoon Saturday, if he was walking out—Mr. Fell called, and said that he had not brought his cheque-book, but he hoped I should be ready, and he would come on Sunday morning before church time—I said that I had written to Mr. Harris, to decline going; he said "But it is the Session, and you must not be out of the way"—I said "Why can I not have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and go to my friends?"—he said "No, they would fetch you, and make you speak"—he mentioned his cheque book, because I asked him how I was to have the money—I meant the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said that he would bring his cheque book and give me some of the money—I declined going, and said "Where am I going?" he said "Go for six months and you will have everything fit for a lady," I said "I am not going," he said that he would come at church time, and wished me good evening, that was all that passed—next day, June 8th, I was standing at my door, and the little boy who was upstairs at the window, said something, and I came in and shut the door—I had not seen anybody—there was then a ring, I opened the door, I saw Mr. Fell and Mr. Barnett—Fell spoke first, he said "Good evening," and came</p>

               <p>in, and we had a long conversation, I asked where I was going to, and, he said "We will go to-an hotel in London to-night, and go into the country in the morning"—I said "Well, if I go for this Session I shall be home for the next"—I asked Barnett who he was and what he wanted, he said "Well, I am the same as Bowell"—I said "What, a detective" he said "Something of the sort"—I don't think they said anything about the money they had previously mentioned—I agreed to go, and left the house that night without the money—I beg pardon, I understood that Harris held the money, Fell said that he had not brought his cheque book, and could not get the money, but Mr. Harris would see to that—I put my bonnet on, and put my things together, Barnett got a Hansom's cab, and carried my box to it at the top of the road—it was then past 9 o'clock, I and the little boy who is turned ten, and Barnett got into the cab—Fell said "It is no use quarrelling here any more, I will come back again," but he did not—we stopped and had some refreshment somewhere in the Holloway Road, and then changed into a four-wheeled cab, and got to Islington about 9.30 o'clock—my box was taken off the cab and put on the pavement, and Barnett asked me if I would mind waiting a little, while he went to a friend—he went away and returned with Hammond, who I knew as the defendant against whom I had given evidence—he said "How do you do, Mrs. Easterby?" and put his hand out to shake hands, saying "I don't owe you any ill feeling"—Barnett and Hammond carried the luggage, and the little boy and I followed behind—we went to 14, Chadwell Street, Myddelton Square'—we went inside and I saw a lady there, he said "That is my sister," we went into a sitting-room up stairs and had some tea—Barnett brought me some paper in the course of the evening, and I wrote two letters and gave them to him, because I did not know the addresses; they were open, I did not see whether he read them—I gave them to him to put the stamps on—one was to the post-master at Finchley, for all letters to be left till called for, and the other was to my sister, Mrs. Harper—I did not put any address on the letters, because I did not know it—Barnett brought 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that evening, and I signed a receipt for it—I saw Hammond there that night—I do not know what, became of Barnett—they wished me good night, and Miss Hammond showed us to our bedroom—Barnett said that we were going to the country the next day, and we were to be ready by 7.30 in the morning—we breakfasted with Miss Hammond the next morning, and after breakfast I saw Barnett—I saw Hammond as I went out—he wished me good morning, and said he was going to the Sessions—a cab was a little way off, not at the door—the little boy and I and Barnett and Miss Hammond got into it and went to Gower Street Station (I had left my box at Chadwell Street)—we went to Victoria Station by the Underground Railway, and on the way Barnett said that I must not travel in the name of. Mrs. Easterby—I said that I would take the name of McKenzie—that is my maiden name, but I did not tell Barnett so—when we got to the station we changed from the Metropolitan part to the Brighton part—Miss Hammond gave me two tickets and a half, and we got into the train—Barnett then said "Good morning, Mrs. McKenzie, my name is not Barnett, it is Baldwin, give my love to my wife, and she will treat you very kindly"—Miss Hammond and the little boy travelled down to Southsea with me—we went to Brighton first and then changed—when we got to Portsmouth we went to Pelham Cottage, where I was introduced to Mrs. Baldwin—we stayed there until the following Sunday, 15th June—Baldwin came down in the middle of the week, and so did Hammond, but they did not tell me</p>

Would not you like the boy?"—I said, "Yes;" and then they all left me—after that Hammond said, "I never had such a lecture in my life; I will bo off"—I had given him the lecture—I asked him to come away from them, and said, "If you don't give me the keys I shall walk to King's Cross; you first send me to Chadwell Street, and the second time you take me yourself—he said, "Why, woman, you went by yourself"—he snatched off-my shawl, and in a moment I was in the train—I had sat half-an-hour by myself before the train started—Hammond took me to the train; my shawl was on his arm, and the boy was in the carriage with Mr. Fortescue—we went away in the train, and my shawl was left with Hammond—we went to Dover, and on the way Fortescue told me that he was a doctor, and an intimate friend of Harris's—he said, "You must not travel in the name of Easterby; you must take Jones"—I said, "I will take McKenzie"—that is my maiden name—we went to Adamson's Hotel, Dover, and stayed there till 2nd July—Fortescue stayed the whole of the time, and Hammond came down and brought me some things which I had made a list of when I left Wentworth Villa, but he did not bring the key—I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Fortescue at Dover, and bought some things with it—I did not write to Harris, but I sent messages to Fortescue and saw him write—a lady and gentleman, friends of Fortescue's, were staying at the same hotel; they crossed with us to Calais—Hammond had dined with us that day—he knew I was going to Calais—I proposed going home but I had no key, and Fortescue said that it was for my own safety—we went to Calais by the night boat, to the Hotel Meurice, and after staying one night Fortescue went to Paris with his friends—he did not return—the bill was owing—I wrote to Harris about it to his office, and I believe I enclosed the bill—I did not write for my shawl because Fortescue wrote and said, get another—I said "Send the means then"—this is his letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he afterwards came with Hammond, and I think Fortescue said that they had both come from London—Hammond only stayed a day—their letters came in the middle of the week, and they came on Sunday about 1 o'clock, and then we moved to Boulogne with the boy to the Hotel de Londres—while I was</p>

I should think—I wrote to my sister Mrs. Rolf in July, I did not say "My poor things are worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," that is a mistake, I said "Your things would not fetch more than 20l"—I meant her boxes and things—I have taught the child reading and writing, and I took him with me because he is my only companion—I knew that his mother wanted him, and did not I come home from Southsea, and was not I stolen away?—I was going by the name of McKenzie in Dover, and I wrote a letter in that name, that is my name, my name is McKenzie Easterby—Holman did not complain while I was away with him, that I took a good deal to drink—he was very kind—he was not obliged to be kind to me, because I was laid up from drink; we came home to do justice and to speak truth—I am defending myself—bother me as much as you like with the truth—the last time I saw Mr. Harris before Monday 8th June, was on the Friday night with Mr. Fell—I saw him on the Monday and again on the Friday in the same week—that was the Friday before the Session—at the time I saw him on the Monday I had seen Mr. Wontner—I made a note of it.</p>

I saw Mr. Fell twice in the week before it came on, on 9th June—I had never seen him before—I also saw him on Saturday afternoon 7th June, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I am quite positive of that—I was taken to Wells office by Inspector Clarke, it may have been on 9th May, 1874—Wells came out and asked me, whether I knew him, I said "I don't know you," he said "I thought you would not Maam," but his voice struck me—he did not reply "Nor do I know you Maam"—he had glasses on his eyes suspended from his neck—I asked him to take them off, I did not then say "It is not the man nor the voice"—I said "It is Mr. Fell</p>

               <p>of the case, and said that he wanted the Christian name of Diprose—I had a paper in my possession with his signature, which I showed him—that paper had been lent to me to arrange, by somebody else—Harris asked me if I would bring it to Highgate, and show it to his Counsel—I went to Highgate Police Court, and saw one of the warrants executed; that was the arrest of the elder Diprose—Mrs. Easterby and Harris were with me—Harris said that I might as well see the fun out, and we all went together—I made Mrs. Easterby's acquaintance on that occasion—I chatted with her going along, and in the Court, Harris asked me to bring my papers a second time to show Mr. Harris—I had heard Harris conduct cases at the County Court frequently; in fact, he lived with me some time at my house—Hammond was one of the defendants at Highgate—I remember the fact that they were committed for trial—I was present here in May when the case was postponed; I heard Serjeant Ballantirie apply for a postponement, and it went over to the June Session—I did not know Baldwin until this case; I just saw him when he came to Bow Lane station—on Wednesday, 18th June, I was at the Ludgate Hill railway-station—Hammond, Harris, Wells, and Mrs. Easterby were there—after the adjournment of the Diprose case, Harris and I had different conversations about it—he told me it was necessary that Mrs. Easterby should be sent away—he told me so on the second occasion, and he said he thought it was advisable to send her abroad—I think that was on the Saturday previous to the 18th June, and he asked me, as I knew the Continent, if I would, undertake to take her—I said of course I could not leave my business without some consideration; but if there was no danger likely to emanate from it, I was willing to—he said "There will be no trouble accrue to you from it, because there is no charge of felony against them, as my Counsel, Mr. Harris, says that the charge of felony must be abandoned when they come to trial, and it would only be compounding a misdemeanour, which there is no harm in"—I said I would talk it over with my wife, and think about it, and let him know—I don't think I saw him again till the following Wednesday, when he said that he would see me righted, that it would be liberal pay, and my expenses would be paid—he also said that his costs were to be paid by the other side, as he had got nothing out of Mrs. Easterby—I think he said that his claim was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they had agreed to give him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; half was to be paid down, and the remainder if Mrs. Easterby did not appear, so that they were acquitted—he did not tell me whether he was to have all the money, or whether anybody else was to have a part, but I understood him that he had to pay some portion of that to Counsel—he and Hammond came together on Wednesday, 18th June, after Barnet County Court, and saw me in my private office—the same thing was proposed about my going away with Mrs. Easterby—I said I was quite willing, but I did not want to burn my fingers over it—Wells said "You can't do that; for we are dealing only with Hammond, and he is not charged with felony. Mr. Harris says that the charge of felony cannot be sustained, and therefore no harm can come of it," or some remark of that kind—I then consented to go, and he told me to put a lew things together—it was first arranged that I was to go to Paris, to take Mrs. Easterby to some address that was to be furnished to me afterwards, and first of all they wanted me to stay away six months—I said if I went to Paris I should certainly extend my tour a little, and see the Con<lb/>tinent again, as it was some years since I had seen it—I declined to go for six months, but said I would not mind being away a fortnight or three</p>

Wontner—I can't say whether it was dictated or not—Hammond showed it to me—I am not certain that I saw the letter; I think I saw a copy of it—I could not swear that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was it; I should know the subject of it—Hammond went away soon after that; he stayed a night—we went by the night boat to Calais the first calm day, and went to the Hotel Meurice—I and my friends started off to Paris, and left Mrs. Easterby and the little boy at the hotel at Calais—she had money when we went over by the boat; I can't tell how much—I had given her different sums, altogether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—she bought things for herself and, I believe, for the boy, and she had a dressmaker's bill to pay, and one or two little matters—I remember her coming to me for money for it—I think it was on 2nd July that we crossed to Calais—before leaving Dover I paid the hotel bills, altogether about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while I was in Paris I received two post-office orders addressed to the Hotel de Londres de Milan; they were on the Paris chief office I signed the name of Cecil Fortescue for them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the orders, and this is my signature—when I went to cash the last one they had not received the advice, so, as I was coming away, I left it with the hotel proprietor in part payment of the bill—one was sent to me in the name of Robert S. Harris, and the other in the name of Charles or Charlie Kidman—I received a letter from Harris at the same time, informing me that he had remitted it to me in that manner—the orders were each for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not known him by the name of Kidman; that was the first time I heard that name—I stayed at Paris a fortnight—I received these post-office orders there while Mrs. Easterby was at Calais—I had written to Harris for money—I went direct from Paris to London; we got into London at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, and I went to my friend's house—I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a letter from Wells before I came away—I don't know that I could swear to Wells writing; I don't think I could—I have destroyed the letter</p>

Wontner—I gave it to her, she opened and read it, and was somewhat alarmed—I said I had better go to town, but I did not—she suggested that she had better leave the hotel and we left and went to Neufchatel—we stayed at a small country inn there, I forget the name of it, it is next door to the English boarding house, opposite the Church—I stayed there till the following Wednesday, that was in August—I then came to town—I paid the bill at Boulogne and at Neufchatel up to the time I left, and when I got to London I had only a few shillings left—I went to Hammond's house, he was not at home, but the servants came running after me—I went back again and then went to Mr. Wells' office in Paternoster Row—I saw him there and told him what had occurred, and that I had left because I had only made arrangements to be away a week—I considered that 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to me and it was paid me, it was sent to me in the name of Thomas Ward—I afterwards saw Hammond—I told him what had occurred, and that Mrs. Easterby was very anxious and uncomfortable—I gave him the address at Neufchatel, and as far as I know he left—I saw Harris and Wells from time to time after that, and had conversation with them continually about Mrs. Easterby—Harris talked a good deal about one of the trials, where he had to make an affidavit—he merely mentioned the annoyance it was to him, that he had been charged with certain things and had to make an affidavit to clear himself—Wells and I met sometimes at my house and sometimes at his—I heard about the acquittal of Hammond and the Diproses—I was not told for a long time afterwards by either of the Defendants what had become of Mrs. Easterby, but afterwards Harris</p>

                  </hi>. I am public analyst for Paddington—I received from Jonas Hall a tin of English condensed milk which had been opened at the bottom instead of the top, and about a quarter of it had been taken out—there were some slight specks of a white powder scattered about on the sides, and a few on the surface—the milk being sticky they stuck to the sides—I picked them out, and placed them on a watch glass, and found that they were an insoluble white precipitate—I thought at first it might be arsenic, but upon analysis I found—it was not—white precipitate is a poison—I picked out the particles from the surface of the milk—I did not observe any in the bulk of milk—white precipitate is sold by chemists in 5 pennyworths and mixed for vermin—I am not aware that it is ever used internally for children—the effect of administering a very small quantity would produce a burning sensation about the mouth, and throat—even a grain or two would produce some sensation—it would take a larger quantity than two or three grains to kill a child eight months old; I should say ten or fifteen, but it would depend upon whether the sickness threw it up again—it was a very small quantity indeed that I took out of the tin—it is a thing easily detected—half a grain can be detected very readily, or less than that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The evidence of the small quantity was so distinct that I did not analyse the bulk—I did not take out all the specks, but I took sufficient for analysis—all that were there were visible—it was not all mixed with the milk; it stuck on the surface and sides—I don't think the whole of the specks would amount to two or three grains—it was on the surface and sides alone that I found the specks—it did not sink down—full three-quarters of the contents of the tin were still there—it could have been stirred up-with the milk, but that was not so in this case—I think possibly it might have been dropped, or spilt, or fallen in, or in some manner have come upon the surface.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Newman Place, and am a widow—on Monday, 2nd March, I was living with the prisoner at 24, Cardigan Road, for a few days to take care of her while she was ill—on the second morning I gave her her breakfast in bed, she complained very much indeed, and I advised her to keep quite, she said she would, providing I would lay along side of her, for a time—she kept saying all the morning about her sufferings, and said death was preferable to her sufferings—she was my adopted daughter, I brought her up from seven years of age to twenty-one—she is now forty—I laid down by the side of her and fell off in a doze—she was restless—I got off the bed suddenly, and took a knife from her side—I went and sat in a chair—she suddenly attacked me—she said "You shan't leave me"—she rushed on to me and tore my jacket, I held on as well as I could, opened the window and cried out "Murder"—she took me by the hair of my head, and beat my head on the bars of the-grate, saying all the time "You shan't leave me"—froth was coming from her mouth, I recovered myself by her night dress and the iron bedstead—I took up the chair and I knocked the knife out of her hand, and she broke the wash hand basin across my head—when I came to myself she had again got the knife—she had cut my throat first, then she was going to cut her own throat, and I took hold of her,—she drew the knife through my hand, and chopped me on the other, and I fell helpless to the ground—I had been crying out "Murder!" all the time—she made another attempt on her throat—I was nearly insensible—during-the whole of that time she was repeating "Death, death, that is preferable to my sufferings"—when I laid down at the; side of her she put her arm around my neck and kissed me, and said what a good mother I had been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been sent for to take care of her, because her head was bad—her husband came and said she was very ill, and he must put her in an asylum, as something was very wrong—she has been mar<lb/>ried thirteen years—I have always treated her as a daughter, and she me as a mother—I don't believe she knew what she was doing at the time—I don't believe she would harm me—she said she was so sorry she was afflicted, as she would be my good friend in my old days—the doctor said. "Keep knives and things from her"—she once nearly set her bedroom on fire—she would beat her head about—she was tearing her hair and running hair pins in her poor head—I told Mr. Kneller I was afraid to stop, and did not like ray position at all—this was the change of life, women who have had no children at the change of life, their symptoms are worse than those that have had children—the blood flies upwards on the brain—this night she was thoroughly wild, like a maniac.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an wholesale frame maker in Blackfriars Road—I saw the accident happen opposite my door—the old men were going towards the obelisk, partly on the tramway and partly on the stones—the prisoner was coming in an opposite direction—I saw him 50 or 60 yards off—he pulled from the near side of the road and passed between the omnibus and the truck—the omnibus was going the same way as the truck—I think there</p>

               <p>was barely room to allow him to pass—I should think he must have seen the old men—I heard the old man call out plain enough—I think the I prisoner might have heard him also—the wheel of his van caught the handle of the truck, and the deceased went under the wheel of his van—I called to him to stop four or five times, so that he might have heard it—he heard me call, decidedly, but he went along a trifle faster—a gentleman tried to stop him—his language was not of a regretful tone—he was not sober. I have no doubt of that, by the way he went on—he jumped down and begun to abuse the gentleman who had stopped him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not say he didn't know he had done any harm when before the Magistrate—my evidence was taken down at the police-court—I never said the prisoner said he didn't know he had done any harm—the depositions being read contained that statement—it was not in my statement, it was taken down in mistake, I 'didn't hear him say so—road there was very rough, it had been newly stoned and there was a steam-roller—the prisoner's van made the usual noise that vans do going over stones—the truck was going the same way as the omnibus—the prisoner was going" the opposite way—the van was not going behind the omnibus—there was only one bus—his right side would be the left side of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—the prisoner went on the off side.</p>

I knew the deceased who died in the hospital—that statement was made in my presence—he was sworn by the Magistrate's clerk—he signed his deposition—I was on duly about 10.13—I heard some cries and saw a gentleman holding prisoner's horse—he was drunk no doubt about it—I told him—he had run over a man a little lower down—he said he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not know he had—he said at the station "This is the first time I have been here, make it as easy as you can."</p>
