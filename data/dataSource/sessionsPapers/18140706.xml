               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any thing out of your shop - A. On the 4th of June, there was a piece of floor-cloth in the shop, in the morning part; I saw it there myself; I cannot tell the hour; there was no one but me there I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards is this piece of floor-cloth - A. Eighteen yards; it is of the value of between three and four pounds; it is worth upwards of three pounds. We did not miss it at all. I went out of town as I usually do, and when I came to town on the Sunday morning, my servant, who was left in the care of the house, gave me some information.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday you saw it in the shop - A. Yes. I came to town on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it at any time on the Monday - A. Yes; I saw it at the office in Queen-square, on Monday morning; it was then in the possession of the constable, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you went out of town on Saturday had you sold it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the floor-cloth that you saw in the possession of the constable the same that you saw in your shop on Saturday - A. Yes, I am certain of that; I know the floor-cloth to be the only piece, from the maker; in the next place, it is a pattern of my own. I do not know that we had cut a yard off, and it is the usual practice of my foreman to put a chalk mark inside of the number; it has that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060004"/>chalk mark on it now. This is the chalk mark, that the foreman always puts on; it corresponds with our stock-book. There was a ticket upon it; that is torn off. and here is the King's mark, 168, the Excise mark. We only had one piece of this pattern. By the chalk mark and the Excise mark I am certain this is the piece.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Princes-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner about nine or ten years; he was a respectable man, a publican I have known him in two public-houses. He kept a public-house since I have been in my house. On Saturday evening, the 4th of June, between eight and nine o'clock, he came to my house; he had this piece of floor cloths. I am sure it is the same, because I put a mark upon it myself. He opened the door, and said, how do you do, Mr. Swan. I said, how do you do, Mr. Payne; what have you got there, and where are you going to take it. As I understood him, he said, over the way. He asked for a pint of half and half. He asked me to roll it up to the bar, as I supposed, while he drank it. My servant brought him the pint of half and half. I went to get a poundsworth of change; during this time he drank the pint of half and half, and was gone, but had left the cloth. I looked at the goods; seeing it was not tied, I thought it was not honestly come by. I informed the officer of it. Green was the officer that came round. It was in my custody from that time until the next morning, and then I delivered it to Green. I put my name upon it, and I cut this piece out of it. I am sure it is the same. I delivered it to the officer, and said, for God's sake, do not take any body up until he knew it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not your bar a conspicuous part of your house - A. It is very public; if any body came in they must have seen it perfectly.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 4th of June, I was going with the picquet between ten and eleven at night; I called at Mr. Swan's. Mr. Swan said, here is a piece of oil-cloth, Green; Mr. Payne brought it here. The floor-cloth remained until Sunday morning, the 5th, then I took it away. I watched the house on Saturday night until Mr. Swan shut up. On Sunday morning, I got up, and went to the house before Mr. Swan opened the house. I saw Payne go into the house; he called for a glass of gin; he said, I have called for the oil-cloth. I said, Mr. Payne, I want you and the oil-cloth too; this oil-cloth is stolen. He turned white, and trembled, and could hardly drink the glass of gin. I took him into custody, and took him to Tothill-fields. I came back, and took the oil-cloth away to my own house. This is the oil-cloth.</p>

               <p>Q. What made you go into Lisle-street - A. That is my nearest way home from Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor at all - A. No, I was not. I was by myself. I was coming along Lisle-street; the prisoner at the bar, two more men, and a woman, I saw in Lisle-street. I did not see them until the prisoner accosted me. They came behind me; the prisoner laid hold of me on the shoulder; (they had a woman in company) he said I promised to give the woman some money, and that I had been ill-treating her. There was no truth in that; I had never seen any of them before to the best of my knowledge. He said I had been ill-treating her, and if I did not make her some compensation, he being a constable of the night, he would take me to the watchhouse; I told him I had no money about me. One of the party began to abuse me, and charge me with an unnatural crime, and told me I was a well known character. I was very frightened. I told him I had some silver, and offered them a three-shilling token first. One of the party asked what I had given him; he said, a three-shilling piece The other man said, that is not enough; give it him back; if he does not give you more I will knock the b - y b - r in the kennel. The prisoner had hold of me all the while. The prisoner gave me the three-shilling token back. I began to be very much frightened. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out an eighteen-penny token and a shilling, and with the three-shilling token, I gave it to the prisoner at the bar. Then they left me, and I went away home.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, you say, had hold of you - A. Yes, he had hold of me all the while. He was the first man that accosted me.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140706-3-person81">Q. </persName>
            You did not part with any money voluntary - A. I was very much frightened. I gave it to him to get rid of them. I was under terror at the time; very much so. That terror was produced by their language, and their threats to me, what they would do.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. The 19th was on Thursday, I saw the prisoner again on the Saturday following, under the Piazzas, Covent Garden, near Mr. Robins's, the auctioneer's, door.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you for suggesting the prisoner to be the same person - A. He was holding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060005"/>me all the while; I had such an opportunity of observing his person, as to be sure he is the same person. I think it was moonlight. It was very starlight.</p>
               <p>Q. From first to last, how long were they with you - A. It might be ten minutes altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the person who principally spoke - A. No; he had hold of me all the while, and he took the money</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him on Saturday under the Piazzas - A. Yes. I went up to him, and spoke to him, and said, you are a constable of the night, are not you; no, he said. I then said, do not you remember the circumstance that took place in Lisle-street. He walked away. I followed him up James-street, Covent Garden. He said he was going home to his lodging. When he got into Cross-street, he ran away; I pursued him. He went into a public-house in King-street; he said, you may follow me in here; I am well known in here; I have lodged here some years. I followed him in, and saw him in the tap-room; then I came out and got the patrol, and had him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go to get the patrol - A. The patrol, I believe, was at the door; he heard me call out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any opportunity of getting out of that house before you returned with the patrol - A. No. The patrol went in. There was a piece of work with the landlord and some of the people. This person came out; he was taken about half a dozen doors from that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any opportunity of getting away before the patrol came - A. I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is King-street from Cross-street - A. About fifty or sixty yards. King-street and Cross-street is in a line. He ran so quick I could hardly overtake him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry stop thief - A. No, I did not. I was so much agitated I did not know what to do hardly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with you on this Saturday night - A. No. He was taken before the magistrate, and was remanded until the Thursday morning. In the interim I had this letter sent; I don't know who it came from. He was brought up on the Thursday following; he was remanded for another examination. He was taken ill in prison; it was three or four weeks before he was committed; he was never out of custody afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you when Scotland spoke to you - A. I was in King-street, Seven Dials. When he called watch, I was near as I am to the bench. He called watch. The prosecutor said the prisoner had robbed him. I went and took the prisoner into custody. On Monday, the prosecutor gave evidence against the prisoner at Marlborough-street; the prisoner denied every thing of it, and also at the watch-house. The prisoner said, before the magistrate, had it not been for him the prosecutor would have been very roughly used.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing more to say than what I said before the magistrate. I was coming along Leicester-square; I turned up Leicester-place; I met a woman; she said, see how I have been used by that person over there, in Lisle-street; he agreed to give me half a crown, and now he has had his will of me, he has given me nothing. I said, charge the watch with him; she called out watch immediately. He said he meaned to give her something, but she was very impertinent to him; he had but little silver in his pocket. He then gave the girl an eighteen-penny piece and a shilling. That is all the money I saw.</p>

I went out at three o'clock, and returned again a little before eight; I went out again at half past eight; my master would expect me home at eleven o'clock. I went from my master's house to Charing-cross, and from there to Whitcomb-street. I proceeded up Rider-street, into Oxford-street; I then went up Berner-street, as far as Middlesex hospital. I went with intention of calling upon Mr. Terry, of Northumberland-street. I returned into Oxford-street again, and went to the bottom of Oxford-street, towards the park. I went down Park-lane, and then I went into the park at Grosvenor gate. This was about half past ten at night when I went into the park at Grosvenor gate. I proceeded through the Park. I went almost out of the carriage road, and went into Rider-street walk. When I came into the foot path, I met Maroney; he was stooping at his gaiters; he said the gate was fast.</p>

               <p>Q. What gate - 
               <persName id="t18140706-4-person89">A. Hyde Park</persName>
             gate, that comes into Piccadilly. He was swearing at the porters for having shut that gate. I told him if I could not get through that gate I could go through Grosvenor gate, the gate that I came in at. I directly turned, and made towards Grosvenor-gate. Maroney followed me. I got into the carriage road; I got over the railings to get into the carriage road, immediately two soldiers sprang upon me. Ashton was the <rs id="t18140706-4-deflabel18" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

                        targets="t18140706-4-defend85 t18140706-4-deflabel18"/> that attempted to knock me down. That is the man now at the bar. The other man, I saw the blow coming, I stooped my head, and in stooping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060006"/>I fell. Ashton directly collared me; he called me a b - y sod, and said he would take me to the guard-house.</p>
               <p>Q. He called you a sod; did you know what he meaned by that expression - A. I know now; I did not at that time. He said he would take me to the guard-house; I told him I was very willing to go whereever he chose to take me, if he saw anything of the kind by me.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said you did not understand what he meaned; what do you mean by saying, if he saw anything of the kind - A. I said if he saw anything that was bad of me, I was willing to go where they liked, so they both -</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Whom are the both - A. Ashton, Maroney, and another. They took me down the road until I came to the Serpentine river. I told them I was certain what they wanted, that they wanted my money, and the property I had about me. They asked me how much I had; I told them I had two crown pieces. Ashton asked me how much I had. I gave 
               <persName id="t18140706-4-person90">Ashton</persName>
             the two crown pieces that I had in my pocket. I told them I would give them all the money I had if they would not use me ill.</p>
               <p>Q What induced you to give two crown pieces to Ashton - A. I was afraid they were going to murder me. One of the other men felt my smallclothes pocket; it was not Ashton; he had hold of me; with that, they said I had more. I pulled out the third crown piece; I am not certain what crown piece it was. I had two old crown pieces, and one French one; two were English. I am not certain which crown piece I gave to Ashton. I had three one-pound notes and three crown pieces. That was all I had to the best of my knowledge. I had a watch, a chain, and seal. The watch was a gold repeater.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you having parted with this third crown piece, what happened then - A. The men let me go. Maroney came up; he catched hold of both my arms: he let go one arm, and felt for my watch; the instant he felt for my watch I cried out murder. A hand was put before my mouth; with that, Maroney attempted to knock me down. I did not receive the blow. I fell down, and struggled; I could not cry out. When I fell down, there was a knee upon my head, a hand upon my mouth, and another pressed upon my throat. My fob pocket was very tight. I had hold of my chain before I fell; I kept hold of it at the time I was down, and then I had the key and seals in my hand. The watch-chain was broke. I had one part of the chain and seals in my hand, the small part of the chain; the other part was gone; my fob and my pocket were gone; the other part of the chain, the watch, and pocket, and fob, were all taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the fob and pocket were both gone. Was the bank notes in your pocket - A. They were to the best of my knowledge. The instant they tore my smallclothes off they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of your hat - A. I do not know; that was taken away from me in throwing me down. I had it when they attempted to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. When they took your fob and pocket away had you your hat - A. I had not. I had a walking stick with me; that was left likewise. I had a pair of gloves; one was left; the right hand glove was left, to the best of my knowledge. They left me directly I got my head up.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they go away - A. Two went to the left, and Maroney went to the right. Maroney ran away; the two others I cannot say how went away; I did not observe them. I continued they hallooing out murder from the instant that they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pressure so much upon you that you could not cry out - A. When the hand was upon my throat pressing me, I could not cry not. I followed Maroney; he went to the right. I never lost sight of him at all. I saw two gentlemen of the name of Beechy; they asked me where were the fellows. I directly pointed to Maroney; I said, there is the rascal that robbed me. They pursued Maroney, and overtook him; they struggled together. When I came up to them they were all three down; one of the Mr. Beechy's said, why do not you come and assist us. I said, I do as well as I can. Then I saw two more persons; I ran to them. I ran back again, and when I came back I picked up Maroney's grenadier's cap; Maroney and the Mr. Beechy's were standing up, and Maroney was with his bayonet in his hand. I took up the cap, and made the best of my way home.</p>



               <p>Q. Now, that cap; had it a plate on - A. It had not. When I got home I examined the cap; it had no name in it, and there was no lining to it. I shewed the cap to my master when I came home. I took the cap afterwards to the Horse Guards, and wrote my name in it. I shewed that cap to my master, and informed him every thing that passed. He accompanied me the next day to the Horse Guards, and I took that cap with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Horse Guards did you prefer your complaint there - A. Yes; in consequence of that, six or seven soldiers were brought forward. I selected Ashton and Maroney out. Maroney was brought in first. Maroney and Ashton were taken before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any part of your property since - A. Yes, I saw at the Horse Guards part of my chain, a glove, my hat, a stick, and two pockets.</p>

            ; we had been to dine at Chiswick with a friend. In coming home, we came through the Park, we heard the clock strike eleven as we came into the Park I saw not any one until I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, Maroney; the prosecutor was crying out murder. I mentioned to my brother, there was the cry of murder. We instantly ran, crossed the road, close by the Serpentine river; I saw the prisoner, Maroney, running from the prosecutor; I heard the cry of murder, four times. When we saw him running, the prosecutor said, I have been robbed by a soldier, there is one of them, who has robbed me. We immediately ran, and came up with him. Marony then turned, presented a bayonet, and swore he would run the first man through that came up to him. We immediately attacked him, endeavoured to get his bayonet from him; we were down on the ground more than once, and in the scuffle he stabbed me in the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say thing - A. Not after the expression. When he presented the bayonet, he said, by Jesus, I will stab the first man that comes forward. When we were down, there were two boys or men, we were engaged, I cannot tell which. The moment before that, I had lost my shoe, which I named to my brother; he endeavoured to find it, and picked up the plate of Maroney's cap. My brother came up, and said, I have got your shoe, and the plate of his cap; now, we will follow him. We went up to him, and told him, we were determined to take him to the barracks; he said, he would go if we would suffer him to look after his cap. There was no cap to be seen. We took him up to the barracks, a prisoner. He had no cap at all at the time we had the scuffle to that period we took and delivered him up at the guard-house, and informed the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he prefer any charge against any body at the time - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see 
               <persName id="t18140706-4-person95">Ashton</persName>
             that night - A. No. The serjeant assured me if we would attend the orderly-room, he would bring Maroney forward We attended the next morning, I and my brother. I was there when the soldiers were brought in. I saw Milsom pointed him out a short time after he was in the room, and he pointed Maroney out. He first pointed Ashton out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any conversation made by them against Milsom - A. Not by them at that time.</p>

            . I am a soldier in the Staffordshire militia. On Monday morning, the 13th, I was in Hyde Park; I was on Magazine guard at the time, about thirty yards from the Serpentine; I found a glove and a walking-stick. This is the glove and walking-stick; I gave it to Gillmore, the officer. I found them about five o'clock in the morning</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Coldstream guards. On Sunday, the 12th of June, I called the roll-call at ten o'clock; Maroney and Ashton were my men; they were absent out, without leave At eleven o'clock at night, I was called up by two strange people; I am positive Mr. Beechey with the stab in his hand was one of them, and his brother the other. When I got up, Maroney was without his grenadiers cap.</p>

            No, he did not. This is the cap that was brought to the orderly-room the next morning, and this plate is the same as is worn by the grenadiers of our regiment. This is such a cap as Maroney ought to have had on; this plate fits the mark of the cap where a plate has been.</p>
               <p>Maroney. Was not I coming off guard - A. It was your duty to be in readiness to go on the Queen's guard; that guard was not wanted. The guard was dismissed a little before. It is possible that Maroney was on the spot; he ought to have been present at roll-call or a few minutes afterwards.</p>

I at last, said to Ashton, I hope you are throwing nothing down the privy; he said, no. He then said, he did not knock the man down; he knew who did He said, he should say all he knew when he came before the grand board. I handcuffed him to Maroney, and another of the name of Davis.</p>

            , ESQ. I reside in Adelphi-terrace. On Sunday night, the 12th of June, the prosecutor came home near twelve o'clock; he was out with my permission; I expected him home at eleven. He came up to my bedchamber; he had- the appearance of a man wild, a frenzy appearance; his breeches were torn by violence, the fob-pocket completely rent from the garment; he brought a grenadier's cap with him on Sunday night. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060008"/>the next morning, I went with him to the Tilt-yard, the commanding officer was not there, Afterwards, the prisoners were brought before Colonel

             asked the prisoners if Milsom had been guilty of any thing improper; they answered, no.</p>
               <p>Maroney's Defence. This night, I met this gentleman in the Park; I was buttoning the knees of my gaiters; I told him the gate was locked. He said, have you got a woman; I said, no. He said if I would come along with him, he would get me one; I replied, that, I did not mind. He took me across the path-way, to the grove; he stopped there: he opened the flap of his smallclothes, took out the flap of his shirt, he then pulled out what he had; he asked me whether that would do for a woman; this man and his comrade came up, and boned him, called him a b - y sod; he immediately made a dart to get away; one of them knocked him down. He got up, and said, all the money I have, I will give you to drink. We said, we do not want your money, we will take you to the guard-room; silence, he then said, you want to ruin my character. He then said, he had got six shillings, I will give it you to drink. He put his hand into his pocket, pulled out two pieces, and said, it is ten shillings I have got; he gave it to one of the soldiers to let him go, I cannot say which. I was in the rear all the time, and never laid a hand upon him all the time. He then said, I will give you another crown to let me go. I walked in the front of them then, and these two men said, they would take him to the guardroom, and when he thought they were taking him to the guard-room, he screamed out, murder; they then were walking up the Park towards the Magazine barrack. These two gentlemen came up to me, they said, they wanted me to give them my side arms; I said, I could not give them my side arms; I will go wherever you want to take me. They said, I wanted to rob the man. Two men got hold of my bayonet; they asked this man to come to their assistance. Two of the men held the bayonet, the third man fell; in falling, this man's hand got down, and the bayonet got in his hand, and in pulling the bayonet from me, they cut me here; it is my blood that settled on the bayonet. I went myself to the Magazine barrack. I stopped to look for my cap, and in looking for my cap, I found the gentleman's hat, and took it with me, and left it at the barrack door. If they brought me a prisoner, how could I be in the rear of them, and how could they he up before me if they brought me a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Ashton's Defence. As I was coming home, about half past ten at night, I got into the Park, there are some very large trees; on the right hand side of walk I saw a person walking to and fro on the green. Some men came up to me that had been upon guard, and asked me what I was doing there; I told them I had seen a man in the Park that I thought was at no good. They went by me. On my turning back in about four or five minutes afterwards, up came

            , who belongs to the same company as I do; he asked me where I was going; I said, home to the barracks. We agreed to go together. As we were pursuing our way home, he said, he had got leave of absence for all night; I said, so have I. With this, we agreed to go into town again. In returning back to where I saw the person before, I do not say the prosecutor, but where I saw the person, I saw the person and the prosecutor standing together; we made towards them. When I got within ten yards of them, I saw the prosecutor with his smallclothes down. Strange went up and collared him. The prosecutor made a spring to get from him; he said, will not you come to my assistance; I went and took hold of his right arm, and Strange held him by his left breast. He said to us, soldiers, what are you going to do with me; we said, we will take you to the guard-room. He said, do not take me to the guard-room; I have got some money I will give you to get something to drink; we said, it is not your money we want, but you shall go with us to the guard-room He then said, do you want to expose me; I said, you deserve exposing to the public at large. He then cried out, murder. Maroney was in the rear of me; he said, let him go. I said to Strange, let him go; Strange said he would not. I left him with Strange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Prosecutor. Have you heard what these men have said - A. Yes, it is all untruth; the money was given for fear at first, and by force afterwards. I did not give it to hush up this business. It is all untrue what they have said</p>

            . I live at 15, Frederick-place. On Sunday, the 19th of June, I was up in my bed-room; I observed three men lurking about the road. I saw one man ring at the door, he tried to open the door at the key-hole; he could not get it open; he went away along with the prisoner. They went to Lady Owen's public-house. In the course of a little while after, the prisoner returned, and the other man; the prisoner got over the area rails, on to the cisternin the house of Mr. Maystone. I then awoke my brother. I saw Wall go down into the area, and open the shutter. I cannot say whether the window shutter was fastened or not. In the course of a minute or two, he opened the door, and let in the other; one was inside and one outside; the one inside opened the door, and let in the other man that was outside. I just at that time, I observed four men coming down the road, they appeared like working men; I came down, and addressed the men; I said, there were two men broke into the house opposite; if you will have the goodness to assist me, I have no doubt we shall take them. I knocked at the door, and turned round; I observed a third man standing with a sack under his arm. I said, to the men with me, pointing to the man with the sack, that is one of them; he immediately turned round, and went into Sidney-street, that leads into the New-road; he carried that sack away. I knocked violently at the door; the prisoner opened the door to me; he asked me what I wanted. I said, you have broke into the house; his reply was, I have done nothing; I came to see what you knocked at the door for. By that time, the prisoner and the other man stood in the door-way; the prisoner stood on the right, the other man on the left. The man on the left, took the opportunity to escape, as I was going to knock at the door again. I immediately seized the prisoner by the collar; he said, oh, do not, sir; you will tear my shirt. I replied, oh, d - n your shirt; you shall not go. I secured him; we sent for an officer. He searched him; a silver spoon was found upon him. I gave charge of him to the constable. This was about a quarter before six when I took him; it was about a quarter before five when I discovered him get into the house. There were three young men in the house; two of them came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Maystone there himself - A. No. The two young men that came down, are both in court now; I do not know their names.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Maystone. I left my master's house about half past five in the morning, I went out to fetch a little boy that I have with me all day. I am sure the window was close down, but I did not put the screw in. I shut the door when I went out, and locked it, and took the key with me. The five silver tea-spoons I had put in the cupboard in the kitchen the night before; the time-piece was hanging in the front parlour, over the mantle-piece; the table-spoons were on the sideboard in the parlour; the spoons are not marked. I am sure they are my master's. I have lived with my master four months. They have been used daily in the house; I have had the handling of them every day. I know them from their general appearance. The salt spoons round on the prisoner, is my master's property; the one the prisoner had in his pocket, has a flaw in it; I can swear it is my master's property.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Martin. I was in the shop when the prisoners came in; Reuben asked for ribbon; she bought a yard and a quarter at seven-pence a yard; they had afterwards several lengths cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Giddes buy any thing - A. No; she was with her at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alarm before they left the shop - A. Master came in, he was serving at one end of the shop; he saw them take a piece of ribbon away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Martin. Did you see either of the prisoners take any thing - A. Yes, Reuben; I saw her take a piece of ribbon, and gave it to Giddes. I threw the flap of the counter up, went and took it from her, and told her it was my property, and said, I should search and see if she had any thing else, and as they moved the umbrella, a piece of ribbon fell out. I picked up the umbrella, and found six pieces more in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that either of them brought the umbrella in - A. No. I believe the umbrella stood on the right hand side of Reuben.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these pieces of ribbon - A. Three pounds, rather more than less. I said, I would send for a constable. Giddes went on her knees then, and Reuben ran away; she was pursued and brought back. These ribbons have my shop mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen either of the prisoners take any of these seven pieces that were in the umbrella - A. This piece of blue ribbon, is the piece that I saw Reuben take and give to Giddes.</p>
               <p>Q. to James Authorn. Did you see either of the prisoners take any of these pieces of ribbon which were in the umbrella - A. No. There were three serving in the shop besides me and my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these three give any alarm of any thing being taken away - A. No. I did not see which of the prisoners brought the umbrella in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reuben. The gentleman took that ribbon off the counter, and put it into the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Martin. Reuben suggested that you put a piece into the umbrella - A. So I did. When I took that piece, from Giddes, I put it into the umbrella. They were all in the umbrella except that one piece. I put that in myself.</p>
               <p>JAMES WELCH. I was sent for to take the prisoners into custody. I asked them where they lived; they neither of them would tell.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was another person in the shop; she begged these girls off; she said, it was the first thing they ever did.</p>
               <p>Welch. She is a base character, and led these girls into it.</p>
               <p>Reuben's Defence. When I went into the shop I had no umbrella with me; there were several more people in the shop buying ribbons besides me.</p>
               <p>Giddes's Defence. When we went into the shop neither of us had any umbrella.</p>
               <p>Giddes called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

The pawnbroker found the next day eight breadths of sarsenet; they have each our private mark upon them. The prisoner was our journeyman. All the servants had access to that drawer.</p>

            . I belong to the Excise office. On Monday, the 4th of July, I was coming down the yard of the Excise office; I saw the prisoner. The basket stood in the gateway. The prisoner had two loaves under his arm. I saw him take one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060011"/>loaf out of the basket; he put two under each arm, and walked out of the gateway. I went to the lad that belonged to the basket. I told him a person had gone out of the yard with the loaves. The lad went after him. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEONARD. I am a servant to Mr. Henderson. The first witness told me that the prisoner had taken four loaves out of my basket. I went after the prisoner, and found him by Wormwood-street with two loaves under each arm. He said a man gave him sixpence to carry them into Broad-street. I took the loaves from him. I am sure they were Mr. Henderson's loaves.</p>

I told him I was determined to find it out; I had been missing money a good while. I went over to call a neighbour who had marked the money for me, (he is a publican) to search him; and while I went over he went into the privy: I went and pulled him out of the privy, and found three of the shillings that I had marked in his jacket pocket.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Morrison, at the top of Fleet-market. On the 30th of June last, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner came with another person to buy a gown. I sold her friend three gowns. In the interim I saw the prisoner with a pair of stockings in her hand; she was endeavouring to put them into her pocket; she could not accomplish it. She took them to a different part of the counter put her handkerchief over them, wrapped them up, and put her handkerchief into her pocket. I sent for an officer. She was going out. I accused her of having a pair of stockings in her pocket; she denied it. She took her handkerchief out with the stockings in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner purchase - A. Nothing that she paid for; her friend paid for three gowns, one of them, she said, was for her.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of July, I was in St. Martin's-court; I saw the prisoner with his knee against the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief out of the prosecutor's right hand pocket; I jumped up to the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him. I then said to the prosecutor, you have lost your handkerchief. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked the gentleman's handkerchief up, and returned it to the gentleman; the officer came up, and said I picked his pocket.</p>

I missed the watch out of my bed-room. I always kept my bed-room door locked. My servant had left the key in the door. I came down stairs, and asked her where was the key of the chamber door; she said, in the door. I went up; I found the prisoner standing at the door, and my watch was not to be found. I at last found my watch had been pledged at Mr. Flemming. The prisoner must have taken it from the dressing room case; my servant had been in the room not ten minutes before. I saw the watch in the dressing use about five o'clock, when I put my cap on.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. I am a pawnbroker. On the 16th of May. the prisoner offered me a silver watch to pledge; she went away. The next day, Mr. Coates came, he said he had lost his watch; he described the prisoner, in consequence of that information. On the 25th of May, the same watch was offered again, by a man; he said, he had taken it out of Mr. Cotterill's, Shoe-lane, for a guinea, and in the afternoon the prisoner came again, with a tablespoon; I had her taken into custody. I am sure the prisoner is the person that offered the watch to pawn with me; she wanted twenty-five shillings upon it; I would not advance her above eighteen shillings; and when she offered me the watch I took the watch into my hand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my watch; I lost it on Monday the 16th of May; I am positive she is the woman that was in my house.</p>

            . I am a wine-merchant. On the 23d of June, the prisoner came into my house with some tools and melted lead at his back; he put them down. There is a bottle-rack at the cellar-door. I had an idea that the prisoner robbed his master. The bottles rattled; I said, do not break the bottles. He came away, and came to the bar, and had a glass of liquor, and said, I do not pay you new. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to the shop, having a glass of liquor, and then saying, I will leave a tool; instead of that, he left solder; they were two bars joined together. About a month before, this man had done the same. This is the solder. I am sure when he left the solder, there was no solder there until he left it.</p>

I took it over to Mr. Priest, and weighed it; it weighed sixteen pounds. This is the solder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. It is like Mr. Preist's solder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday morning, I was coming along Bridge-street, as I was crossing the road I saw two bars of solder lay; I picked them up, and took it to Mr. Glossip's. I intended to take it back to see if I could find the owner.</p>

Our stock is large. All I know the boy was stopped, and the property is ours.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The prisoner came to my shop in Russell-court, Drury-lane, and offered the articles for sale; he said his father had ran away, and left his mother in distress; I said, what is your father; he said, a tailor. I said, very likely, if your mother comes, I shall agree with her; he said she was sick a-bed. I said I will go with you to your mother He wanted to get away; I said, no, I will go with you to your mother. He took me to a coal-shed; he said it was not there, it was at some other place. The prisoner then ran away. I called after him; he was taken. He throwed away the property. The watchman laid hold of him. The prisoner then told me he lived at Mr. Gibbons's. I went with him there. He then said he lived with Mr. Croft; I then said, I should go with him there. I did. This is the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The articles are ours; they cost us more than less than what they are valued in the indictment. They are articles of a superior description.</p>

            . I am a servant to Messrs. Smith and Harrington, distillers. On the night of the 13th and the morning of the 14th, I watched in the distillery; I was placed at the window, with the casement open; where I had a full view of the spirit-cask. Between two and three in the morning, I saw Mason and Cox in the distil-house; that is the room in which the spirit-cask is kept.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Cox any business there at that time of the night - A. No; Mason was watchman. Cox had no business on the premises at that time at all. When they came, I pulled my head away from the window; the first thing I heard was one of the prisoners pull the slider off the spirit-cask; I heard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060014"/>slide go off; I then listened until I heard a liquid running into something; then I peeped up. I saw Cox put some instrument into the spirit-cask, through the hole where the Excise officer dips. I saw the liquid run from his hand into the can while he was squeezing that. After that, he ran off again out of the spirit-cask, and then squeezing it into the can; I think he was there half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, while Cox was doing this, what did Mason do - A. He stood with his lanthorn, giving him a light. When they had taken as much as they chosed, Mason moved his position he back stood in; he stood with his back rather towards me; he moved in the front of me. I did not keep looking the whole half hour; sometimes I was looking, and sometimes listening. I heard somebody walk across the distil-house; I saw Mason walking to the second wash-still, he fetched a broom; I saw him sweeping the dust over the top of the spirit-cask to dry up the wet; that when we came in the morning we could not see what had been done. They went away then, and took the can with them. I then came down, went into the distil-house, and perceived the fresh dirt which they had swept over the wet on the cask.</p>

            . On this night, I was placed outside of the premises to watch; Carver, the constable was with me. I saw Cox some from the distillery a little after three; I followed him about two hundred yards, and then I told Cox, I wanted to go home with him, and after he got home we searched him. We found nothing. He took a pocket-handkerchief out of his pocket, it smelled very strong of spirits; I took the handkerchief from him, and smelled it. I returned it to him some time afterwards. I gave Cox into the possession of the constable. I returned into the distillery. I asked Mason who had been there; he said Cox, he had come to sleep, he had been out late. I asked Mason if he had left nothing with him; he said, he had not. We looked round for the spirit, which he had taken out of the spirit-cask. Behind Mason's watch-box, we found a quart bottle of spirits in a sack; in removing the sack, the spirit run out of the bottle. This is the spirit; it is raw corn spirit. I believe it is the spirit which they took from the spirit-cask; it corresponds with it. I found the tin can concealed in a saw-pit; one hundred and ten yards from the distillery. This is the tin can; in it was five pints of raw spirits; it was warm from the spirit-cask; it is the identical spirit; the same as in the bottle.</p>

               <p>MR. MEARS. I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on Friday evening the 10th of July, preceding her death; she died the next morning. I found her in a state of insensibility. There were external bruises on her eye, jaw, and on part of her head, near the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these bruises that you saw likely to produce death - A. It is possible. She died the next morning. I opened the head on the Sunday morning, and found the brain in a state of inflammation. The membranes of the brain were in a state of inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that inflammation in consequence of the bruises that you saw, or might it be the effect of excessive drinking - A. It might be occasioned by either.</p>
               <p>Q. Is thery anything to determine which might cause it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any such connection between any of the external bruises that you saw and the bruises next the brain, that induced you to determine what had caused the inflammation - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you to say, from inspection of the bruises there was nothing to determine in your mind which caused it, the bruises or excessive drinking - A. No; it might be occasioned by either.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they speak English - A. I do not think they can speak English at all. I took them into the cambric warehouse, and shewed them fine French cambrics; they looked at several pieces. I opened three or four papers for them, each paper containing twenty-five pieces. After five or ten minutes, they looked at the same pieces again, putting the goods behind them, and slipping over packs; they laid them behind them. I then thought they were after thieving them. I waited a little while. I saw Boas attempt to put a piece under his coat. Boas had got part of a piece off the counter; he then saw I was looking at him; he put it back. A short time after that, Rochatz got further from me, took his place, and while I was talking with Boas, I heard five pieces fall off the counter; I then said, you will spoil all the goods. They both appeared very much agitated. My brother was with me; I told him I thought they were after thieving, and desired him to watch. I began to talk with Rochatz; he took out of his pocket a paper. I thought he wanted to take the numbers and prices. I told the porter to fetch him a pencil. While he was gone, Boas came near me; the other took his place. I was in a narrow place. Boas opened a piece of muslin, held it up before me, began talking about the width,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060015"/>saying six quarters; he held it five minutes up; that made me suspect the other man was secreting something; it was impossible for me to see without rising upon my toe. I looked over the muslin, and saw part of a piece of muslin under Rochatz's coat. I immediately thrusted by Boas, and as I got to Rochatz, he turned round; I got hold of him, and pulled the piece of muslin from under his coat; I pulled it out, and threw it on the counter. I hallooed to my brother, and the porter to fetch Mr.

The servants of the firm sleep there; the rent is paid for out of the profits of the business. On the 14th of June, the two prisoners came to our warehouse about half past four in the afternoon, they wanted to look at cambric muslins; I could not understand them. I and my clerk, Mr. Barber, shewed them a great many; they wanted to look at more; we could not find any thing fine enough for them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces were taken down for them - A. A great many scores. They went away without buying, said, they would return with a broker. They seemed hurt that I could not understand what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they were gone, did you miss any thing - A. I went away immediately. I thought their manner old; but I did not see them take any thing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARKER. I am clerk to Messrs. Ainsworths. I assisted in shewing the goods to the prisoners; during the time they were there, I did not see them take any of the goods. After they were gone, I assisted in putting up the goods again; I missed seven pieces of cambric muslin, of two different qualities.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they part of what you had opened to shew the prisoners - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time of their leaving you, and the time of making this discovery, had any other persons been there - A. No, there had not. In consequence of what I heard the next day, I went to Guildhall, and found them in custody, and then I went to Mr. Roberts, the Golden Fleece, Wine-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive of Mr. Roberts any pieces of cambric - A. No; the officer did. I found there seven pieces that I had lost.</p>

When I missed the last spoke I questioned my servant about who had been there; she said, Betey's sister. On Monday morning I found that spoon at Mr. Delaney's, a pawnbroker; he accompanied me to the office, and at the prisoner's lodgings I found there the whole of the duplicates for the twelve spoons pawned at six pawnbrokers. The prisoner took me to these pawnbrokers herself. She before denied every thing. The officer found her in the act of throwing the duplicates in the fire.</p>
               <p>MR. DELANEY. I am a pawnbroker; I live in Church-street, Rotherhithe. On the 4th of June, late in the evening, the prisoner pawned with me a silver table-spoon. This is the spoon.</p>

I had then in market, to the her shop, for some herbs I had been afficted for some months. I was extremely in when I met him. He asked me how I was; I told him my husband had left me; I was ill in health. He asked me to pledge him a watch; I told him I would. I told him I was going to Mr. Cameron, who is my pawnbroker. He gave me the watch, and told me to ask four guineas upon it. I pledged it; the gentleman lent me four guineas upon it; he gave four one-pound notes, three shillings, a sixpence, and some copper.</p>

I went up stairs into the bedroom with her; I found this trunk. I have got the key of it. The key was in it. I found fourteen shirts in it, six waistcoats, and three pair of drawers; and behind the tester of the bed I found six towels. I found a great quantity of duplicates. I found them in a man's blue coat between the top of the tester of the said bed. I asked her how she came to take these things from her master; she said she did it on account of the young man,

            . On the 6th of June last, I lived <rs id="t18140706-31-deflabel182" type="occupation">servant</rs> with Captain M'Keller.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 7th of June, what time did you get up in the morning - A. Between three and four; as I went down stairs I struck a light on the top of the stairs; when I got down stairs, I saw the kitchen-door open, and when I saw the area-door open, I went up immediately to my master, and told him I thought somebody had broken into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060018"/>Q. Whose house is it - A. Mr. Rider's; she is the person that keeps the house. Mrs. Rider is not here. She is a married woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her husband - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Captain M'Kellar lodge there - A. Yes; there are other lodgers in the house. Mrs. Rider lives in the house herself now. Mr. Rider does not. She lets lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up and told your master that the house had been broken open - A. Yes. He came down with a dressing-gown on, took a sword, and came down with me; he saw the kitchen door broken open, and the lock of the cupboard in the back kitchen, that was broken, and two silver teaspoons were taken out of the cupboard in the back kitchen; a pair of gaiters, and smallclothes, were taken off the line. I had washed them on the Monday. I had seen the spoons the night before; I had locked them up in the cupboard; they were missing when I came down in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day light - A. Yes; it was as light as now. The spoons were Captain M'Kellar's; the gaiters, and smallclothes, likewise were his; I had seen them on the line in the kitchen in the evening. The boots were in the passage, outside of the door; they were hessian boots; they were gone, and two umbrellas, which hung up in the passage; they were gone; they were all Captain M'Kellar's. The kitchen door was wide open. The person that shut the kitchen-door is here. I lost a shawl out of the back kitchen.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of June, in the afternoon, between five and six, I went out; I locked the door, and left no one in the house. I returned between eight and nine, I found the door open, I called out hoy, halloo; I saw a light in the back room. The prisoner came forward; he immediately came up the area; as soon as he came out, I laid hold of him, and put my finger into the button-hole of his coat; I said to him, what have you robbed me of. He struck me; I fell back at my full length; he ran off. I raised my head up, and called out stop thief. I saw my child pursue him. I met Mrs. Maddox, a neighbour, I told her my house had been broken open, and I had been knocked down. I went into my house to see what I had lost; I found a lamp that I had set upon a table with a tinder-box, set upon a stool. I missed three silver tea-spoons; they were in the house when I went out. I had them in my hand just before I came out; they are worth six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the prisoner; are you sure, or have you any doubt whether he is the person who was in the passage - A. I have no doubt at all. I know it is the man I had hold of.</p>
               <p>NIMROD BINNS. I live at No. 4, High-street Stepney; I am a cabinet-maker. On Saturday, the 4th of June, near dark, I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw a woman lying down, it afterwards proved to be Mrs. Donaldson. I saw a man walking by me; when he came to the rails, I attempted to collar him. He stooped under the rails, which made me suspect he was the thief. I pursued him with the cry of stop thief; he ran away, and just as Mr. Palmer came up, he dropped three silver tea-spoons; I picked them up. I saw the spoons fall to the ground: they must have fallen from the prisoner. When I came up to the prisoner, he was taken in custody, by Fettis and Palmer. The spoons were delivered into the custody of the constable, and the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. I live at No. 1, Abel's-buildings, Goodman's-fields. On Saturday, the 4th of June, about half after eight, I had occasion to go to Stepney. I saw the prisoner, and the last witness pursuing him. I heard the cry of stop thief. I crossed the way to look at the prisoner; he made a run against me, in order to baffle me from catching him; I followed him as far Cottage Grove; Mr. Fettis came across the road, and catched him. I heard the spoons drop, but I did not know what they were. I and the other witness took the prisoner back to Mrs. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>MR. FETTIS. I saw the prisoner running; I stopped him; he cried stop thief. I took him as he was running. That is all I know.</p>

            . I am an officer. I got the gown at the pawnbrokers, Mr. Graham, in Strutton-ground. I was giving him directions to stop it if it should be offered. On Whitsun-Wednesday, between eleven and twelve, a young woman of the name of

            , brought it in; the pawnbroker called me back, told me the gown was on the counter. In consequence of what she said, I went in pursuit of the prisoner. As soon as the prisoner saw me, he ran away; I overtook him in the space of twenty yards; he cannot run fast; he is a cripple. When I took him, I asked him where he had got that gown; he said, he found it; he gave it to the girl to pawn. I told him, I should take him to the office. Going along, he said, a young woman gave it him; he did not know who she was.</p>

               <p>Q. And did nothing to support yourself - A. No, sir. I knew the prisoner about a fortnight before he sent me with this gown to pawn. On the 1st of June he gave me this gown to pawn, and told me to ask seven shillings upon it. I stopped in the pawnbrokers five or ten minutes. Mr. Gillmore asked me where I got this gown. I came away from the pawnbroker's with Mr. Gillmore, and as I was returning I met Martin; I pointed him out to Gillmore. Martin walked away as fast as he could. I am sure I got the gown of Martin.</p>

            . I am a licensed victualler, 24, in the Strand. On Saturday the 28th of May, about half past ten at night, the prisoner brought six sacks, he throwed them into the bar, and asked my wife if she would give him leave to leave them there till the morning. She was not willing to let him leave them. She came and asked me; I said he might leave them on the top of the cellar stairs if he liked. He said it would save him carrying them two miles. He left the sacks. In about an hour after, some cost porters came to enquire if anybody had left any sacks; I said, they had. They told me he had stolen them, no doubt; they had been watching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take the sacks away - A. No, I would not let them have the sacks. I locked them up in the cupboard. The next morning the prisoner and another man came for the sacks; I would not let him have them. I told the prisoner that I understood he did not come honestly by them; I should not let him have them. In the mean time we were talking the officer came in and took him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday the 29th of May, I received information of some sacks having been left at the One Tun, in the Strand. I and my son went down together, and asked the landlord about these sacks. When I went in, there were two coal-heavers standing there. I gave my son item to mind the door. I called the landlord of one side. I saw the prisoner there; the landlord pointed him out; I took him in custody. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse; I went back for the sacks, and when I had them at the watchhouse, I asked him where he got them sacks; he said he had them of a man of the name of Carter. That is all I know about it. I took the sacks home, and have had the care of them ever since. I went to Mr. Thatcher, and found they were his sacks.</p>

On Monday morning I was called upon by Donaldson, the officer, to count them; there was but fifteen left out of the twenty-one; six were gone. I compared these sacks with the fifteen that were left; they are the same. They are marked with a particular T.

            . I am an officer of the City. On the 28th of May I was in the Strand about an hour before I saw the prosecutor. I was following the prisoner up and down the Strand, observing him. When I came to Akerman's, the picture shop, I saw the prisoner go close to the prosecutor, and saw him take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket. I took hold of him directly he took the handkerchief, and took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's hand. This is the handkerchief; I have kept it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor took his handkerchief out of his pocket; he gave it to the officer as soon as the officer took me up. They said they would send me to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Stevensons. Upon Mr. Jones stating this discovery I was called down.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your warehouse door in the house - A. It is part of the dwelling-house, the first floor. The warehouse door is an inner door in the house, up one pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got up did you find the warehouse had been robbed - A. Yes. We lost three hundred pieces of bandana handkerchiefs, twenty-five pieces of figured sarsenet, five pieces of gauzenet, and three pieces of silver tissue; altogether of the value of above a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>HYAM ISAACS. I live at No. 50, Cable-street, Wellclose-square. I am a tailor, salesman, and slop-seller. On Monday the 21st of March, Lion Levi (the old one) came to me; he asked me whether I would buy any silk handkerchiefs; he said he had not got them with him, if I would go to his house he would shew me them. I went with him directly. His house is in Guildford-street, Petticoat-lane; it is something of a chandler's shop. He took me into his back parlour, and shewed me four pieces of the handkerchiefs; he asked me five shillings a handkerchief; he told me he had got more, handsomer than them. I asked him to shew them me; he said if I would go with him he would shew them me. I went with him to Baker's-row, Whitechapel, to Harris's house; Harris was at home. He took me into a little bed-room backwards; there stood a deal box full of handkerchiefs, bandana, chocolate, and blue. I told him I could not see them in that room, to shew them me in a room more light. Levi told me to go up stairs. I went, and when I got up stairs, Mr. and Mrs. Harris brought the box up stairs together. They put the handkerchiefs on the bed. He asked five shillings a handkerchief; there is seven in a piece; that is thirty-five shillings a piece. I offered him thirty shillings; he would not take the money, and I went away. I went home to my house again. Soon after, he returned to my house; he brought me a pattern of silver tissue; he then said, look at that, that is much handsomer than you have seen before; and he brought me some patterns of sarsenet with flowers in it; be asked me four shillings a yard for the silver tissue, I gave him three shillings; and I dealt with him for the sarsenet. He asked me three shillings a yard for the sarsenet; I offered him half-a-crown; he took it; I bought the sarsenets; I agreed with him at my house. Then he told me he would let me have the handkerchiefs at thirty shillings if I would call and take them away. He went away, and told me to come directly. About an hour after, I went to Harris's house; I found him there. I took my son and daughter with me. When I got to Harris's house I went up stairs; Mr. Levi was measuring the sarsenets and putting the handkerchiefs together. There were there besides him, all three of them. There was Lion Levi, his son, (Harris was not up stairs, he was in the house), Thrustton was there. Trustton is a partner to Levi, as I understand, to Lion Levi. Mr. Levi tied up some handkerchiefs in my bundle handkerchief; he counted them one by one, and tied them up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bundles were there made - A. Three at a time; one for me, one for my son, and one for my daughter, and we were to come back again each of us. Each of us went again a second time; that made six bundles. There were several pieces of handkerchiefs that I objected to, and likewise sarsenetts; I left them behind. Lyon Levi told his son to fetch some more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out for them - A. They went out of of the room and talked; I did not hear what they said. His son went and brought them in in a basket. The room door was shut; I cannot say where he brought them from.</p>
               <p>Q. When the son brought the second parcel, who came with him - A. The son came first; Trustton brought some more. We went altogether three times; we made three trips, and carried goods home three times each of us.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had done, how did you settle accompts - A. Then it was almost night, and I was tired, it being a distance off our house, we went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060022"/>home, and between eight and nine in the evening Lyon Levi and Trustton came to my house together in the evening; they had each of them a piece of paper, and the accompt was put down, and I took an accompt likewise. The goods amounted altogether, what I purchased, to one hundred and sixty-seven pounds. Trustton cast up the accompt. One hundred and one pounds five shillings I paid in money that same night; I paid it to Trustton; he gave it to Levi; they were close by, sitting together at one table. Truston handed the money over to Levi; that left a balance of sixty-five pounds fifteen shillings, which I put in my book. I have got it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the goods which were afterwards found at your house by the officers - A. Yes; the goods that were taken away by the officers are the very goods that I bought of them.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had bought this did either Levi or Trustton call again - A. About a day or two after Mr. Levi called at my house, and shewed me three or four pieces of sarsenet, a pink, a laylock, and a green shot with white. I bought no more of them. He told me he had some more handkerchiefs, about forty or fifty pieces more. He did not call after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the officers come to your house and find these things - A. On Thursday the 7th of April, the day before Good Friday. They found these things in my house; they found some in the shop, and some in the parlour, and I was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any questions the officers put to you did you give any information against the prisoners now at the bar - A. I did, almost the same minute I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information you gave, did you send your son by the officers direction any where - A. Yes, I sent my son to Levi's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you mean to describe to the jury that these things were all found in your shop and parlour, and that none of them were concealed - A. Yes, none as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not any part of them found behind a picture - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect it. I perceive you are alarmed - A. No, I am not alarmed. There was none found behind a picture; they were in the very same bundles; they were all laying in the parlour; they were in a cupboard; that cupboard door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any hole behind the picture - A. I do not know, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear there is no hole behind the picture - A. There is not; they were found in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up in April, were not you - A. Yes, on the 7th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the same story at the Mansion House that you have to day - A. No, and the reason why, I was not asked.</p>

               <p>Q. While you were there did you see Trustton and young Levi - A. Trustton came in while they were tieing up the handkerchiefs, and young Levi came in with a basket of things. I, my sister, and my father, took each of us a bundle of things home. We went three or four times. The things that we took home were silk handkerchiefs and sarsenets.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go there slow or fast - A. I went fast; he asked me why I ran so fast, and why I sweated so, I told him my father wanted him; he said he would come directly; I was to go on. I went on towards Harris's, and when I got to Harris's house I found the officers stationed there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find there any goods which were claimed by Mr. Stevenson - A. I did, ninety-three pieces of Bandana and seven pieces of silk. (some of them had been cut), and three pieces of tissue; three pieces Brown found in the shop; the rest we found in the cupboard in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any picture with a hole behind it - A. Yes, that was at the top of the cupboard, in the parlour; that had been fastened up. Brown opened it. There was a picture hung before it; behind was a loose board. The picture was bigger than the board, so that the picture would prevent our seeing the entrance to the cupboard. It was a corner cupboard; the upper part was boarded up. I produce three pieces of handkerchiefs; the rest have been returned to Mr. Stevenson. When the picture was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060023"/>removed the concealed part was easily seen. These three pieces are bandana handkerchiefs.</p>

I remained with him in the coach, and Brown and Freeman, by his information, went to Harris's house. Afterwards, there was a plan; it did not succeed. They sent young Isaacs to Levi's house.</p>

               <p>Lion Levi's Defence. May it please your lordship - Gentlemen of the jury, I am standing in your presence accused of a charge, if found guilty must affect my life. I trust you will attend to the following circumstance: the man, Isaacs is a well known character for receiving stolen goods; he also keeps a house of ill fame. He has been charged with the offence, he being in possession of some of the property. He first said he bought them of a smuggler, and now he says he had them of me; and to confirm his testimony his son and daughter are the only witnesses called: they, like the father, are bad characters: the son acts in the receiving business, while the daughter conducts a common brothel. I trust with caution you receive their evidence. Gentlemen of the jury,

             was not charged with any share in the transaction. When he was seen before the Lord Mayor as my witness, Isaacs was present; he laid nothing to his charge; and the son and daughter, I humbly presume, came to save the father. I therefore most humbly rely on your lordship's humanity, that the doubtful testimony and character of Isaacs, who was acquitted of the misdemeanor this day, together with the bad character of the son and daughter, will operate in my favour, and in the favour of the other prisoners at the bar.</p>

I missed money at different times out of the till. On the 20th of June I marked ten shillings; I put them in the till; the next morning I missed them. I immediately followed the prisoner to the kitchen, and demanded the money that he had broken open my bar and robbed me of. He told me he did not break open my bar; he had only pushed up the shutter, and he had only robbed me of a few halfpence; I told him to produce them, which he did; he produced the halfpence. I told him I wanted the silver. He pulled out a purse; I turned out of the purse from nine to twelve shillings, in shillings and sixpences. I told him that was not the money. I thought it was my money, but it was not the money I wanted. He turned to a cupboard, and brought me some shillings; seven of them were the marked money. He said he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he bring out of the cupboard - A. Eight or nine; seven of them are the marked money. This is the marked money; there is a little dot upon it, marked with a nail. The prisoner said he hoped I would do nothing more with him than discharge him.</p>

When we were at Santa Cruz, Richardson was in the hold when we were stowing rum; it is about ten weeks ago. The deceased was in the hold stowing rum; he was a little intoxicated in liquor. The man was not capable of doing his duty; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060024"/>laying down on the puncheons. The mate told him to get out of the way: he took a billet of wood about twelve inches long and three inches square; he beat him shocking on the sides, shoulder, and jaw; he struck him more than three times; they were very hard blows indeed; he said, d - n your eyes, (while he was beating him) I will be your butcher. Richardson said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these blows any effect afterwards - A. Yes, the jaw was never proper afterwards; it was swelled; he could not eat his victuals, and on some day, in the homeward-bound passage (I cannot recollect the day) the deceased was at the helm. I stood on the larboard side of the windlass. I saw the mate take the main-brace, and beat him shocking. The main brace is a rope about three inches and a half round. It is not a usual rope to strike seamen with. The rope was just by him; he struck him with this rope over the sides and shoulders. Richardson stopped at the helm until he was relieved by another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he came from the helm - A. Yes, he was like a man out of Bedlam; he never had his right senses afterwards. I saw nothing at all afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you arrive in the Thames - A. I cannot say the day of the month; it is about three weeks ago. I kept company with Richardson until the day he died. I was with him very often.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his health afterwards - A. Not the same as before; he was like a madman. Before that he spoke sensible to any man in the ship; afterwards he would chew tobacco of one side of his mouth, and eat his meat on the other side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you see the prisoner before the magistrate - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he come voluntary - A. I cannot tell. I saw him come in the first time I went. At that time the magistrate admitted him to bail.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to tell the whole before the magistrate - A. He did not ask me; he left me to tell my own story. I did not tell him all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any discipline from the mate - A. He beat me one, that was when I first came on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten to bring an action against him for that beating - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know why the prisoner beat Richardson at the helm - A. It was for something about the steerage. He struck him three times. I cannot say exactly where the blows fell.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Richardson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember anything happening between him and the mate while you were stowing the rum - A. Yes; while he was down in the hold he took a billet of wood that laid under the rum casks, and struck him with it. If it had been square all about, it was five inches round. Both ends of the billet of wood was not alike, one end about five inches and the other end three inches and a half. It was flat on one side, and corner-like on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Richardson doing when the mate struck him - A. He was sitting on the top of a cask. The hatchway was open. We were waiting for orders of the mate what we should do. The mate had given no orders. We were come from our dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in what manner did he strike Richardson - A. He struck him as hard as he could over his jaw and over his cheek. He struck him four or five blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Richardson at that time, was he drunk or sober - A. He was neither drunk nor sober; he was between both. He had drank half a pint of rum before it was served out to us.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he after this beating - 
               <persName id="t18140706-42-person393">A. </persName>

               <p>Q. Was Abbott by when this happened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man's cheek afterward - A. It was swelled up a little; he did not make much complaint about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, afterwards, about three weeks before you got here, do you remember anything happening at the helm - A. No, I was not up; I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the mate and him, and any thing happening to him at another time after that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Richardson when you saw anything happening - A. He was abaft the windlass. Richardson was working upon a platt, the mate came and asked him why he was doing the platt such a foolish way. He did not do the work properly. Richardson had not his proper senses, nor never had since he was driven from the helm.</p>
               <p>Q. Not having done this, what did the mate do to him - A. He struck him with a two and a half inch rope, with a foretopmast staysail halliard. He gave him six or seven blows, some over his arm, thigh, and backside, as the man turned himself about. Sometimes the mate held the rope with one hand, and sometimes with both hands. The captain came forward in the forecastle, and asked him what was the matter with him. The prisoner was not by at the time. I was not present when Richardson was driven from the helm.</p>

Richardson was at work; the mate came to him; the mate told him to go to work about the platt; the more he endeavoured to clear them the more he warped them.</p>
               <p>Q. To what was that owing - A. It appeared to me the man was quite delirious.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he always been so - A. No; a few days before we left Santa Cruz he was so, and continued so all the way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that known by every body in the ship - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What day did you leave the country - A. I cannot say. We were six weeks coming; we got home on the 22nd of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you left the country did he become in this state - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man could not disentangle the foxes what did the mate do to him - A. He took up a rope<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060025"/>immediately, a three inch rope, and struck him over his back and loins. He gave him about a dozen blows altogether; they were heavy blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he after this beating - A. He was the same as before; quite out of his mind; he was quite sullen stupid; he never spoke anything to any one. He was about forty. He came on board a ruptured man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the coroner that he became ill after he received that beating, and remained so until he came on shore - A. Yes; he was the same before he was beat, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether that is not your hand-writing - A. It is, I told the coroner the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. It is here stated that he became ill soon after this beating, and continued so until he came on shore - A. That is not true.</p>

Yes; I cannot say exactly the day of the month; it was between two and three weeks before the ships arrival; it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning; as he was at the helm, the mate took up a three-inch rope, and struck him about eight blows, as nigh as I can tell; he struck him two or three blows over the head, and some more over the body. He took the rope in both hands. About two o'clock in the same day he received some more blows from the mate as he was standing on the larboard side, abaft the windlass.

            . I live in Bluegate-place, Shadwell. Richardson lodged in my house before this voyage, and when he returned home he came to my house as usual. When he came, he came to the window instead of to the door: he came as though his brain was turned, and his eyes were turned in his head. I sent for a tailor, and had him some clothes made, and a shoemaker for some shoes. He had his breakfast, and went to Shadwell office. I did not go with him, nor did I did I know of it until next day. As soon as he had been to the office he came home and went to bed. This was on Wednesday that he came home to my house; on Thursday he got up, and wanted to go out again; I took his hat from him, and told him I did not want any law work. On Friday morning I sent for a doctor; he was gritting his teeth as if in a convulsion fit. Dr. Ball came, and Mr. Rutherford likewise. Richardson never got out of his bed; he died on Monday morning.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I opened the body of Richardson. Upon examining the body I found several bruises; one on each of his sides, and on the left arm, and particularly under the left ear, and two or three slight bruises about the head. I opened the head, and perceived the man's death was occasioned from inflammation of the brain, the cause of which I cannot say. The bruises might be the cause of it, or might not. Principally an inflammation arises from excessive drinking of spirits.</p>

            , was brought there on Monday the 28th of June, near eleven in the forenoon; he died on the 20th, at near eleven o'clock at night. I examined his body after his death; I found a rupture in the right groin, and a laceration of the several intestines, and a very violent inflammation all over the abdomen. I conceive the violence done to the abdomen was the cause of his death. The rupture was a recent one. The rupture and the inflammation were connected; I conceive they were both done at the same time; both originated by the violence done to the abdomen. The hernia was produced at the time he was kicked or struck.</p>

            . I am surgeon's beadle of the London hospital I saw the deceased, O'Brien, brought there on the 28th of June; he died on the 29th. He was very ill indeed when brought in, and growing worse from the time he was brought in until he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he believe himself to be a dying man at the moment he was brought in - A. He was told so by the magistrate when he took his deposition, and he believed himself to be a dying man; he told me so as I was helping him in; he appeared to be a man approaching to his dissolution.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, while under the apprehension of his approaching death did he tell you anything - A. He told me the day prior to his being brought to the hospital there had been a quarrel with him and M'Guire; there was a challenge given to fight; he could not recollect whether he gave it, or whether the prisoner challenged him; he said, after that, in the afternoon, they met again, and he was dragged into an entry in the court, and kicked, and struck. I asked him particularly who did it; he said, M'Guire.</p>

On Monday morning, the 27th of June, M'Guire gave O'Brien a challenge to fight; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060026"/>deceased refused. In the afternoon, between four and five o'clock, the deceased came up the court; the prisoner abused him and his wife very much. The deceased then challenged to fight, and struck the first blow. They fought together. The prisoner dragged the deceased into a passage; what happened after I cannot say. He was in the passage about five minutes; the deceased came out; he got up to the landing of his own stairs; he could get no farther. I went to help him; he begged of me to let him lay still. That is all I know, except the prisoner called the deceased many foul names.</p>

They met again in the afternoon; then the deceased gave the challenge to fight. The deceased gave the first blow; there were only two blows given on both sides. I did not see them in the passage. I saw the deceased come out of the passage; his mouth was filled with blood.</p>

On the 23rd of June, the prisoner came blusteringly hallooing out, Millwood, Millwood, give me change for a two-pound note; when he hallooed out the name of Millwood, my husband was not at home; he called at the door; I came to the door to give him two one-pound notes, all that I had. I received of him a two-pound note, apparently, in return. I put the note I received of him into my pocket book; there was no other note there; he said, at the time that I gave him the change, Mr. Powell, I am coming. I went to the door, and saw him go to Mr. Powell. Mr. Powell lives at the next door to me. As I had seen the prisoner several times before, I wondered where he lived. This attracted my attention. I took particular notice of his person. I kept the note in my pocket-book until about ten o'clock at night. Mr. Millwood came home; I gave it him to buy fish the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of anything that passed did you see the prisoner on the next day - A. In the course of the next day I had suspicion that the note was a forged one. Before that suspicion had arisen, the prisoner passed my door. About ten minutes before word was brought me, he stood and stared at me. I thought him a gentleman; I curtsied at him, thinking him a gentleman. On the next Saturday, at half after three o'clock, I saw the prisoner walk before me in Thames-street; I went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder; I said he was the gentleman I was looking for; he said he knew nothing of me. I took hold of his collar, and said he must go with me. He offered to put his hand into his pocket; he said if two pound was any object, he would give me two pound, or any money that he had; he pulled out a handful of notes, a good many. I then told him if he gave me the King's dominion I would not take it; he then put them in his pocket. I said he must go with me. When I got into Little Trinity-lane, where I live, he ran away; there he set off running; I called out, stop thief; my husband heard me; he came to my assistance; he and Mr. Powell together took the prisoner into custody; they brought him to my house. I fetched a constable myself; his name is

I brought him back to my house; he asked me for a pint of water, which I gave him; he then wanted me let him go; he offered me two pound to let him go, and some more money that he had got in his pocket if I would let him go.

            Queenhithe. It is my own hand writing. I am sure that is the note I received of him, as any person can be of his own hand writing. I am clear is the note I received of the last witness for the lobsters. I sent the note to the Bank by another person. I have not written the word Queenhithe upon any other note than the note I received of the last witness. I always ask the place of abode.</p>

            Do you remember the prisoner coming to your shop on Thursday, the 23rd of June - A. I do; I have no doubt he is the person, I was at dinner; some person called out Mr. Powell; I came forward; he then asked for Robinson, a baker; I told him I did not know any body of that name. He went to the next door, and asked that lady to change him a two-pound note. My shop is next door; he spoke loud enough for any body to hear at the next door. Before he went from me the first time, he apologised for disturbing me at my dinner. In about two minutes, he came back again, and asked me if I knew any body in the name of Robinson; I told him I did not recollect any body of the name of Robinson. I never saw him before; he called on me the next day.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 25th of June last, I went with Mr. Lees, one of the inspectors of the Bank, to a public-house in the Poultry; I found the prisoner there. Mrs. Millwood pointed him out as the person that had given her the two-pound note. I asked him if he had done so; he said, he never gave her any note; he had no such transaction at all. I searched him. I found good notes upon him, which I gave to Mr. Lees, to the amount of ten-pounds about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there about him a two-pound note - A. There was. I found a key upon him; I asked him what it was the key of; he said it was the key of his chest. I asked him where he lived; he said, No. 5, Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane. I told him his house must be searched; he said, it would alarm his wife; he would send her a note, desiring her to let the house be searched. In consequence of that, he wrote this note in my presence, and directed it Mrs. Mitchell, No. 5, Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane.</p>

I unlocked the chest with the key he gave me; I found some good notes in the bottom of the chest, which I delivered to Mr. Lees. The good notes were altogether in a small piece of parchment; I think forty pounds, or thirty-eight pounds; I cannot recollect which. I looked then at the clothes in the chest; I felt the flaps of the coat pockets; there were four or five coats. I felt something in the pocket flaps of three of them; the coats are here; I found in this coat eight two-pound notes, slid in between the lining and the outer part of the coat; this was only in one flap. Here is another coat; I found in his coat nine two-pound notes on one side, and eleven on the other side; all two-pound notes.</p>

In coat No. 2, I found nine and eleven; these are the nine; I marked them before I parted with them: these are the eleven.

In consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060029"/>of that, the prisoner was searched, and the bags were found upon him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARE. I am an officer, and a labourer in the spice warehouse, where the nutmegs were. The prisoner was also a labourer. I searched the prisoner. I found forty-four nutmegs in his coat pocket, and two pounds of nutmegs in his breeches pocket; he pulled them out of his breeches and delivered them into my hands. I found two bags of nutmegs upon him. He said, he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. I was there when his lodgings were searched. We found six pounds of nutmegs there; they are worth ten shillings a pound, exclusive of the duty.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; we are drug brokers, Queen-street, Cheapside. The prisoner was my clerk, in March last; he was entrusted to receive money on my account; he was to pay it over to us. He never accounted to either of us for the two pound ten shillings and sixpence received of Mr. Pilham. I told him I discovered on going round to several of my customers, that he had received brokerage, but to what extent, I did not know; he then told me. I neither threatened or promised him any thing whatever. He then set down on this paper, and what he could not remember he took out of the ledger; he set down this two pounds ten shillings and sixpence, as part he had received of Mr. Stewart on my account, and had never accompted for it to us. This conversation took place on the 15th of June; I had dismissed him prior to that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was taking out a truss to go to Mr. Denbigh's, Monument yard; the truss weighed an hundred and a half, and just as my back was turned, this other truss was taken out of my cart.

I suspected they were robbing the cart. The man in the cart helped a truss on the shoulder of the other man on the ground. I was convinced they were thieving the truss. I followed the man with the truss, and brought him back to the cart again, and delivered him and the pack in the charge of Smart. The prisoner is the man, and this is the pack.

            . I am in Mr. Waymouth's employ. I have seen the prisoner came frequently to the sugar-house prior to the 27th of May. In consequence of what I observed, I gave information to Mr. Waymouth. On the evening of the 27th of May, I observed the prisoner go into the sugar-house; the officers were nigh at hand the same time. I informed them directly.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY. I am an officer of Worship-street. I received directions to attend near Mr. Waymouth's sugar-house; I did. On the evening of the 27th of May, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the sugar-house. I stood opposite of the sugar-house.

             said, Mr. Kennedy, this is another acquaintance of mine. I asked him his name; he told me his name was Knight. I asked him what he had got in his pockets; he said it was sugar. I then asked him where he purchased it, or did he bring it out of the shop; he said that was no place to speal about it, if we would go into a house he would tell me. I took off his hat; in his hat I found upward of five pounds weight of sugar in a handkerchief to keep it from his hair. In his coat pockets I found upwards of thirty pounds weight of sugar. I asked him how he came by it; he said he would rather decline making any answer. I took him into custody, and brought him to the office the next morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ARMSTRONG. I was with Kennedy at this time. The account that he is given is correct. He is an old acquaintance of mine by living in the neighbourhood, not from any criminal affair.</p>
               <p>LAWRENCE DEPREE. I am one of the sugar-bakers in this house. I have seen the prisoner in the fill-house at unusual hours. On the morning of the 28th of May, I looked in the fill-house; I saw some sugar was missing from the bin. The sugar produced by Kennedy is as much like the sugar as if it had been taken out of the bin. When I saw the prisoner in the sugar-house. Mr. Brier was always with him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is all the property in the sugar-house yours - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that thirty pounds weight of sugar - A. It is five pound the hundred weight; it cost me about ten pence the pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. For the last two years I was in the habit of shaving Mr. Brier. I considered Mr. Brier to be Mr. Waymouth's partner. I have known him fifteen years; he lived in the neighbourhood that I reside in before he came to that sugar-house. I used to shave him two or three times a week. I asked Mr. Brier two weeks ago to let me have half a hundred weight of sugar; he said it was not for sale; it was raw sugar; he said he would give me some. I told him what he had given me was very dirty; it did not answer the purpose. He said he would give me some clean, which was the business of that night. I took between twenty and thirty pounds; I was tying it up in my handkerchief; it was unable to retain it. I broke the handkerchief. I placed as much as I could in the handkerchief, the remainder I rolled up in the handkerchief, and placed it as well as I could in my hat. That is the truth. I was stopped.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK BRIER. Q. This is your hand-writing to this paper, is it not - A. Yes; I have one like it about me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at this sugar-house in consequence of these articles - A. Ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060031"/>to come and shave me. I gave him permission to take the sugar; he wanted it for brewing. I knew of his taking the sugar; I gave him leave.</p>

            . I am a watchman of High-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. On this Sunday morning, about one o'clock, did you hear the cry of stop thief - A. I did. I pursued the prisoner, and took him; he dropped the watch when I had hold of him; I picked it up. This is the watch that he dropped.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I implore the humane attention of the court, I having no friend alive, nor have I the means of retaining able counsel in the law to defend me. I trust I shall receive an impartial hearing. It is painful and awful for me to enter into this charge. It is the first time in my life I have had to answer for a dishonest act. I have been faithful in serving my king and country fifteen years. I am a native of Liverpool; and since my discharge I have been employed in the docks of London and Dentford. On Saturday night, the 2nd of July, about the hour of one and two in the morning, the prosecutor was robbed in Whitechapel; the watch was found upon me. With regard to any knowledge in me how the watch was taken; all I know, I never took the watch. As to the assault, I am not able to describe, from the very forward state of liquor I was in. Unhappily, from a fracture in my head, when I take any drink I have not the ability of knowing what I do. I hope and trust in some measure that may extenuate some part of the crime, and from every circumstance ariseing in my favour, where there is a doubt I hope I may receive the benefit of that doubt, and I shall how to the verdict of the court.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, when you returned did you find the house locked and secure, or how - A. I found the back door on a jar; that door was shut on the latch when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body open that latch from the street - A. No; they must have come through the other persons premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get that chain and seal - A. I took it on the 23d of May last of the prisoner at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060033"/>r. I am sure the prisoner is the person of whom I took it; she pledged it in the name of Ann Williams; I lent her thirty shillings upon them. They were worth about forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for them - A. Not more than two pounds.</p>
               <p>Taunton. I am an officer. I got this watch at No. Little Union-street, Piccadilly. I apprehended the prisoner in Carnaby-street; I told her I suspected she had taken a gold watch belonging to Mr. Elgar. she denied knowing anything about the watch. I searched her, and found nothing about her; afterwards she told me where the watch was, and went with me to find the watch at No. 2, Little Union-street, Piccadilly. She said she had left it with a friend, deposited in a tea-caddy. I have had the watch ever since. She was with me when I took it out of the tea-caddy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Lawrence is a relation of mine. I had been there about a fortnight. Mr. Elgar came home exceeding tipsey; the watch he gave me; and through the death of my child, and its illness, I pledged the chain. I meaned to tell Mr. Elgar of it. He told me in the coach he did not wish to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Elgar. How long have you known the prisoner - A. About fourteen years. I know nothing of her for the last four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the watch - A. I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before she was apprehended - A. Yes, once she called upon me at the Bank, saying, that she understood some suspicion had attached upon her on account of the watch. She said she had been ill, or she should have been with me before. She gave me her address; she referred me to two places where I might search her boxes; I told her probably I might call on her that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that she had got the watch - A. She did not; she said she was poor, but honest. She informed me where she lived, that I might search her box. The watch that I lost I was in the habit of using daily.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taunton. Did she mention to you that Mr. Elgar ever gave her the watch - A. Never to me.</p>
               <p>JURY, Q. to Mr. Elgar. What was your illness, was it intoxication - A. I can hardly speak to that. I had been dining with the Governors of Pentonville school. I remember Mrs. Lawrence's daughter lighting me up into the room; I fell down. That is all that I remember. I am subject to the bile.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 6th of July what happened - A. I was the first up in the house; when I went down stairs the back door was standing wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. What people are there in the house - A. There is my wife and five children, no servant. I have a lodger. I rent the house myself.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of July, who went to bed last - A. We all went up to bed together. I bolted the back door myself; I saw the front door was fast; the windows were all fast; the washhouse window I did not fasten myself, it was fastened by my youngest son. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; I arose next morning about seven o'clock; I came down stairs first; the back door was standing wide open; that was what I had fastened myself the night before. I first went into my parlour; I found all my drawers open, and my desk open. There is a desk and book-case in the back parlour, and the little door within the desk was cut and opened, and all my papers were strewed about.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things were taken - A. Various articles of wearing apparel; the drawers were not entirely stripped to be sure. I lost eight shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. About two pound the eight shirts; nine pair of silk stockings and three pair of cotton, they were worth about three pounds; I lost seven waistcoats, they were worth about forty or fifty shillings; two coats, one was quite new, the two worth about six pounds; five silk handkerchiefs, worth about ten shillings; a tablecloth, two shillings; two watches, about two pounds; there was a gold chain to one, and four gold seals; the chain and seals, about two pounds; and two boxes, two shillings. I believe that was all I lost. One half of the washhouse window lay in the garden; one half of the sash removed, and the shutter, there was a hole cut in it. I presume the entrance into the house was opened that way. I have seen my watches again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your watches again - A. Yes, I saw them at the police office about eleven o'clock the same day. I saw all my property there, and the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of those things put altogether - A. About twenty pounds I should think. That is all I know of it.</p>

He was coming from Long Acre, as if from Franklin's house; it appeared he was coming from Franklin's house by the direction he was going. I asked him where he got the umbrella from; he informed me, from his brother; he was going to pawn it to get his breakfast, as he had got no money.

Yes; a blue coat, of the value of thirty shillings; two shirts, value ten shillings; a silk handkerchief; a cotton handkerchief, value sixpence; two one-pound bank notes; and three five-shilling and sixpenny pieces. I lost them between eight and nine in the evening; I saw them when I went out; that was about a quarter before six in the evening. I returned a few minutes after nine. My box was in the tap room; where the prisoner and myself lodged. Immediately I went up stairs, I missed my things. The prisoner was in the room when I left the room. He was not there when I returned, and my things were missing. I did not see the prisoner until the following Wednesday. He had lodged in the room with me four or five weeks. I lost my property on Sunday evening, the 3rd of July. I saw my property and the prisoner at the office on the Wednesday evening.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 5th of July, the prisoner came to me, and told me he wanted me to take him into custody. I asked him what for; he said, for a felony; he told me he had robbed a person at No. 4, Baldwyn's-gardens. Me and my father, another officer, on the Wednesday went with him to St. Giles's, and took the two witnesses into custody; they told us, they had bought it fairly, and they would give it up to us. All that is recovered, is a coat, handkerchief, and a shirt. The prisoner told me he had spent the money, and the other shirt he had sold to a strange man in the street; he did not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner his senses - A. Yes. He said these two men had his tools, and they would not give them up; he might as well resign himself up; he could not go to work. I went and found his tools.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the coat - A. I am sure it is my coat; I had the coat made for me; I value it at thirty shillings, it is worth more; the handkerchief is worth five shillings; the shirt is worth eight shillings. I am sure they are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Read. What parish is this house in - A. In the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

On the 5th of June, some time before five o'clock, the two prisoners came in together; I was in the shop when Bowers asked for ribbons; I shewed them some. Bowers took off Fitzgerald's bonnet, said she wanted ribbon to trim it; she put the bonnet on the drawer, in which the ribbons were, and with her hand that was under the bonnet, she took a piece of ribbon. I did not see the colour of the ribbon, but by the motion of her hand, I perceived that she had taken a piece of ribbon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive that - A. I did. I perceived that by her motion of her arm, that she took a piece of ribbon from the drawer; this was Bowers, and by some management or other, she got the ribbon out of the drawer, and put it down by her side. When I detected her, Bowers had got the ribbon into Fitzgerald's hands; by what manner I cannot say; her hands were under the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm before any thing was said about missing any ribbon - A. Fitzgerald said, she had paid me for what ribbon they had; I said, no. She said, very likely it had fallen down; I told her, I looked for the money on the counter. I told them if the money had fallen down, it had fallen on their side of the counter. I pushed Bowers away from the counter very easily, but when I came to push Fitzgerald, she would not move. I at last with great force, pushed her away; I was leaning over the counter; then she caught the ribbon in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure just before that, that piece of ribbon was not on the ground - A. Yes, I am; I am certain it had been in the drawer. I leaned over, and saw her catch the ribbon; I saw the ribbon then, and its colour. Then I went round the counter; I took hold of Fitzgerald's arm, and told her she had got a piece of ribbon; she then put it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time you saw Bowers take Fitzgerald's bonnet off and put it on the drawer, and you saw her take a piece of ribbon out, from that time until this time, how long might it be - A. It might be a minute and a half, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. When she put it on the counter, did you look at it and see what it was - A. Yes; it is here; the officer has it. This is the piece of ribbon; there is eighteen yards of it; it is of the value of seventeen shillings; there is my shop mark upon it. I sent for an officer.

               <p>Q. How came you to let her go away - A. I had only a boy and a young man in the shop, they did not know any thing of the business; there was nobody but me to manage the business. It was not with my consent that she went away; she went away because I could not stop her.</p>
               <p>Bowers. Q. Are you sure I am the person - A. I am; you were in my shop three minutes. I had seen you before. I had seen you in my shop twice before that, and suspected you.</p>

On Monday week the prisoner came to my house for a saddle horse to go to Kingston, and back; I let him have one to go that journey; not on his own account, not till another man answered for the horse. It is a difficult thing to let a saddle horse to a stranger; he was to return the same evening at eight o'clock.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060036"/>Q. What home was it - A. A little brown Welch horse, a Roman nose; with one eye; it was a gelding; I value it and from seventeen to eighteen pounds. He did not come back that evening. I never saw my horse from Monday about the middle of the day, until Friday; a friend of his came to me after I had been searching for him two days; he asked me if I was in the habit of letting out horses; I told him I went. He asked me if I had not lost a horse; I told him I had and asked him if he knew where it was, she said he did not. I saw the horse again on Friday, the horse was at livery at the Flying Horse, near Lambeth-street office, in the care of the landlord of the name of Chuk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the horse that you had lent the prisoner -

            Yes; I am sure it the same horse that he had hired on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his marks - A. Yes; he is a brown gelding, small brush tail, black eyes, and wrashed round. I had the horse four months; he had one eye, and a Roman nose; the near eye was out; that was the horse I let the prisoner have on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not know the prisoner before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to a friend of the prisoner, he came with the prisoner - A. I should not have let him have the horse without that friend had passed his word for him. I saw the prisoner again on the Friday; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiries after the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner intoxicated at the time he hired the horse - A. He might; I took very little notice of him. He hired the horse at five o'clock in the afternoon of Monday.</p>

            . I am a butcher; I live at Mile-end. The prisoner called on me last Tuesday morning, about eight o'clock, he asked me if I knew any body that had got a poney to sell; I told him I did not. I told him that I had a little blind horse that I would part with. Accordingly my lad went with him to shew him the horse. When he came back he liked my horse vastly well; he proposed to chop the brown gelding of the prosecutor's; he offered to take five pounds in exchange and my horse for this gelding; we struck no bargain. He told me that he had an uncle that kept the Bird in Hand public-house at Bow; his horse unfortunately fell down with him at Mile-end, he could not proceed so far; the brown gelding fell down with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was - A. He said he was the landlord of the Running Horses at Brentford. A friend of mine was coming by at the time. I suspected it was not his own horse. I asked my friend his opinion, and he and I agreed to go down to Bow to ask the uncle if he kept the Running Horses at Brentford; the prisoner made an objection to go towards Bow; he said, he would go up Globe-lane. I agreed to that, and as he went round Old Ford, he wanted to get out of the cart; he said, I had tried the horse enough. I came through Old Ford into Bow; I said to the prisoner, you say your uncle lives here, we will have a little porter; he said, no; he did not want his uncle to see him with a bad arm; I said, your uncle will excuse that. I pulled up to the door; he got out of the cart. The landlord and landlady were at the door. I told the landlord I understood that the young man was his nephew; the landlord made no answer. I asked him the second time; he said, he was no relation nor any kin whatever. I told the prisoner I thought the horse was a stolen one; I would give him in charge of an officer. I left the prisoner with two friends that were in company with me. I drove the horse home to my own house. The horse was taken to Lambeth-street, and left in the care of Mr. Coombes, by order of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse that was left in the charge of Coombes, the same horse that you had of the prisoner - A. Yes, it is; I have no doubt about that.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLE. I am a cow-keeper, in Mile-end-road. On Tuesday morning last, Mr. Cooper called to me, and related the case of the young man wanting to shop the horse with Mr. Biggs; I said, I should persuade them not to have any thing to do with the horse. He said, he was going to his uncle at Bow; the prisoner objected going down the road; he would go down Globe-lane. The young man wanted to get out of the cart; he said, they had trial enough of the horse. Mr. Biggs said, you have an uncle at Bow, we will call upon him; he said, no, he should not like his uncle to see him in that situation. He got out of the cart, went to the landlord, told him to say he was his uncle, if we should ask. The prisoner said it was his own horse, he gave two ten-pound notes for it. I said, do not try to lug other people into difficulties. The landlord said, he was not his uncle. As we were walking up Mile-end-road, he shoved us both into a ditch; I got out again. He ran off; I called stop thief. A dog crossed the road, run against him, which impeded his running. At last, I came up to him; I got hold of him. Mr. Coombes came past, he took charge of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor when I hired the horse; when I came round from my journey at Bow I tumbled off the horse; the next morning I was so tipsey I did not know how to walk. I did not mean to part with the horse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any carpetting in June last - A. I lost a great deal in former days.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of fourteen yards and a half being taken away - A. Yes; that was taken the 21st of June, the fourteen yards and a half; it was standing in the front window, in the shew window; it was within the house; I expose nothing outside of my window. I had seen it at half past two o'clock. I missed it directly one of my men came in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060037"/>from his dinner. I was standing with my man and my wife; my wife looked round, and gave the alarm; I missed the piece of carpeting immediately my wife gave the alarm, I pursued the prisoner; he was overtaken; he threw the carpet from him in Well-street; I saw the carpet come from him, it went into the kennel. He was taken at the corner of Union-street; he went to the top of Well-street before he was taken. I never lost sight of him only when he turned round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him at your shop, did you - A. Yes, I did. The carpet is here; some of my work people picked it up; there is fourteen yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it cost you a yard - A. The cost is a great deal more than what I charge; it cost six shillings a yard in the piece; carpets are rather fallen now; it is worth four shillings, or four shillings and sixpence a yard now. This is the carpet; it is mine.</p>

               <p>SUSANNAH HILL. I live at No. 9, Morgan-street, St. George's in the East; in the house of my mother; my mother keeps the house. The prisoner lodged in that house, he occupied the one pair of stairs room; he paid four shillings a week for it. On Tuesday night, the 5th of this month, he came home about eight o'clock, he was very much in liquor indeed; his neice came home with him. I and his niece undressed him; we got him to bed between eight and nine. After I had put him to bed. I went down stairs to get him some water to put by his bed-side, and when I went down, he got up; he broke the things on the mantle-piece; this was between eleven and twelve. When I heard he was breaking the things, I went up stairs; I said, for God's sake, do not break the things. He took a bundle of matches, and put into the fire, and then he put an apron into the fire; I begged him for God's sake, not to set the house on fire. He then took me by my side, and was going to throw me down stairs, but I ran down, and shut the street door after me when I ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you so run out, did you consider yourself in personal danger - A. Yes. I sat on the steps; I heard him within breaking the things, both in my room, and in my mother's room. I went for the watchman; I could not find the watchman on the beat. I then went to the watchman, Hale; I desired him to come and take him out of the place until he was sober. Hale came with me to the house; when he came to the door, I spoke to the prisoner; I desired him to open the door; he would not. I saw my mother coming down the street, within two doors of me; I asked her to give me the key. She went to open the door herself; the watchman asked her to give him the key. The watchman took the key and opened the door, and as he was opening the door, Mr. Elliot unbolted the door. I did not see what took place. As soon as I entered the house I found the watchman was hurt directly; I helped him off with his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a hatchet in the house - A. Yes, when the watchman came back from the watchhouse; that hatchett belonged to Elliott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What is Elliott - A. He is a painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. He came home at eight o'clock quite drunk - A. Yes. My neice and me went to bed in half an hour after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You put him no water at his bed-side - A. No, I had no time to get it.</p>
               <p>Q You could have got it before twelve o'clock - A. Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. He was unfortunately gone down for the water when you unfortunately awoke - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman was at the door, your mother asked to come in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He opened the door to let your mother come in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the door was opened, the first person that presented himself, was the watchman; he expected to see your mother; he saw a man he had no motion of before. The axe was his own; whether he had struck with it or no, you cannot tell - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Before the watchman opened the door, did you hear Elliott say any thing - A.

The patrol opened the door; on the door being unlocked by the patrol, I had heard Elliott say, the first person that entered the house, he would do him a mischief. I was the first person that entered; as I was entering the house with my lanthorn in my hand, Elliott struck me on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060038"/>the arm at the elbow with the axe, just against the socket the bone is cut asunder. He cut the bone three inches over. He struck at me after that, missed me, and hit the patrol. I was taken to the surgeon directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. He had not known it was you, who you was, and what you came for - A. When I came to the door the prisoner was looking out of the window; at that time the patrol was along with me. I told him what came for. The young woman that fetched me was there then, and the mother came up at the time we were talking. The young woman wished me to break the door open; I told her we had no authority to break the door open. He was not breaking the things when I came up; he was looking out of the window; he had been breaking the things before.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was called a quarter before twelve by the watchman; I went with him, and saw Elliott at the window. We demanded admittance. I had my patrol's coat on; he had his watchman's coat on and his lanthorn. I told Elliott not to kick up a disturbance in the street at that time of the night, because it was what we did not suffer. I asked him to give the girl admittance; he would not; the girl desired me to break the door open. I told her I had no more right than the watchman without the cry of murder in the house. The mother came up just at that period of time; she gave the daughter the key to unlock the door; she could not get it open then. She gave it to the mother, and she could not get it open. I said, are you the landlady of the house; she said she rented the house; then I said, give me the key, I will endeavour to open the door, which she did, under promise of letting her have the key back again. I opened the door, and while I was unlocking the door the prisoner unbolted it. There was nobody but the prisoner in the house; then I saw the prisoner when he opened the door; he stood behind the door with something in his hand, which I then thought to be a stick; I afterwards found it to be a hatchet. I then said twice, come out, here is a second Williams, he has got a hatchet in his hand. The watchman went in, his lanthorn was first knocked out. I saw his arm, and his lanthorn was struck; his arm fell. He had a lanthorn in his hand. I was standing at the door. At first, I thought it was only a stick. I received a blow on my wrist, which took all the use of my hand away. I received that blow from Elliott: then I put my hand upon the shoulder of the watchman to get him out; he cut me twice upon the arm. When I saw the hatchet, I drew my cutlass; I said, if you rise that again I will run this through you. He then shut the door, and shut me out. I got assistance. The woman of the house opened the door again; then we went in, and took him up in the one pair of stairs room. After we had taken him down to the watch-house, I returned back with my partner for the hatchet; we found it in the house. This is the hatchet. Seagrove, the other patrol brought the hatchet out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody strike him - A. Not before he struck the watchman and me, and then in our defence we hit him with our sticks.</p>

               <p>MR. BENNETT. I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the wound the watchman had received - A. I did. He had received a severe cut at the elbow, which had divided the elbow joint. The cut was about two inches deep; the blow was within two inches of the point across the elbow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I got up for a little water I saw no person there; I could not get any water. What crockery ware I broke belonged to myself A knock came to the door; I told them no person should come in; who it was I did not know. When the watchman brushed open the door, I did not know who it was. I had the hatchet in my hand; I told them they should not come in. I struck; where the blow fell I could not tell. I went up stairs and sat close by the window.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am an officer of the city of London. On the 9th of July, the night of the illumination. I saw the prisoners from Spring Gardens to Carlton-house; I had my eye upon him; I followed him about two hours. I followed them close in the mob, and saw them take from several people pocket handkerchiefs, before I saw them take the snuff box. They went more than a dozen times from Spring Gardens to Charing Cross. I saw them at <placeName id="t18140706-65-crimeloc360">Spring Gardens</placeName>

I saw both the prisoners round the gentleman, and as they left the gentleman I saw something shine in Hassen's hand like a snuff box. They both left the gentlemen at the same time, and went towards Carlton-house again. They turned up St. Alban's-street, and went to the first public-house in St. Alban's-street, and directly they went into the public-house I searched them; I found on Hassen a silver snuff box, four silk handkerchiefs, one cotton, two pair of scissars, a knife with the blade open, a tailor's thimble, a rule, and a pair of gloves. Upon Burgess I found one silk handkerchief in his breeches pocket, and two cotton ones. I told them I had been following them. They said they found all the things. They said they found the snuff box by Spring Gardens. At the place where they said, it was impossible for them to stoop, the crowd was so great, or else I should have taken them; I could not on account of the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the handkerchiefs the appearance of having been found upon the ground - 
               <persName id="t18140706-65-person578">A. </persName>
            No; they are now as they were found; they have no appearance of having been upon the ground. I have advertised the things four or five times; nobody has come forward.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060039"/>This is the snuff box; it is gold inside. Hassen took it out of the gentleman's right hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Burgess's Defence. I went out to see the lights; on my returning I met Hassen; I had seen him twice before. We went together into this public-house to have some refreshment; Johnson came in and searched me, and found this silk handkerchief, I had it given to me in the morning by a young man, who is gone to sea. The cotton handkerchief is my own.</p>
               <p>Hassen's Defence. On the night of the illumination I left my lodging at eleven o'clock; I walked up Pall Mall, I felt something soft under my feet; I found a silver snuff box wrapped up in some silk handkerchiefs I then met this young man; we went into a public-house together. Johnson came in and searched me, and found the property on me.</p>

            . I am a constable of the city of London. Last Thursday, about three o'clock. I was in Fleet-street, in company with two more officers. Just by Shoe-lane there was a bustle, and directly the bustle was over three men turned out of the mob and went into Shoe-lane. We followed them up Shoe-lane. One of the officers knewing them to be suspicious characters, we stopped them, and took them to the watchhouse, and searched them, and the pocket-book was found in the prisoner's pocket. That is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>- WESLEY. I produce the pocket-book. This is the pocket-book I found in the prisoner's pocket. There is a one-pound note in it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know it to be mine by the name of Styles being on it in my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You know nothing of losing your pocket-book - A. I found the bottom of my pocket cut; I do not know where it happened exactly. I had been standing not far from Shoe-lane ten minutes speaking to a gentleman. I am sure it is my pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards St. Paul's, I saw this book on the ground by the corner of Shoe-lane; I took it up, and put it in my pocket. I was asked by the officers what I had got. They took me to the watchhouse, and searched me; they found the pocket-book. I told them I found it; I had more right to it than they had. They immediately locked me up.</p>

It is about eleven weeks ago they came to the house; they came as man and wife. The woman looked at it first, then she brought her husband; he left a shilling earnest for the room. They took a front room up two pair of stairs at five shillings a week. They staid in the room about ten weeks, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pay any rent - A. No. I went to ask for the rent; they owed twenty-two shillings and sixpence; she told me she would fetch her husband to pay me in five minutes, and ran out of the room, as if to fetch him. I let down the bed, and saw all the bed clothes were gone. I called out to my husband to stop her; she ran away from him; my husband went after her. She took him to a public-house, where she said she had found her husband, and he should make every thing good in a moment. She ran away from my husband. I went with my husband in the evening, and found the man in a public-house in Chiswell-street. He said he would make every thing good if my aunt would take his word for it. She said that would not do. She then sent for Mr. Worrall; he took him into custody. My aunt has never been paid. I am sure they both came together, and passed as man and wife. The man and the woman slept there together every night.</p>

When I was there the old gentleman said, go to your old bed where you used to sleep before, my lodgers all will not be in to-night. I went to sleep in the bed; the prisoner came in and laid alongside of me. I had about four pound in silver in my pocket. I pulled my waistcoat off, and laid it by the bed side, and then the next morning I asked the landlord what o'clock it was; he said it was almost five o'clock; I said I am in time. We work on Sunday morning in mackarel time. I asked the landlord if any body had been at home while I was asleep; he said his lodger came home at half past twelve. As I was going to my work I met one of my fellow servants: he asked me where I was going; I said, down to the Gate; he said, there is nothing to do there, there are no beans come up. I returned home. Coming up the Minories I met the prisoner; I did not know then that he was the lodger of the old gentleman's. The prisoner told me he lodged with old Mr. Tiller. I said to the prisoner, I'll take a drop with you at the next public-house; he said he did not like to go there. I then said, suppose we treat old Mr. Tiller with a drop; he said he would not be up. The patrol met me; he said he would see me home. He came with me to the top of the alley. I told the patrol I had been robbed in the night, and I thought this was the man that robbed me. He searched him, and could find nothing upon him but a crown paper of halfpence and eighteen pence in silver. The constable came; he said he had a bag of silver in the watchhouse. The constable coming down stairs picked up a bag of silver. He said he would swear that was the bag of silver he had in the watchhouse. The officer asked him where he got that money; the prisoner said he had no occasion to take any trouble about it, it was Green's money, he dare say Green would not hurt him. He asked me to take one pound fifteen shillings, and he would try to make it up with me. I said I would leave it all to the officer. The officer said he must bring it before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober - A. He was half and half. He said it was Green's money; Green would not hurt him. I have worked many a day with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning I was sent for. Previous to that I had seen the prisoner with a bag of silver; he gave one or two shillings away. Mr. Green made me strip him naked. I could find no silver about him. I said he had some silver about him; I had seen some in his hand, and coming down stairs I looked in a crevice on the stairs, I found a bag with this silver; I said, I have got the money. I asked the prisoner how he came by this money; he said he took ten shillings of one and a pound of another. As soon as he found I was going to the parties to see whether it was true, he then said the silver is Mr. Green's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received of Mr. Harris, of Tower-street, on Saturday morning for watching, one pound; and ten shillings of another man for labour. The sum taken from me by the officer is thirty-seven shillings and sixpence.</p>

I was following Lord Wellington's carriage, and a person that was with me. I put my hand back, and found my pocket-book was gone. On seeing the prisoner go through the crowd I followed him; I put my hand to his coat, and felt the pocket-book through his coat, and while I was attempting to take it out the pocketbook fell to the ground. The officer took him into custody immediately. Several officers were on the spot.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BRADSHAW. I stood by the prosecutor some time; all in a moment, when we wanted to see Lord Wellington come to Guildhall, this gentleman lost his pocket-book. I immediately collared the prisoner. I saw the pocket-book between Mr. Beal and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JAMES TRURO. I was stationed at the corner of King-street to see that no other carriage come down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060041"/>King-street than what belonged to the procession. I heard the cry of, a pocket-book. I saw the prisoner. I took him into custody. I said, where is the book. The prosecutor had it in his hand; he gave it me. I produce the book.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I certainly was there on the day mentioned in the indictment. I was standing in the crowd the same as any other gentleman might; at the time a certain coach came by there was a great crowd came up; this book came upon my foot. I raised the book to my breast. I was accused of the theft. As to my taking the gentleman's pocket-book I deny. I certainly had got the book. I never took/ it from the gentleman's pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg leave to state that my prosecution is carried on alone by mere suspicion, as the handkerchief was found in my possession. It was on Thursday the 7th of July, I went out on purpose to see the procession at St. Paul's; the crowd was great. I felt something at my feet. I had some difficulty to pick it up; it was a handkerchief. I placed it in my bosom. The officer seeing me stoop and pick up something, took me into custody. The officer is my prosecutor. I never was a moment before confined. I work hard for my living. I rely on your lordship's consideration.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am a city officer. On the 11th of June, I saw the prisoner at Spring Gardens; it was on the night of the illumination. I observed him an hour to and fro with the mob. I watched him from Spring Gardens to Carlton-house. He appeared to be by, himself.

I could not get up to the gentleman by reason of the mob. I could hardly stand, the mob was so great. I have never seen the gentleman again. I and two officers followed the prisoner out of the mob; directly he got out he took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and tied round his neck. He turned round; and saw Cooper, an officer of Queen-square. He ran in about two yards; we stopped him. I told him what I had seen. He said it was through distress. I searched him; he had seven handkerchiefs upon him; one round his necks, one or two in his hat, and the rest in his pockets. I did not know his person. I had only observed his actions that night. This is the handkerchief I saw him take out of the gentleman's pocket. It is a white handkerchief; it is worth eighteen pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a handkerchief on the 20th of June - A. I did; I was in the Park; I presume it was about eleven o'clock when I lost the handkerchief; it was on the day the review was. I did not know my handkerchief was gone until the officer, Johnson, apprised me of it; I felt in my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone. I never saw the prisoners to the best of my knowledge; I was looking at the soldiers.</p>

            . I saw Morley and Savage go up to the prosecutor; I saw Morley take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his own breeches pocket. I told Lawson to keep his eye upon the prisoners, while I went and apprized the prosecutor of it. I asked the prosecutor what sort of a handkerchief it was; he described it. I then went and apprehended the prisoners. I took the handkerchief out of Morley's breeches pocket, where I had seen him put it. I handcuffed the prisoners with a deal of difficulty. I found the handkerchief corresponded with the initials of the prosecutor. The prosecutor came to the office, and swore to the handkerchief. I know the prisoners persons well.</p>

I ran down stairs, and asked the prosecutrix if she had taken in her gown; she said, no. I immediately ran after the prisoner, and catched her in Greek-street, with the gown. The prosecutrix came up, and took her gown from the prisoner. I am sure the prisoner is the same woman. The prosecutrix fetched her master he took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of June, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was going out of the London Dock gate; he had something bulky about him. I asked him what he had got; he said, nothing at all, I searched him; he then told me he had a shirt going to be washed. I took the shirt from him. The captain was by; he said it was the mate's shirt. He said the mate and he had lost shirts. In the prisoner's trowsers I found these pankeen trowsers; they belong to the mate; and this other shirt I found on him belonged to the captain.</p>

            . On the 7th of June, I was in the park; I saw the prisoner and two more; by seeing their motions I followed them a length of time with Barrett, another officer, and when they got to the King's palace. Lions took from the gentleman this silk handkerchief. The prisoner, Taylor, was in company with Lions. We had followed the prisoner and two others to and from in the park. The three men were in company together all the time in the park. It was as much as we could do to take Lions and Taylor.

The gentleman followed me to the officer he would not come in. The gentleman said, it was his handkerchief, but he would not prosecute the boys. The magistrate bound me over to prosecute.

The prisoner had left the house. The moment I awoke I fell my thigh cold, and then I found my pocket cut off.

             I am a constable. I had information that Sturgess was robbed on the Saturday. I know the prisoner well, he is a soldier in the third regiment of foot guards I met him on Sunday morning, the 22nd of May, in Tothil-street, Westminster, as soon as I met him, he and I went into the Checquer public-house; we had some gin and milk together. I sent a person off to Sturgess. I kept the prisoner until Sturgess came and identified him; he said, that is the man that robbed me. I then took the prisoner from that public-house, into the parlour of another public-house; where I searched him; he and his wife were together, and on the prisoner I found a pair of scissars, a knife, sixpence, and some halfpence; after that, I searched his wife; upon her I found three three-shilling tokens, two eighteen-penny tokens, and three sixpences in silver.</p>

I saw Mr. Sturgess come in; he had something to drink; after which, he sat down; he paid my master ten shillings; he pulled out his money to pay the ten shillings. I saw some notes and silver. Afterwards he put his money into his purse, and put the purse into his left hand pocket again; then he came into the tap-room. Ward said, set down; make yourself comfortable; you have got money in that hand for a pint of porter; put that farthing into your pocket. After which he sat opposite of Sturgess. Ward afterwards moved round; and sat close by the side of Sturgess. He sat there a good bit. I went to the bat to serve some porter. The prisoner was looking round to see if any body was in the house. After that I went out with some beer, and returned in again. Ward was gone when I came in. Sturgess awoke; he said to my master, Robins, where is Ward; master said he was gone. He then said, he has robbed me. I know nothing more.

            . I am a tailor. On Saturday evening, the 21st of May, the prisoner called in at a public-house; he sent for me. When I came in he said his dog had won twenty guineas, and I should have part of a bottle of wine He called for it, and paid for it. I saw about six three-shilling pieces. It was about six o'clock when he sent for me.</p>

             thirty-six shillings. I am a tailor, and work for the regiment. At twelve o'clock I was dismissed, and coming down the Strand I met Mr. Sturgess; he laid hold of me, and would insist on me going with him to the Bull's Head, Hungerford-market. I told him I did not wish to go with him, because he was in liquor. He would insist upon me going; to pacify him, I went with him. We had twopenny worth of rum each. Mr. Sturgess paid the landlord at the bar some money at the bar After that, we went to the door, and stood there together three or four minutes. Mr. Sturgess said he had got three pence left, he would go into the tap, and have a pint of beer. The landlord would not serve him unless he would promise to go when he had drank the beer, seeing him in liquor. We sat down together in one box; a woman was ironing in the next box; she wanted to get by me. I got up and went and sat by the side of Mr. Sturgess, and while we were drinking this beer Sturgess laid his head on the table, and appeared to be asleep. I said to him, it is of no use my being with you, I wish to go home. I went home, and saw no more of Mr. Sturgess till the next morning. When I went home, finding my wife not at home, I went to a public-house and got two or three pints of beer, and in Union-street I had four-penny worth of meat. This said dog of mine came in; I gave him a bit of bread. Then, I went into the Marquis of Granby; the dog came in there. I sent for Mr. Macklin; he is a master I have worked for many years. I was in liquor. I treated Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060046"/>Macklin with what money I had out of good nature and friendship. I got quite intoxicated. The next morning I went into a public-house in Tothill-street, Mills, the constable, was there. I had a halfpenny-worth of milk, and a glass of gin. Mr. Sturgess came in. I was searched; I had a sixpence and ten or eleven pennyworth of halfpence. My wife was when searched, and what money she had she had earned. Mr. Sturgess then said he did not know any part of the money, and on the Thursday he swore to a three-shilling piece. I am as innocent of the charge as God is true in Heaven.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a married man - A. No. I suspected the prisoner on account of insobriety. She was so intoxicated on the 24th of May, I was obliged to discharge her. She came on the following morning, the 25th of May, for her clothes. I desired her to wait a few minutes, and she should have them. In the mean time, I sent for a constable. On searching the drawers where her clothes were kept, I found about a yard and a half of cotton, and some small pieces besides, my property. The constable, afterwards searched her pockets, and found various duplicates; here is three of them. There were sixteen in the whole. There are four articles here; one of them has been given up. I took her to Hatton Garden office with the constable; she was remanded for another examination. The pawnbrokers are here.</p>
               <p>MR. SALTER. I am a pawnbroker, 93, High Holborn. I produce a tablecloth pledged on the 9th of May, and the tea-spoon on the 25th. I took them in of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. WALTER. I am a pawnbroker in Theobald's-road. I produce three sheets. I took them in on the 19th and 23d of May, of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at these goods - A. The articles here produced are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with the prisoner - A. Yes, an unjust one. The prisoner had not been in the service of the person that gave her a character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please you, my lord, and worthy gentlemen of the jury the prisoner lived servant with Mr. Norris, her prosecutor. There was no mistress. Mr. Norris being a man of great business occasioned his absence a great many times, and the prisoner not being possessed of money of her own, unguardedly happened to pledge some things belonging to Mr. Norris, with no other intent but to bring them home again when Mr. Norris paid her, which he always did upon the prisoner making her bill. I am in hope you will be pleased to take my case into consideration and in duty bound will ever pray.</p>

I did. I sat down on a chair; a sickness came on me, I came down stairs again; they followed me. I clapped my hand to my fob and said, I am robbed. One of them seemed confused, and was going away.

            . I am a watchman of Marybone. About half past three in the morning of the 27th of June, I had gone my round; I returned to my box. I blew the light out in my lanthorn; I went into my box. The prisoner came past my box at the corner of Titchfield-street; I asked him where he was going; he said to work. I observed that he had a bundle under his arm; he said, he was going to work at Mr. Tyson's in Park-lane, he kept livery stables I perceived a pair of girths drop on the pavement. I asked him what he had got in the bundle; he said, his clothes. I said, you walk along with me; I brought him into Lower Titchfield-street; he ran away from me. Some of the girths that fell from under his arm, he picked up. I ran after him, and catched hold of him by the collar. I told him if he did not stop, I would knock him down. I brought the prisoner round to the other end of the market place, and

            . I am a printer at Shacklewell. I print bibles there, and testaments, for Messrs. Reeves and Strachan. On the morning of the 31st of May my warehouseman came to me. I went to the warehouse, and saw from the appearance of the warehouse there had been an entering into the one pair of stairs window. They had let down the upper sash, and opened the door of the warehouse. There were marks of crows upon the door. They had stolen a large quantity of bibles and testaments, and then they broke their way out. They stole bibles and testaments worth upwards of one hundred and fifty pounds. I have seen the bibles and testaments since; they were the identical things that were stolen out of my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Were the bibles perfect - A. Forty thousand and eighty-five perfect, two hundred Italian testaments perfect, and sixty quires, part of an octavo bible.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the morning that Mr. Rutt's printing office was broken open - A. Yes, on Tuesday morning. On that morning I was disturbed by a cart rattling at the back part of my house. I thought it rained. We are obliged to cover up our work when it rains. I am a brick maker. I went out of doors, and saw the cart. I followed the cart. One man was with the cart, and two behind it. I heard one say, I am afraid we shall not be off with this job now; I am afraid we shall be taken. They whipped the horse to go as fast as they could. They went towards Clapton. This was between two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Who the men were, you cannot swear - A. No. All I know, there were three men with the cart.</p>

            . I am a green grocer; I live at 101, Wentworth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; I have known him eighteen months, or upwards. On the morning of the 31st of May, between six and seven in the morning, I was getting out of bed; somebody knocked at the door; I went to the door; the prisoner came; he said, will you let me leave some things for half an hour; I said, yes, you can lay them down here. I was not dressed; I went into the room, and dressed myself, and came into the shop again; I found a number of printed papers. I said, what have you got here; he said, waste paper, the property of his brother, who was in that line. They were the same printed papers that has since been given to the officers. While I was dressing myself, I heard a cart coming along; when I came out, I saw no cart. After I was dressed, two men came in, the prisoner asked for pen and ink and paper; I gave it him. He wrote a note, and gave it the two men. He then said, I will put the paper down in the cellar; I said, do not put it there, the cellar is damp. He said, it is of no consequence, as it is going to be removed directly; he then moved it into the cellar, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the next day deliver that paper to any person - A. I did, by the prisoner's order, to a man of the name of Laugley; Laugley fetched away the paper by that written order, a part of the paper. The prisoner called again in about two or three days; I then said to the prisoner, how could you ask me to let you leave any thing in my shop for half an hour, and leave it here for two or three days; he answered very short. He said, I will take it away directly, and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that you entertained, did you remove these things out of your house - A. I did, to No. 28, in Wentworth-street, a house that I had the letting it. After that, I went to the office. The officers took the paper into their possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Are you not known by the name of

               <p>Q. Have you ever had the pleasure of seeing me here - A. I have. I have been at the bar, where the prisoners are; I was convicted of a burglary.</p>
               <p>Then you were under sentence of death in Newgate - A. I was; I might be twenty months; that is twelve years ago. I have been here since, for an offence against the revenue; I was confined in Newgate for the offence against the revenue; I may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060049"/>have been twenty months out of Newgate for that offence. I was pardoned of the first offence.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL LANGLEY. At the time this transaction took place, I lived at No. 8, Cooper's-buildings. I went to Buckingham's house, and saw some printed paper by the information of Osborne. The prisoner went into the cellar with me to look at the paper; after I had seen the paper, I agreed to buy it. I fetched away about five hundred pounds weight. I bought it by the lump. I paid ten pounds in part of payment two days afterwards; I paid it to Osborne. That is the paper which the officer had. I went to the office voluntarily, and gave the same account which I have given now. I paid the money to Osborne. The prisoner did not receive a farthing of me; Jem Osborne received the money. Upon my honour I thought the paper was stolen. I lock the paper from a house in Harrow-alley, Petticoat-lane.</p>

            . In consequence of Mr. Rutt, laying his information at Worship-street office, I, on Monday, the 6th of June, in company with Mr. Rutt, found eleven bundles of paper in a room where a madman was laying in bed, which Mr. Rutt said, he knew to be part of his property; that was in a house in Harrow-alley, in Petticoat-lane, and on the 17th of June, I, in company with my son, went to 98, an empty house, in Wentworth-street; in a cellar we found the remainder part of the paper. We sent for Mr. Rutt; he knew it to be that which he had so lost. After I had found this, I went to Langley's house, in company with Mr. Rutt. I left word for Langley to attend at the office; he came voluntarily, and gave some information. Then I took some steps at Buckingham's house; he also attended. Then on Wednesday, the 29th of June, I, in company with my son, and Gleed, apprehended the prisoner on the charge of this robbery; I told him the charge; he said, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q to Mr. Rutt. Have you looked over the property - A. Yes. I believe we have recovered the whole of the property.</p>

He said, no, I might search him. He was searched; the three-shilling piece was not found He then said, I will tell you the truth; the three-shilling piece is not about me; I gave it to a friend of mine in Nightingale-lane In consequence of what he said I found the three-shilling piece at a house kept by a man of the name of Dickons, the corner of Old Gravel-lane. Dickons went up stairs and fetched a three-shilling piece down that had not any mark on it. The prisoner then said, bring the three-shilling piece down that I brought to you. Dickons went and fetched the marked three-shilling piece, and gave it me. He said the prisoner gave it him that evening to save for him. The officer has the three-shilling token.</p>

They had two sheets; they had the third sheet afterward; a bolster and two quilts to use with the lodging, and other things. They left the lodging on the 4th of June. They did not give up the key on Saturday when they went away. On Sunday morning I got a constable to open the door. I found the three sheets, the bolster, and two quilts gone. The man prisoner came on the Saturday after I had opened the door.</p>

I asked him if he did not intend to pay anything else; the lodgings were robbed. He then said, I should be no loser; he would pay the rent on the Monday, and redeem the things, and bring them back.

I then went to sweep the stairs, and a person of the description of the prisoner passed me on the stairs. I lodge in the two pair of stairs front room. I am quite sure the watch was safe when I went out of the room to sweep the stairs. I had been on the stairs five minutes. I looked at the watch when I went out of the room, and when I returned the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch again - A. My husband found it the same day.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW MUIRE. On the 2nd of June, I went to work at six o'clock; I went home at twelve o'clock to dinner; my wife told me what she has told you. I suspected a woman in the house; I took up this woman; it proved not be that woman. The magistrates advised me to search the pawnbrokers. I found my watch at Mr Lane's, in Drury-lane. I then went and informed the magistrate. The pawnbroker informed me at five o'clock it was pawned, in the name of White, of Long Acre. On Monday the 10th of June, the pawnbroker informed me he had found the person that had pawned the watch. I went and found the prisoner in Steward's-rents, Drury-lane. I took her to the pawnbrokers; they said she was the person that pawned the watch. I then took the prisoner to the magistrate. That is all I know. The watch that I saw at the pawnbroker's is mine. The pawnbroker has it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARTLEY. I am a servant at Mr. Lane's. I took in a watch on the 2nd of May of the prisoner, that watch was claimed by Muire. I think it was about twelve o'clock when I took it in. I advanced seventeen shillings upon it. Some time in the course of that day, Muire came; I shewed him the watch. After that, a man brought the, and wanted more money upon it. I told him he could not have more money upon it. I gave information, which caused this woman to be taken up. This is the watch, it is worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 2nd of May, as I was walking along the street, a woman was making a bargain with a man to sell a watch; they did not agree. I asked the woman what she wanted for it; she said, twenty-five shillings; I agreed to give her twenty-two, and as I had not enough, I gave her five. I went to Mr. Lane's, and pledged it for seventeen shillings, which made up the deficiency. If I had come dishonestly by the watch I should not have taken it to pledge where I was known.</p>
               <p>Hartley. I never saw the prisoner before, as I know of. She said the watch belonged to her husband. She came alone to the shop.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Martin's-le-grand I know the prisoner by sight; I used to see the prisoner in St. Martin's-le-grand; she has passed me twenty or thirty times of a night, frequently. On the 3rd of June, I was calling past twelve, I met the prisoner and the prosecutor, they were going up New-rents; I was coming down; I put my lauthorn up, and looked at her; nobody else was near but the prisoner and the prosecutor. Seeing him a country looking man, I thought if he had any property he would lose it. I am sure the prisoner is the woman he was with. After calling the hour, I went to my box; I met the prosecutor; he said he had been robbed of his watch; I said, was it the woman I saw you walking with; he said, yes. The next night the prisoner was taken by the constable.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BLANCH. I am a constable. In consequence of the description the prosecutor gave me of the person that robbed him. On the next night I apprehended the prisoner. I told her the charge; she said she knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please you, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the door of a house in Newgate-street to shelter myself from the rain. Mr. Blanch said he wanted me. I immediately went to the watchhouse with him, where I remained two hours. Mr. Blanch came into the watchhouse, with a young man; he pointed me out to him; he said, that is the woman that robbed you; he then said to the watchman, did not you see this woman and man together just before the time he said he was robbed. The watchman said I was the woman that he had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060052"/>with the prosecutor. The prosecutor solemnly declared he never saw me before. The prosecutor then came to me and asked me for the watch, or one pound five shillings. As I had never seen the watch, I thought it very hard I should pay for a thing I never had seen. I knew nothing of the watch, nor ever did I see the prosecutor before.</p>

I went opposite of my window; I did not see any light, but on looking in between the joints of the shutters I saw a light, and heard some persons talking. I then went and knocked at the door. They asked, who's there from within. I said, here is one. The door was immediately opened to me. I then saw three persons; they were all strangers to me. I am sure the prisoner is one of them. One of them asked me what I wanted; I said, I want you. I rushed upon them, and seized the prisoner; the other two ran away. I called out, watch; the watchman came up to my assistance, and secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any of your paper hangings were gone - A. Yes, one hundred and twenty pieces were moved out of the racks, and twelve pieces tied up in bundles. They were tied up with one string in the middle. We always tie them up at both ends.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the value of the one hundred and twenty pieces -

            Forty or fifty pounds. They first forced the door by a crow. There were the marks of two different crows upon the door. The lock of the accompting-house was broken also. The paper had been taken from the accompting-house, and there were nine shillingsworth of copper taken out of the desk belonging to my partner, which he had left there. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 22nd or 23rd of June, was the prisoner at your house - A. I cannot say the day; it was about that time. The first time he called and left the glasses I was not at home; he left the glasses, with my servant. When I saw him I had thirteen, coach-glasses in my possession. I asked him how he came by them; he said he came honestly by them. I told him I had my doubts about it; as an honest man he could have no objection to go with me to the person that had lost them, or to Bow-street. He said he had no objection to go with me. I was fearful of going with him by myself; I sent for a constable. The prisoner gave me the name of Bateman, in Eagle-street. When the constable came he seemed very much agitated, and begged me to let him go; that determined me not to let him go: he was taken to Bow-street office; the prosecutor appeared to give evidence.</p>

On the 22nd of June, the prisoner brought thirteen plate glasses to Mr. Watson's house; he asked me whether we bought plate glasses; I told him I could not say without I saw them; they were tied up in a green baize. I looked them over. I asked him what he asked for them; he told me he had sold some for two pounds ten shillings a set, and some for three pounds a set. A set is four I told him I did not think Mr. Watson would give more than seven shillings for each of them; he said, that was too little. I told him I could not say any thing about them; he might take them away, and bring them when Mr. Watson was at home. He said, he had some way to go, he would leave them. I told him when I expected Mr. Watson at home. The prisoner called again.</p>

            ; they are coach-makers, in Long Acre. They were in possession of a great many glasses; the glasses are here; they were taken from the shop; the shop is facing of the dwelling-house. The manufactory is the corner of Bow-street. My idea is, that he concealed himself in the shop. I concluded that somebody remained in, and broke out. I found nine frames broken and forced to get the glass out; we discovered the loss of thirteen glasses. The prisoner was a servant to Mr. Houlditch's. I engaged him about a month before; he is a single man; if he kept to his work he could earn three guineas a week; if he was particularly industrious he could earn more than that; we have men that will earn six guineas a week. This frame I remember being made for a coach fourteen years ago; this glass fits it. One glass will not fit another frame; they vary more or less.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One glass will fit another frame. I am taken out of my turn; I am quite unprepared.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Daniels. The prisoner came out of the kitchen laughing. The spoons were missing on the 17th of June. I asked her what she had done with them; she said, she had pawned them at Mr. Burrow's, in Barbican, for a guinea; she had paid a little of the money to one and to another. I said, it was a wonder any pawnbroker would take in spoons of her; she said, she always pawned there; they knew her. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>SPIRE HOLLOWAY. I am a silk manufacturer. I live in Mile-end-road. I went with Mr. Daniels to Mr. Burrows; in consequence of what the girl said, I asked Mr. Burrows to let me see the spoons that had been pledged the day before; I described the spoons and the girl to him. Mr. Burrows denied having taken many such spoons of any such person, or any table-spoons of any description at that time. I returned with Mr. Daniels to his house. I addressed myself to the girl; I asked her how she could assert such a falsity, to say that she pledged the spoons at Mr. Burrows. I asked her for the truth, and insisted upon knowing where they were pledged; she said, she had told all the truth to Miss Daniels. I then said, what is the truth; she then said, that she had actually pledged them at Mr. Burrows, in Barbican, for a guinea. I told her that was a falsity, they were not there. She made a long pause, and then denied that ever she had been the thief. She had previously told me that she lost the duplicate out of her bosom. She said, all this was an invention; I examined Mr. Burrows's books; I did not find such an entry in it.</p>

I missed my handkerchief in about two minutes after the prisoners were laid hold of, and Avory took my handkerchief from Ryan. I am quite sure the handkerchief was mine; it was worth three shilling and sixpence, or four shillings. I saw my handkerchief taken from

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of June, I was in Hyde Park, I saw the three prisoners all together; I saw them all go to the prosecutor; he was looking at the soldiers. They came from him again. They all three went to him again; in about half a minute they left him, and returned instantly to him again; the prisoner Ryan was in the middle, the other two were on each side of him; they covered Ryan. I saw Ryan pull his hand from the gentleman's pocket, and put whatever he had in his hand, under his coat. I saw the hand had apparently a handkerchief, something of this colour; he put it under his coat.

            , a neighbour of mine, was with me at the time. The prisoners then left the gentleman. I went and told the gentleman that I believed he had his pocket picked; he told me he had not; he felt in his pocket, he said, he had lost his handkerchief. I asked him to go with me, I would shew him the man that had picked his pocket, and when I came up to the three prisoners, they were from twenty to forty yards off; they were all three together at that time. I then charged them with stealing the gentleman's handkerchief. I took the handkerchief out of Ryan's left hand pocket, he had got inside, under his arm; I searched him afterwards. I found this handkerchief upon him, and these two handkerchiefs I found in Phillips's pocket. The three prisoners were altogether, as nigh as they are now.</p>

            . I was with Avory in the Park at the time this matter happened. I saw the three prisoners together before the gentleman's pocket was picked. I saw them try more than one pocket; that induced me to watch them. I saw Ryan draw his hand upwards from the gentleman's pocket, and put whatever was in his hand, under his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been near the gentleman before that - A. Yes, they had been once; they returned to him again instantly. I saw Avory acquaint the gentleman of what had happened. I kept my eye upon the prisoners; they continued together. Avory and the gentleman came, and secured them. I was present when they were searched. Ryan had the handkerchief which was claimed by the prosecutor; that was taken from under his left arm. Then they were all taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that handkerchief - A. It is my handkerchief. I am quite sure of that. This is the handkerchief that was taken from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Ryan's Defence. I humbly hope to present these lines in my defence. I hope and trust my case will meet the judicial proceeding of this bar, and that notwithstanding what has been said by the witnesses, there may appear yet some favourable circumstance to a youth at the early age of seventeen, for the first time brought to this bar to answer for any charge of a felony. On Monday, the 20th of June, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I went into Hyde Park; I had not been there long before an officer came and took me into custody, with the two young men now at the bar; stating before the magistrate, that we were in company together; which I avow to my knowledge I never saw the two prisoners before. I will now ask the officer whether he did not observe before the magistrate, that he had been pursuing another one with a velveteen jacket on, and said, he had plenty of handkerchiefs about him. I do allow that the handkerchief that was dropped by a lad, who was making his way in the crowd, I took it up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No such thing; he was asked if it was his handkerchief; he said, yes; he knew it by the pattern.</p>
               <p>Mulkey's Defence. I am quite innocent. I never saw either of these prisoners before in my life.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Powell. On the 7th of June, the prisoner came through the liquor-shop into the tap-room; she did not ask for anything; afterwards I missed two rummers from the tap-room table; I asked her whether she had them; she denied it. I searched her, and found them in her right hand pocket. This was on the 7th of June. She was taken up directly, and has been in custody ever since</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw him take the money, or did he fail to account for it - A. No, I did not see him take the money; he accounted for it in an artful way. He did not take the money from the till; he contrived to withhold the money. I found two tickets of a watch in the name of Joseph Clark. The hand-writing of the tickets and the book is his hand-writing. On Tuesday the 17th of May, it was entered,

            , silver watch, lodger, a guinea and a half. I referred to the file which I have in my hand; I found these two tickets to be in the handwriting of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner how there could be two tickets in his hand-writing. I counted the tickets over, and I looked in the balance book, in which we set down the abstract of the business; then I looked in this book; I found on the 17th of May I delivered one hundred and one pledges; the money received for these pledges was twenty pounds eight shillings and three farthings. When I counted the file, I counted one hundred and two tickets; as no one is infallible, I reckoned the tickets over again; I found there was one hundred and two tickets on the file, and the amount came to twenty-two pounds four shillings and nine pence three farthings. The way that this robbery has been committed, on the 17th of May he took one pound eleven shillings and sixpence, and the watch was booked a guinea and and a half to make up this deficiency, whereas, the watch was never pledged at all. That entry was made in the book to cover that guinea and a half. As he confessed to me without any promise or threat, I turned the prisoner away. The next morning, on looking over some other things, I procured a search warrant; he came to my house on the Wednesday, and sat down in the parlour. I wished to have a witness with respect to what was going on; I sent for Mr. Perryman. When Mr. Perryman came I said, this affair of the watch; I was by no means satisfied. At last, my saying it was his hand-writing, that all the business was done by himself, he then said, sir, I will own it, there was never such a watch pledged. He said he took the money out of the till, and if I would fetch him the day book he would shew me. He did shew me the date and the place.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. I cannot say; I was asleep when it was taken out of my pocket. I went to sleep about half past one in the day; I awoke between three and four in the afternoon; the prisoner was in my company then; he said I had another hour to sleep. I was going away by the afternoon coach, and I awoke by the noise in the house. That was about half past four. I went to the door, looked in my pocket-book, and missed my notes. A post chaise man stood against the public-house door, I asked him what notes were left in my pocket-book. I cannot read; I do not know one note from another. He said there was a one pound note and a five-pound in the pocket-book. There ought to have been a ten pound note and another one pound in the pocketbook. I told the landlord I had been robbed; he told me to go for an officer. I went to Hatton Garden office, and got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who took it, do you - A. No. The prisoner went out of the house when the office came.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor told me he had lost a ten pound note. He did not say at that time that he had lost any more. I learned who was in company with him. I searched the other man that was in company him. The prisoner was gone then. They told me the prisoner also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060056"/>was in company with him. The prisoner, I learned, was a ostler to Mr. Fagg, a stage master. I sent for the prisoner; he came. I accused him of the robbery; she denied knowing any thing about it. I took him to his master's stables, and told him I was sure he was the person that had got the note, and I would not leave you stable until I found it. I proceeded in searching and when I came to a little cupboard, he then said if I would turn my back to the door he would take out the note and give it me. I turned my back to the door; he put his hand into the cupboard, then put his hand to mine; he put this ten pound note into my hand. I took the prisoner to the office. One of Mr. Fagg's men came to the office, and said they had found a one pound note in the stable. I went down to Mr. Fagg; he delivered me the one pound note. It was in an old shoe. The prisoner owned to taking the ten pound note. He said if they hang me for it, I will tell you where it is.</p>

He endeavoured to get away. I seized him in Bloomsbury-square, by the iron rails. The watchman came up; we took him to the watchhouse.

            . I am a widow; live at No. 8, May-place, at the bottom of Brook-street, Hampstead-road. I lost my stockings and handkerchief the last day in June; I left them in the watchhouse on the Wednesday night at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them - A. I believe the prisoner. They broke open the place. They wrenched the post, and broke part of the post away to get the bolt back.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SQUIB. On the 30th of June, about six o'clock in the morning, I being in the watchhouse, a person cried stop thief. The prisoner came the back road where this woman lived; he being likely to be pursued, threw the copper down. He was caught by a gentleman's coachman, and in the prisoner's pocket I found this pair of stockings and this handkerchief, which Mrs. Nichols claimed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These are my stockings and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the Hampstead-road; I met two men, they asked me if I would carry a copper for them; I answered them I would. They took me in a field; the copper laid in the hedge. They put it on my head. I carried it across the Hampstead-road, and going by the watchhouse a man stopped me with it.</p>

            . I live at Caseborton. On the 28th of May, about nine o'clock on Saturday morning, I came to the top of Fleet-market with two bundles in a basket; they contained all the things in the indictment, and a great deal more. A person came to me at the top of Fleet-market, and said, Mr. Lacey, where are you going; I told him to the Oxford Arms, Warwick-lane. He addressed me as though he had known me. He went down Fleet-market with me, turned up Snow-hill, and instead of going into Warwick-lane he turned into Giltspur-street. I told him I was going to the Oxford Arms, Warwick-lane. I told him that I had never been to the Oxford Arms but once before. He said he would be my porter and my pilot. I gave him the two bundles in the basket that I was carrying on my own back, and some money to pay him for his trouble; and when we got into Newgate-street, he turned up Giltspur-street, and went to the Fortune of War. I followed him to the Fortune of War, and when we came to the Fortune of War, this said

The prisoner joined company with me and the other man; he sat, and had two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060058"/>pints of porter. I then said, I must go; the prisoner, Slater, then said, I will walk with you, if it is agreeable. They went behind me some of the way; we came up to Newgate-street; I turned round for Warwick-lane. The girl that had been with the prisoner at the Fortune of War, came and laid hold of my arm just then, and said, master, let us go and have something to drink, and as soon as she caught me by the arm, I looked round after the prisoner and the other man; they had turned round the corner. Instead of running after them, I ran after the girl, imagining she could discover where they had gone to; the girl got away from me. I next saw the prisoner at Hatton Garden office, on the Wednesday following. This happened on Saturday, Whitsun-Eve. On the Wednesday following I saw the prisoner at Hatton Garden office. I had given information of the transaction. I am sure when I saw the prisoner, he was the person that run away with the other man with the property, and I am sure now that the prisoner is the same person.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of the prosecutor describing to me the man who had run away with his property, that one of them had a crutch; on the Wednesday I apprehended the prisoner at a public-house in Portpool-lane. I searched the prisoner; in his pockets I found these two gloves. I shewed them to the prosecutor; he said, they were his; he bought them at a shop in the Poultry. I went there, and Mr Dean said, he bought four pair. I took the prisoner to the office. I have not found any more of the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. to Prosecutor. You had them gloves packed up in the basket; did you see them any more after you bought them, until you saw them at Hatton Garden office - A. I did not see them until Mr. Read brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to go and see a person confined in Bartholomew's Hospital; I went to the Fortune of War, at the corner of Cock-lane; I sent a female to this person in the Hospital, and I was sitting at the Fortune of War waiting for the return of this female, waiting for her to come out again; I had not been long at the door, before the prosecutor came up with a shabby man; he was so intoxicated he could hardly stand; he set down by the side of me; he drank out of my pint of beer, and handed it to the other man. I said, I thought it insulting to make free with my beer in that way. I had another pint of beer, I came out with it; he said I will have some again. After that, he had a pot of beer, and paid for it. Then this woman that I had sent into the Hospital came back. He got up, and said, is this your wife; I said, no. He kissed her again; she took hold of his arm. All this passed while the prosecutor was sitting between me and the man that had the property. Before the magistrate he said, I did not speak a word with the man that had the property; neither did I touch it. He insisted upon my going with him to shew him the way to Warwick-lane, as he was dubious of the person carrying them. I went with him; the woman and the man went arm in arm, and as soon as I got to the corner of St. Sepulchre's church, I turned the corner, and went down Snow-hill; it was my own way home; I left them to go their way. I never saw any more of the prosecutor until I was taken. These gloves are my own property.

            . I apprehended the two prisoners. I told them what I apprehended them for; they said, they bought the ass of a farming man, in Holborn; there was tied to a waggon two asses.

I have seen the prisoners before; I know no harm of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS. I am an officer. When I took Mr. Payne into custody, he very readily took me, and he and his wife pointed out the prisoners. I asked him what conversation took place when he purchased the ass; he told me. The prisoners said, they brought the ass from Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Q. to Payne. Did the prisoners tell you where they got the ass - A. They said, it came from Hampstead; they had not had it long; they said, they bought it of a gentleman at Hampstead; they did not say whom.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners joint Defence read in court. My lord and gentlemen of the jury; as we were walking down Holborn, we saw a man riding upon a mare ass, and a colt; we bought the ass, and sold it to Mr. Payne; we did not know it was stolen. We told Mr. Payne where we lived. We were apprehended for stealing the ass. Since we have been in custody,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060059"/>we have tried to trace the man; we have advertised the ass, and offered a reward for apprehending the man, and if you will find us not guilty, I do assure you, if ever we find the man, we will take him into custody.</p>

            . I am foreman of the pot-ash manufactory. On the 10th of June as I was coming across the common near Bow, between two and three in the morning, Thomas Wright and another man came out of a field in the road, towards the end of a foot-path; they were crossing into a field from the foot-path. We passed them. I said, what have you been at that way; one of them made answer, we have just laid her in a ditch. We walked on about about twenty yards. I had a suspicion that they had been breaking a fence, or something of that sort; and then they returned, and went over the same railings as when we passed them. The prisoner was knocking of some wood, as I thought; I said, you are pretty fellows breaking a fence, and when we came to them, the prisoner was beating something; I found it was lead. The man that was with me, saw the other man burying some lead. The prisoner made off. I took up this heavy piece of lead that he was knocking together. I said, he shall not go off so, I would take him if possible. I pursued the prisoner, and Smith that was with me; we took Thomas Wright; we brought the prisoner back, and took him to the watchhouse, and afterwards we took all the lead to the watchhouse. I said, this lead must have come off Mr. Gillman's premises. The prisoner said he knew nothing of it. I saw where the lead came from</p>

            . I was employed to detect some person that the prosecutor thought robbed him. I sat up in his room on Thursday morning the 31st of May; about three o'clock, the prisoner came into his room where the closet was. While the prisoner was going to the closet where the money was, I rushed out of another close to it, and took him into custody. On Friday night I marked the money. On searching the prisoner's house I found three papers with them halfpence of my marking in his custody. I found these halfpence, two five-shillingsworth, and another paper with forty halfpence in it. These are the several halfpence that I marked S M upon the back of the papers. On Tuesday I took the prisoner into custody; on Friday I marked them all S M. Mr. Lee saw me mark them, and Mrs. Lee, I believe. I marked the penny-pieces as well as the halfpence.</p>

            . I am an excise officer. I was sitting at my room window in the City-road, about half past four in the morning of the 6th of June. I saw the prisoners, in company of another man, pass on the opposite side of the way; they stooped at the corner of Peerless-row; they stood there apparently in conversation. They walked down Peerless-row; they were out of my sight; my window would not command a view of them. I waited a few minutes; the prisoners then came up again; the third man was with them; they stood at the end of Peerless-row, all three of them, the two prisoners and another man. After some conversation, they walked up and down the City-road, and then went down Peerless-row again. They returned the third time, all three of them. The man who is not here had an apron on when I first saw him; when I last saw him he had no apron or hat on. They ran down the row again. I arose upon my feet, ran down stairs, and crossed the road to look down the row. I saw the prisoners with something on a truck, that was covered over with the apron apparently. I had left my door open; I ran back and shut it, with intent to take the prisoners. I ran down the row; I could not find them, nor any watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Monday morning, the 6th. On Wednesday morning, I was going along Mitchell-street, at the back of St. Luke's; I met the two prisoners, in company with the other man, coming down Brick-lane; I leaned down, pretending to button my knee, by that I had a full view of their faces. The man that escaped asked me if I should know them again. I told the watchman I had reason to believe these men were housebreakers. We followed the two prisoners, and took them; the other man escaped. I have no doubt of the identity of the prisoners, nor I never had a doubt.</p>

I happened to be locked out of my lodging; I would not disturb my landlord or landlady, and being a fine morning I walked up and down the street. After I had walked about two hours, the watchman came up, and said, you have got some property in your bundle; I said, it was my own. He said he saw a parcel of bad fellows walking up and down the street; he said I had better sit in his watch-box, it would be safer than walking backwards and forwards in the street, and while he was crying the hour of three I sat in his box. I felt asleep in the box. My property was taken from me. My bundle was taken from under the seat of the watch-box. My bundle contained two pair of boots, five shoes, a pair of breeches, some meat and bread in the apron. Soon after the watchman cried the hour of three, I awoke, and missed the bundle. I got up and saw the watchman I told him I had lost my bundle. After this, the constable came; the watchman related the circumstance to him; the constable said he had taken a man with a bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he lose his fowls - A. Yes. On Tuesday the 5th of July they were running about. I cannot tell where they took them; they did not break open any fowl-house; they were hay-making in the next field. The fowls ran here and there in the barn. I missed two of the hens after feeding them in the morning. I watched for them; at twelve o'clock at noon I missed another hen. These men were in the barn. I looked through the barn, and saw them take the fowls from under the hay. Webb did. I ran after the prisoners, and asked Webb what he had got there that did not belong to him; I said, whose fowls have you got there; he said he did not know. I said, they are mine, and you are my prisoners. I found nothing upon Bliss.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WAKEMAN. I am a carrier. On Wednesday morning. I was alarmed by my watchman, stating, that a man was taken to Marybone watch-house with a chest of tea. I went to the watch-house, and saw the chest there. That is the identical chest. The waggoner delivered the way-bill to me; he is here.</p>

            . I am the waggoner. I received the way-bill of Isaac Boden, the bookkeeper of the Castle and Falcon inn, Aldersgate-street. When I receive the way-bill. I receive the waggon, and all the goods in the waggon. I carry them to my master's wharf, and there I put them.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you carry this to the wharf - A. Tuesday night. I found out the deficiency on Wednesday morning. I discovered, about half after six, a gap in the waggon.</p>
               <p>ISAAC BODEN. I made out the way-bill myself I saw the goods loaded in the waggon. I am able to say that every article in the way-bill was put into the waggon, and was delivered to Plomer. I knew this box was tea. I am sure this article was put in the waggon.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOND. I am a hackney coachman. On the 5th of July, the prisoner came up to me about half after nine at night, and said he wanted a coach to go to St. Luke's. I told him to get on the box to shew me the place. In going along, I said, what part of St. Luke's; he said, the City-road; I said, the fare is five shillings and sixpence; he said he had but half-a-crown in his pocket. He jumped off the box, went into a place where they had laid a foundation for some new houses, and brought up a chest that laid in this place. I then said to him, I do not think it is any good; I shall not like to carry it. I turned the coach about. It gave me suspicion that he had not come honestly by it. A dog was barking at the prisoner. He put the chest down; he was sitting upon it. I said to a boy, go and get a watchman. One of the boys got a watchman. Before the watchman came, the prisoner took the chest on his back, and ran across Montague-square. I ran after him, and cried stop thief. A gentleman knocked him down. I am positive the prisoner is the man who first hired me for the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wakeman. Does that chest correspond in all respects with the chest that came in the waggon - A. Yes.</p>
