               <p>Examined by Mr. Willes.</p>
               <p>We were coming down the back stairs to our carriage, and while we were going from the back stair case the corner of Pall-mall towards the arch, the prisoner looked at me and said something, which to repeat is of no consequence, I cannot repeat the exact words, he looked up at my face very stedfastly, I had several of these ornaments in my head, four or five, I did not suppose he looked at me then with intent to rob me, but afterwards I did, because he took the most valuable from me, he took the pin from my head, which Sir Sampson Wright since shewed me, Sir Sampson is not here.</p>
               <p>Jury. The pin ought to be produced.</p>
               <p>Court. As the pin was not taken upon him, it can answer no purpose, it was not traced home to the prisoner, they do not make use of that medium of proof, but the Lady swears to the positive fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Willes to Mrs. Jeffries. Did the prisoner take it from you with violence? - The pin was very heavy, there were seven buttons set on it, and the stalk was made of silver, and was very heavy; I twisted it very much in my hair, which was very close frized and craped very much; it had a screw stalk, I felt him at the same time he took the pin out of my head tear a part of my hair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. I must trouble you Madam with a question or two on the part of the prisoner? - You had better not ask me any thing, for I do assure you Sir, there is no answer I can give, will be of use to your client.</p>
               <p>I must exercise my very poor judgement on that occasion, I hope you will not think I do it all to trouble you, but because I think it necessary: I take it for granted the Court had been very much crowded? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were many more persons coming there at the time you did? - Our coach did not come early as I ordered.</p>
               <p>Upon these occasions the curiosity of the publick is attracted to see the dresses and equipages, and every thing else which are then displayed, and many of the mob, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070004"/> they are called, attend on these occasions, it was so then I suppose? - I suppose so, I cannot swear that there was or there was not.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, you do not know that you ever saw the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>This must have been rather instantaneous? - I believe he stood two minutes taking the aim as I suppose.</p>
               <p>I mean the transaction supposed to have been done by the prisoner, must have been instantancous? - His snatching and going off was quick, but he stood as I told you two minutes taking his aim; I assure you every question you ask will hurt the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It will be very unfortunate for me and my client if it should turn out so, I beg you will not distress yourself Madam, I do not mean to distress you, I do not ask you one question for the sake of troubling or giving you uneasiness; perhaps you can tell me the place where this happened? - Count Dillon can tell you.</p>

               <p>COUNT DILLON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with Mrs. Jeffries, I was conducting her to her carriage coming out of the back stairs I think they are called from the Princess's apartments, and the coach was ordered to be at the angle, the coach was not come and the servant did not answer, I told Mrs. Jeffries she had better let us go back to <placeName id="t17840707-2-crimeloc10">St. James's</placeName>

               <p>You were convinced as to his person? - I am convinced thoroughly as to his person, because I never quitted sight of him till I had hold of him, as soon as I turned about I saw him run off, Mrs. Jeffries immediately said that is he, follow him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner take it from Mrs. Jeffries's head? - I think I saw his hand coming down as he turned about, but I saw him turn about, and I saw nobody else near except Mrs. Jeffries's daughter, and I immediately followed him, and I saw about five or six persons standing together near a coach about five or six yards from this place, and I saw the prisoner run towards one particular person who held a white handkerchief in his hand, and I saw the prisoner deliver something to this man which he put into the handkerchief, and the person that had the handkerchief gathered it up immediately and put it in his pocket, and he run under the coach, I saw to more of him; but I instantly seized the prisoner by the coat and he turned about, I called out as loud as I could, you villain I have you, I made a great noise, upon which to the best of my knowledge the rest went away, one of Sir John's men came up and two of the King's footmen, and he was taken and confined.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. Was the prisoner searched when he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You found nothing upon him? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Where did this happen particularly, you had got out of the palace in search of the coach and were returning again? - We were coming away from the ball room, Mrs. Jeffries's coach was ordered at the angle but the servant did not answer, then I proposed to go through the great gate, and it was in that place.</p>
               <p>Can you be quite certain, Sir, that you had not got into the great gate before this man was taken? - Quite certain.</p>

               <p>That is the person Madam whose hand was up to your neck? - It is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the pin itself is not produced, but though that is one medium of proof, certainly a person may be convicted of a crime without the production of the thing itself, for the thing itself if produced, would not have tended at all to fix the fact on the prisoner any further than by the present evidence, for it was not found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Did you see them drop the handkerchief? - No, my Lord, in the course of the riot soldier had the handkerchief in his hand and he said the prisoner dropt it.</p>
               <p>Is that soldier here? - No.</p>
               <p>When this person gave you that alarm from the window, were these prisoners near enough to hear that alarm? - Certainly my Lord, they run away immediately.</p>

               <p>Court to Pritt. What passed at the time between you and the prisoner Gardner? - Atkins belonging to the office rushed in, and found the mode on the table, with Mrs. Gardner, and Moore, Stokes, and Partridge standing all round the table opening it; she was also treating them with some liquor of some sort, this was about twenty minutes or half an hour after I lost it.</p>
               <p>What was the conduct of the prisoner on your coming into the house? - Very bad.</p>
               <p>What did she say or do? - She insisted on knowing our authority for searching her house, and rather hindered us from sending for any other assistance, by stopping the door; we got more assistance from Bow-street, and I let one of them in at the window to assist us to search, there were four of them.</p>
               <p>Court. What, she would not let you open the door? - She was not willing.</p>
               <p>In what way did she hinder you? - She went to the door herself and insisted nobody should go out.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what she said about the goods? - She could have no other cause but to suppose they were stolen, they could not have come honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Did you know from any thing that passed whether the other three women lodged in the house or not? - I believe they did not lodge there, they went there directly. my young man traced them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tell us what your young man did? - Sir, I came here to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord will tell you, that you are not come here to tell us what any body else said or did, but only what you did yourself? - I saw the goods in her possession.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. You went about twenty minutes or half an hour after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you found this congregation of women and the things laying on the table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go in with Atkins or did he rush in first? - Yes; he saw it with the same eyes I did.</p>
               <p>Did he see it with your eyes Mr. Pritt; how many of them were there? - I believe there were four belonging to the office.</p>
               <p>Four men belonging to Bow-street office against four women! and I believe the prisoner and Mrs. Stokes were within a few hours of their delivery? - I believe you are mistaken.</p>
               <p>Was not Mrs. Stokes brought to bed that night? - I do not know, it is not my business to enquire when women are brought to bed.</p>
               <p>There were four men belonging to Bow-street office, and you thought it necessary to let in some more at the window; which of you was it that knocked the prisoner down? - Not a soul, no more than I knock you down just now.</p>
               <p>What account did this woman give of her acquaintance with the people in the room? - She pretended she knew nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070007"/> of them, she said they came there, and she gave them some refreshment, and she knew something of the husband.</p>
               <p>So seeing Mrs. Stokes was very much like herself, very big with child, and very much wearied, she ventured to give her a little refreshment? - She said so.</p>
               <p>Did you break open all the drawers? - All that were locked then.</p>
               <p>Why I believe Mr. Pritt they attempted to break some drawers open, but she opened them herself? - Yes, the officers searched the other women.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this piece of mode? - About 9 l.</p>
               <p>How much money did you find on all the women that were there except Mrs. Gardner? - I cannot be positive, I did not search them, I do not know what the officers found, this woman behaved very bad, she insisted on knowing our authority.</p>
               <p>The mode was laying on the table publickly and openly, was not it? - Yes, as if they were in treaty.</p>
               <p>Why Mr. Pritt is there any thing more particular in mode when people are in treaty for it than at another time? - It was open and the folds taken out.</p>
               <p>That could not have happened, I suppose by their saying we have been purchasing some mode, what do you think of it, is it good? - Mighty unlikely.</p>
               <p>Could it not Sir? - It was impossible it should.</p>
               <p>You say it was quite impossible, very well Sir, after that I will not ask you a question more.</p>

               <p>What did the prisoner do or say to you? - She insulted me very much, and called and abused me; I shoved the boy out at the door, she said I should let nobody out; after the boy was out, she flew into a bigger passion still, and said I should let nobody in.</p>
               <p>What did you let the boy out for? - To fetch more assistance, for there were so many women I did not know whether we should keep the mode safe or not; when the officers came from Bow-street, she kept me from opening the door, and one of the men threw up the sash and jumped in at the window; the officer got in, and then we took them away and searched the house; then she consented at last to have her house searched.</p>
               <p>Court. She refused at first? - She did, either to open her door and let us out, or to let any more in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are a good deal in the habit of apprehending thieves? - Yes, but I would rather face so many men than so many women, because I could handle them in a different manner, I searched one woman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070008"/> and found half a crown, I do not remember what was found on the other.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mrs. Gardner giving any account of these people coming there? - She said they came to refresh themselves, they were drinking brandy.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Stokes say she knew nothing of Gardner? - Yes she did say so.</p>

I attended at the office in Bow-street the next morning, and gave information in hopes of recovering my property, and described the prisoner so exactly that Sir Sampson Wright's men went and apprehended him in about a quarter of an hour after, I waited in Sir Sampson's Office, the prisoner was brought in and many others.</p>
               <p>Are you positively sure that that is the man? - Most positive my Lord, if nature forms one man so much like another, I am sure my situation would be more disagreeable than his. I never got my watch again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the value of your watch? - It was a very remarkable watch, a time keeper, it was a very improved watch, made by Mr. Comyns.</p>
               <p>You never saw the person before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>This was a pretty severe land engagement, Captain? - A great scuffle; there were five of them had their hands upon me at one time, but there were more there than a dozen.</p>
               <p>Might not it have happened that the hand that was applied to your fob was the hand of some other person and not the prisoner's? - It is possible it might have happened, but by no means probable.</p>
               <p>If the man was forced upon you in the manner you have described, it should seem as if that would have incapacitated him from taking your watch, and that somebody else took it? - If the force had not been intentional.</p>
               <p>Can you ascertain exactly and with precision, so as to say that it was not involuntary force; might he not have been forced by the rest of the mob? - No.</p>
               <p>You was not at all apprehensive as to personal danger, I believe I may say so, Captain, from your known character and courage? - I rather smiled at the oddity of being assaulted by such a number of people at such a time of night, I was not at all apprehensive of my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I think, my Lord, there is a case where the prosecutor expressly swore he was not put in fear.</p>
               <p>Court. It is taking by force, which is the same thing as taking by fear. Suppose a man is knocked down and never sees the hand.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the Council for the prisoner endeavoured to get from the prosecutor, that he was not alarmed or put in fear, but in point of law it is sufficient to constitute a robbery, either if your property is delivered by fear, threats, and menaces, or if a man comes and takes your property from you by violence on the road; and at this time of day it would be a very doubtful case, whether the objection would hold if a person delivered his money with his own hands, and said he was not put in fear; but that is not the case here: whether he was put in fear or not, if a man parts with his property, either from the effect of terror or force, it is equally a robbery in either case.</p>

               <p>Did you see that? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards might you see the prisoner on board that ship? - I saw him every day from the time I have related, which was the 30th or 31st of March, until the 8th day of April, which was the day they arose upon us, it was Thursday morning, eight o'clock, I had then the pleasure of wearing what the gentlemen here call darbies; we were about twenty-five leagues to westward of St. Mary's, on the West India Rocks, I saw him several days after that, but not every day during the six days they held the possession of the ship as commanders; I might see him three or four days I believe out of those six, before they went on shore.</p>

               <p>What was his conduct on board that ship? - His conduct with respect to the rising do you mean?</p>
               <p>His conduct in general? - I do not recollect that he was any ways worse than the rest of them, he never did me any harm or injury, not particularly, no more than aiding and assisting the rest, I saw him go from the ship's side in one of the ship's boats, and he never returned, therefore I had no doubt but he went on shore in Devonshire.</p>

               <p>Court. Who was he convicted of robbing? - I do not know who it was he robbed, it was for robbing a gentleman in his carriage, he is the man, he was sent down to Woolwich to the hulks, to remain there till the ship was ready, I went to the waterside with him, I saw him on board the barge that was to convey him on board the bulks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg permission of the Court to read my defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, from the well known justice of this honourable Court, I have not the least doubt of a patient hearing, especially as the hardness of my case is unparalelled in the records of the Old Bailey. I stood here convicted of a robbery, and afterwards received his Majesty's pardon; on the 4th of June I was apprehended in Smithfield, and brought to prison; I pleaded Not Guilty to this indictment, not with intent to give the Court any unnecessary trouble, but to explain the hardness of my case; the robbery I was cast for was attended with such circumstances of behaviour on my part, that the Court thought me not unworthy of clemency, and I was accordingly recommended to his Majesty's mercy, and I was afterwards pardoned on condition of serving in the royal army in the East Indies; but some difficulty arising in putting this pardon into execution, my prosecutor applied to Mr. Townsend, now Lord Sydney, for a free pardon; then I had a pardon on condition of serving on board any of his Majesty's ships or vessels of war; I went on board his Majesty's ship the Prince Edward, two months after, having been six months at my liberty, and I was taken up for not complying with the terms of my pardon, and committed to Newgate, where I continued six months, and was had up every Sessions, and was informed I should be discharged: during the time I was in Newgate, I had a severe illness, which rendered me insensible, and whilst I was in that state I was brought before Counsellor Harrison, who sat as Deputy Recorder. When the sentence of the Court was read to me to be transported to

             for the term of my natural life, it may be said I acquiesced, but I was then in a state of insensibility: I apply to Mr. Akerman, that during my long confinement, I never was charged with any offence; I have served his Majesty in the royal navy, and had the honour of bearing a commission. Whilst I was on board the hulk, I had the mortification of seeing my fellow sufferers die daily, to the amount of two hundred and fifty? several who have had pardons similar to mine, such as

               <p>Jury. My Lord, in his defence he says he was pardoned on condition of serving on board a man of war.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to his defence I did not state it to you, because the facts respecting these convicts will be examined by the Judges, and he has proved nothing, but the facts can very easily be known.</p>
               <p>Jury to Owen. Can you positively swear to the identity of the man who was convicted for robbing Mr. Downs?</p>
               <p>Court. He has not swore that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Somebody ought to prove certainly that he was the man that was tried here for that identical robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. The indictment charges it to be a robbery on Mr. Downs, and Owen cannot go that length, I believe, Gentlemen, I can save you some trouble, I for my own part giving my opinion, am not satisfied with this evidence, I do not think the case is made out; for it must be proved that the prisoner was the man that robbed Mr. Downes, now that he has not been able to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070013"/> prove; Owen certainly does not prove that that man committed the robbery as laid in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Jury. Owen said that he neither recollected the Gentleman's name that was robbed, nor the place where it was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. He says he has seen the prisoner before, he was convicted in December 1781, of a highway robbery, he was present, it was for robbing a Gentleman in his carriage, he knew no more; certainly that does not prove that this was the man.</p>

               <p>Court. If the prisoner makes out his case he then will be discharged, if he does not he will then be sent to his former sentence, and every proper enquiry will be made.</p>

               <p>I am engine keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn; on the 16th of July, I saw the prisoner Foxhall put his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand pocket, I cannot say which hand he put in, and took out a box; I saw something red in his hand, I followed him on the other side of the way, and at St. Sepulchre's church gates I crossed over the way and the prosecutor had hold of Ingram; Ingram was close to Foxhall, pushing him. Foxall pulled out the snuff box from under his right arm, and give it me; the prosecutor directly said, that is my box.</p>

               <p>Coming under old Newgate, this lad was before me, I saw a box roll, and I picked it up, the prosecutor laid hold of this lad, and he bid me stop. I told him I found the box. Scott said he should get a guinea a-piece for us, if he transported us.</p>

               <p>Relate slowly and distinctly the manner in which this misfortune happened? - On Thursday morning the 3d of June, between three and four, I was alarmed with a noise on the outside of the house, my wife waked me, she told me there was an alarm of fire, and I went immediately to the window which looks to <placeName id="t17840707-10-crimeloc51">St. Mary Hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17840707-10-crimeloc51" type="placeName" value="St. Mary Hill"/>

                        targets="t17840707-10-off47 t17840707-10-crimeloc51"/>, and when I looked out of the window, the first thing that struck me was the flames coming out of my shop window at St. Mary Hill, I was then three story high; I immediately went to the next room, where the boys all slept, there was my son-in-law about fourteen, a child of mine between five and six, who was burned, and the prisoner the bar.</p>
               <p>Was that room locked or open? - It was unlocked.</p>
               <p>Is it usually locked or open? - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070016"/> usually open; I found my wife's son and my child fast asleep in bed, and this boy was out of the room; I called for him, but he did not answer; then we found the fire coming up so fierce upon us, we could not go down.</p>
               <p>In what manner then did you endeavour to make your escape? - My wife and children and myself went up in the garret, which was four story high; I went immediately to the window, there was a row of windows, one of them I opened, and got out myself that way, and then I got out one child, the youngest, between three and four, who slept in a side bed by the side of my wife; the lad about fourteen, my wife's son, he got out also; I put the young child in the gutter, and then I immediately tried to assist my wife, I endeavoured to get her out, I laid hold of her to raise her, but she being very heavy with child, I could not raise her from the ground, the window was as high as our heads where we stood withinside; having done my endeavour to get her out, as I was without side the house I found that impossible, and I jumped in again, but I could not raise her then, we had nothing to stand upon, and I was obliged to jump out again, I could not stay for the heat and smoke, I was almost suffocated.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there nothing in the room that you could have brought to the window? - There were several things but we did not think of them, we had not presence of mind, we were so frightened, there was a book-case and a large cupboard that we might have brought; in that situation I was obliged to leave her, and I jumped off my house on the next, I then desired my wife's son to throw the young child down to me, and he did, and I ran into the garret of the next house, I ran down into the street and went into a baker's shop almost opposite; I stood there about five minutes, expecting to see my wife come out of the window, but I never saw her since: it has been very maliciously spread abroad that she is now living, and lying-in at Hackney, but I wish they could find her for me.</p>
               <p>Court. You have reason then, Sir, to fear that is not true? - I have, Sir, from the circumstances I left her in; this is the most sorrowful colour I ever wore to me.</p>
               <p>When did you see this boy after? - I took him the next day at Mr. Berry's.</p>
               <p>Had you any other persons, servants or lodgers, that slept in your house? - No, Sir, only my own family.</p>
               <p>You did not see this boy during the time of the fire? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the progress of the fire very rapid? - Very rapid, we could hardly get up into the garret.</p>
               <p>Did you view the house at all yourself; had you coolness and presence of mind at all after this affair happened to view the house, to know where this fire began? - No further than from looking out of the window; I saw the flames come out of the shop window next Eastcheap; it was two houses, and that end of the front on the hill next Eastcheap was the shop window where I saw the flames first break out.</p>
               <p>At what time had you gone to bed the night before? - I saw every thing safe about eleven, my wife held the candle for me while I bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed soon after? - We went to bed immediately.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any part of the family up? - No, they were all in bed before me.</p>
               <p>How was your shop lighted of a night? - We had that night only one candle, I had no occasion for any more, I took that candle away with me, and took it into the kitchen when I fastened up the shop.</p>
               <p>Is there any fire-place in the shop, or in the back room by the shop? - There is a fire-place in the back room, but we had no fire any where but in the kitchen, which is up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Was there any fire in the kitchen that night? - There was fire in the kitchen that afternoon for dressing victuals.</p>
               <p>Was it in when you went to bed? - I think it was out.</p>
               <p>Were there any chips of paper, any shavings of paper laying loose in the shop? - It was always my custom to take up the chips of paper, those shavings are valuable to us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070017"/> we sell them for twenty-two shillings a hundred weight; in the shaving tub there was between six and eight pounds, the tub was kept in that part of the house next Eastcheap.</p>
               <p>Did you go near that with the candle? - Only to fasten the door.</p>
               <p>Where was your work-board that you worked at usually? - Across the shaving tub.</p>
               <p>It lay over the shaving tub? - Yes, there were two presses upon it.</p>
               <p>What sort of candles did you usually work by in the shop? - Candles called eighths.</p>
               <p>What sort of candlestick? - Flat ones, tin or brass; the candlestick I had that night was a metal candlestick.</p>
               <p>A slat candlestick? - No, a high candlestick.</p>
               <p>Did you go from the shop up to the kitchen, and so go to bed, that night? - No Sir, I left work at nine, and I did not go to bed till eleven, there were two hours between, before I came to fasten the door, and then every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Was there any window where the shaving tub stood? - It was by the window, that window was fastened by the boy before.</p>
               <p>Did you go to look at that window when you examined the house before you went to bed? - No, I knew it was fast before, the shop door was within a quarter of a yard, but then the bolts were not near that; from the fastenings of the door to the shaving tub was near a yard; when I fastened the door my wife held the candle, I called her down for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on which side she stood when you fastened the door? - She stood on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Then she did not come forward into the shop at all? - No, she did not, she did not come close to me.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed with the same candle? - Yes, the candle that my wife had.</p>
               <p>Did you blow out the other candle or snuff it out? - I snuffed the working candle out in the shop with the snuffers, that was put out when we shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>Where did you see this boy first after the fire? - My neighbours the next morning advised me to go Guildhall, to take him up; I went to get a warrant, I went over to his mother in George-street, Black-fryars, expecting to find him there, his brother gave us information that he was at Mr. Berry's, an attorney in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Had he been in bed in your house that night? - Certainly he had.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Berry's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him there? - Mr. Berry denied him twice, I asked him if

             was there; Mr. Berry said he is not; I said, Sir, I am informed he is here; he said he is not here; a young man that was there said he is below in the kitchen, and he came up to me; Mr. Berry apologized for saying he was not there.</p>
               <p>What did the boy say? - He said, I hope you will not hurt me, I have not robbed you, I did not set the house on fire, and he hoped I would let him see his father and mother and friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. I will send for Mr. Berry about his denying him.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you been robbed of any thing that you know of? - I did not suspect him of any thing, I have never seen any thing that has been destroyed.</p>
               <p>Did the boy at any other time in your hearing, say any thing remarkable? - We put him in a coach to take him to Guildhall, and Mr. Jameson asked him before the constable, how he came to do such a wicked action, and how he came to escape himself, he told Mr. Jameson that they broke open the door and took him out, and after some more conversation Mr. Jameson asked him the same question over again, how he escaped, he told him that when the man made a noise at the door he opened the door and run out.</p>
               <p>You are sure he said first the one and then the other? - He did Sir, in less than two minutes time in the coach going along, then he was brought to Guildhall and examined by Mr. Alderman Plomer, and Mr. Alderman Hart.</p>

            's Counsel. What o'clock was it that evening that you began to work by candle light? - At dusk.</p>
               <p>What o'clock is that? - It must be between eight and nine, I suppose we had a candle lighted about half an hour, I was at work for Mr. Phillips binding books, the last thing we do is to clear the shop, the candle was on the board and the snuffers, there was no extinguisher.</p>
               <p>You made use of the snuffers occasionally? - Yes, we put out the candle with the snuffers, we took them all up stairs with us, I took the candle up with me put out as it was.</p>
               <p>When you came to fasten your shop and to examine the door, you called your wife down to hold the candle? - There were bolts out of my reach without I stood upon the shaving tub, and they bolted a flap that fastened to the top.</p>
               <p>Then the candle was in the work shop? - Yes, when we were fastening the shutters.</p>
               <p>Then your wife was with you then? - I did not fasten these bolts then.</p>
               <p>You know at eleven you took your wife down with you? - Because I could not fasten these bolts that were out of my reach without setting the candle down.</p>
               <p>Did you stand upon the shavings or the tub? - Not upon that shaving tub at all; upon a little shaving tub that is covered intirely, when it is let down the boys could not do it, the shavings are loose, they fell loose in the tub some over the tub, and they are put in afterwards loose one upon the other; there were about eight pounds weight, not exceeding eight pounds.</p>
               <p>I should think they were a pretty deal? - They are but a little in a tub of eight foot long, and that has three presses along it.</p>
               <p>This young man's father writes at Mr. Berry's? - I have heard something of his writing for Mr. Berry at times, I do not know that he was clerk with Mr. Berry.</p>
               <p>You know him to be an Attorney? - I have heard he is an Attorney, I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Why you lived in Carey-street yourself? - I was not obliged to know him, I did not know you till I was told your name was Silvester.</p>
               <p>You know my name upon the door, and you knew Mr. Berry lived next door to me; it is a little unfortunate that you should say that now, when you told me the other day you knew me perfectly well? - I did not Sir, you said that you knew me.</p>
               <p>This man is a man of character, and the father worked there as his clerk? - I have heard that he worked there occasionally.</p>
               <p>You did not suppose that Mr. Berry was concerned with somebody against your house? - Why should I, I say he slept there that night, and Mr. Berry denied him twice.</p>
               <p>Was not his father there? - I did not see his father.</p>
               <p>I think you say that Mr. Jameson is not here? - No, he was before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>He is not here to be examined now? - He lives the corner of St. Mary's Hill, he may be here in Court.</p>
               <p>You never found the remains of the poor woman? - They never have been found, they have been searched for, I have the bill of charge to the parish for the searching for her, it was falsely reported that she never was searched for.</p>
               <p>Was that a part of the collection you made? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You never tried for her yourself? - That is a very foolish question; I have borne a great deal, and I shall be able to bear this.</p>
               <p>Jury. What work was you about that night? - I was finishing the boarding of books, I was pasting, the board was over the cutting press.</p>
               <p>You was not boarding the books upon the cutting press? - The board was upon the cutting press, the press was over the shaving tub, and over the press the board, there was such a small quantity of shavings in the tub and they were not pressed down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had the boys access to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070019"/> the shop? - Yes, when we sent them out for beer for supper they were obliged to go through the shop, I believe the prisoner went for it, did not you Dick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No Sir.</p>
               <p>Pray Mr. Duffey, you are the most easy witness in a Court of Justice I ever saw, let us ask the questions? - We sent the boy and my wife's son both up together.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you know of this unfortunate affair? - I was going by being ordered upon duty that morning upon the Jubilee at Westminster, and as I was coming past this part of the town, I saw a light over the top of the shop door, through the fan over the door.</p>
               <p>What time of the morning? - As near as I can recollect about fifteen minutes before four.</p>
               <p>Was it East Cheap or St. Mary Hill? - St. Mary Hill, I was not certain whether it was not a baker's shop, I put my ear to the shutters and I heard the wood cracking and burning, I came back again to St. Mary Hill, and saw two men and called to them, and told them there was a house on fire, they came to my assistance, one of them claped his eye to the key hole of the door and looked through, I began to knock at the door, a little after we had knocked, we heard a foot come to the door and spring the lock and come out.</p>
               <p>Court. The shop door or the house door? - The shop door.</p>
               <p>You saw that person come out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of it. </p>
               <p>Was he dressed or undressed? - He was full dressed, he was completely dressed, I did not see any hat on his head, but his clathes were all on.</p>
               <p>Had he any bundle with him or any thing? - No, Sir, when he came out first he had nothing, he came out and asked what was the matter, says I, what do you think is the matter, don't you see the shop is on fire about your ears.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - He never made any reply, he went in again towards the stair case, I went with him about a yard into the shop.</p>
               <p>In what state was the shop then? - It was all on fire on the side of the shop that led down to little East Cheap, there seemed to be a bench there, and from under that bench the fire seemed to proceed.</p>
               <p>What became of the boy? - He went off, I do not know what became of him, he went past me, he came back immediately and I saw something lay over his arm, I did not examine what it was, I was looking at the fire and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Had you leisure to observe his shoes and buckles, whether they were on, and his stockings whether they were up or down? - I did not particularly observe that, I only looked at the upper part of his body, the fire drew my attention to the upper part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Had the flames gained a deal when you looked into the shop? - The flames had reached the windows of the book case.</p>
               <p>Had it reached the stair case then? - No,</p>
               <p>Who came into the shop besides you? - One John Bowland, there was only that one with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman Hart. Did not you knock more than once before the boy came down? - We kept a perpetual knocking for about a minute before we heard a foot come to the shop door.</p>
               <p>The flames not having reached the stairs did Bowland and you go up stairs and alarm the family? - No, I only went one pace into the shop and I went to call the watchman he came directly. </p>
               <p>Did not it occur to you that there might be people up stairs, and that they might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070020"/> have escaped if alarmed then? - We made all the alarm possible in our power by calling out fire.</p>
               <p>You did not go far enough in to see if there was any fire in the house? - No, we did not.</p>
               <p>When you came back with the watchman what state was it in then? - It had got to the staircase I saw no more, when the boy came to the door he asked me more than once what is the matter, what is the matter, I replied what do you think is the matter, do not you see the shop on fire about your ears.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Two men came up to you, who were these two men? - One I never saw since, and the other is

               <p>Then instead of alarming the people you went and called the watchman? - He was facing Cross-lane talking to two men, I suppose about one hundred and twenty yards off, I went into the middle of the street and called them.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy go up stairs? - No, I did not, I saw him go towards the staircase, he come past me again directly, my attention was fixed on the fire, whether he went up two or three stairs I cannot say, but he c ame by me immediately again.</p>

               <p>I was coming to call my master just before four, and I saw the soldier looking at the house, says he, there looks like a fire, is it a baker's? no, says I, it is a bookseller's; I knocked at the door, and looked through the key-hole, I heard a noise of crackling and jumbling about the place, what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a noise? - It was crackling and jumbling about the place.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference between crackling and jumbling? - There was a crackling inside the place, I was not withinside.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by a jumbling? - Why crackling.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the same thing when you say crackling or jumbling? - I do not know how you take me, not I.</p>
               <p>I take you just as you say, but I want you to explain what sort of a noise was it? - It was the crackling of wood.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the word jumbling? - A noise I took it to be.</p>
               <p>You mean the same kind of noise as crackling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not mean any different noise? - No, I did not mean any different.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear any other kind of noise except what might proceed from the crackling of the fire; when you knocked at the door, did you hear any body from within? - No, my head was turned the other way.</p>
               <p>Did you see him open the door? - I could not see him undo the door, he was withinside and I was without.</p>
               <p>But you saw him open the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it? - About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he opened the door? - He rubbed his eyes, and said, Master, what is the matter? - I made answer and said, you son of a bitch, cannot you see what is the matter, do not you see the place is on fire! then he ran into the street as far as the kennel, and looked up at the house, and then he ran in doors and fetched an old coat, and put it under his arm, and ran out of the house; he was fully dressed, but he put the old coat under his arm; I never saw the boy again till the next day.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed when he opened the door? - Yes, he was dressed all but his hat on; I saw nothing more than what I have said.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing loose or undressed about him? - His black waistcoat was buttoned, his coat was on, I saw his stockings were strait on his legs, whether they were tied or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I suppose you kept knocking? - Yes, I knocked two or three minutes at the windows, and two or three minutes at the door.</p>
               <p>I suppose you knocked very violent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was it possible for the boy to open the bolts? - One of the doors was fastened with a flap and two doors, and one was a door without the flap; the door next St. Mary Hill was a single door, with two bolts, a chain bolt, and a spring lock, the boys could not reach it without standing on something.</p>
               <p>Court to Algey. It was the door on St. Mary Hill that the boy opened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said you heard something after knocking some time? - I heard a foot.</p>
               <p>Then if you heard so plain as that, did you hear in what manner the door was opened? - I heard there was no bolt drawn, nor no chain, but the spring lock, for I should have heard the chain; if the bolts had been drawn I must have heard it, and he would have been a longer time about it; I heard only the spring lock draw, and he opened it immediately.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect now whether you heard the foot more than once before the door opened? - No, I cannot say, it might be more than one pace, but it was very little, it seemed to come across the door as I could understand it, I only heard the foot just coming to the door, and immediately the spring lock opened, and he asked what was the matter! what was the matter! one side of the shop was all in a light by the flames.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Where did his old coat lay? - He used to work in the shop, and the clothes he did not wear in common were in the garret.</p>
               <p>Court to Algey. Was that the coat he had on when he came out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What had he on when he went to bed that night? - He had these clothes on, for I desired him to put on these clothes, and to mend a hole in his stocking.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070023"/>Jury. Did the stair-case come down fronting your door? - It was fronting the door in St. Mary Hill.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The morning the fire happened, as I was going over the water to my mistress, to let her know of the fire, she lives at Newington, her name is Jones; it was in the morning about a quarter after four, it was while the fire was; as I was going along Eastcheap, just by the corner of Fish-street Hill, I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Only by working at the house a day or two before the fire happened; I asked him where he was going to, he told me he did not know rightly where he was going to, or some such word; I told him to go back and see if he could not see his master, and he went back, but before I got half way down the Borough, he was after me again.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the Borough? - Just by the corner of Snow's Fields in the Borough.</p>
               <p>That is a good way down? - Yes, and I asked him if he had seen his master, he told me no, I told him to go back and see if he could not see him; he made me no answer to that, I asked him how he got out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Now tell us as exactly as you can remember, what answer he made to that? - He told me he got out at the street door, and that he went up one pair of stairs to call his master, and he heard the bed creak, and he came down stairs again directly; then I asked him how he got his things out, he told me that he got his breeches and his shoes to bring away with him, and he dropped them coming out of the door.</p>
               <p>Had he all his things on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then what did he mean by dropping his breeches and shoes at the door? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Repeat again, slowly and as exactly as you can, what answer he made to that? - He told me first that he was bringing them out at the door, and in his fright he dropped them, he said it was his breeches and a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - I cannot say whether he had or no rightly; I said to him again, go back again and see if you cannot see your master; he told me his master was such an ill natured man, that if he saw him there he would throw him into the fire; that was all that passed: he went up to the house where I was going to, just by Newington, and he staid there till I came out and talked to a gentleman at the door, he came away with me then, and he never said a word to me all the way we came down the lane till we came to the corner, and I asked him where he was going, and he said to his father at Newington; but instead of his going to Newington, he crossed over St. George's Fields, and went up the road towards Black-friars Bridge, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Had he any bundle or any thing over his arm when you saw him? - No, Sir, nothing but the clothes on his back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Do you know where his mother or father lived? - No, only he told me he was going to Newington to his father, he did not say his mother.</p>
               <p>Court to Algey. When the boy went in towards the stairs, can you say whether he went up the stairs at all or not? - I cannot be positive, I do not think he had time.</p>
               <p>Did he call to any body? - No, Sir, he never spoke, I am positive of that, he did not call to any body.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowland. Do you know whether he went up stairs or not? - He went towards the stairs, but I am sure he could not go up, it was impossible for him to go up stairs, the sulphur was so strong.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What do you know of this affair? - I saw the prisoner come to Mr. Draper's, on St. Mary Hill, the day the fire happened, about one in the day, as near as I can recollect; Mrs. Duffey's son was there, he came to see him, I asked him how he escaped, he told me he was taken out of a two pair of stairs window; I asked him the reason he had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070024"/> called his master, he told me he called him, but he could not make him hear, that was all he said to me.</p>
               <p>Did you see the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there at that time? - No, it was burning with great fury when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you see at the windows any of Mr. Duffey's family? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he see Mrs. Duffey's son when he came there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between them? - No, only he asked him how he did.</p>
               <p>Court. I wonder it has not been material to bring that boy here who slept with the prisoner; you must not go for him yourself Mr. Duffey.</p>
               <p>(The Court sent a messenger for the boy, with orders not to tell him what he was sent for, only that he might not be frightened and suppose he was sent for on account of any harm to himself, nor to let him converse with any body as he came along.</p>
               <p>Court. In the mean time we will go on.</p>
               <p>- ROSIER sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 4th of last month, I was going along the Poultry that was the day after the fire, I met the prisoner and a constable which had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, I never saw him before, I heard the constable ask him to confess, he said to him if you are guilty you had better confess at once.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must not tell us what answer the boy made to that, we cannot legally hear the answer.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - The conversation between him and the constable.</p>
               <p>You know nothing except that conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you must not tell us that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How many rooms are there on a floor in your house? - On the first floor there are three, on the third floor, there is the middle room where the prisoner and my wife's son and the child of six years old slept, we slept in the back room.</p>
               <p>Where did the window of the middle room look into? - Into St. Mary Hill.</p>
               <p>Is that room nearer the stairs or the room where you slept? - The middle room is directly opposite the stairs, the lads did not use to lock their room door, that used to be open, when I got up on the alarm it was on the jar, and I immediately waked my son in law and the child; they were both asleep I am positive, I called Dick by his name several times and he never answered.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There cannot be a case where one would more anxiously wish to get at the whole truth which ever way it may lay, and I dare say you have no objection to waiting for this boy's coming.</p>
               <p>Jury. We think it highly necessary my Lord to have him here.</p>
               <p>(The boy came after some short time, and Mr. Duffey was order to go into the Lord Mayor's parlour whilst the boy was examined.)</p>

               <p>Now when this dreadful accident of the fire happened, what was the first alarm you heard? - The first that I heard of it, my father awaked me and then I got up.</p>
               <p>Was you asleep when your father came into your room? - Yes, I was fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Did you hear no alarm of any kind till you father came into the room? - No, Sir,</p>

               <p>Did you fasten up shop the door or windows or anything that night? - Yes, I helped to shut up the shop and fasten all the windows, then I went to bed.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - It was about ten o'clock or it might be rather after.</p>
               <p>Who were with you when you fastened up the shop? - Nobody but me and the other boy, my father was in the shop but he did not help to shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070025"/>Which of you held the candle? - Neither of us held the candle.</p>
               <p>Where did the candle stand? - The candle was standing on the little shaving tub that we had, and the other by the window.</p>
               <p>Was the little shaving tub covered or open? - It was covered with a board that we always had over it.</p>
               <p>Did that board cover it intirely? - Yes Sir, intirely, it was but a little one.</p>
               <p>Who bolted the cross bolt at the top of the flap of the door? - My father did that, because it was out of my reach, I could not do it.</p>
               <p>Where does the other shaving tub stand? - It was in the window next to little East-Cheap.</p>
               <p>Where does your father generally work? - At the shaving tub in little East-cheap, that is the large shaving tub.</p>
               <p>That was not covered was it? - No, that is never covered, but the candle was in the window because we could not work if it was upon the presses, the board that we work upon is over the big shaving tub, but does not cover it.</p>
               <p>Who went for the beer that night? - The other boy, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did he and you go up stairs to bed together? - Yes Sir, both together.</p>
               <p>Was it long before you fell asleep? - No, Sir, it was not long.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the other boy fell asleep before you or not? - I do not know, we had no conversation together in bed that night, but mostly he would talk, but that night he did not.</p>
               <p>Which way did you get out of the house? - I could not get down stairs, but my father and I went up to the fourth story and I got out of the window, and I jumped down to the next house.</p>
               <p>Which way did your father get out? - The same way.</p>
               <p>Did you see what became at all of your mother? - I heard her cry terribly, and I staid about five minutes after my father.</p>
               <p>Did your father try to get your mother out? - Yes, Sir, he tried, and his hands and his nose were all scorched, and he had something to rub them with.</p>
               <p>Did he come into the house a second time? - He jumped out and tried to get my mother out, and he could not, and he came in again and he tried to lift her up and could not, and he was obliged to leave her in that distress; I first saw the prisoner at Mr. Draper's, he came and asked me how I did, says he, George how do you do, I came to see how you do, says I, I am hurt terribly, and my mother is burnt, says I, how did you escape without hurting yourself, and he told me at that time he got out of the window.</p>
               <p>At what window? - He did not say which.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him any questions about leaving you, or not waking you? - I did not mean to ask him any questions for fear that if he did set the house on fire that it would frighten him, and therefore I did not; I had heard at that time, that he was suspected, and I said nothing more to him then I could help.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who used generally to fetch the beer of a night? - I did.</p>
               <p>There were a quantity of shavings in the box? - There were about nine pounds.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Because they lay quite light in the shaving tub, on purpose to make a little show, because it looked naked without, as we had but been lately moved in.</p>
               <p>You had one candle and you father had another? - I was at that time folding, I did not work at the press in East-cheap, I worked at a mahogany board.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you any candles to go to bed with that night? - My mother went up stairs, she went in the other room, there was a little closet that we slept in, and when we got into bed my mother took down the candle.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you remember, my boy, whether there was one candle or two burning in the shop when your father was at work? - I do not rightly know, I cannot positively say either way, whether there was one or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070026"/>Was there any fire in the kitchen do you know that night? - There had been a fire, there was but very little fire left.</p>
               <p>Is there any tinder box and matches kept in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does that usually lay? - It was put in the drawer under the dresser, as there is in most kitchens a drawer under the dresser, it was kept in there, I have had occasion to go to the drawer, and have seen the tinder box there.</p>
               <p>Who got up first in a morning? - The prisoner and me both got up together.</p>
               <p>In the winter time who gets up first? - Both together at seven.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner been with you? - He had been off and on a matter of a twelvemonth on liking, but he had not served above two months of his time; we both got up together, my father and mother did not get up so soon; I used to strike the light, for I lighted the fire for my mother.</p>
               <p>Was the other boy with you? - No, he was sprinkling the shop.</p>
               <p>How did he get a light? - We did not get up before day light.</p>
               <p>Did the boy know where the tinder box and matches were kept? - I do not know, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You had not been above a fortnight in the house? - It wanted a day of a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Court. How old is the boy? - Seventeen.</p>
               <p>Is he so much? - He is something thereabouts, I will tell you why, he was saying to my father, says he I am seventeen years old, do not you tell my mother that I told you, but my father knew it, for I heard her say I deceived you in this boy, for I told you he was but fifteen, but he is seventeen.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Will you say any thing for yourself, or will you leave your defence to the witnesses your Counsel will call?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>

            , I saw the soldier lay his head to the door and listen, and he said to me it is my opinion here is a fire here, I looked over the door way, there were three or four pains of glass, I saw there was a fire, I immediately began to knock and call as loud as I could, to awake the inhabitants, I knocked five, six, or seven minutes as near as I can guess, and this lad came down stairs, he had never a hat on and his stockings were about his heels, and his waistcoat was open it was not buttoned; I said to him my dear make all the haste you can and awake the family, and desire them to come down stairs, as soon as ever they can; then the child went up stairs again immediately and went out of my sight, but how far he went I cannot say; he came down stairs again, and said I can go no further the smoke choaked me so; then I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing more to you? - When he came down again he said I wish you would go up stairs, I said no, my dear, the danger is so great I will not go up stairs at all, I should have been to blame if I had, the fire pouring down stairs so as it did.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the boy at that time? - Only as I mentioned, of his waistcoat being unbuttoned and his stockings about his heels.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Tell your own story. - I was going just close to this house, and there was a soldier going by, and he said this house was on fire, and we stooped down and looked through the wainscot and saw it was on fire, and we looked through the glass and saw it was on fire.</p>

               <p>Court. What wainscot? - Through the crevice of the shutters; then we alarmed the place, and called out fire as loud as we could, and we were the space of five or six minutes before any body came to the door, and the boy came to the door, and as far as I understood there was a key in the door, and he was puzzling at the door, I computed it to be half a minute before he could open the door, and I called out, and when he opened the door, he said what is the matter, and we said, do not you see the place is all on fire; he was without his hat, and his coat and waistcoat, if he had a waistcoat on, it was quite open, and his stockings were about his heels, and says we, go up stairs, and awake the people up stairs, for fear they be burnt; with that he went up stairs, but how far he went I cannot say, for the fire and smoak were so great, there was no such thing as that he could go farther up.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing when he came down again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he had been up to the top or not? - No, he did not, he never spoke a word, only wanted one of us to go up.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He wanted one of us to go up, he said he could not go up.</p>
               <p>You say his coat and waistcoat was quite open? - His breast was quite open, and his stockings about his heels, and no hat on.</p>
               <p>That was plain to be seen by any body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the soldier? - He might be there, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see one Bowland there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at him? - That man was there, but he was not there at the first of the fire.</p>
               <p>Was he there when the boy opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070028"/> door? - I cannot tell, he might come up at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did the boy bring out any thing with him? - Not as I saw, because I never looked, if he did bring out any thing it must be a small thing; I saw one or two people on the leads, I saw one man in his shirt, and he stood for the space of a minute I suppose before we could make him move at any rate; I told him not to come down the stairs, for he would be burnt.</p>
               <p>Then when the boy came to the door, you heard him puzzled at the key of the door some time before he could open it? - Yes, very nigh half a minute.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him draw any bolts? - No. He seemed very much frightened.</p>

               <p>Court to Algey. Who was the first man that went into the shop with you? - I cannot say, if there was any it was Bowland, I saw nobody but him in the shop, and I believe he stood at the threshold of the door, I stopped in immediately and made the reply the shop was on fire.</p>

            , and there are very few trials occur which require more attention, or which should be considered as more important than the present, for the charge against the prisoner, under all its circumstances, is one of a most aggravated and atrocious nature, and such as if he is guilty, he is extremely dangerous to society, and extremely unfit any longer to be suffered to continue a member of it: on the other hand, the very magnitude of the charge renders it still more improbable, that a boy, who has hitherto had the character of a harmless inoffensive lad, should without any degree of provocation alledged, or any thing that could excite malice in his mind, commit so great an offence. This matter is certainly after all our endeavours to investigate the truth, by no means set so perfectly clear or free from difficulty as could be wished, and I must rely therefore upon the attention you have paid to the evidence, and upon your opinion on that evidence. It is my duty to bring back the most material part of that evidence, and at the same time to trouble you with a few observations thereon, having no doubt but many more, equally material, will occur to yourselves. The first witness is the suffering party,

            , and he says, &amp;c. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and observed) It is a fact proved by all the evidence beyond a possibility of doubt, that whoever was the cause of the fire, it certainly began in the shop; no inference should be drawn from the boy's being denied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070030"/> by Mr. Berry, because it is very probable if it was so, that Mr. Berry did not know the boy was in the house: Mr. Berry is an attorney of character in Carey-street. The only circumstance of apparent contradiction that appears to me between the boy and his father-in-law is, as to the manner of shutting up the shop; the father seems to speak to that as his own act, and did not speak of the boys at all, he did not explicitly say so, but that he himself did shut up the shop, and the circumstance of bolting the flap, which was high, the boy speaks of as done at the same time, whereas the father speaks of it as being done at eleven. As to the fire, it certainly proceeded from the shaving tub under the stairs, whether it was by accident or design. One of the witnesses says, the prisoner told him the next day that his master was such an illnatured man he would throw him into the fire; and this expression is the only circumstance that shews the smallest ground of malice or ill will against his master. The circumstance of the prisoner going over Black Friars Bridge does not appear to be very material, when you consider his father lodged at Newington, and his mother lived near Black Friars Bridge. The material circumstances that arise from the evidence on the part of the prosecution to affect the prisoner, are these: first, his leaving the room where he slept, and the other lad his companion and bed-fellow, without waking him at all, or disturbing him: his opening the door by the spring lock, which the night before had been bolted and chained; and coming out with all his clothes on, and immediately going off, and then giving at different times of the day an inconsistent and therefore false account of the manner in which he had escaped from the house: there are several witnesses called on the part of the prisoner to take off and lessen the force of these material circumstances; but with respect to the circumstance of the boy not having waked any of the family, and not even his bedfellow, that stands utterly uncontradicted, and it is incapable of contradiction. It is very observable that these witnesses on the one side or on the other, have not, that we know of, any connection with the parties, or any bias to mislead them from the truth, yet certainly their testimony shews a great want of recollection. The circumstances in which they differ are material; one party represents the boy as finding difficulty in opening the door, and puzzling for some time before he could get it open, and another says he opened it directly: and there appears in the manner of Jones's relating the expressions he made use of, a discourse that does not look like a hurry, and which cannot help striking one as not quite consistent with the situation in which it passed. This is the whole of the evidence, and certainly this is a case deserving a very attentive consideration; for to convict a lad of a crime of this nature upon circumstantial evidence, of a crime of this enormous magnitude, and the punishment of which must be severe and certain, if there be any reasonable chance of his innocence, would be a thought shocking to humanity: on the other hand, if the boy is guilty of the crime of setting fire to this house, the crime is such a one as calls for public justice, and the safety of society does not permit such an offender to pass unpunished; so that it is far from being an indifferent matter either way, for if he is guilty, the injury is done to the public; and if he is not, a most heavy and dreadful injury would be done to an unfortunate individual if he should be convicted; but this rule is certainly a safe one for Juries and Courts of Justice to abide by in doubtful cases, that dangerous as it is for the public, that enormous crimes should go unpunished, it is better that many guilty persons should escape, than that one innocent one should suffer; the circumstances are certainly unquestionably those of strong suspicion, the most material that strikes me, is that of the boy if it be true, that he was alarmed by the noise made by those people at the house, not awaking his companions; the natural effect of a fright as you all know, is to fly to those that are near; the natural effect of fear would have been in the first place instantly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070031"/> to alarm his be d fellows, and the next to fly into his master's bed chamber, and it is very difficult, supposing you believe that part of the evidence to be true, which depends on the credit of Duffey and his son-in-law, to account for this boy leaving his companions asleep in bed, and coming down with all his clothes on: another material circumstance, still supposing you believe the evidence of Duffey is, that the door of the shop which this boy unquestionably opened (for that is proved by all the witnesses on all sides), was the night before bolted and chained with two bolts and a chain, and among the witnesses who heard him open the door, three of them heard him only open the spring lock, tho' a fourth speaks of the circumstance of the boy fumbling sometime before he opened the door, but in which he must be mistaken; this together with the boy having his clothes on, and coming out in the manner he did, and after he had escaped from danger, youthful curiosity would probably have led him to be a spectator when out of danger himself, are strong circumstances against him: on the other hand there is no visible cause of malice which could actuate him, no evidence of hard treatment, no evidence of any precedent declarations of malice on his part, there is but one single expression in the whole of the case that in the smallest degree indicates any such thing, which is what Bush says, that the boy said his master was such an ill natured man, that if he saw him there he would throw him into the fire; and it is extremely difficult to suppose that human nature can be so depraved, as to commit an act of this kind at any years without great provocation, but still more so at his early years. The next circumstance is this, whether consistent with the evidence you can account for this fire without supposing it happened by design; and there, there certainly arise several favourable circumstance for the prisoner; for it is proved perfectly clear it began in the shop, and the shaving tub being under the bench where the man worked that night, and he having his candle not on a flat but in a high candlestick, and snuffing it as often as he had occasion, and snuffing it out at last and carrying it away, it is not very improbable that a spark from the snuff of that candle might fly among those shavings; but then on the other hand the most likely consequence might be, that that would cause an immediate consflagration; but yet again we all know the effects of fire are different, and that a small spark will sometimes moulder many hours, so that no certain conclusion can be drawn in this case, unless you think the conduct of the boy is such as to exclude all possibility of innocence. But you gentlemen will weigh all these circumstances in your minds, in such a case you certainly will not convict the prisoner on a mere suspicion; but if you think his conduct such as can by no possibility be accounted for consistent with his innocence, you will be obliged to find him guilty; I do not mean to say that you are to strain against all evidence, or that if you are clearly and truly convinced of his guilt in your own minds you ought to acquit him, but I say if there is a reasonable doubt, in that case that doubt ought to decide in favour of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did he tell you where his uncle lived? - No, Sir, he did not, before he went out to go to his uncle there was another gentleman come in, and said he was a Wine Merchant in Bishopsgate-street, at No. 19, and he shewed the bill and receipt to him, and the ring; says he how came you by it, and the wine merchant wanted him to leave it in his hands, till he went to his uncle's; he returned in about ten minutes, and he said his aunt was gone into the country to lay-in, and his uncle was gone to see her, the prisoner said he was a gentleman's servant, and lived with a single gentleman, and he must go, and the wine and liquor merchant said, if you have a mind to leave it in my hands, it will be as safe as if it was in your own pocket, till it can be settled; but he was not willing to leave it in his hands, unless I would leave something in his hands along with it, and he asked me what money I had, if I could raise five, or ten, or fifteen pounds, I told him I had not it about me, but I believed I had a friend in town, that I could borrow that value of: but he was not willing I should go to borrow the money, for says he, he will want to know what it was for, and I should not chuse it, he said he thought it might be of some value, and there might be hand bills out about it, or be put into the papers that a lady had lost it; he asked me if I had a watch, I told him I had never a watch, then he asked me what money I had, I told him very trifling, the value of two or three shillings, so the wine merchant called me out of the room, and asked me to raise the value of four or five pounds, and says he if you can raise that, it will be as safe as if you had it in your own pocket, till the matter can be settled; I told him I could not raise it, so we went into the room again where the prisoner sat, and he said he must go directly, then the wine merchant said to me, if you have ever a watch give it to me, it will be safe till you can settle it, which will be between six and seven in the evening, when the prisoner said his uncle would be at home, and I left my watch and half a crown, I had but three shillings in my pocket, I gave my watch to the wine merchant, and we was to meet again, they gave me directions where to find them both.</p>

               <p>Jury. What did he say when you told him you could not find him? - He said it was a very hard thing that he should be cheated out of a great deal of money.</p>

               <p>Court. To what place? - No determined place, on a walk.</p>
               <p>What part of the Strand were you robbed? - About ten yards beyond the pavement; I perceived the prisoner, seemingly in company with another man, about two or three yards before he came upon me, they were coming towards the city, they met me, the prisoner came upon me with force by a jostle, and applied his hand to my watch pocket, and with a considerable degree of force tore it out of my pocket; my pocket being tight made me scarcely sensible of it.</p>
               <p>Did he touch you otherwise than by jostling you? - He came just upon me, face to face, with a view as I judged to take away my recollection at the time.</p>
               <p>Where did he hit you, or strike you? - He came quite upon my breast and made me go back, he came suddenly upon me, the force that he was obliged to apply to take my watch from me, the pocket being tight, suspended his arm above his head, I instantly catched him by the collar, and with my other hand endeavoured to regain my watch, at the same time one of the other witnesses came up and catched him by the collar, and endeavoured to regain my watch too, he still holding the watch at the full extent of his arm; I was in company with five more, four of which saw the watch in his possession; he endeavoured to drop the watch, a parcel of men and women came round him on the other side of me, by which means he conveyed away the watch.</p>
               <p>Did he drop it? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see your watch afterwards? - Never after it went out of his hand, but I saw it for some small space of time in his hand; I apprehended him, and conveyed him to custody with other assistance, I never lost my hold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he was drunk or no? - I had been drinking moderately.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the prosecutor drunk? - Not in the least, he had been drinking.</p>

               <p>Was it in a high road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was you robbed of? - I was robbed of three guineas and a half, and some silver, and a cane.</p>
               <p>Who robbed you? - There was a great man, a great thief, came and stood behind the church dead wall, and I thought it had been a post, squatting down in this manner, and it had been raining the whole day, and the place was deeper than common, it took me up to the knees; there was a great thief, and I thought the great thief had been a post, and I looked to the lane end to see if there was any thieves, and I could see nobody but a thing that I thought was a post, and when I came at him he was a great tall man, and he whipped up in this fashion; and this little thief clapped his hand at me, and stopped my mouth, and the other thief, as I compute, knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Court. What hour was this? - To the best of my knowledge, it wanted about a quarter to eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Then the great thief knocked you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who took your money? - The great thief also, I was hardly sensible , for they threw me among the dirt; I was all water and dirt; it was as deep - as deep - I could feel his hand against my thigh, he cut my breeches pocket, and took my money and my cane.</p>
               <p>What way did the prisoner assist? - Please you, my Lord, this little thief ran away.</p>
               <p>What part did he take in it? - He clapped his hand to my mouth, and stopped my breath.</p>
               <p>Was that after you was down? - Before I did fall.</p>
               <p>How did he reach you? - He did, I was as near him as I am to these gentlemen; I saw his face, and I saw his dress, and I know him properly; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you sober? - O yes, I am never drunk.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you take the prisoner? - I cried out murder! and fire! and stop thief! and the watch came directly, and I followed him and took him; when they called stop thief, this little thief said, I am after the thief.</p>
               <p>What is the watchman's name? - I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070036"/> studying, it is an odd name; but he is somewhere out, if you will please to call him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman. I had just done crying the hour of ten, it wanted about a quarter of eleven, and I heard somebody cry out murder! murder! for Christ's sake! for the Lord's sake! fire and murder! I ran up to his assistance, the prisoner at the bar was a little distance off, I kept sight of him till I got the gentleman up, then I asked him what was the matter, he said he had just been knocked down, I ran after the prisoner, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Did you keep him in sight all the whole time? - Yes, we brought him down to the watch-house, and they scrupled to take him in; then I charged Mr. Orange with him.</p>
               <p>You was not present at the robbery? - No, I came immediately as I heard the gentleman cry out.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner doing then? - He was running along, crying out stop thief! stop thief! Here are the gentleman's breeches that were cut, and the shirt that he was knocked down in, and the stock where the blood was.</p>
               <p>Court. No part of his property is in that bundle? - Orange and Cole were with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nobody to call but a poor father.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it moon-light? - Yes, as broad as the day.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How old are you? - Fourteen.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the part the prisoner took in this, if you believe the prosecutor is right, is sufficient to constitute him a party in the robbery, for if he was present when the robbery was committed, and acting with one common intent with the person that knocked him down, it makes him equally guilty.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. When did you see the prisoner again after you was robbed? - That very night, as soon as I could walk, but I could not walk without the watchman's help.</p>

               <p>I am the patrol of St. John's and St. Margaret's; on the morning of the robbery, which was the 9th of June, I saw the prisoners about a quarter before three, they were both very near together, the prisoner Willis had a bundle, we saw them run across Strutton Ground, and we pursued them down Pye-street.</p>
               <p>Did they see you pursue them? - I cannot be sure, but they run, we pursued them near a quarter of a mile, and took Willis, and he was endeavouring to throw this bundle over a pair of high gates after the other prisoner Hinton; Hinton had got very near the gates; after I came up to them, one was upon the gate and the other was throwing the bundle after him, I attempted to stop Willis, but he made a short turn and got from me. I took the bundle and made the alarm of stop thief! and the watchman stopped Willis in New Peter-street.</p>
               <p>(The bundle produced.)</p>
               <p>- Prisoner Willis. I know nothing of this man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hinton. I was over the water at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Willis ever out of your sight? - Yes, but I am sure he is the same man, because I saw him before, I stopped him my self first.</p>
               <p>When was Hinton apprehended? - I do not know, he was not apprehended by us.</p>
               <p>How do you know he was the same man? - I knew him before, and I saw him getting over the gates.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Bishopsgate, I had this guinea at my Lord Mayor's, before Alderman Plomer, he had it from the baker, the baker is ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Largent. Did you tell him you had received ever a guinea from the baker? - I found this guinea at the baker's.</p>
               <p>What is the mark? - I never knew it, my wife marked it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. LARGENT sworn.</p>
               <p>I marked the guinea with a black mark on the fleur-de-lis.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure of that mark again? - Yes, I could pick it out of five hundred if I had them; I am sure this is the guinea.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you receive that guinea your wife has in her hand from the baker? - Yes, the baker's name is Corneck.</p>
               <p>After you had got this guinea from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070043"/> baker, did you ask the prisoner any questions about it? - Yes, I did, and he said before Alderman Plomer that he changed it there.</p>
               <p>Did you make any promises to the prisoner before he made his confession? - None at all; when Alderman Plomer said, how many do you think you took out of the drawer, he said about ten, then said the Alderman you are like to be hanged, and I said I hope you will recommend him to be sent abroad, and not take his life away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I changed the guinea there the over night, my master picked it out of more gold and silver, the prosecutor then said he could not swear to it.</p>

I have this to say in my defence, that going through Grafton-street, I believe it might be about half past five in the morning, I was alarmed with the cry of stop thief! it founded from this house, I looked down there, and saw a man attempting to get out of the area, I jumped upon the top of the area, immediately he sprung away, I run after him, at the bottom of Hay Hill he dropped or threw away part of the things, I went to catch at the shirt; it was obvious to several people as well as myself that I was not the person; there was a gentleman that gave me his word that he would come and appear for me.</p>

               <p>Did you see the prisoner in pursuit of the other man? - No, I did not, I saw the men jump over together, and run as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Not one pursuing the other? - Not as far as I could know.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you ask any questions of this witness?</p>
               <p>Whether he did not see me jump over the rail, and the other man spring over the rail? - I could not discern which came first over the rails, or which was first running.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses, I did not know I should be tried so soon.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this offence is made capital by an act of parliament; to take a false oath in order to obtain letters of administration to receive any wages or prize money due to seamen; and by which act of parliament you see that which before was but a perjury, that particular species of perjury is converted into a particular felony; but it is incumbent on the Prosecutor to fit the law exactly to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070048"/> fact, and to prove every circumstance which is necessary to bring it within that law, by a clear, precise, and exact evidence, and by the best evidence; now in this case the very jutt of the crime is taking a false oath; and I never remember any instance in fact, where an indictment for perjury has been supported without direct and positive proof that the party took the oath, or where any attempt has been made to supply the defect of proof, in that circumstance by the supply of other proof from which it might be probably inferred; now in this case there certainly is no direct express evidence that the prisoner ever took the oath in question, there is circumstantial evidence; the fact of taking the oath requires distinct proof as well as that of the execution of the bond, and Mr. Shepherd's memory not serving as to the person that took the oath, and Dr. Harris not being here, there is no direct proof of it, and there is a possibility certainly that the prisoner might go through all the rest of the fraud, and avoid the circumstance of taking the oath, supposing he knew the taking the oath was a capital felony; if this was an indictment for perjury, and the evidence was to stand as it does now, I should be of opinion that they were bound to give precise and positive proof, that the prisoner was the person that took the oath; the part where the proof is defective, is the very point on which the indictment turns.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I wish this case might be reserved.</p>
               <p>Court. There is nothing to save.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It is matter of law whether the evidence is sufficient.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if you are satisfied notwithstanding the observations I have stated, that the evidence is sufficient to prove that this man actually took the oath, in that case you will find him guilty; but I am of opinion that unless it is clearly proved he took the oath, you ought to acquit him.</p>

               <p>What was he doing? - He had a brown linen apron on full of things, the property of the prosecutor, he was looking into the drawers belonging to the chest of drawers which stood in the kitchen, I collared him and he run away, I pursued him he was stopped by Hatchman, I never lost sight of him, I saw him drop the things at the door, the things were all taken up afterwards, when he was brought back and carried to the watch-house; they were taken up by Hatchman.</p>
               <p>Did you secure the door when you went away? - I latched the door, I only latched it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether he did not bring a woman before the Justice, that said she knew the man that dropped the things? - I saw the prisoner drop the things.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, with respect to the larceny it is very strong evidence, but there is a difficulty about the capital part of the charge, the lodger said it was about nine o'clock, and they do not pretend to any degree of accuracy; therefore it was dark when he returned, yet when he opened the latch, it was sufficiently light to acquit him of the capital part of the charge.</p>

               <p>How long might you have a view of them? - About half a moment, very little more, only just while they looked round the room, I saw them afterwards; as soon as they were gone I got out and went after them, I went softly, I then saw them both in the bar.</p>
               <p>What light had you then when you saw them? - They had a large candle, they were breaking the desk open, and pulling out the drawers, and I had the same light to see them; then I went back to my own room, and went out of the window, and called one of my master's sons up, he slept in another house, my window was on the ground floor; when I came back I called one

When my fellow servant called me up, I went with all the haste I could down the yard to the gate, it was fastened, I went round the farm yard and came to the kitchen door, which was open, and the yard door was open, and there was one of the great candles by my master's writing desk, the backs of the prisoners were turned towards me, one of them turned his head and I thought he saw me, then I said damn your body, what are you a doing there? with that Holmes caught hold of the pistol, and he run at me, damn your body, says he, I will shoot you dead; with that I says, shoot, shoot, and be damned; I had this stick in my hand, I struck at Holmes and missed him, and he knocked me down with the pistol, or with his hand, I am not sure which; away they ran out of the kitchen door down the yard, I followed them as well as I could, but I could not get up just in a minute, one of them was taken before I could get up with them.</p>

               <p>Was it light? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any truth in this part of the story? - I never saw her till I took her with the property upon her, I never saw her in the days of my life upon the oath that I have taken.</p>

               <p>How came you by that bed? - This young man the prisoner came from sea when I lived in Castle-street, I have known him a great while, and he told me he was going to provide a room for himself he had plenty of money, and some time after this, I did not see him for two or three months, I cannot tell which, then he came and asked me to buy a bed.</p>
               <p>About what time was that? - I think it is about three months ago, it might be short of that, or it might be full that.</p>
               <p>Might it be a month or six weeks? - It must be more than that, Seasons has had it three weeks, I had it two months before he fetched it from me to the nighest of my recollection.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner asked you to buy a bed, did he bring you the bed? - Yes, the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did you purchase it of him, I did, Mrs. Willis saw the bed.</p>
               <p>In what situation was it when she first saw it? - It was with other things laying about, and people lived in the room, I told her I had not bought a bed for two months, she said she had lost her's within a month, she then went up stairs and said here is the bed, says she I know it by the outside being my own spinning.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Willis. Did you ever say any thing about the spinning? - Nothing but the darning, I said it was what we called in the country a home spun tick.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of the expression that that woman mentioned? - Upon my honor I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you doubt this being yours when you first went? - My Lord I was terrified, there was many people in the rooms, and they were making their diversion, and I went into one room and they

               <p>What is the value of the things that are mentioned in the indictment? - I valued them at five pounds, they told me I must make a value; the prisoner came into my bed chamber at six in the morning, I asked her what she wanted, she told me she wanted a scrubbing brush and flannel, which she had left there the night before, I told her to take it; I got out of bed immediately and I said it was very dark, she said yes, it was but six o'clock: the night before she said to me, Madam I am very short of clothes, I wish you would give me leave to wash my gown to night, I told her by all means, she seemed rather confused and threw the gown across the table; I returned to my bed and left her to go on with her work, and at eight I got out of bed to ring the bell, I missed nothing; she was not there, I returned to bed and thought she was gone out somewhere, but in turning my eye towards the bureau, I found the drawer where I had placed my linen that came home from wash the night before, open and empty; that alarmed me, I jumped out of bed and went to the dining room, and found the place compleatly stripped, I screamed out that I was robbed, I left the dress I wore the evening before, and that I missed also.</p>
               <p>When did you find any of your things again? - Never till I found her, I believe it is a month yesterday since she was taken; I offered a reward for taking her, and about nine o'clock on Wednesday morning I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070057"/> informed she was in Vine-street, I went into the house where she was and several more women, the constable said to me Mrs. Langrish look which is your servant, I turned up her bonnet, she downed of her knees immediately, and said for God's sake have mercy upon me, I asked her what mercy she could expect, and I told her the only way she could have mercy upon me, was to discover what things she had got.</p>
               <p>Court. Now we cannot hear what she told you? - The constable then took a coach, and we went to several pawnbrokers before we came to the right, at last we went to Mr. Jarvis in Fetter-lane, and the trifling things that were found were found there, only two pictures and an umbrella; the other things were found by taking up a woman that was servant to her after it seemed.</p>

               <p>The evening the robbery was committed I had been over Westminster-bridge to see a friend, and was going home to my lodging in the Haymarket, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man run across the way, and went up to him, he knocked off my hat, he ran into a publick house, I could not be sure whether he went up stairs or strait forwards into the yard, I went up stairs to see for him and I was taken; they searched me immediately and found nothing upon me, the gentleman of the house then said that he noticed a man standing in his passage at the same time; there is a man that can witness that I was talking to him at the time there was a cry of stop thief; he was here this morning, and he will be here again at four o'clock, he heard I was in Newgate, and he came to see me.</p>

               <p>I live in Theobalds road, on the 22d of June, about ten minutes before ten, the two prisoners passed me as I stood at my shop door, loaded with lead on their shoulders, the aspect of the prisoners, and the unreasonable hour of carrying lead in the street, gave me the strongest reason to suppose they had stole it, the candles at the shop gave a full light of the prisoners, I determined to give charge of them if the watchman was at his stand, I did so, the watchman run after them and found them, I took one with the lead on his shoulders, the other was about twenty yards further with the lead on his head, he endeavoured to throw the lead upon me, but a person came by and assisted me, and the prisoners were taken with the lead upon them, and carried to the watch-house, one of the prisoners, Butler, as the watchman told me, flung out of his pocket these instruments, apick-lock and turn-screws which the constable gave into my possession; in the morning the owner came and owned the lead, I I know the piece of lead which will be produced: this is the lead found on the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Is there any particular marks besides? - Rather a large head, a remarkable large headed horse of the draught kind, it was a chaise horse.</p>

               <p>Can you safely swear that the horse you saw the day after in the possession of the uncle, was the horse that was stolen out of your stable? - Certainly, my Lord, I have no doubt of it; I was alarmed in the morning between three and four on the third of June, that my house was broke open, I immediately sent a man to the stables; I borrowed a horse of a neighbour, I went to different turnpikes in search of it; I took the prisoner, I met him going to London in search of the horse, I met him under the wall of Kensington Gardens; the prisoner was my <rs id="t17840707-40-deflabel213" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Here is no confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. You say this lad had lived with you nine months, had not he lived with you longer? - No, Sir, he came to me the 17th of June was a twelvemonth, and absconded.</p>
               <p>During the time he lived with you I believe he behaved very well, that you have acknowledged? - Where did I acknowledge that?</p>

               <p>The lad was giving a dram to a poor soldier, and his master threatened to lick him, and he ran away.</p>

               <p>Did not you ride part of the way to go for it? - We turned down Kensington, and I wished to have charged an officer with them there; he rode behind the uncle, the uncle said I will engage he shall go whereever you please, we never went out of the road, the uncle said, I believe I can find the horse for you; when we came into Piccadilly, the prisoner slipped down from behind his uncle, and ran down Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Court. When the Prosecutor charged him with taking the horse did he deny any knowledge of the horse? - He did say he had taken nothing from him, he told me directly the horse was at Chelsea very safe, I told the prosecutor so immediately, and I said I hope you will forgive him, he said I do not know what he has taken from me, we turned down to go to Chelsea and went as far as Hangmore Inn, through Kensington, it is two miles out of the road, we turned back again in order to go to Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to go? - Then Mr. Curtis's mind altered, he would not go, then we came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Now you have heard what that witness has said, is that true? - No, not that I purposed to go to Chelsea, or promised to forgive the man.</p>

               <p>Pettington. I suspected Watkins because I have known him many years.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing on Watkins when you took him? - I found this box coat upon him, it was tied up in his apron, something of a hard working rag, he said he would go into this house of ill fame where we had been searching for him, and he said to the prisoner Nunn, I will go and see if he has called here, says I, you will ask me leave first will not you, and I seized him, and that moment he discharged the bundle from him, and likewise Nunn the same; Nunn had this great coat tied upon something of a handkerchief, and this lace I took out of Nunn's pocket; we brought them to the watch-house and these twenty five grains of buck shot, this punch and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070075"/> these keys I took out of Nunn's pocket when I searched him and some loose powder.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you say this lace was the property of Lord Southampton? - Yes, I am sure it it is the same pattern I have on, and the waistcoat and hat had the lace cut off.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these were not given to the servants? - No my Lord, they were my Lord's property.</p>

            , he is at sea; on Saturday the 26th of June, about two at noon, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, they were in my box which was locked when I went out, which was about ten in the morning, they were in the room which I rent on the ground floor, there is no lock to the room, but a lock to the box, there is a button to button it with-inside; I found my things upon the prisoner when I returned about two, who came on the Monday night to lodge in the house; I left her in the house by herself, she said she was going a washing, and when I returned she was talking with some people, I saw she had my petticoat on under another, it hung below her's.</p>

I have not got any thing, I looked down the vault and this gown was there and I took it up, I saw her hand over the vault, but I did not see it go from her hand, this is the gown I took out of the vault, I know it by being all soiled, I took charge of the prisoner, and gave her to the constable, she said we might hang her if we pleased, the gown was left with the constable, (Mrs. Walker deposed to the gown) the prisoner left these cuffs behind her which I have in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Court. Where was it? - About three or four yards from the door of the iron house, under the knee of the head of a ship; then I got a light, and went into the house and found the other keys, there is a partition, the padlock was unlocked, and the keys were thrown among the nails; I think this is the key of the padlock; these keys are locked up in the foreman's counting-house every night, of which this is the key, and the labourer goes round to see that they are all locked; I then went to the counting house, which is on the other side the yard, separate from the iron house, and I found the lock strained off from the door; this hempen bag I found full of nails, I know it to be my father's property; I have no share in the house.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner in the iron-house, I heard a noise in the house, and I called out who is there, but no body made me any answer, I secured the door with some large paving stones which happened to be by and got a light, I heard a person run to the other end of the lost when I called out, I heard the nails rattle under his feet, and I heard the bag moved.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not it be moved by the running? - No, my Lord, it was so heavy.</p>
               <p>Can you say what bag of nails he moved? - One bag was moved from all the rest, I was in the lost that afternoon, and secured the lost door, I found the keys of the counting-house and of the nail lost laying down near the door at the bottom, these are the keys of the nail lost which I secured in the counting-house, which I carried into the counting-house, that evening, they were near the end of the head of the ship, the key of the padlock was there that opens the inner lost, I am positive sure I heard him in the lost trying to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in besides yourself? - No, I locked the door all the evening.</p>
               <p>Had you the key of the door all that time? - No, they are carried into the counting-house to the foreman at six o'clock who carried them home to his house, he is here.</p>
               <p>What difference was there between the situation of this sack of nails and the rest? - The foreman had that day ordered me to separate the nails which I did, there were two bags of them they weighed 168 pounds at least or more, when I went away I set them up an end one bag against the other, when I found them the bag was thrown down, it was moved about the length of the bag, by turning it down he had rolled it over.</p>
               <p>Court. If a man was to run with great violence against the bag might not he knock it down? - A man would fall before the bag.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But if it was possible for a man to knock it down would it not fall in the same position? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was the door he was trying to get out at? - Yes, but I heard them fall before I attacked him, I was about five or six yards distance, I was going past the lost at the time.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He made no defence in the world, but said he knew nothing about it, and he came there to sleep.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Meriton the elder had any bags there that were not his own? - Not that I know off.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Meriton. I ask you the same question? - No, Sir, I am sure of it, the nails were never opened, the bags were all filled with iron nails.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070089"/>Court to Williams. Do you know whether on that day these bags were filled with nails and that bag in particular? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whether the nails were not in the middle of the lost? - No they were supported by the lost side.</p>

            , the prisoner confessed to me that they were all our property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Was that confession reduced into writing? - I fancy it was.</p>
               <p>Then you must not talk about it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe about it? - I believe nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship I humbly submit will not hear any thing about that confession.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you or can you not say from your own knowledge, whether it was taken down? - I cannot say, it possibly might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any examination of the prisoner reduced into writing? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have no belief about it perhaps? - That I have no reason to tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, this was a subject discussed very much at length the last sessions, and I understood the Court expected it in all cases.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. The examinations of prosecutors, but not the confessions of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The act of Philip and Mary understands it should.</p>
               <p>Court. No, not confessions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not know whether I state correctly what was the direction of the Court last sessions, it was very much discussed here, whether any thing said before a Justice of Peace could be received in evidence that was not reduced into writing; and I understood the Court to say, for the information of Justices, that it was the duty of a Justice to reduce every thing into writing, for that the neglect of the magistrate should not operate against the prisoner at the bar, who may have said something, which, if reduced into writing, might appear in a different light, but which the witness keeps back, or part of it, and therefore monstrous mischief to prisoners might happen if part is to be kept back, and a witness who is unwilling to disclose the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070090"/> whole truth should come and give an oral evidence in part.</p>
               <p>Court. The Justices have no right to ask a prisoner to confess, but if the prisoner does confess, it should be taken down no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Here is no confession returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Mr. Harvey by at this time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that there have been some promises made to this young man if he would make confessions? - Not that I know of, I did not, and I did not hear Mr. Harvey; he is not here, I never heard from Mr. Harvey that he made any promise; I do not know or believe that he did. Here is a pair of stockings that I can swear to, there were so many in the paper of the same sort, and one pair is gone, which I am sure and positive are my own property, they were bought of a person that buys his goods at a public sale, and I bought what he had of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I ask you whether these stockings might not be matched? - I do not suppose they might.</p>
               <p>Do you believe upon your oath that they could not? - I never saw any more of the same, I will swear upon my oath they are my property.</p>
               <p>I shall repeat my question till I get an answer; upon your oath do you believe there is a possibility they might be matched? - They possibly might, I do not know that they might, I never saw any like them I will not swear that there are none of the same sort, but the person I bought them of had no more.</p>
               <p>He may have had some scores of the same kind of stockings? - I am very sure he has not had any of the kind.</p>
               <p>Give a reason for your certainty, as that will go to your credit? - He very possibly might.</p>
               <p>Then very possibly the prisoner might have purchased some? - It is rather unlikely; this is my own writing on the outside handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Is there the same sort of writing on other outside handkerchiefs like that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you have sold some like that? - I never sold a handkerchief off that piece.</p>
               <p>But off other pieces of the same pattern have not you sold? - No, I never sold one of them.</p>
               <p>But your people have? - I do not know that they ever sold one.</p>
               <p>That is a shuffle, that will not serve you? - Yes it will, I do not know that they have.</p>
               <p>How many were there at first? - There was only twelve of them in the first place, and I believe I have nine, and this makes the tenth.</p>
               <p>Who sold the other two? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then there are two that are otherwise disposed of than you know of? - They might, my servants never sold these to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>That you do not know? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>For God's sake, Sir, have a little regard to your oath and character? - I do, I have as much regard to my oath and character as you have.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you put private marks on every handkerchief? - On every outside handkerchief, this is the outside handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark on any other? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that that handkerchief was not sold by any of the other servants of the house, or by the prisoner? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner was entrusted to sell handkerchiefs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear this, that he never sold this handkerchief and put the price of it into the till? - I think it is very unlikely, it is not possible I think.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear, that a man entrusted to sell handkerchiefs to himself or any body else could not have done so? - It is not possible for a man to sell goods to himself.</p>
               <p>No! - He does not do it without giving some knowledge of it to some person in the shop, it is not right.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070091"/>Court. It is very odd that he should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But it is no theft, it may perhaps be an impeachment of the prudence of the prisoner, but not of his honesty; you cannot swear, however, that the price of this handkerchief has not been paid, into your till? - I will swear it was not paid to me, and I will bring my partner and my servants to swear that it was not paid to them.</p>
               <p>Whose hand writing is that? - That is my partner's.</p>
               <p>What is it? - It is one of my shop bills, it is a bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>For what? - For the goods that are mentioned in it; two yards and one-eighth of Florentine, and five weeks wages at twenty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Then he has purchased that? - Yes, it was booked, and allowed in his wages.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his buying any stockings of you? - I believe he had a pair or two of my partner; I am sure he had not this handkerchief of my partner.</p>
               <p>Explain the cause of your certainty? - My partner told me so.</p>
               <p>That is all you know it by? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Between one and two in the morning, I cameupon deck on board the ship Stanislaus, to see if there was a good watch, and I spoke to the watch then on the gangway, and desired him to keep a good look out on the craft; I went to my cabin, pulled off my shoes, and went to bed, I laid down for the space of six or seven minutes, when I heard a man very distinctly ask where is Mr. Barrett, the mate, I came out of my cabin, and saw the prisoner dressed in a blue jacket on the quarter deck, I asked him who wanted the mate, he asked me if my name was Barrett, and if I was the mate, I told him yes, he said unless we kept a better look out our craft would be robbed along side, that was the prisoner, he was standing between me and the craft, I thanked him and said I was much obliged to him, but asked him how they could rob the craft, when there was a watchman standing in the gangway; during these words the watchman cried out, Mr. Barrett, the man that brought that man on board is robbing the craft of the fruit; I immediately left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070092"/> prisoner on the quarter deck, I jumped down the gangway, and saw a man on the gunnel of the craft, handing a chest of lemons into the boat that was along side of the barge; immediately I got down into the craft, and cried out in a menacing manner to them to come back, or I would shoot one of them, but I had no fire arms; they shoved off the boat, and the two men jumped into the boat, and she might have been about ten feet from the craft when I got on the gunnel, they said to one another pull away, and they rowed a few strokes, during this time the prisoner came to the gangway, and the watchman was there, and he cried out in a loud manner, George, put back and take me in; they made him some reply, but I was so confused I could not understand what it was; they then backed one of their oars or scullers, and they pulled back with all their might; I came on the gangway and met the Captain with the prisoner, I asked him if that was not the boat that brought him off, he said yes, did not you see the fruit in that boat, said I, he did he said, I asked who this George was that he called, he said he called no George, he called Jem; I asked him who Jem was, and he said he did not know; I asked him if he knew me or had any business with me, he said he had no business with me, neither did he know me; he was then in custody with the Captain, and I had no more business with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. When you had got up and directed the man to keep a good watch, you had not observed any mischief going forward? - No.</p>
               <p>The first you heard was from the prisoner that came on board your ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It seems to have been very easy, if it had been his design, for him to have gone off without giving your notice? - No, Sir, the watch was on board.</p>
               <p>The watch had not given you any alarm? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him tell this story, That he was going on board another ship, for some purpose of smuggling, and that these watermen had forced him to this ship, and that he suspected them, and came to give you the alarm? - No, Sir, he said he came on board to know what them boats were rowing about for; and that his intention was to go on board some ship to deal, but he came voluntarily along side us, against the the watch's will.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him say that he was forced on board your ship? - I do not recollect any such thing,</p>
               <p>The mischief was done after he had given you the alarm? - No, Sir, I saw one chest after, but there were chests in it before.</p>
               <p>He gave you timely notice to prevent it? - I cannot say he did, he gave me notice before all was in.</p>
               <p>You had timely notice to prevent that chest being lowered down into the boat? - I had not, I used my diligence and could not stop it; I never saw the other two afterwards, nor our fruit, I immediately missed three chests, I saw one shoving into the boat the moment he spoke to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was the watchman on board that ship, it was past one o'clock in the night, a wherry came along side the craft, and I hailed the wherry and told them to put off and not come in the night time, they told me they wanted to come on board; I hailed them a second time not to come on board in the night, he told me it was nothing at all to me what he wanted, he wanted to come on board and speak to the mate.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he name his name? - He said I want to speak to Mr. Barrett, the mate, I told him he was asleep, he was not on deck, he told me you must show him me, I want to speak to Mr. Barrett, the mate.</p>
               <p>Was this before he came on board or after? - When he was getting up the ship's gangway; then he came upon deck, and I went along the gangway and shewed the prisoner the mate; when I was going to shew him the mate, the prisoner walked to the gangway, and he spoke to Mr. Barrett on board, and I saw the same wherry take the lemons; this was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070093"/> time that I shewed him the mate that they took the lemons; so I said to Mr. Barrett, there is the same wherry that brought Mr. Parry on board is taking the lemons out of the lighter, upon which I and Mr. Barrett jumped down from the ship's gangway into the lighter, and the wherry pushed off with one sculler; I saw three chests; when Mr. Parry saw that the boat pushed off, he called out George, come back and take me in.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the lemons? - Four pounds the three chests.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Smith. Have you examined these chests of lemons accurately? - No, Sir, they were with the rest.</p>
               <p>Does not the length of a voyage often make a very material difference in the value of the fruit? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Were they not common fruit? - They were not picked chests, they were common fruit, but many of them were green; I saw them packed in Lisbon, and they had been a very short time on board, they are valued by the fruit merchants at that value.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know of your own kno wledge? - Only as I have been informed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Oldnup. Did you know Mr. Parry? - No, that was the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>How did you know his name was Parry? - I said there is a man, I heard his name.</p>
               <p>It was your duty to keep a good watch? - To be sure, I do, I told him not to come on board, he said I want to come and speak with the mate, Mr. Barrett: the fruit was in the craft, he said I must shew him the man.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Was he never on board any ship that you watched smuggling? - Never.</p>
               <p>You are frequently watchman? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw smugglers come on board in the night time, I dare say? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to my Council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Smith. Did not the prisoner tell you he came to smuggle? - After the alarm was made, I came on the quarter deck, I there saw the prisoner standing on the quarter deck, I called to the watchman and asked what noise that was, he informed me the prisoner had come out of the boat alongside, and the people were taking away the fruit out of the craft, I told him not to let him go till I came out and conversed with him, I put on my slippers, and went on the quarter deck in my shirt, and called for a a pair of pistols, but none were brought me; I called for my great coat, which was immediately brought me by one of the boys, I then addressed myself to the prisoner, and asked him his business on board the ship at that hour of the morning, he informed me that he knew his business if I did not; I insisted on knowing, and he informed me that he came to see if he could deal, and not to thieve; then the fruit was taken away, and I insisted on taking the prisoner; he made no resistance, and told me his name, which he said he was not ashamed of; he said he did not rob the craft or design to rob it; I told him if he did not his confederates did, and it was his artfulness to keep the mate in dispute. I sent for a mate of another ship that he applied to, and he came on board, but he could say nothing in his favour, any farther than he had sold him some things, and he paid for them; I told him I should detain him, and would bring him to justice, he threatened me with making me pay five pounds per hour for detention and false imprisonment: he mentioned one Mr. Wallis that would be bondsman for him for his appearance on Monday morning, I sent for him, and he would not be bound for him, nor knew any thing of him, any farther than his name was Parry, so I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The way that I came to go on board this ship was this, a man that deals in smuggled goods came to me that night, we went into the Two Brewers, he asked me to go on board the Nonsuch, I could not get my own boat off, I went to Limehouse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070094"/> look for a boat and I saw two boats, one was a pair of oars, and the other was a pair of scullers rowing another man, I called scullers, they came on shore directly, I said I wanted to go outside that tier of ships, the tier Captain Smith's ship lay; they kept shoving astern, and when they put off along side the lighter, now, says they, damn your eyes, if you do not jump out we will heave you over-board; I went directly and called for the mate, and told him, and I sent for the mate of this ship, who came on board, and said he had no doubt but as I had bought goods of him, that I was come to buy goods that night of Captain Smith.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury. We do not think we need give your Lordship any farther trouble on this matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, Gentlemen, it is for you to exercise your judgment upon this case; to be sure the whole thing depends upon this, with what view he came on board this ship, if he came to put the men on their guard, he did a commendable thing, but if he only came to amuse the men while the things were taken out of the ship, he was an accessary to the theft; now, to be sure, it does not appear that he had any particular business on board that ship, nor was it very likely that at that time of night he should come from on shore on purpose to give this information on board this ship.</p>

               <p>On Friday this man went to this public house and left two pounds of tea for sale with the landlord; on Saturday night he came again and they could not agree for the price, I was there drinking I might be rather in liquor, the gentleman was rather affronted with the landlord, says I, it is rather bad times for smuggling now; says he you are a dirty fellow, and he walked out before me; he says he pulled his hat off and put the two pounds of tea in it, a scuffle ensued between us while we were at the door, and he lost his hat and I lost mine; we looked for them and when he came up again, says he this is the man that ran away with my property: on Sunday morning he met with me in the yard, and collared me, and said I wanted my property which the man that was with you took, he said I was the man that struck him, and I said if you do not let me go I will strike you again; then he met this young fellow and asked him for his hat: he forgave me every thing at the public house only to return him his hat again.</p>

             while the prisoner was in the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070096"/> after the two men were gone out? - I am positive the watch was in the shew glass when the prisoner came in; when the other, who I since understand was his brother, was gone, I followed the prisoner to the door, and immediately missed the watch, and concluded this man I had fitted the minute hand for, must be a confederate of his, as he never was within the reach of it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear positively that this man for whom you fitted the minute hand was not in reach of the watch? - Yes, I do swear positively that he was on the right hand of me, therefore he could not be within reach of it, I stood betwen him and the shew glass.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch after the two men lest the shop? - Yes, I did, and it was in the glass case after the two men had lest it, and when the prisoner came in when I missed the watch I suspected the man as being a confederate of the prisoner, because he must see him take it as he stood opposite the shew glass, I followed him, and in going through the courts to May's-buildings and Bedford-court I lost him; I then went into Maiden-lane, and in a passage that leads into the Strand I saw the four, the prisoner and the three men that had been in the shop standing close together as if viewing their booty; immediately upon the sight of me they all ran away, some one way some the other, I followed them, the prisoner ran into Maiden-lane, I followed him, and he ran down another court into the Strand, I still followed him, and in crossing the Strand he by accident I suppose fell down, by which means I took him, but I cannot recollect what he said.</p>

            's case,</p>
               <p>"By the word warehouse in the statute is meant not merely repositories for goods, but such places as are in the nature of shops; though the goods might with propriety enough be called the property of the prosecutor, yet his warehouse was not a place for sale; the meaning of this act with respect to shop-lifting must be such goods as are usually exposed to sale in the shop; I think your are right Mr. Chetwood in your objection.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is laid as a capital offence, but the counsel for the prisoner has taken very properly an objection in respect to that part which capitally affects the prisoner, for this was not the property of Alcock, and was not left there for sale, but for another purpose; therefore you must acquit the prisoner of the capital part of the charge.</p>

            's family, I am gardener, I missed this lead on the 24th of February last, from a building in the pleasure garden; there was about 762 lb. value four pounds ten shillings; we had a search warrant, and found the lead in the prisoner's house, in the garret, I tried part of it to the place where it had been taken from, and the plumber tried part, and it tallied exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it match exactly? - Within a very little trifle, as near as can be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. But you know if it was cut from the place, it ought to match exactly? - I have a piece here, the sheet was cut in two, one piece we fitted on, and brought a piece off the place where it is cut through in the middle; one side of this corresponds with the other; it was all found at the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Was that seam cut through? - It was cut through by a saw.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon yourself with precision to say, that that lead belonged to the house of Lord Paulet? - No, my Lord, I will not pretend to say that.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all that you speak from is its being about the same size? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, as this is the case, there is no evidence that applies home to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Were the sheep in view when you had this conversation? - I did not see the sheep that instant, my eye was too much upon the two men.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure this man was driving the sheep? - He was not out of my fight, the sheep were walking before him, there was a word spoken from one to the other, and then a blow, damn your eyes, says they, hit them, they will run fast enough by and bye, but which of the men said so I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070098"/> tell, whether it was the prisoner or the other man I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Had the prisoner or the other man any thing in his hand at that time? - I did not perceive any thing.</p>
               <p>What prevented you, darkness? - No, it was light enough; I heard the blow and the words, but which spoke the words or struck the blow I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You are very sure this is one of the two men that was driving? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you in liquor? - I had been drinking, but I was not in liquor, it is a thing I am not addicted to, I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when the prosecutor first saw the sheep? - No, I was sent for.</p>

               <p>Court to Yardley. Did that man appear to be in liquor? - As much as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then he took another man and let him go: I never offered to get away; says he, you damned rascal, I should not be afraid of taking fifty such fellows as you! says he, you have no call to pitch none of your gammon to me, because you know I am up to every thing of that sort; says he, have you any money, can you call for a gallon of beer, I said I had not, says he you are a pretty fellow. Then he told me if he got the reward for the sheep that he would turn me up at the Old Bailey, and if not, he meant to take my life away. I had some witnesses yesterday, but they would not stay any longer on their own expences.</p>

            , on the 10th of June last, and several times before, we lost money, and I suspected the prisoner, who lived with us, and I ordered some money to be marked in the petty cash, which was done so, and on the 9th of June one shilling was wanting, and on the 9th and 10th of June I ordered more money to be marked, not thinking one shilling a sufficient proof, and in the morning there were two shillings wanting; I sent for a constable, and the prisoner was searched, and the two shillings found upon him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Stoneley's Counsel. Do you know any thing now of that of your own knowledge, Mr. Constable? - Of what Mr. Counsellor?</p>
               <p>Why, Mr. Constable, of the coals being consigned to this Mr. Desimore? - I only know by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us it. - My Lord, when I was fetched, which was by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070104"/> Desimore, the gentleman to whom I am not to say the coals were consigned -</p>
               <p>Court. True, because you do not know it.</p>
               <p>Pearson. I found Windsor the evidence, you have heard, and Isham one of the prisoners, and one or two other, and they were interogated by this Mr. Desimore on the business of these coals being missing, and Isham said that coals had been delivered at Stoneley's, but he did not say by whom; then we went to Stoneley's house to ask him, and he first said he had received one sack, and afterwards two sacks, and bought them of the prisoner Talbot, and gave five shillings for the two sacks, and upon being further interrogated, he had received four.</p>
               <p>What is Stoneley? - I believe he is a silk-throwster, he lives in my neighbourhood; I have known him some time.</p>

Here is a petticoat which belonged to Miss Strutt, it is a dimity petticoat, here are two petticoats, two frocks, these are a pair of stockings of my mistress's which I have mended for her several times; they are marked No. 3. with black silk; my mistress has many of these clouts, this is one, this stock is new, I have seen it several times in my master's drawer, they are marked I and a dot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tomlins. When you saw these curtains in your mistress's room, did you know they were your mistress's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell your mistress? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not? - I did not like to make a disturbance, I know the curtains by sewing one of the loops.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, on the 10th of June after I had called two o'clock, this prisoner and two more passed me and bid me good morning, and when the clock struck three they all came past me loaded, I saw something under their clothes, I pursued them, and they dropped a bundle, two of them ran away and I took this one; they passed me three or four times altogether and came back altogether; one of them dropped a leg of mutton; this is the bundle and the prisoner is the boy, I took him to the round-house, and I afterwards found Mr. Ball's back gate open, and the door open, and two copper boilers let at the door ready, and in the hen-house there was a cock and hen without their heads, Mr. Ball's people owned the things in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How far were you from any other watchman? - A quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Had not you a rattle? - Yes, but it is a great chance if it is heard.</p>
               <p>But the purpose of it is to be heard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing in the conduct of these three persons that drew your attention to them? - No, not at first.</p>
               <p>So that you should not have known them again? - Yes I should, I see them frequently of a Ranelagh night.</p>
               <p>This poor child was not loaded at all? - No.</p>
               <p>The other two were stouter than this boy? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I never saw the boy till the watchman brought him to me, and a bundle of linen and things tied up in a handkerchief, and a leg of mutton, the boy fell a crying and said there had been two men along with him, and he was to watch the patroles and the watchmen while they got into the house; then we went round and found where the house was broke open, there was a window broke open, and a glass shutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had frighted this poor child out of his senses? - I do not think he was afraid at all.</p>
               <p>Do you know what reward there is for the conviction of this poor infant? - Upon my oath I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you, a patrol, do not know? - I am sure it is a thing I never had.</p>
               <p>You shall not slip through my fingers so? - Upon my word and honour I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear there was a reward of forty pounds upon the conviction of that child? - I never kneany such thing.</p>
               <p>But you have heard it? - I never heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070107"/>Come, come Sir, it is a fair question, and he Jury see you and hear you; upon your oath did you never hear that you should be entitled to forty pounds as the price of that poor infant's blood? - Your honour, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But you shall say before you leave that place? - I have heard other people talking about such things.</p>
               <p>So I thought; and with that answer so given I leave your testimony with the Jury.</p>
               <p>The things deposed to by Mrs. Ball; the shirts are marked and the table cloths and shift with S. B. the shirts are my own mending; here is a towel that I marked with I. R. that was left with me by a gentleman that went abroad, one Robinson; this striped waistcoat is my child's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That striped waistcoat is like ten thousand more? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>The old shirts that are not marked, are pretty much like all other old shirts that have patches, and that are a good deal worn? - There is but one that is unmarked.</p>
               <p>Did you mark the others? - My child marked them, I certainly must know them.</p>
               <p>Why is not the marking of overy other girl that learns to mark at the same time alike? - I lost my property that morning, I must judge.</p>
               <p>Is there any other thing you can swear to? - One of the table cloths has a fringe.</p>
               <p>Do you know it by the fringe? - I cannot by that, I lost a table cloth, and it is with the things that are marked; two of the table cloths are marked by myself.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear to your own mark on these two table cloths? - I would do no such thing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ball it is true that there is nothing of that property that may not be mine or the property of any other man that is here; can you safely and consciously upon your oath say, that that is your property, and not the property of any other person? - If you say it is not mine, I do not know whose it is, it is my husband's, I certainly can swear to the linen that I marked.</p>
               <p>Distinguish them? - These two table cloths.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that these things which you have spoken of are your's? - I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>What age is the boy? - Eleven.</p>
               <p>Court to Birdsey. When you followed these people two dropped the bundle and ran away, did the boy run away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said he did not belong to them, I asked him if he did not bid me good morning before and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is a boy of tender years, the circumstance that presses upon him is, his being seen in company with two men who dropped the bundle, and first running away and then acknowledging that he was in company with them, and was to watch while these two men got into the house; if you believe he staid without and watched while they got in and plundered the house, he is actually guilty with them. The law fixes no particular time for the age of discretion as to the criminality of the party, and under particular circumstances Courts have gone very far in adjudging children of very tender years to be capable of committing even capital offences, so far back as even of the age of eight years in some cases; in all cases the question is, whether the Jury are satisfied that the child, of whatever age, has sufficient knowledge and discretion to understand that he is doing a criminal act? for if he has, he is answerable to the law for the consequences; and whatever the feelings of Courts and Juries may be on such occasions, it would be highly detrimental to the public if any age was exempt, because people of full years would employ children to commit crimes of almost every description; therefore, if you believe that this child was conscious he was breaking the laws of his country, and was doing a criminal act, you will find him guilty; if you either doubt the proof of the property, or the truth of the case, you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>Court. Is that in the parish of St. George's? - Yes; on the 17th and 18th of June last I was robbed of a great many frame cucumbers, and a great many of my vines destroyed, which occasioned me to set a watch, one of my men, and on the 23d of June my man came and called me about ten minutes past one, I took my gun in my hand and went down, and I saw the prisoner and another man, one on each side of the frame, holding up the lights and getting cucumbers; I looked at them sometime, I went about six yards off them, and I told them if they did not surrender themselves, I would shoot them; the man that was at the back of the frames made off immediately, and I took the prisoner by the collar, and as soon as I got hold of him he said, you bloody thief, shoot away! I said, no, I have no occasion to shoot you, I have you safe enough; the other man made off, and my man shot at him as he went.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing taken away broken or destroyed? - The prisoner said some little time after, says he, what do you want with me, says I to take care of you; says he I ha lost my shoe, I insist on your finding my shoe; we brought him down to the watch-house, and when I came back there was a bag full of cucumbers and his shoe, I have his shoe here, they were laying at the frame and pretty near together.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you observe whether a great number of cucumbers had been cut from your frames or not? - Yes, there had been a great number cut, they had stepped into the lights.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said before the magistrate that he was drinking with a strange man at Westminster, and that this strange man brought him into my ground, and gathered some onions and cucumbers, and gave them to him.</p>

               <p>What business had you in the ground? - I was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>Court. What is the value of the cucumbers?</p>
               <p>Sprang. I valued the fruit cut and damaged at ten pounds, what they trod upon and gathered I could not count.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that a low valuation? - Yes, fifteen pounds would not make me amends.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the charge is under a particular act of parliament, which makes it felony to cut, pluck up, or destroy, any plants, roots, or shrubs, of the value of five shillings.</p>

               <p>There are other gowns of that pattern? - Yes.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I saw a bundle lay in Brick-court, I picked it up and went along Fleet-street with it, and that gentleman stopped me, I told him I had found it, I run after him, instead of running away from him, I never saw the young woman nor was in the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you will acquit him of the capital part of the charge as it was light enough to see a man's face, without the help of the candle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, I humbly submit, on the part of the prisoner, that the indictment which charges the burglary to have been committed in the parish of St. Clements Danes, in the county of Middlesex, is erroneous. I understand that part of Brick-court, in which Mr. Morris lives, is within a liberty of the County-Palatine of Lancaster. In a civil process this description would not be sufficiently accurate, I therefore trust the Court will be of opinion, that in a case so highly penal, the description ought to be in conformity to the fact, and allow the objection.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the same parish and county, and being a mere matter of description is not necessary.</p>

               <p>Court. Is this Bob here? - No, I do not see him; I went contentedly with him to the watch-house, and remained till the morni ng, and in the morning I was brought before the magistrate, with my hands cuffed in this manner across, a thing I never had before; when I came before the magistrate they said I had beat them; the Justice told me to go over the way and make it up, and they put me into the lock-up house, I remained there about half an hour, when one of the men brought me into a room where this woman was sitting at a long table, and the prisoner Lefevre proposed two guineas to make it up, I told them I had no money; I told them I was nakedless and friendless; then two men came again, and handcuffed me again, and put me into a coach, and carried me to Clerkenwell Bridewell; I remained there for three days, the vessel being gone down without me, I thought it right to write to my friends, to inform them of the matter, and of the unjustified cause that I had suffered; they took consideration of me, and found I was clearly right, and bailed me out; and now it is before you, my Lord.</p>
               <p>So there was no prosecution set on foot against you? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner Lefevre's Counsel. So they are all leagued against you, the watchman, Justice, and every body; do not you remember offering half a guinea to make up the assault? - I never did.</p>

               <p>Did not you break the watch-house? - Yes, I paid five shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you charge either of these women with a robbery that night? - I did not know the meaning of it, I told the watchman I was robbed, and the Justice.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - Very clearly so.</p>
               <p>And he committed you? - I was sent to gaol.</p>

               <p>Did your hear of any accusation against these women till after? - No, not till four or five days after: I am sure he offered them money to make it up, he took it out of his pocket, there might be eight or ten shillings, he said that was all the money he had, he would freely give that; I am sure he had some silver.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to the Justice, I was present at the first examination on the 2d of June, before the justice, he never in the least hinted any charge against the prisoners of robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, now we have heard the evidence on both sides, and to be sure, in regard to Lefevre, at all events she could not have been convicted on this indictment, because the charge against her was for stealing; whereas, by the evidence of the prosecutor, she was below stairs at the time, therefore the whole that she could have been found guilty of was for receiving and comforting. But upon the evidence itself, you see the story is the strangest that ever was in the world; to suppose a man had been robbed, and that he should suffer himself to come before the Justice as an accused person, and never make any charged the man would naturally have said, I am injured, I have been robbed. This is positively sworn by the Justice's clerk and others.</p>

               <p>Did he know you? - I do not know indeed, I only knew him by sight, I was not acquainted with him; I saw him the Thursday evening after at the White Lion, the corner of Shadwell market.</p>

               <p>He lives very near? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You found him the next day in his business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He robbed without any disguise at all? - None at all.</p>

               <p>If you was a good deal frightened, as you have told us, do you think that you could venture to swear that that man is the man that robbed you, knowing that his life is at stake? - I am very cautious he is the person and no other.</p>
               <p>He said he was at the Eagle and Child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the other man at all? - I do not know either of the others.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it wanted precisely ten minutes to twelve? - About a minute after I was robbed I met the runner, and I told him, and he said let us look at the time, and he pulled out his watch and said it wanted ten minutes of twelve.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you tell him who you was robbed by? - I told him by Williams; the officer went to the watch-house to call some other men.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Last Wednesday night, a little before twelve, I was going home to my lodgings with the last witness, he was before me a few yards, I saw somebody stop him, and a man came and hit me over the left arm with something in a scabbard; I thought I would give him my money, and another man came up, then I thought I would not give him the money, and I knocked him down, and my hat fell off, and the man that I supposed robbed Pickett, he put my hat on my head.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there were three? - There were two with me, and the one that was with him came and put my hat on.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he do that? - I suppose he was afraid I should take him, as I had knocked the other down.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of them? - I think the prisoner is the man that put my hat on, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>How comes that, was it light enough to see him? - Yes, but I never saw any of them before, and therefore I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What may you be? - A Carpenter by trade, we work together.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a carpenter? - I have been eleven years out of my time.</p>
               <p>Was you ever on ship-board? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you a witness last sessions? - I never was in this place before.</p>
               <p>Court. These are the civilest highwaymen I ever met with, the one is knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070123"/> down, and the other comes and puts the witness's hat on.</p>
               <p>They came and met you did they? - The prisoner met me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I shall prove the prisoner twenty miles from town.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was so dark you could not see them? - I could not know them well enough to swear to them.</p>
               <p>How long were they with you? - I dare say they were half a minute.</p>
               <p>Court. You see Gentlemen, the other witness said four minutes, this man says he could not see them to know them, and the other could.</p>
               <p>Court. Which way were they coming? - They met me as I was going towards my home, they certainly must be coming the other way.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Be kind enough to be very accurate and certain, which way were you going and which way were they going when you joined together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, now he has been in Court and heard the other man's evidence!</p>
               <p>Court. He gave his evidence very positive at first.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 12th of June between six and seven in the morning, I went to a house in an alley between Goswell-street and Golden-lane, in consequence of an information I had heard the preceding evening, of one of the returned convicts lodging in that house, when I came there with two others, I found he was not there, I went into the one pair of stairs and knocked at the door, the prisoner Percival got out of bed and came towards the door, where was a hole big enough to put through two fingers; I saw him come to the hole, and from thence go to the closet towards the other side of the room, at first I saw somebody come to the hole but did not know who it was, I observed him tarry there a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070125"/> little space, I conceived there was a closet there, and that he was preparing something to give us the meeting; I apprehended that he was preparing for opposition, in consequence of which I says to Clarke who was next the door, wait for nothing, snap open the door at once, or words to that effect; he endeavoured to break open the door, the hinges gave way, and I saw the prisoner Percival go from the place where he stood towards the window, I went down stairs to tell Newman to take care of the window, before I could get into the room he was out of window in his shirt, I saw Newman and him down together, and I immediately came up and assisted Newman in taking him; upon searching the room I found this pair of shoes and a pair of scissars with silver bows to them, and a quantity of halfpence; I have told them and I believe if my memory does not fail me, there is seventeen shillings and sixpence and some halfpence besides, and a quantity of tobacco, this towel in which the tobacco now is, was hanging up against the window, just by the bed side, and a quantity of sugar and two or three knives and forks, and a quantity of tobacco papers which I found on the floor in the name of Berry; on finding these I said these will say something, we will take him on suspicion, and he was taken into custody; he was asked whose things they were, he at first declined giving us an answer but he afterwards confessed that the goods were not his, upon which we tied his hands and took him to the Compter, I took the things to my house, and he was examined before Alderman Harley, the prosecutor brought his servant there the same morning in custody of an officer, on suspicion of being concerned; the servant's name is

               <p>Your master's house was broke open, who was it by? - The two young men.</p>
               <p>Do you see one of the young men here? - Yes, Percival and another young man, I saw them on the Friday night, the other young man said whose watch is that hanging up in your master's bar?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070126"/>Was Percival in hearing then? - No.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us? - My master sent me out of an errand one day, and Percival was in the street and he met me, he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>What did Percival say to you about breaking the house? - I heard the other young man say to Percival, he lives at the gentleman's house where they meant to come and get in; then they both said to me will you say any thing if we get into your master's house; they said no more when Percival was with them, they said they would give me some money if I would not say any thing, I was in bed when they got in, I did not hear them nor see them.</p>
               <p>You knew before that they intended to come? - From what they said to me, but I did not let them in, nor hear what time they came in, there was a cellar window, they asked me if that window was fastened, I told them it was not, I left no other place open for them.</p>
               <p>Was the door of the cellar stairs fastened? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the watch and the other things? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where were you to see them to get the money for holding your tongue? - The young man said he would come to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Did not your master take you into custody the next day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you terrified very much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that if you would but confess no harm should be done to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say a word about Percival? - No, I did not know their names, I did not think it meant any harm because the young man is a monstrous laughing young man.</p>
               <p>So they said it publickly in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to say nothing to your master when you went home? - I had no thoughts of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. He certainly stands in the light of an acceslary before the fact? - I had no acquaintance with them in my life, but they often used the house.</p>

               <p>When you came there what did you find? - We looked into the out houses, and in one of them we found twelve bags of tea.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they all in the same sort of packages? - A paper bag, a canvas bag, and a oilskin bag, and a sailcloth bag sewed all up compleat, they were all in the same packages, but different sorts of tea.</p>
               <p>What weight might this be? - The neat weight of them three hundred and thirty three pounds; we cleared the bags to see the weight, they were covered over with straw, we immediately put them into the cart and went off; we had each of us a glass of brandy, we did not stop a minute.</p>
               <p>How far is Apperton from London? - About seven miles and a half, this was a cart that Mr. Buckland hired in Old-Street, we took it down for the purpose; in our way to London we met two men on horse back just on the top of the hill called Hanger-hill.</p>
               <p>Who were these two men? - I have seen one of them since, but the other I have not seen.</p>
               <p>Who was that one? - That is the Gentleman (pointing to the Prisoner) he was on horseback, he turned back several times and looked at us, there was a post-chaise just before, but the horsemen were some distance behind the post-chaise; there were two men in the post-chaise, I saw these men afterwards, we met them on Hanger-hill they passed us, it is about half a mile on this side of Apperton nearer London; we came on till we came near Kensington Gravel-pits just coming up the hill this Gentleman the prisoner passed us again.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with him then? - Nobody, I did not notice any body.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said? - No, not a word, then we proceeded on further till we came to Broad-Street, St. Giles's, about a quarter or twenty minutes before one, I am not sure to a minute, I was walking along the pavement, and somebody knocked me down, I was not driving the cart, I strove to get up, and I got nearly up and somebody knocked me down again; when I got up I stood on the side of a post, and I saw the prisoner among a number of people fifteen or twenty, there might be more or there might not be so many.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - I cannot say; the people that were with him had sticks, and he might have one for any thing I know, I cannot say whether he had or not, I was so stagnated; three of them made an attempt at me, the people came to take my weapon away.</p>
               <p>What weapon had you? - a small cutlass, two men took hold of the blade of it, and swore if I did not deliver it to them they would shoot me; some man that had a blunderbuss stepped up, and said damn your eyes take care, I will blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>How were these men armed that attacked you? - All with sticks, such as good sized walking sticks with knobs to them, some small and some large, they snapped the blunderbuss, but it did not fire.</p>
               <p>Was there any flash in the pan? - No, I made an attempt to strike at the man with the blunderbuss with a cutlass, but several of them prevented me, they beat me on the side of the house, and there the others snapped the blunderbuss a second time at me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070129"/> seeing that I attempted to run into a house that was a hair dresser's, and the blunderbuss snapped at me again, and somebody struck at me with a stick, but I am not sure who it was, I could not see; he missed me but hit the door post very hard; I had not been in above a minute before the cart and horse was drove by me by three men, two or three of those that were there with their sticks; the man beat the horse very much, there was a great mob, a hundred or two people, I followed the cart all up that street, and into Bloomsbury-square, and at the end of Dyot-street, I heard somebody cry, let him go, let him go, and I saw one

               <p>During the time that they were beating you with the blunderbuss, did you see the prisoner? - Not after the time that I was first knocked down.</p>
               <p>Did you see the other persons that struck you? - No, I felt it, I did not see them strike me, they struck me behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard, one of the Prisoner's Council.</p>
               <p>I believe through the scuffle in St. Giles's there were a great number of people collected together, were there not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Their curiosity was excited? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was knocked down before you saw the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you got up you saw him standing? - He was among the people.</p>
               <p>Several of the people had sticks? - I cannot say the prisoner had a stick, I will not swear that he had or had not.</p>
               <p>Was the cart gone up Bow-street before you was knocked down? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you was before the cart? - I was on the side of it, the prisoner was before the cart, nearer towards Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Of course, if the prisoner was before the cart, he was not with the man that knocked you down? - He did not knock me down, I was knocked down twice from behind.</p>
               <p>Did the cart overtake the prisoner? - He was as nigh to it as I am to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. Had you known this man before? - I never saw him before that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman and this Mr. Buckland came to Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Clerkenwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For what? - I went along with a gentleman that was there as a witness, and he would not go by himself, I went with Mr. Rice Jones and Mr. Lucas, I only went in company with them.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any body else being taken up for this business? - There was a man taken up for the same crime.</p>
               <p>Was that man sworn to? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that man was discharged? - He was.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was the same man? - Yes, there was another with him, we came on towards the Excise Office, we came into Broad St. Giles's, and there a large mob arose, and there was one man that pointed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070130"/> us out to them, and a large mob came up, three of them came up to me, the cart was before me, we did not expect any opposition.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they any thing in their hands? - A bludgeon, I saw nothing but bludgeons; so they attacked us, and I defended myself as well as I could; I lost sight of the horse and cart and my comrades, but as soon as I could get on I went in pursuit of them, and the goods were retaken.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner in St. Giles's at all? - No, Sir, the last sight I had of him was at Kensington Gravel-pits.</p>

               <p>You could see distinctly, I take it for granted? - There was a great mob I could see from all quarters.</p>
               <p>What sort of bludgeons were they? - They were sticks, large sticks.</p>
               <p>Were they common walking sticks, or were they bludgeons? - They were what you call bludgeons.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I will swear they were sticks.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester, one of the Council for the Crown.</p>
               <p>What are you? - An officer of Excise.</p>
               <p>Court. Come to Broad St. Giles's at once. - I was driving the cart in St. Giles's, just before I came to Drury-lane, perhaps twenty yards, and I saw a great number of people collecting about me, coming after us; a soldier came and asked me for a blunderbuss which we had in the cart; I said for God's sake, soldier, for God's sake do not fire, you may hurt the innocent; when the soldier got the blunderbuss, and had a horse pistol likewise, I saw a man coming to strike me on the left side of the cart, he came and knocked me out of the cart, who he was I do not know; as soon as I got up again, I saw the prisoner at the bar come up to me, and hit me on the side of my head, and knocked me against a plug, where the water comes through; I am very positive to the man. After that there was a number of people came about me, and I was going to rise, and he says, damn him, murder him a villain! after I got up again I was quite stupified; at last I saw the cart going away, I endeavoured to follow it, and opposite Bow-street, St. Giles's, at the corner of Hart-street, I laid hold of a post, I found myself very weak; with that the prisoner came up with his stick again, and grinned his teeth at me, and said, Ah, damn you; and struck me a second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he strike you? - I do not know where I received the blow, I had the pistol in my hand, and he knocked it out of my hand, and I was stooping to pick the pistol, and he then knocked me against the rails, and I crept into a house there by some means; I know no more till I went up and saw that the very man, the prisoner at the bar, was taken, which was the very man that struck me; this might be about four or five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you go? - I do not know the street.</p>
               <p>Was it a neighbouring street or a distant one? - It was two or three streets, I was very weak and bled a good deal; I went in a coach to the hospital and was dressed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Are you positive that was the man that struck you a blow in St. Giles's, and afterwards struck you against the post? - I am positive to the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard</p>
               <p>I think you say you was in the cart when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070131"/> you was first attacked? - I was, I gave the blunderbuss out of the cart to the soldier, and desired him not to fire for fear of hurting an innocent person; the man said damn you, get out of the cart, and was going to strike me, I held a pistol at him.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner struck you against the rail, you told us that he struck you, but you forgot to tell us that you held a pistol at him; did you not present the pistol at him before he knocked you against the rails? - I did present it, but it was not cocked.</p>
               <p>Cocked or uncocked, did you present it? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner committed for at first? - I believe for a felon; I am sure it was for felony and striking me.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he was committed for an assault at first? - I charged him with taking away the tea.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that the Justice committed him for a felony at first? - I never examined the Justice's books, I had no business with them; I charged him with robbing us of our cart and horse.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with that at first? - I do not swear that I did at first, but before he was taken out of the Justice's I did, and I said he should have no bail, he had robbed us; I charged him with robbing us, I do not know how he took it down; I believe I told him every thing as nigh as I can; it was within five or ten minutes from the time he struck me; I saw him in Russel-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a soldier, I was with the other witnesses with a horse and cart, I saw the prisoner that day, I met him about half a mile from this place where they made the seizure, I saw him in Broad St. Giles's, it was between twelve and one in the middle of the day, I and the other three were with the horse and cart; I saw the prisoner come up to the cart, and I saw a large mob noisy there, and I ran up to the cart immediately, and asked Simpson what was the matter, he said he did not know, then there came up three or four and struck him as hard as they could.</p>
               <p>Court. With what? - Large bludgeons, very large sticks indeed, they knocked Mr. Simpson off the cart, he had like to have tumbled atop of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner do any thing? - He struck me with a stick and knocked me down, and then said, damn him, kill him, knock him on the head; I had nothing to defend myself with, I had lost my weapon, I had a blunderbuss under my coat which the gentleman gave me out of the cart, but I had lost that in the scuffle; I do not know what became of the horse and cart, I was so knocked about in the affray I lost the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>You are sure that Shelley, the prisoner at the bar, was the man that knocked you down with the stick? - I am quite sure of it, I saw him do nothing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Was you in your soldier's dress? - No; I was not, I had a brown great coat on.</p>
               <p>So you took this blunderbuss in order to fire? - I had it in my own defence.</p>
               <p>Was there any other blunderbuss there? - I did not see any, there might be, but I did not see them, I could not have seen them, I was knocked down, and my head swimmed about, I did not know where I was.</p>
               <p>When you first came up to Simpson he had been beat sadly? - He was knocked out of the cart by somebody, but who I do not know; I never saw the prisoner do any thing to Simpson: I attended that day before the Justice, but I cannot say what the charge was; I was examined before the magistrate, but I did not sign any thing, I was so ill, I was very much bruised indeed, I was knocked down by a hand whip.</p>
               <p>What was the charge against the prisoner at that time? - It was for assaulting Simpson, he was committed to gaol for that I believe.</p>
               <p>Was there any charge against him for stealing tea? - I was so ill I could not take any notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070132"/>Did you ever attend again before the Justice after the first day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, here is a strange singularity in this case, to call it by no other name; this man is examined before the Justice and committed for an assault on Simpson, on the 21st he was committed for the offence against the Excise laws, and the informations actually returned are of another day, and of other persons, so that we are perfectly in doubt as to every thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. My Lord, the Excise officers knew nothing of this statute, nor the Justice of the Peace neither.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The man was never examined a second time.</p>
               <p>Court. If you shew that he suppressed any charge or any facts, that is another thing; the only inference to be drawn from this is, they did not know the extent of the Excise laws.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, my observation is this, if these informations had been here I could have confronted the witnesses; they are suppressed, and the new examinations, of which we cannot try the truth, because we know nothing, are brought here.</p>

             the officer? - I am a smith, and about a quarter after one I was going out with some iron, and I saw a few people gathered together in Broad St. Giles's, I saw Mr. Simpson in the cart, and somebody struck him, but I cannot tell who; after that I saw the prisoner at the bar hit him with a stick and he fell; afterwards a man came up with a cutlass and cut him over the head; he was getting up, he was on his hands and knees, and then he fell again; after that there were more blows struck, but amongst so many I could see no more till after two or three men laid hold of the cart and horse, and took the cart up Bow-Street, I followed them along Bow-street, and I saw Simpson stand bleeding at the corner of Hart-Street, but before that I saw the prisoner at the bar turn several times and shake his stick, but what he said I cannot say; and as the cart was passing by the end of Hart-street, the prisoner was behind the cart with a stick in his hand; I saw Mr. Simpson stand bleeding against some iron rails at the corner of Hart-Street, he immediately went out of the middle of the road, and he struck up with his stick and struck Mr. Simpson over the head; Mr. Simpson immediately fell, and crept into a house, but what house I cannot tell; I saw some more blows struck, that I can take safe oath of; there were so many of them that I could not see every one, but I saw Simpson knocked down and cut with a cutlass, and expected him dead.</p>

               <p>Do you remember seeing Simpson present a pistol? - I saw him have either pistol or blunderbuss in his hand when he came out of the cart, I did not see him present a pistol to that man; I cannot recollect I saw him put a pistol to any body at that time; I saw the man that laid hold of the horse have a blunderbuss in his hand.</p>
               <p>Who struck Simpson? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>I was at the end of Bow-street, about twenty minutes before one, it was this day three weeks, there was a man with a blunderbuss came up, I thought it was a mad bullock at first, he was in a sailors jacket and a flapped hat, and he knocked down Tillary; I did not know the man's name then: he walked backwards and forwards, I was as near to him as I am to you, a cart came up and a mob of folks, and I wanted to get out of the mob; there were some more men that I saw with sticks and things, I could not tell who they were, the cart went into Russel-street, and Bedford-street, and through the square.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner? - Not at that time but afterwards, I did not see him till after the cart passed; I saw the prisoner strike Simpson over the head with a stick, and with that the prisoner said keep away, keep back; he struck him and knocked him down; I believe the cart was gone a good way, there was a number of people, the prisoner was a good way behind the cart when he struck the man; I lost sight of the cart; the prisoner went after the rest of the mob, and I was near to him at the time, and he was taken by a man, he was running, he had hold of the rails in Russel-street, at the end of Dyot-street, a stick fell down, I had hold of the flick myself, I let it drop immediately, some people came up and said let the poor man go, let him go; in the mean time Simpson came up all in a gore of blood, then they did not let him go: I should not have troubled myself about this affair, I did not go the Justice's on Saturday, I was sent for to speak to another man that was taken up, which happened to be acquitted.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was the prisoner? - I am too sure.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>You are too sure are you; what are you? - I live in Holborn, I am a live Poulterer.</p>
               <p>Some of your poultry consists of dogs, does not it? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Now how many dogs have you in that poulterer's shop at this hour? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you will tell! - I cannot.</p>
               <p>There may be a good many come in since you came out you know? - There may no doubt, for I have bespoke a pack.</p>
               <p>You are a very wholesale dealer in this sort of poultry called dogs, you cannot give any thing like a guess how many of these dogs you have in the shop at present, now have you so few as thirty? - There may be.</p>
               <p>I believe you have had the misfortune to be here before? - I never was here before only to give a man a character.</p>
               <p>I am a little in your se crets Master Martin, was you examined to that man's character? - I was.</p>
               <p>What sort of treatment did you meet with here, was not you sent back to that building there? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw this man carried into the Justices about one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not think it necessary to go in? - It was a business I did not like; a person came to me from Mr. Walker's office, as I said I should know the man again, and had seen the person that was in trouble strike this man.</p>
               <p>How many cutlasses did you see? - I will not be positive, I saw one, there was a cutlass in a sheath and a blunderbuss, one in a sheath and one out; I would not swear positive to no body; I will swear he is the man that struck the man.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that there were two cutlasses in the whole affray? - I did not see two, I saw but one out of the sheath; the prisoner was running very fast when he was taken, but there is another man will prove that more than I can.</p>
               <p>Do you know any one fact that you have been talking off by your own knowledge, are you sure it was Russel-street that you saw him lay hold of the rails? - I did, and in Charlotte-street too.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Did he run fast after him? - Not very fast, he came up with other assistance, and he was brought before the Justice; there was a man taken up on suspicion, and he happened not to be the man; I was before the Justice, and was examined.</p>
               <p>Did not you positively swear that was the man? - No Sir, I said I believed he was the man.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, I do not know for what purpose this surgeon is called; it does not go at all to the establishing the offence, and it may make certain impressions which may as well be spared.</p>
               <p>Court. The wounds are a confirmation of what they say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We do not dispute but Simpson had a blow from somebody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You are a surgeon, Sir? - Yes; Simpson was admitted into the hospital from a cut on the top part of his head, which penetrated his skull, and from which his life was in danger; he had a wound on his forehead likewise, that was of no consequence; his life was certainly in danger from a wound and contusion which appeared to have been done with a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. My Lord, we have now finished our case.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you say any thing for yourself, your counsel can only examine witnesses, or suggest any matter of law, they cannot tell your story for you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, as counsel for the prisoner I humbly submit to your Lordship, that in this case they have not shewn such proof on the part of the prosecution, as is necessary to bring the offence imputed to the prisoner within the indictment; for the indictment charges that the prisoner at the bar, with certain other persons, unlawfully and riotously assembled themselves together, in order to rescue certain goods, being unaccustomed goods, &amp;c. In order to support this offence, I shall first submit to your Lordship, that it is absolutely necessary that they should prove the parties to be of that description that they have set forth in the indictment, and they have not produced any thing to shew that they were Excise officers at all; I am well aware the act of parliament will be produced, and it will be said no other proof is necessary, but that act of parliament I submit is previous to the proof itself with which it dispenses.</p>
               <p>Court. According to my recollection it is sufficient to shew that they acted as Excise officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, I submit they should be proved by some other persons to be Excise officers, and that they acted as such.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, that they acted as such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, we have no proof even of that, but from the mouths of the men themselves; and then another allegation necessary to be proved is, that these goods which are stated to be rescued were unaccustomed goods.</p>
               <p>Court. They must prove that, there is no doubt of it, the question is, whether they have not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I shall submit the same proof is necessary, as there would be in the condemnation of goods; they have not told your Lordship for what cause they took this tea, and whether it was in an entered place without a permit, or in an unentered place; but simply that they got into possession this tea, nor have they produced any thing to shew your Lordship that the tea was under condemnation, if the tea had been subsequently condemned, they ought to shew that condemnation: by their own evidence they have shewn that the cart was actually recovered, and that the parties they took it from had it in their custody afterwards; I am therefore warranted to say that this tea was returned into the Exchequer; why then they ought to put it in the same situation as it would be if we were now trying an information for condemnation, then that information would exhibit certain charges.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose they were, it is sufficient you know that the burthen should be put on you, the person claiming it must shew it; but it always gives me great pleasure if any thing can be said on behalf of a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, it is usual in informations for condemnations, to state particular reasons why the goods were seized, that they were seized for some cause or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070136"/> other; and if the commodity is not brought within the description in the information, the commodity never is condemned, and I submit it is necessary to prove the same here as in a tryal of that nature, and that this tea was in that specific situation, which by the excise laws would make it condemnable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship indulge me with an observation or two on the same side, in support of both these objections, and I profess it is my humble opinion (which it is my duty to submit to your Lordship) that the first is by no means the weakest of the two objections; the gentlemen answer this by saying, that though this would not be proof against the prisoner at the bar in an information or at law, yet that the strict rigidity of proof is dispensed with in the Excise laws, and that they are to be proved through some other medium; the act of parliament on which the gentlemen ground their answer to our objections, is the 11th of

             I. it is pretty easily discovered what the spirit and intention of that act of parliament was; it sets out with saying, that whereas it very often happens, that by the strict rules of evidence through defect of proof in actions, and prosecutions against persons under the revenue laws, such persons have escaped conviction, and therefore the legislature dispenses with the strict rule of proof, and then it goes on seemingly rather inattentively, and rather inaccurately to indictments; it goes to indictments against persons for rescuing the seizure of goods: what was the offence at that day? it was only a misdemeanor, a common assault punishable by fine and imprisonment; but then afterwards by the act of the 19th of

             I. cannot by any possible construction be extended to the proof in this case; how easy would it have been at the passing the second act, if they meant to extend the first act to this, to have provided for it, and said all these things mentioned in the former act shall be applicable to this high offence; I am certain your Lordship will not think it is to be extended in this case; is it the bare saying of these men that they are revenue officers that is to convict the prisoner? non constat, that they were not tortious persons; these men are not appointed by paroll, there is such a thing as deputation, under the hands and seals of the commissioners; why is not that produced? and when a prosecution is carried on by their own officers, is there a difficulty in producing it? if there is not, you will not assist the gentlemen in order to support what is applicable to this subject, a degree of laches in not supporting their cause in this way. But my Lord, I humbly submit that the second objection is unanswerable; they must be unaccustomed goods, they must be liable to the payment of duties not paid or secured; can the Gentlemen upon their oaths, and in their consciences say, that the duties on this tea have never been paid or secured; nothing like it: why then I say it is not unaccustomed goods, now have they affected to prove they are? have they told your Lordship that the package was peculiar to smugglers? therefore I contend it may have been very fairly paid for, and carried to Aperton under a permit. My Lord, there is a case of the last session, which seems to me to be completely in point; the case of

            ; it was an indictment against the prisoner for opposing a Custom-house officer: did they there stop as they have done here? did they say we went on board because we possessed such and such powers? No, they produced the survey of the harbour, and they brought oral evidence to prove that the ship was within the limits of the harbour; they pointed out the species of goods on board, to be the species of goods that were seizable; these produced the sentence of condemnation; here it is answered by the solicitor of the Excise, these have been returned into the exchequer: I am entitled to say that the prisoner at the bar had paid the duty on these goods: shall not he defend his property? one would expect in an indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070137"/> for killing, that the warrant of the man should be produced; even a constable may be resisted, and resisted lawfully, even to his death, unless he is a known constable, or produces his warrant: perhaps in the next sessions we shall produce to your Lordship a sentence of the Exchequer, that these are not unaccustomed goods; and after this man has been executed under this conviction, how will every man that has been concerned in this cause, feel upon such an occasion, if it should so turn out? If we are to go on in this way, we may have such sort of prosecutions brought on every day against persons that resist revenue officers: I say my Lord, that at present we have not got such a sentence of the Exchequer, and I say too, that by the practice of the Court we could not get it: why what is the practice of Mr. Sylvester in prosecutions against persons for procuring letters of administration? does not he come here constantly, and apply to put the trial off till they have got the probate? just so here, if they had come and told your Lordship these goods are now in a progress of condemnation, there is a suit instituted in the Exchequer, in which we have got judgment; but having done nothing of that kind, nor shewn that these were persons authorized by the law to seize and carry goods to the Excise-office, I am sure your Lordship will not think they have sufficiently proved the case on the part of this prosecution.</p>

            . chap. 30. sect. 32, states what the evidence shall be in all cases where there is either a prosecution against Excise or Custom-house officers, for any thing done under the colour or pretence of their authority, or where there is a prosecution against any man for rescuing goods; the act of Parliament has said that which by the common law would not be evidence, shall in all such cases be evidence; it is a species of evidence undoubtedly, but is inferior to that which might be produced, by shewing you the appointment under the hands and seals of the commissioners; the common law did not suffer it but on account of the inconveniencies that might arise, it was laid down as a rule by the legislature, that in all cases whatever concerning the revenues, whether they were civil suits, or whether they were criminal prosecutions; whether they were against officers, or against persons charged with smuggling; in all these cases a species of evidence shall be sufficient that would be insufficient at common law: the act says, not only Excise officers, but any person acting in aid under Excise officers; so that I conceive there is nothing in this objection stated in this manner, that this act of parliament which dispenses with the proof, was prior to the proof itself; this act which creates, or rather converts this offence into a capital felony, they say it was prior to it; but my Lord that will make no difference, for as to these Excise officers, the law tells you, that the man who acts as such, shall be taken to be such, unless you can prove the contrary; it puts the onus probandi on them; I conceive there is nothing in the world in the objection, though it has some ingenuity in it, as to the stating this act of parliament on which it is founded, as being later in point of date. I now come to the second objection, which I think my learned friend who spoke first, had not much reliance upon; and I am perfectly ready to admit, and there is no principle more clear, than that the evidence given to day, would be quite sufficient to condemn the goods, if it stands uncontradicted: the man who claims, has the onus probandi imposed upon him. I submit therefore to your Lordship, that I have given evidence sufficient to be laid before a jury, and to put the prisoner on his defence; the Gentlemen may contradict<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070138"/> this evidence if they can, or if they can induce the Jury to believe either that it is not true, or that there is something in it besides, to shew that the duty has been paid; but at present it stands thus; the officers of Excise go to an outhouse at Aperton, seven miles and a half from London, and under some straw they find twelve bags of tea, which they take and bring away, in order to bring to the Excise office, but in their journey thither, they are thus assaulted, beaten, and the tea rescued and taken from them; in the case which Mr. Garrow mentions of a probate, there is an administration actually granted, and out under the seal of the ordinary; that is a judgment, and though it be improperly obtained, while it stands you are bound by it, of course it is absolutely necessary, that that jurisdiction which granted it, and which alone is competent to examine into the validity of it, should do so before you can go into your prosecution here.</p>
               <p>Court. The first objection is, that proper proof has not been adduced, that the persons making this seizure are Custom-house officers; the case arises on the act of parliament, it has been been very properly and pointedly argued by the prisoner's council, which is, that as to what should be sufficient proof refers only to the offence which should be a misdemeanor, and that by a subsequent statute that misdemeanor is converted into a felony: it seems to me, this act of parliament does not touch on the offence, but only regulates the manner in which it shall be proved; as to the second objection, to be sure it behoves the officers of the Excise to shew the goods are unaccustomed, they must prove that, and that will be matter of evidence for the Jury; but people are not called upon to make positive proof of negative propositions; they can prove that this was concealed, and in such sort of packages; and upon all the facts, the circumstances of the rescue, and all, the Jury must form a judgment, whether or no it amounts to proof that they were unaccustomed goods; and besides it is competent for the prisoner to shew that they are not unaccustomed goods: with respect to the postponing a trial, it is no reason when a criminal prosecution is once proceeded on, that the party is to be acquitted because there is a civil suit depending on the same case, it is a reason to apply for its being postponed until the civil matter is decided; but they have made no such application; therefore to be sure that objection cannot take place, and I am of opinion that the prisoner ought to go on with his defence.</p>

               <p>Examine d by Mr. Sheppard.</p>
               <p>I am a salesman in Broad-street, St. Giles's; on the 19th of June I remember seeing the dispute begin, it began with blows, I saw a parcel of men, I saw a number of men with bludgeons under their coats I was somewhat surprised at seeing them, I saw a little cart, I supposed something would ensue.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these the men that attended the cart? - No, they were the rescuers of the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Among these men with bludgeons, do you recollect seeing the prisoner at the bar? - No Sir, I never saw him. I am upon my oath, I am clear I never saw him about at the time, they appeared to me to be a set of Irishmen, bricklayers labourers, I saw the affray from the beginning to the end, I did not see the prisoner till he came out of the Justice's; I saw the persons of three men that gave the blows, they were ragged looking men, like bricklayers labourers, I saw one man in light coloured clothes come and strike at him that had the blunderbuss, and the man in a sailor's habit ran away with the blunderbuss, I saw the whole affray.</p>
               <p>During the time can you say the prisoner was not one of these men? - I as firmly believe it as I exist.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wilson.</p>
               <p>How long had you been acquainted with the prisoner before? - I never saw him till he came out of the Justice's, I never knew him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070139"/>You speak of these rescuers as ragged people? - They were.</p>
               <p>Was that your reason for supposing Shelley not to be one of them? - No, Sir, I did not see any man strike that had such a wig, nor such coloured clothes as he had on, and he is dressed now as he was when he came out of the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Could you know all the people? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Simpson? - I saw a tall thin man that had his head cut, I knew him instantly yesterday at Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the corner of Hart-street, leaning against a post? - No, I saw him at the top of St. Giles's leaning against a post.</p>
               <p>You did not see him there at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Of course you saw no body strike him there? - No, it may be the distance of a hundred yards, I cannot ascertain to ten or twenty yards, I do not recollect seeing him at the corner of Hart-street.</p>
               <p>That is all you can say with respect to this Shelley, that according to the best of your recollection and belief, the prisoner was not among the people? - To the best of my belief he was not there, I think I should have seen as much of it as any body, the cart stopped opposite an eating-house about eight or ten doors from Holborn, at first they could not stop the horse immediately, that was very near Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Then that was before they came to Hart-street? - Oh, yes, the scuffle was all intirely there, and the goods were driven right up Bow-street, and the rescue was in St. Giles's,</p>
               <p>How came you to see this man come from the Justice's? - I heard that some of them were taken and I went out of curiosity, no otherwise I assure you, I saw this was very desperate affair, and I had a mind to see who they were, I said to some of the neighbours, the man they have taken up is a very creditable looking man, and I never saw him in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And it is in consequence of that, that you came here to day? - Yes, I was subpoened.</p>

               <p>Look at the prisoner, do you recollect among the people that were scuffling about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070140"/> this cart, that the prisoner was one? - I do not recollect that he was, they appeared to me in general to be bricklayers labourers or working people.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at all after the cart was rescued? - I cannot say I saw the man there at all.</p>
               <p>Do you think if he had been there in the scuffle and active, you were so situated that you should have seen him? - I really think I should, but it was such an instant; I certainly must have seen him if he was there; but I do not recollect seeing the man there at all, I saw him at the magistrate's he was dressed as he is now.</p>
               <p>Were there any people among these fighters that were dressed like the prisoner or had any appearance of being dressed like him? - I did not see any.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I keep a pork shop.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>It was in your shop that you saw it? - I went out to look about it as the rest of my neighbours did, but during some part of the scuffle I was in the shop, and some part out; the prisoner could not be in the riot to be one of the very active ones, because I really think I saw every transaction of that sort.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know but part of this passed while you was in the shop; when you was in the shop could you see every thing that passed? - I could certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you? - I saw the greatest part, I did not see Hart-street at all, I only saw Broad-street; the cart stopped immediately opposite my window, I saw it stop, I saw the very beginning of it, and the whole that passed in Broad-street, I cannot take upon me to say that I saw every transaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you see the whole of what passed till the cart was driven away? - I saw the cart stop, and I saw them a fighting, I saw the whole of it till the cart was driven away.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you positively say now, that no transaction passed but what you saw? - I do not take upon me to be sure, to say that I saw every part.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could you see on both sides the cart? - The cart was very low, and I could see people's heads over the cart.</p>
               <p>If any body was knocked down behind the cart could you see? - Yes, unless they were very short people, I saw several people knocked down in the street, I believe I saw the officer knocked down, I remember seeing that man knocked down, but I cannot say by whom.</p>
               <p>Do you think it was by the prisoner at the bar that knocked down Simpson? - No, I really do not think it was, I did not notice who knocked him down, I could not take upon me to identify any one particular person, because I was noticing the officers, I do not recollect seeing this man's face there.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - The third door from Bow-Street, on the right hand side as you go from Holborn.</p>

               <p>Look at the prisoner, did you from the time that you first observed the cart, till the time the cart was driven away, see him there? - No, Sir, I am sure I did not see him there, I saw him afterwards, I saw him dragged by a parcel of men, I certainly should have seen him and noticed him if he had been there, and active; I looked at every person with particular attention, because I thought there would have been murder, I am perfectly sure I did not see him, I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wilson.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a Coal-merchant.</p>
               <p>You do not deal in tea? - I buy it for my wife when I want it.</p>
               <p>When you first saw them what distance was it? - About ten yards, I first saw the prisoner dragged to the Justice's, the corner of Hart-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see Simpson in Broad-street, St. Giles's? - I saw a parcel of men that were knocked down, I believe that Gentleman was there, and there was two more there, I think I could be sure that that Gentleman was knocked down, I am as sure he was there, as I am that the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the corner of Hart-street? - I did not.</p>
               <p>By what was he knocked down? - By a stick.</p>
               <p>Who knocked him down? - If I could tell that I should, I cannot tell, but I think I should know some of the people if I was to see them, there were several blows, there was only one knocked that man down, there were several blows at once made at him and others; I saw several blows made at him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the persons who made the blows at him? - Yes, I should know the persons again, I think I should.</p>
               <p>But could you swear to every one in that scuffle that made a blow? - I think I could.</p>
               <p>How long did it last? - About five minutes, there were five or six that were striking, they were partly all on the side of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen any of these people before? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear, that seeing them in that bustle, striking and knocking down the officers, at the distance of ten yards, that from that five minutes observation you could know them again? - I think I should know their faces in the same dress they were then.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070143"/>You are quite sure of that? - Yes, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Describe the man that knocked Simpson down? - It was a man like a bricklayer's labourer, he was taller than me, he was a man fatter than me, a lustier man than me in every respect.</p>
               <p>Where was Simpson when he was knocked down? - He was just by the cart, just down out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Simpson in the cart? - No, Sir, I did not, when I first came up he was out of the cart, I never saw him in the cart, there was another person in the cart and they were striking.</p>
               <p>Now you swear it was another person and not Simpson that was in the cart upon your oath? - Yes, a man in a blue coat and a red collar was in the cart, I am sure it was not that gentleman.</p>
               <p>If he had been struck in the cart he must have been struck in your sight? - There was no striking at all, I saw the horse's collar seized first.</p>
               <p>When you first came up Simpson was not in the cart? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>He was standing when you first saw him? - They were all in a hurly burly.</p>
               <p>He was upon the ground and not in the cart? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Then if there was any striking at Simpson in the cart, it must have been before you saw it? - But there was no striking, in that place.</p>

               <p>How can you tell that? - I do not presume to know.</p>
               <p>Did you see the cart in motion when you first saw it? - When I first saw it I saw it in motion, I was up even before the man seized the horse by the bridle, I was within fifty yards of it before it was stopped at all; I was within sight of it long before it was stopped, I was within ten yards of it when it was stopped; Simpson was not in the cart when I first saw it, it was a man in a blue coat and a red collar.</p>
               <p>Are you or are you not certain? - I am positive that he was not in the cart, that I did not see him in the cart.</p>
               <p>If he was struck in the cart it must be before you came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And there must have been a striking before you came up to make that true? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Sheppard.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of June I was at the Broad Way, St. Giles's, four doors from Monmouth street, I remember very well seeing a cart go by, and about three or four along with it, and presently I saw five or six more with sticks following the cart, I saw the cart at the bottom of the street, it might be one hundred and fifty, or one hundred and sixty yards, it stopped as near as I can tell between a pork-shop and a broker's, there was a battle I suppose for a minute or two, and I saw the cart run up to a linen-draper's shop, at the corner going up to Holborn, then I saw somebody turn into Bow-street; at that very time the prisoner came by, and he made a motion this way, and passed by, I was between him and the cart, when he spoke to me the cart was turning up Bow-street, he made a motion, how do you do, and passed me; the cart was going into Bow-street at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wilson.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A publican.</p>
               <p>You have known Shelley before? - Yes, for some time, we have known one another a good many years.</p>
               <p>Besides being a publican you deal a little in tea sometimes? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>There never was an information against you for smuggling? - Yes, several times, but there never was none found against me, nor nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Have they been more frequent or less since your acqaintance with Mr. Shelley? - Less, for I was fined once in the Broad Way, St. Giles's, for a little that a man gave me, that was all that I was ever fined in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070144"/>Which way was Shelley coming, the same way that the cart had gone? - The cart had gone about two or three minutes before Mr. Shelley came up.</p>
               <p>Had he a stick in his hand? - He had indeed as nigh as I can tell; I saw a battle at the bottom before I saw him, he did not stop, he only made a motion, he was walking along a good pace down towards the bottom, I saw the cart turn to the best of my opinion.</p>
               <p>Recollect what you are about, upon your oath did the cart turn before Shelley passed? - To the best of my opinion it did.</p>
               <p>Mind what you are about; did the cart turn before Shelley passed you? - I tell you before to the best of my opinion, I cannot say any other.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether it had or not? - To the best of my opinion it had.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it bad? - I only swear to the best of my opinion, I believe it had, but I swear nothing but what I am sure.</p>
               <p>The battle was all over in a minute or two. - It was for what I saw of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this indictment is founded on an act of parliament, made in the 19th year of the late King, in order to repress the daring conduct and behaviour of the smugglers, who endeavoured, not only to violate the laws, but to resist them with force. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on the part of the prosecution, and then added:) Gentlemen, you will first of all consider how matters stand on the evidence for the prosecution: on the part of the prisoner two objections have been taken, and the first objection was, that they ought to shew that they were Custom-house officers; this is an act of parliament that makes it unnecessary to shew their deputation, it is sufficient that they were reputed to be such, that they acted as such, and were then in the discharge of their duty; the next question is, how far it is proved to your satisfaction that these goods were unaccustomed; it is impossible for the Crown to shew that the duties were not paid; the defendant may prove they were paid; it is for your consideration whether the facts and circumstances do not make out these goods to be unaccustomed; first, they were in a house concealed under straw, the master denying any knowledge of them; they were in oil-case packages, which are known to be the conveyance of smuggled goods, and the question is, whether these circumstances are not sufficient for you to believe that these were unaccustomed goods; or at least it lays the burthen of the proof on the defendants, it is for them to prove the contrary; to be sure, if the prisoner was only, as their Council would have you believe, an accidental spectator, he could not fall within the meaning of this act of parliament; the two first witnesses only prove in general the affray, they themselves were assaulted on all sides, and it was impossible for them to see every body engaged in that assault; they were not attacked themselves, and therefore can say nothing of it; but Simpson, Chatterton, Newton, and two more, swear possitively to his taking an active part in it in two different places, one in Dyot-street, and the other in Hart-street; and Cook too, when he stopped him, tells you he ran away, and when he stopped him he gave a false account of himself; now if a person is stopped and apprehended, and tells a false story, that is an evidence of guilt; falshood is always accompanied with guilt, and truth with innocence; was he an officer's servant? certainly not. The prisoner has called several witnesses. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence for the prisoner, and then added:) Gentlemen, here is certainly gross perjury on one side or other, you are to weigh it; but there is one very strong circumstance, the Excise officers cannot be mistaken in the person; if they swear wrong it is not through mistake; they first saw him at Hanger-hill, and then passed him at Kensington Gravel-pits, then they saw him at Broad St. Giles's, and if they swear falsly, they are most wickedly and corruptly perjured; I should have been glad to have heard why the person passed by these people again from Apperton, and how this mob a rose: who gave intelligence? was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070145"/> it the man that passed the cart the first time, and repassed, and came to London, or was it another man? the two first witnesses that were called may swear very innocently, and yet it may be very true that the prisoner was there; there was a great noise and bustle, and it is a great deal for you to take into your consideration, how they are warranted to say that such or such a person whom they did not know, and whom they had no reason to look for, or at, did not give a blow, or whether he might not have given a blow without their knowing it; and as to the transaction at Hart-street, there are people no way connected with the Excise officer that confirm him in every respect.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, on the face of this note Mr. Pearce has indorsed it, and therefore he certainly cannot be a witness to prove that this is not his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. He has a property in the bill.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearce. You suppose yourself to be the person to whom this bill is made payable? - Certainly</p>
               <p>Then if the bankers had paid it without your indorsing it, they are liable to pay it again? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>They certainly are, you have a right to recover it certainly? - It is not my property, I never had it in my possession, I never saw the note till I saw it at Mr. Croft's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have not you a claim of 4 l. 4 s. on Mr. Davis? - No this bill was to have been remitted to me with a bank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070147"/> note, to pay a debt of Lieutenant Cole, it was an act of friendship, I paid the debt for him, it is no property of mine.</p>
               <p>You never indorsed the bill you say? - I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how do you know that you are the person to whom this bill is made payable? - I have it here in writing.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do? - I can do no more, it is no fault of mine, there is an indorsement upon the back of the bill that is erased, and I would infer from that, that it is very much like the name of the prisoner, I do not say that he wrote it, if it was to be held to the light the letters that are erased will appear very much like it.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a matter of consideration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How many are there of your name in the world? - I cannot tell; there is never another in the Excise office.</p>
               <p>Court. But there is no mention of the Excise office in the bill, and Mr. Davis is not here to shew us who

            ; the next is, this bill being indorsed with a blank indorsment, has the same effect as a draft payable to the bearer, it makes that bill payable to the holder, and the writing the name upon it for the satisfaction of the Banker is merely an attestation to the receipt from the Banker: therefore this should have been described as a receipt for the money; in which case if they had called evidence that this man's name was not John Churchill, it might have been a case for your determination: but at present there is nothing in this case in point of law, on which you can convict the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. This bill has been travelling about, unless it is identified in some way it will not do; now the parties might have come forward, and in cases of forgery they usually trace the bi ll quite through, therefore you must prove this the same bill, he believes it to be of the tenor and date, now I am really of opinion that is not a sufficient circumstance to put a man on his defence before a Jury in a case of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I admit this man receives a bill of Jacobson, which he enters in a book, he has not the book here, he parts with it to Bellamy, Bellamy parts with it to twenty people, I have a right to say that every part of that bill is an absolute forgery; I have a right to say that every letter, every mark, every figure on that bill is an absolute forgery; it would have been very easy to trace it: what the Jury think in their own private feelings is one thing, and perhaps in an action might be sufficient, but when a man stands on his trial for life it certainly is not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys to Thornton: Who was this bill drawn by? - Watkins and Smith.</p>

               <p>Whose hand writing is that? - Charles Watkins's.</p>
               <p>Where does Mr. Watkins live, Sir? - At Daventry.</p>
               <p>Was you ever there? - No, but I have seen him often at our house, I have seen him write his name.</p>
               <p>Did you know old Mr. Watkins, the father? - I have seen him, he has been dead for some years; I am clear it is not Charles Watkins's hand writing.</p>

               <p>Court. How was he mounted? - Not very well.</p>
               <p>What was the colour of his horse? - As nigh as I can guess it was a dark brown, or bay.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - About half past ten at night, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Was it a cloudy night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was you stopped? - I was driving a chaise, there were three people in it.</p>
               <p>Could you see very well that night? - Why it was rather cloudy, so that I could not see so well.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar the night before you was stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see how he was dressed? - As far as I can make out he had a light drab coloured surtout great coat on.</p>
               <p>Can you describe any thing else? - No; he followed the chaise through Ball's-pound gate, I was coming to town.</p>
               <p>Had you observed him before he came to the chaise? - Yes, I saw him before about five hundred yards, and I drove on as fast as I could, and passed him.</p>
               <p>How often had you passed him? - Only once.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he come up to you? - He rode up quite opposite to me, and desired me to stop.</p>
               <p>Which side of the chaise? - The right-hand side, near the opposite horse to that I was upon, he was just opposite my horse's head; he desired me to stop three or four times.</p>
               <p>When you passed him once, had you any time to take notice of him, till he came to stop you again? - No, I had not time, I went on, and he damned my eyes for not stopping, and presented a pistol to my head; seeing the patrols so near, he made off directly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070152"/>How do you know he presented a pistol? - Because I saw the nozzle of it as plain as I see you now.</p>
               <p>What size was it? - It seemed to be a large one.</p>
               <p>Are you pretty sure it was a pistol? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. When he put the pistol to your head, did he go round your horse's head and go to the chaise? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you give evidence against him before? - Yes, on Friday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I refer to the notes of Mr. Hodgson, the short-hand writer, if your Lordship will direct him to read his notes. This boy has been with the thief-takers since, and they have persuaded him to swear to me.</p>

               <p>What was on the fire? - A little hot water, I desired Mr. Hasbridge to get up which he did, he had a very dirty shirt on, a pair of breeches lay by the feet of the bed all over dirt and grease, when he got up he put a clean shirt on, and clean breeches, his hands appeared to be dirty and so did his wife's; I then brought him down stairs, and went into Mrs. Wild's appartments, for she went to lock up her clothes, there I found these half-pence, and a quantity of half-pence besides, and a quantity of cecil and some blanks in that room; and in the room that she carried me for her things; two or three young men in bed and another lad in a closet, they were brought to the office and discharged; I have frequently remarked it when I have apprehended such sort of people, it has appeared by the smell of their clothes, what sort of business they had been about, for they use a great deal of b rimstone in the colouring of half-pence, that made me think so here, for his hands were all over dirt.</p>
               <p>What kind of dirt? - Why such dirt as would come to any body from handling such half-pence as these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hasbridge. I had washed myself before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wild. You say there stood a saucepan on the fire? - I said it was a copper pot.</p>
               <p>Did you look into that? - There was nothing but water.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner, I have been there pretty nigh two years, I believe Mrs. Wild came about the beginning of May, she was the mistress of the house; there were some halfpence found in my house, I had them from them, I deal in stack wood from the chace, and I came up to town with two or three load a week, and I used to bring now and then a parcel of half-pence for them.</p>
               <p>Do you know where they got them? - Make them.</p>
               <p>You used to sell them? - I never sold any, I have seen Mrs. Wild, Mr. Hasbridge,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070156"/> and Mrs. Hasbridge making them by mere chance when I have gone in to know whether there was any thing going to London.</p>
               <p>What room did they use to make them in? - In the back room.</p>
               <p>Where did you bring them to? - I took only one load, and I left them in Holywell-lane, I was with Mrs. Wild when she took the house, I saw them all at work one evening, and twice in the day time, I have seen them all at work I believe three times.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that half-penny made from that die? - I cannot say that, it is very possible it was, it is made by that die or one like it; because one die may be like another as well as one half-penny like another.</p>
               <p>Was this die made in the Tower? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hasbridge to Weatherby. What kind of work did you see us about? - At this here.</p>
               <p>But at what part of them? - Mrs. Wild was pulling the fly and Mr. Hasbridge put the half-pence in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wild. Put your hand to your heart? - So I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And swear falsly too? - I would not take a false oath if it cost me my life.</p>

               <p>I am the prosecutor's servant, I took this bason out of the prisoner's pocket in Covent Garden, I saw him with it in his hand at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070157"/> Mr. Pincham's door, he put it down, and I saw him with it again, I spoke to him about ten minutes after, and I asked him if he had paid for it, and he said pho! pho! I took hold of him and took it out of his pocket; at the Justice's he made some excuse that he paid some woman, I do not know whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Might not he go from your stall to another and buy one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Last Wednesday evening I was coming along Covent Garden, I recollected my servant had broke a sugar dish, I cheapened one, the prosecutor asked 1 s. 6 d. I offered him 1 s. he went backwards, and a woman that was there said you may take it; I put down a shilling and put it in my handkerchief, and they followed me, I said I bought it and paid your master, or his sister, or his wife one shilling for it, when I came back the woman was not to be found; they wanted to persuade me that the woman belonged to me, I never was from the stall, we went to a magistrate, I told him I would send for two gentlemen to bail me, if it was 1500 l. I could get it; the next morning we went before Justice Addington, I told him the same; I was then committed: I am of opinion both the master and man, and sister ought to be set in the pillory; here I have been confined three or four days, and my credit at stake.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the woman? - It was in the dusk of the evening, I cannot say I can swear to the woman, but it was a woman that I am sensible belonged to the shop.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to your character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Had you left it in charge of anybody? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was you gone? - About ten minutes, or not a quarter of a hour, and the basket was gone; there were eight quartern loaves in it, and in a little time after a gentleman came with the prisoner and the bread which I left in the basket; our shop is in Berner's-street; I can pick my own loaves out from five hundred, I work it; every man can know his own workmanship.</p>
               <p>Court. What in a quartern loaf? - Yes, I think so, we put a W upon it.</p>

               <p>Court. Then stop a little; you went there? - Yes, we went there with some of the bread, and took him to Mr. Fisher's, and he owned the basket and bread, and the foreman likewise.</p>
               <p>Can you tell a loaf of your own making from another loaf? - Yes, I hope so.</p>
               <p>Does not it change in the oven? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>If you were to see them at another place how could you know them? - I could tell my own bread from one hundred, I do not imagine you understand it.</p>
               <p>If there is nothing but a W how can you know your own baking? - From the mode of working it.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw him carrying it down Ormond-street, and stopped him with the basket and eight quartern loaves, we took the basket to Mr. Smith's, in Baldwin's-gardens, the basket and bread were fetched away to Mr. Fisher's, and left there, the basket is here at the door; the account was as he has told you; I am a baker, and work for Mr. Simpson, in New North-street; every baker has a different way of working his bread.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose every baker could tell his own bread if he saw it twenty miles off? - I could tell my own workmanship, I should think it very hard if I could not.</p>

               <p>I am constable, on the 4th of June, in the afternoon, one Jeffries and Walker came to my house and shewed me a watch, and nothing else; they came to me as an officer to apprehend the parties, they are two labouring men, I went down to Puddle-dock, to a public house there, and charged Castle with having the watch, I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it, I went and fetched the other prisoner; the other prisoner Howse said Castle gave it to him to sell to Jeffries, he said so in the presence of Castle; when I had them both in custody, Howse said to Jeffries I gave you the watch, and says Castle I had it of you, and he acknowledged he had it from him; I asked Castle where he found it, he told me by Bridge-street, near Black Friars Bridge, then Jeffries produced a pair of shoes, Castle said he found them also, and a black handkerchief, he said he found that too.</p>
               <p>Did Howse say that Castle had given all the things to him? - No, my Lord, only the watch, and Castle acknowledged that, and acknowledged that he found the other things, and I took them and put them into custody, I advertised them, and on enquiry I found that a man had been stripped of some things in Fleet-market, and I found out the prosecutor, and he described the things to me before he saw them; there is an R. and M. I think in the shoes, it is the maker's name in Holborn; he described the shoes, he described the watch by a particular seal, but he could not tell the name or number, he said the minute hand was broke.</p>
