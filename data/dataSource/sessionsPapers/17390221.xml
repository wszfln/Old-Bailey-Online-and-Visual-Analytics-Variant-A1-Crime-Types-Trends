            . When I took Mann and Udal, Mann was carried to one House, and Udal to another. Mann desired to be admitted an Evidence, and it was granted. He gave me Directions where the Watch was pawned for ten Shillings. I went to the Pawn-broker's, and demanded the Watch, telling the Man it was stole. He refused to produce it, upon which I sent for Mr. Thorn, and he described it. and said it was in a Tortois-shell Case, and a Piece was broke out; then the Pawnbroker produced it, and Thorn immediately owned it; but we could not have it, unless we paid twelve Shillings, and twelve Shillings I was obliged to pay for it. The Prisoner desired to be admitted an Evidence, and said he could hang three or four; but, as he had been admitted an Evidence several Times before, his Request was deny'd. He wanted to have been made an Evidence against Mann, and said he could put three or four more into his Information. He did not deny the Fact at all.</p>
               <p>Mann. The Prisoner would have killed the Man, for fear of being discovered, had it not been for me.</p>
               <p>Thorn. Yes; He threatened me; - 'twas upon the long Causeway.</p>
               <p>Udal. The Evidence and I were Debtors in the Marshalsea Prison; we broke out and made our Escape. He has done this for Lucre, - for the Sake of the Reward, that he may clear himself of his Debt.</p>

I can't be so positive to the other Prisoner as I am to him, but I was struck at, and my Hat and Wig were taken away, and then they knocked me down. They knocked me down as dead as a Herring, and then they took my Gun. I can't swear Lawlor took it, but he was one of the Men.</p>
               <p>Lawlor. Did you ever see me before in your Life?</p>

            . This Lawlor, and Leonard, and I, have gone out a thieving together, several Times. I lived in Lawler's Cellar, and have known both the Prisoners thirteen or fourteen Years; I have gone a thieving with them in Ireland. When we committed this Robbery, there was another Man with us, beside the two Prisoners, and we laid hold of the Prosecutor, while Leonard watched on the other Side of the Way. We drank a Pint of Gin, between us four, before we went out; and wanting Money, we said we must have it, so as we were coming down Drury-Lane, over against the Coal Yard, we saw this Man with his Gun Lawlor said to him, - d - mn you, What Business have you with a Gun, and struck him with the Stock of the Pistol which he had in his Hand, but he did not fall down I held one of his Hands, to prevent his laying hold of any of us; and at the second Blow, he was knocked down. We took his Hat and Wig before he was knocked down, but I can't tell whether the Gun was seized before or after. The Name of the fourth Man in our Company, was Noland; and Leonard was to stand on the other Side of the Way, and to cry Tommy! Tommy! when any body came by: And he calling out Tommy, as soon as we had got the Man's Hat and Wig and Gun, we had not Time to rifle his Pockets, but were obliged to run away with what we had got. Lawlor pawned the Wig for six Shillings, and I pawned the Hat for three, to a Man, who, I believe is in Court, but they were not both pawned the same Day; and Leonard did not go to the Pawnbroker's with us, for we were afraid if so many of us went, the Folks would not have a good Suspicion [Opinio] of us. The Hat was pawned first, and in two or three Days Time, we pawned the Wig, and Leonard staid at Home in Lawlor's Cellar, while we were gone. The Money for the Hat and Wig, was nine Shillings, which we divided, and had two Shillings and three Pence a piece. I never was before a Judge for any Dishonesty in my Life.</p>
               <p>- Thompson. I know the Hat and Wig very well. This is Mr. Lines's Hat. I carry'd it to have a new Loop put to it; and this is the Wig he had on when he went out that Sunday, - but he came home without it. I have carry'd it twenty Times to the Barber's. He had them both on, when he went out, but he came home without either.</p>
               <p>Lines This is my Hat and Wig.</p>
               <p>A Witness. Cavenagh brought the Hat to me, and wanted three Shillings upon it. Lawlor came with the Wig, and asked six Shillings upon that, telling me, he should fetch it again in two or three Days. I thought them both very honest Men.</p>


               <p>Lawlor. Ask this Witness if he knows James Lawlor?</p>
               <p>The Witness. I can't swear justly to him, - but that Man, [pointing to Lawlor,] is like him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173902210005"/> and the Man that brought the Wig said his Name was James Lawlor.</p>
               <p>Lawlor. 'Tis not very likely I should pawn a Thing I had stole in my own Name.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lines. How came you to be out with a Gun on Saturday Night?</p>
               <p>Lines. The Man of the Tavern wanted a Gun for the Train'd Bands, so I sent for it, and would have sold it him, but we could not agree for the Price; so I was carrying it home again.</p>

               <p>Garret Cavenagh. I know Lawlor; he lodged with me about a Year ago, and paid me honestly: He has no Way to get his Bread but by Work, and the Labour of his Hands. I am a Smith, and he has work'd with me. I know nothing more.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Lambeth. Leonard came to lodge with me a Fortnight before Christmas last; and on Christmas-Day in the Morning he and his Wife had a Quarrel, and she tore his Coat, and he could not go out all Day. Mr. Lines came to my House on St. Stephen's Day, and said he had lost his Hat and Wig, and Gun, and said he would give a Treat to have them again.</p>
               <p>A Witness. As to Leonard, I have intrusted him with more than my own, backwards and forwards, and he always behav'd well. The second Day after Christmas Day, Lines came into Lambeth's House, and said he had been robb'd of his Hat, Wig and Gun, in Drury Lane; and that the Man who knock'd him down was in a close Set-to Coat. Leonard was then in the House, and Lines would have drank with him, but Leonard refus'd: Lines told us at the same time, that he was very much in Liquor.</p>

             went out backwards; Afterwards we return'd to the Door to get into the House, but it was shut, and we could not get in. While I stood at the Door, I heard a Noise in the House like breaking open Doors: I was in a great Consternation, and imagin'd that the Rogues had got in backwards, and had taken Possession of the House; upon this I ran to the back Part of the House, and kick'd against a Door in the Middle of the Garden, and got into a Passage, which led to the Window of the Room where my Wife and I lie; she was there crying out, Thieves! Murder! Davis was with me; and when I had got into the House, I call'd in Mr. Lee and Mr. Owen. My Wife was in her Chamber, almost dead with Fear, - the Maid in Fits, and the young Gentlemen were running from one Room to another in their Shirts. After I had encouraged my Wife, Mr. Lee and I examin'd the House, and when we were in the lower Part of it, Davis call'd out, he had taken the Man! and I went out immediately, and saw the Man in his Possession. He had deceived Davis, by running out of the House, and crying Thieves! without his Hat, (which we afterwards found in the House) so Davis at first thought it was Lee, but when he found his Mistake he pursu'd him: he (the Prisoner) had then Trowsers on, and in getting over the back Pales, the Tenter-hooks catched in his Trowsers; there Davis and he were engaged, while I, and Owen, and Lee, were examining the House; and the Prisoner said, he was sorry he had left his Hammer on the Top of the House, for if he had not, he would have dispatch'd him. As to the breaking the House, he broke through a Window into the Garret, and when the Casement was broke open, there was nothing to prevent his Entrance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Colley confirm'd the former Circumstances, adding, That she went up Stairs, and heard the Garret Window break, and somebody jump in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173902210006"/> That the Man was no sooner got in, but he came down Stairs; that upon hearing him come down, she ran into her Chamber, and shut the Door; for she thought he was coming in after her, upon which she ran to the Window, and call'd out Thieves!</p>

               <p>Mr. Owen deposed, That while he was parting with a Friend near his own Door, a Man came from Mr. Colley's Door, and look'd hard at him: That he then gave a slight Cough, and pass'd him; upon which he (the Witness) went into his own House, and listen'd: That hearing his Foot stop all on a Sudden, he partly opened the Door, and saw him at Mr. Colley's Door, and heard him cough again: That he observed him to look up to the Top of Mr. Colley's House; that he look'd up too, and seeing a Man upon the Top of the House, he call'd out to Mr. Colley's People, and told them there were Thieves on the Top of their House; upon which the Man at the Door ran away: That Mr. Colley came out to the Witness, and they both went to Mr. Colley's Door, but could not get in: That they then went backwards, and heard Davis cry out, - He had got the Man, upon which the Witness ran to assist him, and so the Prisoner was taken.</p>

               <p>William Mumford. I went to Bed that Night about Eleven o'Clock, and fasten'd my Door. I rose at Six the next Morning, and found the House broke, and twenty-four Pair of Shoes gone: The Lock of the Door and four Bolts were broke. We have Part of the Goods here; this large Pair of Men's Shoes, and these Girls Pumps, are mine, and they were mark'd, - 2 s. each, but they have rubb'd the Marks out. I don't make them; I only buy and sell. Campbel confess'd before the Justice, that he broke open the House, between Twelve and One o'Clock, and that he took but fourteen Pairs, tho' I miss'd twenty-four when I came to number my Shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of a House was this?</p>
               <p>Mumford. 'Tis a Shoemaker's Shop, and a Cook's Shop; I lie in the House: There are eight Rooms in it.</p>

             put some of her Shoes into my Bed, and Lewis convey'd some of hers under the Table, and they both desired me not to take any Notice, for they would raise some Money upon them, unknown to the Men, and would share it between themselves I hid the Shoes, and Campbel and Booth stay'd there all Day, and quarrel'd about them. He damn'd her for a Bitch, and said there was not all the Shoes; she said, she knew nothing of them; so he lick'd her, and gave her two black Eyes. The next Day Booth and her Sister came and ask'd for one Pair, which I deliver'd into her Apron: And the Day after this Campbel and Booth came again, and as they both sat by the Fire, a Breeches-maker came in, and told me, (in their Hearing) that Mumford's Shop had been broke open, and he had lost a great many Shoes: This was on Friday, and they both seem'd very uneasy, and went away. The next Day, (Saturday) Booth came for the rest of the Shoes; and I told her, I would stop them for Mr. Mumford. As I was speaking, - in came Campbel, and says Booth to him, - do you know any thing of Mumford's Shoes? he told her, no: Push off, says she, and so away he went. When he was gone, she (Booth) asked me if I stopp'd the Shoes? I told her, - yes. Then d - mn my Eyes, (says she) I'll go and see if you have carry'd them home to Mumford, or not. Upon this I sent to Mumford, and he own'd the Goods. I can't say whether the Men had any of the Goods upon them when they came in; 'twas the two Women brought them in, in their Aprons. When they open'd their Laps, and shew'd me the Shoes, I thought 'twas fine Chickweed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Campbel. Did you see any of the Goods upon me?</p>
               <p>Clark. He said before the Justice, - That he gave the Woman the Shoes, and if he had had a Sack, he could have carry'd off more.</p>
               <p>A Constable. I had a Warrant against the Prisoners, and when we had found them, we carried them before Justice Mercer; Campbel confessed that he broke open the Shop, and stole fourteen Pair of Shoes, and if there was more, the two Women cheated him. He said the two Women were there to receive the Goods, as he brought them out; but they said they were both innocent in the Affair.</p>
               <p>Campbel. This Martha Clark owes me a Grudge, because I lodged in her House, and have not paid her; so she and Addey the Thief-Taker have collogu'd together, to take away my Life for the Sake of the Reward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Booth. This Lewis and her Husband had quarrelled, and I went out with her that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173902210008"/> Night to see Him, about Twelve at Night. Between Five and Six in the Morning, we called at this Clark's for a Dram. There we found Campbel and Lewis's Husband, with their Aprons full of Shoes; which they gave to us, and bid me tell Clark it was Chickweed. We had three or four Pints of Gin among us; and about Ten o'Clock they called us out into the Entry, and took them from us. Campbel told me - his Master was going to break, and he had been helping him off with those Goods.</p>
               <p>Lewis. About Eleven at Night my Husband and I had Words; he went out, and I asked Booth to go with me to see for him. We went to several Places, and at last we found him and Campbel at Clark's with the Shoes.</p>
               <p>Mumford. When Booth was before the Justice she said Campbel broke open the Shop, and brought out the Shoes, and that she and Lewis took them into their Aprons.</p>
               <p>The Constable. Campbel told us, That Lewis's Husband was with them; that He and Lewis broke open the Shop, and the two Women were there, to assist in carrying the Goods away.</p>
               <p>Campbel. I did not get up that Morning, till about Five o'Clock, and is it probable that after I had drank Share of so many Half-pints of Gin, I should break open a House! It takes up a good deal of Time to do such a Thing.</p>

He walked-up to me, and looked me full in the Face and, mumbling something, he gave me a Blow on the Breast, which surprized me, and then he took a Shilling out of my Pocket? and when I found my Hat and Wig go, I caught hold of his Coat, but he was too brisk for me, and got loose. I pursued him to the Place where he was taken, getting over a Wall into Justice Riccards's Yard. It was Moon-light, and I knew him again, and picked him out from all the People that were there. I saw the Colour of his Coat, - a White Loose Coat; a blew Waistcoat, and a speckled Shirt. I saw him at the Justice's, in half an Hour after I was robbed, and remember he had a Scar on one Side of his Face; which I took Notice of, when he robbed me. I can't say I minded on which Side it was, when he robbed me, but I knew him again, and swore to him.</p>

We carry'd him into Mr. Riccards's Parlour, and I was present when Mawley first saw him there. Several of our Men were standing together with the Prisoner, and he ( Mawley ) picked him out, and said, that was the Man who robbed him of a Hat, Wig, and a Shilling. The Prisoner had the same Coat on, that he has now; a Blew Jacket, and a Cap. The Hat I found in a back Place, and the Wig in another, about six or seven Yards from the Place where I took him: I brought them into the Parlour, and Mawley owned them. (He swore to them again in Court.)</p>

             Last Sunday Se'en-night I heard a Cry of Thieves being the Garden, and I went out and found the Prisoner coming out of the Vault, I laid hold of him, but he was too-strong for me, and got away from me: So the last Witness came up and took him directly; and when Maudley came in, he picked him out from among thirty or forty People.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I was the Officer that took him into Custody: I found the Prosecutor bare-headed, with only a Handkerchief about his Head, and he was positive the Prisoner was the Man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been at the Glass House about a Quarter of an Hour, before the Maid said there were Thieves in the Glass House. I thought they had been only playing the Rogue: However, I went to the Door, and a Gentlewoman said, - 'twas a long time before any body came to the House. Madam, says I, I came as soon as I could; then Mr. Riccards bid me go and see if any Body was in the Vault: so I went and poked about there, and these People came and took me, and then the Justice deny'd that he had sent me there. <rs id="t17390221-8-verdict60" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>John Ridley. My House was broke open the 5th of February. I keep Coaches, and there is a Stable joins to my House, and a Door in the Stable, that goes up Stairs to my Chamber. This Door in the Stable must be broke first, and then the Chamber-Door. I went out in the Morning about Nine o'Clock, and left the Prisoner in the Stable, for he used to help me about my Coaches, and I did not come home 'till between Nine and Ten at Night. I am sure I locked the Chamber Door, for I called him up and gave him a Glass of Brandy, before I went out, and he saw me lock the Door when I came out. But when I came home, I found the Door broke, and this Iron was left in my Room, which Mr. Johnson in Grays-Inn Lane proved to be the Prisoner's, and the Prisoner owned Mr. Johnson gave it him. I lost seven Shirts, a Cloth Frock, a Cloth Waistcoat, a Pair of Buck-skin Breeches, and 20 l. in Money. I am positive I had all these Things in the Chamber on Saturday Night, and no one else had been in the Room from that Time to the Time I came home, and found I was robbed. When the Prisoner was taken, one of my Shirts was upon his Back, and he owned it was mine. He deny'd his taking any thing else, at first, but afterwards, when he found I was about to search his Lodging, he confessed his taking every thing, but the Money; and he acknowledged that he he forced open the Door in the Stable with this Iron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were all the Things you found in my Custody your's?</p>
               <p>Ridley. Yes: - The Shirts were all numbered and marked with I. R. They are in the Constable's Possession, but he could not be here.</p>
               <p>

            . The Prisoner lodged in my House, a Week and two Days; and two Days before he was taken up, he desired me to tye up four Shirts in a Napkin for him, and put them in a Chest which stood in his Chamber, which I did, without looking for any Marks, either good or bad; and seeing a Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches upon his Bed, I put them in likewise. I can't tell whether he had these Things when he came to my House at first, nor did I know what Linnen he had; but three of the Shirts, and the Breeches, were found there, which Mr. Ridley owned, when he searched his Room, and one of the Shirts was upon his (the Prisoner's) Back, but the Coat and the Waistcoat were gone I was present when Ridley searched, and he carry'd the Things he claimed before the Justice. During the Time the Prisoner lived at my House, he used to go out in the Morning, and come home at Night to Bed. I never saw him but twice in his Room, and I know nothing of his Character. A Coachman brought him to me, as an honest Man, and he behaved as such, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Bury. Did he break the Door in the Stable, or the Chamber Door with that Iron?</p>
               <p>Ridley. He broke the Door in the Stable first, and then the Chamber Door. The Stable Door was a strong Door, but he bent the Staple of the Door back, and then forced open the Chamber Door, which he saw me lock; 'twas a Stock-lock, and a very good one: When he came out, (I apprehend ) he came thro' the Coach-house, which was fastened on the Inside with a wooden Pin; for those Doors were left open, and the Pin was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Shirts were, - all my own, - every one, - all my own, and the Breeches too. I bought the Breeches in Monmouth-street, and the Shirts in Rag-fair, but nobody was with me when I bought them. <rs id="t17390221-9-verdict64" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cheveny . On the 29th of January, I had been at a Club, at The Black Hog in St. Martin's-Lane, and as I was coming home about Ten o'Clock at Night, I met the Prisoner at the Bottom of King-Street, Westminster; she took hold of me, and said, - Master, will you treat? I told her, I could not afford it. Well, says she, if you'll treat this Time, I'll treat next. Upon these Conditions, I said, I did not care if I did. Then she bid me come along with her. So she carry'd me to the House of one Stark, in <placeName id="t17390221-15-crimeloc86">King street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17390221-15-crimeloc86" type="placeName" value="King street"/>

She told me she would not part with me so, and followed me out to the Door; we stood talking together about a Quarter of an Hour, and in that Time she picked my Pocket, and then ran in Doors, and shut the Door upon me. I told her she had got my Watch, and called to have the Door opened, but it was not opened. Then I called the Watch, and they made them open the Door. There were other Women in the House, beside the Prisoner, so the Watchmen asked me, which of these Women had robbed me? I told them I did not see her, I believed she was got off, and the Watchmen said, they could not search the House without a Warrant; but the Man of the House telling us we might search, tho' we had no Warrant, we did search, and found the Prisoner hid in a Closet; so she was carry'd to the Round house for that Night, and next Morning we had her before Mr. Frazier. Before him, she said she knew nothing of the Watch, but it was produced at the same Time, by the Prisoner's Husband, and then she told the Justice she had found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he felt me take it?</p>
               <p>Cheveny. No; I did not; but there was no one at the Door, or in the Entry with me, but the Prisoner.</p>

            . The Prosecutor came to my House, and desired me to take his Watch in Pawn 'till next Morning. I refused to take his Watch, but told him I would let him have a Shilling or two 'till the next Morning. D - mn it, says he, if you won't take it in Pawn, I'll go out of the House. I believe the Prisoner and he might have a Pot of Beer together, and then they went out together, for about five Minutes: After which the Prisoner ran into the House again; he followed her and said - G - d d - mn the Bitch, she has picked my Pocket, and he called the Watchmen, who took the Prisoner, but but they found no Watch upon her. However, in about half an Hour after she was confined, her Husband came and said, I have the Watch, - take it and carry it down to her. I would have nothing to do with it, so I bid him carry it down and deliver it himself, so he took the Watch from between the Window and the Window-shutter. When she was before the Justice the next Morning, she said she knew nothing of the Matter, but she desired me to go and speak to her Husband about it; and I went up accordingly into her Room, and there the Watch was found between the Bed and the Sacking, and it was carried to Justice Frazier. She lodged in Cabbage-Lane, Westminster.</p>
               <p>The Constable. This is the Watch that was brought to Mr. Frazier.</p>

               <p>Cheveny. This is my Watch.</p>
               <p>Stark. I can't swear to it; but I deliver'd the same Watch which I found in her Lodging to Mr. Frazier.</p>
               <p>Constable. And Mr. Frazier deliver'd it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Watch to my Knowledge. I was going home, and this Man came up to me, and clapp'd Two-pence Halfpenny into my Hand, to go and drink with him. I did not care to drink with a Stranger any where, so I went to this Mr. Stark's, because I was afraid of him, but I never drank of the Beer, nor did I sit by him. <rs id="t17390221-15-verdict87" type="verdictDescription">

Rogers was with me at the same time. He paid us for 13 lb. and a half of Tobacco, 5 s. 6 d. and he paid at the same time 3 d. for a full Pot of Beer, which we had Part of.</p>
               <p>Counc. And what Sort of Tobacco might this be?</p>
               <p>Keys. Merchants Tobacco, - good Tobacco. I never enquired into the Worth of it; but sometimes we got Threepence, - sometimes a Groat a Pound: What he gave us was not the Worth of the Tobacco, for he gave us but 5 s. and 6 d. - for 13 lb. and a half. I was taken up on Thursday in Christmas Week, and was committed to Bridewell, where I lay a Fortnight. When I was taken up, I went before a Justice, and declared the whole Truth. We took our Opportunity to take Tobacco, sometimes in a Morning, before People were stirring, and at other times, as we had Opportunity. Rogers help'd to steal this Tobacco as well as I: He own'd before the Lord Mayor that it was stoln; - and he stole more than I did.</p>
               <p>Counc. I ask you, Whether the Prisoner knew it was stole?</p>
               <p>Keys. Yes; I have sold several Quantities of Tobacco to him before this; and I have told him where it came from. He us'd to say, - Why, this is bad Tobacco; and I us'd to say to him, - we can't make it better than it is - 'tis such as we can get.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you tell him this very Tobacco was stolen?</p>
               <p>Keys. Yes; I did; this very 13 lb. and half. - and every Bit of Tobacco we sold him, we told him was stolen; and he knew it was stolen. We have sold him Tobacco very frequently, - and large Quantities.</p>

            . I am a Constable belonging to the Custom-House Key. My Business is, to look out for lurking Fellows, who steal the Merchants Tobacco. I saw a great deal at Adamson's House, when I went there with Mr. Green the Surveyor; Keys told me, when he was taken up, that if I would go to Adamson's, I might see a great many Pilferers upon the Keys. I went; and the first Man, I saw go in was Mr. Hanbury's Watchman, with a great Parcel of Tobacco, which we seiz'd in Adamson's Scales, and we found several Parcels of Tobacco, of different Sorts, in several Parts of his House; some Oroonoko, some Sweet-scented, and all in small Quantities. He keeps a little Snuff-Shop in Petticoat-Lane, and there we found a great Parcel of different Sorts of Tobacco. When he was taken up, he desired Rogers and Keys to be as favourable to him, in their Account before my Lord Mayor, as they could; and he desired me to speak to Rogers and Keys, that they might be favourable to him, for the sake of his Family, and that they might not tell all they knew of him; telling me that if I would go down with him to the Keys, he would shew me a great many People he had bought Tobacco of. He owned he bought this 13 lb. and a half of Rogers and Keys and they told him he knew very well that he had bought a great many other Parcels of them beside this. He would have made an Information against several People, but it was too late.</p>
               <p>Counc. What do you take this Tobacco to be worth?</p>
               <p>Crosier. Some Tobacco is better than other; but I think none can be bought for the Price he gave for this. I take it, the Duty upon it is Five Pence Farthing, or Five Pence Half-penny per lb. I have taken 3000 lb. Weight of stolen Tobacco from other People; and there are forty People now in Bridewell for taking it. When the Prisoner was first taken, I advised him to make himself an Evidence; but then he said, he knew nothing of the Matter; and afterwards, when he desired it, it was too late.</p>

               <p>Pomeroy. I was robbed of three Hats, this Day three Weeks, and heard nothing of them, till these People, ( Keeble, Crocket, and Huddle ) were taken. Then I went up to Justice Farmer, and Huddle told we, that he and the Prisoner had stole the Hats out of my Shop, and had pawned them to a Woman, who now keeps out of the Way.</p>
               <p>Huddle. About the Time the Gentleman mentions, we stole three Hats off the Compter. There were two Shutters to the Window of the Shop, and one of them was down, and the other was up. The Prisoner reach'd over and took them; I stood by him, but neither of us went into the Shop. <rs id="t17390221-28-verdict141" type="verdictDescription">

Last Saturday was three Weeks, (I think it was) about Seven o'Clock in the Evening, my Shop Door was shut, and the Sashes in the Shop Window were shut down, and I was in the Shop myself; but yet somebody in the Street lifted up the Sash, and I saw a Hand take out seven Yards of strip'd Linen. I cry'd out Thieves, and ran to the Door and open'd it, but the Thief was got off with my Goods, and I have never seen them since, nor heard of them, 'till Huddle made his Information before Justice Farmer, and then I was sent for, and Huddle said the two Prisoners were concern'd with him in robbing me.</p>
               <p>Huddle. On the 27th of last Month, as the two Prisoners and I were coming down <placeName id="t17390221-30-crimeloc147">New Gravel Lane</placeName>

I lifted up the Sash, and we took a Roll of Check, which we carry'd to Mrs. Turner, and she sold it for us, and brought us for it, between nine and ten Shillings, to the best of my Knowledge. I think Mrs. Turner paid the Money to Crockat, and we shar'd it between us.</p>
               <p>Keeble. Whereabout did I stand when you took the Linnen?</p>
               <p>Huddle. Keeble was at the Steps at the Shop-door, and Crockat was at a Post before the Door, about three or four Yards from the Steps.</p>
               <p>Keeble. Where was the Money parted?</p>
               <p>Huddle. At Mrs. Turner's House; we turn'd our Backs upon the rest of the Company, and divided the Money.</p>

            . The two Prisoners at the Bar, and the Evidence, brought me seven Yards of check'd Linnen, and I sold it for 8 s. and gave the Money to Crockat; he was the Man that generally took the Money for all.

Haggis told me, (at the Cheshire Cheese ) that I was his Wife; and you B - ch, (said he) you ran away from me the Day before: I ran out of the House from him as fast as I could, [in order] to get home, but he ran after me into the New 'Change. The New 'Change is a Place like a Square, where the People bring old Cloaths, and lay them down for Sale. He overtook me by the Pump in the New 'Change, and tore my Gown out of the Gathers, and beat me with a Stick; then he wanted to be impudent with me there. [The Witness here gave a particular Account of the beastly Behaviour of Haggis in this Place.] But somebody looking out of a Window, and calling to him, he desisted, and let me go. I ran away again, but he ran after me, and got hold of the Tail of my Gown, and though I was got to my Landlady's Door, yet I could not get in, and shut the Door upon him, but he came in after me. My Landlady<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173902210016"/> and a Woman big with Child, and a Boy was in the Room, - 'twas a Ground Room, where the Woman, the Boy, and I used to lie, for a Penny a Night. When Haggis was got into the Room, six other Fellows follow'd him, and came in, among whom were the Prisoners, Keeble, Gibbons (the <rs id="t17390221-31-deflabel155" type="occupation">Barber</rs>

They were no sooner in the Room, but they turn'd the two Women out; and the Boy was order'd out, but he hid himself in a little Closet by the Door. When the Door was shut, and lock'd, and the Key taken out, Keeble threw me down; (he was the first Man who abused me in the House.) Then they blew the Candle out, and blow'd it in again; this they did two or three times: [The Witness express'd herself here in Terms necessary to prove the Fact, and gave such an unparallel'd Account of the Abuse, and of Gibbons's Behaviour, as would be shocking to every chaste Ear.] I cry'd out Murder but Haggis said, if I made a Noise he would run his Knife into me; and tho' I did all that I could to prevent it, yet he abused me three times in the Space of half an Hour. I cry'd out, Murder! but the other Men laughed, and cry'd, - beat the B - ch, beat the B - ch, make her be still, and Gibbons laid hold of me, while Haggis was abusing me; and then Gibbons himself, and Keeble, - and all of them, &amp;c. I was left in such a Condition, &amp;c. that had it not been for Gibbons, I should have been burnt to Death. The Fidler they brought in with them, was present all the time, and play'd several Tunes. After this they unlock'd the Door, and went away; and my Landlady came in as soon as they were gone. I cry'd, and made my Complaint to her; she told me, she was afraid to come in, for Fear of having her Brains dash'd out. I complain'd likewise to the People at next Door: and they told me, that when the Men left me; they came in there for each of them a Glass of Maxim, [ Geneva,] but they could not tell any of their Names. I live alone, - I have had no Friends these three Years, so I give this Woman 6 d. a Week to let me lie there: Her Name is Pegey. The Prisoners came sometime afterwards to the House, and said, if the People who were in the House had not gone out, they would have served them the same Sauce.</p>
               <p>Haggis. Did not I give you Money?</p>
               <p>Main. No.</p>
               <p>Haggis. Did not you say, if Gibbons would give you half a Crown, you would not prosecute? Did not you receive Money?</p>
               <p>Main. No; they would have given me a Halfpenny a-piece, but I would not take any of their Money, but made an Information against them, before Justice Riccards, the next Day after the Abuse was committed; I can't tell directly the time, but 'twas on a Monday Night, about a Fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Gibbons. It was not on the next Day (Tuesday) that she made her Information, for she was with me the next Day to make it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Riccards. I took the Girl's Information on the 14th Instant, but I can't be sure whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday. She swore the Fact was committed on Monday the 12th.</p>
               <p>Gibbons. Was not you with me at the The Three Tobacco Pipes, and drank with me after this?</p>
               <p>Main. I was there with a Woman and her Husband, and the Woman's Husband said, - let's send for Gibbons, and he came, and owned the Fact, and desired me to make it up. This was on Tuesday between Three and Four o'Clock. He said he would cloath me, if I would make it up, and he offered to pay me ten Pounds, but I told him if I cleared one, I must clear the rest; and he said, - no, you Fool, there's no Occasion for that. I did not accept of his Offer, but came away without his Notice, and left him drinking with the Man.</p>

While Main was out, she heard her call out, - Pogey ! - Pogey! but she was afraid to go out to her. When Main returned, the Men all came in in a Quarter of a Minute after her, and Haggis struck Main a Slap in the Face, &amp;c. [She here gave an Account of Haggis's obscene Behaviour, before she was turned out] And that one of them cry'd, - turn the Bitches out, which was done accordingly. That she went to the Watch House twice, and asked for the Constable, telling the Watchman Mischief she apprehended would be done; that at last she found the Constable in the Watch-House, but he would not stir out of his Chair, nor any of the Men. That before she went to call the Constable, she heard the Girl cry out dread-fully<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173902210017"/> - Murder! Murder! And when she came back, she saw Three Men come out of her Door first, and Four others after them, but that she could not swear to any of them but Gibbons.</p>

               <p>Ray. As I was coming home from a Friend's House the 8th of this Month, I met Bewley, and said, - How do you do? - I believe I might say Molly or, Polly, and so I went directly cross the Way to make Water, and she follow'd me. When I had made Water, I miss'd my Watch, and she ran away to Butler, who stood at a Distance. I ran after her, and charg'd a Constable with them both. He desired me, (as the Women deny'd the thing) to search my Pockets; I did so, and found my Watch at the Bottom of my Breeches Side Pocket.</p>
               <p>- Birch. I happen'd to be in the Watch-house when Ray and the Prisoners were talking about the Matter, and I saw Bewley have the Key of a Watch, and some Part of a Chain in her Hand; and she put it between the Folds of Ray's Coat, but I can't swear it belong'd to Ray.

'Twas about Eight o'Clock, and was Moon-light. I knew his Voice, and his Face, and his Cloaths: He had a strip'd Waistcoat, and a cropp'd Hat.</p>
