            . I am captain of St. James' watch. On the morning of the 26th of February, about two o'clock, I stopped the prisoner with this cloth under his arm - he said it was sheeting, which his brother had bought to send into the country, to his mother; I asked where his brother lived - he said in Gray's-inn-lane. I took him to the watch-house, and then he said his brother lived in Wimpole-street, which turned out to be true; his brother came to the office, and said, in his hearing, that he knew nothing at all of it. I marked it, and delivered it to Avis.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. The prisoner was brought to the office, and I had some conversation with him; I neither threatened nor promised him any thing: he told me, after some conversation, that he got the cloth from a place where he had lived, and said it was from Mr. Greig's, in the City-road - he afterwards said he had been along with two Jew lads - that they took the property, and gave it to him; he afterwards said he took it himself out of Mr. Greig's warehouse, and that he got in the back way; he afterwards told me where he lived, and gave me the key of his box, which I searched, and found in it duplicates of two pieces of linen, which he said were Mr. Greig's, and a book, with Mr. Greig's name in it; I got the linen out of pawn.</p>
               <p>MR. GREIG. This piece of cloth is mine. I am certain I never sold it; the fluctuation of the market is so great I cannot estimate the value. His friends are respectable, and I believe this to be his first offence.</p>

On the 17th of April I went to bed soon after eleven o'clock - I went round the house myself, and saw that every thing was safe: it is my dwelling-house: it is unusual for me to awake before five o'clock, but from some cause or other I was awoke as near two o'clock as possible - I got up and opened the bed-room window-shutter, which is my custom; I found it was quite dark - I went to bed again. About six o'clock Foreigner, my servant, came to me, and I went down stairs with a light - I found several doors had been broken open; the first entrance had been made through the back kitchen window - the wood-work, into which the iron bar fastened, was cut away with a centre-bit, and the bar forced out - a pane of glass was broken in the casement, through which a hand could be put, and the hasp of the casement opened; a person could then enter the house: there were two doors bolted within before they could get in further - the first of these doors was forced off the hinges, and put on one side - the pannel of the second was cut out with a centre-bit - any one could then get through. I have a bureau in my front parlour, and my son has another; they were both broken open, and the papers in some measure displaced, but they appeared to have been disturbed in the act; a tea-chest in the room was broken open, and the tea taken out - that room was quite dark, and the shutters closed; they could not have been there without a light, though it was day-light when I was there.</p>

            . I am constable of Hammersmith. - On the morning of the 18th of April, about twenty minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310004"/>past five o'clock, I met the prisoner at Hammersmith-turnpike, which is about four miles from Strand-on-the-Green; he was walking along very steady; I spoke to him just after he got through the turnpike - he had a bundle in his right hand; I asked him what it contained - he said what he had got he had come honestly by; I collared him, and said I wished to know what he had got - he said it was no business of mine; I took my staff in my hand, and said I insisted on knowing before he went further; he then dropped the bundle out of his hand, and tried to get away - he made no resistance then, but before I got him to the watch-house he caught hold of me by the throat; I struck him with my staff, and took him to the watch-house - I searched him there, and found on him a dark-lantern, a crow-bar, a chisel, a centre-bit, thirteen door-keys, a knife, a pair of scissars, a brad-awl, a die, a pair of black silk stockings, a silver purse, and a gold thimble, and he had a quantity of tea in a handkerchief in his hat which he had got on. I did not hear of the robbery till night; I went to Mr. Trimmer's the following morning. the 19th, and found a door forced off its hinges, and put on one side - I produce the pannel which had been taken out of the other door, one piece was cut out, and I took the other part out myself; I have compared the centre-bit found on the prisoner with the holes in the pannel, it fitted them exactly; the centre-bit was broken at one of the points, and will not cut so clear as a perfect one - these holes appear to have been cut with a broken centre-bit. I showed the articles found to Miss Trimmer, and she claimed some of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what hour do you leave your beat? A. At five o'clock, or sometimes a few minutes past; I had left then: it was exactly twenty minutes past five when I was at Hammersmith-turnpike, just before I stopped him; it was quite light enough for me to see the clock.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Is there a clock at the turnpikegate? A. Yes. He was about four miles from the house; I will not swear it was exactly four miles from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear it is three miles and a half? A. I will not swear exactly to the distance; I will swear to two miles and a half, and I think it is more; I judge it to be four miles, but I never went to Strand-on-the-Green before.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter, and live with him. This purse, gold thimble, and silk stockings are mine - I know the stockings by a mark - they are worth 2s. or 3s. I know the purse by the string being broken, and one of the tassels bent; it is silver, and cost 10s., but being broken I suppose it is worth about 2s.; this is part of an old gold thimble. I saw the stockings safe on the day of the robbery, and the purse and thimble a few days previous - I kept them in my desk, which had been opened, but I had left it unlocked. I came down between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and missed them; when I went to bed on the night of the 17th I put the candles out, and left two candlesticks on the parlour-table, where the desk was - they were gone the next morning; they are not worth more than half-a-crown. I missed the silver prong of a toasting-fork from the other parlour - I had seen that the morning before - it was worth about 5s. The fork and candlesticks were my father's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This prong had been separated from the handle? A. It was screwed up on the Tuesday morning, when I saw it, but is now unscrewed, and the handle left behind - it was my grandmother's, and had been in use some years; the top of the thimble had been knocked off by one of my brothers.</p>

The prisoner was employed to varnish some furniture at my house on the 6th of June, 1825; I left the house about eight or nine o'clock in the morning of that day - I had four 10l. notes in a small book,(not a pocket-book) which I left on the mantel-piece of the second floor front room, tied round with a piece of tape,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310005"/>with other memorandums; I missed the notes on the following morning. I had put the book on the mantel-piece on Sunday evening, the 5th of June; I saw the book on Monday morning, but did not open it; my family were out of town. I saw my notes at Hatton-garden about a month ago; I had received them from Messrs. Hankeys, my bankers, on the 4th of June, but did not take the numbers of them myself. The prisoner had not finished his work; he was painting - it was his duty to return on the 7th of June, to finish the job, and take away his tools, but he never came for them. My servant is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you any other servant in your house that day? A. No. My family were at Highgate; my wife was at home on the morning of the 6th, and went out with me; I had occasion to leave town - I was out all day, and returned in the evening. The prisoner had not finished varnishing some furniture as I was informed - he had been working for me under Mr. Shaw's orders, some days before. I am not accustomed to leave my property about; the house had been painted throughout, and every thing of value was locked up. To the best of my knowledge there was no one in the house that day but him and the servant.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You left the book on the mantelpiece on the Sunday evening? A. Yes. The prisoner left a paint-pot and some small brushes behind him; he had been employed by Mr. Shaw to paint, but not to polish the furniture.</p>

            . On the 6th of June, 1825, I was in Mr. Butcher's service; I saw the prisoner at work there on the 6th of June - Mrs. Butcher left about ten o'clock; nobody but the prisoner and I were in the house all day; I saw him leave the house about six o'clock in the evening; he said he had not finished his work, and would come again in the morning to finish - he left the tools behind him, and never came for them, or to finish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What tools were they? A. Some small brushes, a paint-pot, and a knife; I cannot say whether they were his or Mr. Shaw's. I am positive nobody else was at the house - no tradesman called; there was no carpenter or any other workman there; I did not go out further than into the garden all day - I might be there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I will swear the front door was shut all day; I will not swear there was no knock at the door, but am positive there was nobody in the house. The prisoner went out to dinner, and came back at two o'clock - nobody came while he was at dinner, to the best of my belief, but it is so long ago I cannot recollect; I was asked about the notes; but never suspected myself; I was not searched, nor were my boxes; I was asked if I had been with the man in the different rooms - I had been up and down, backwards and forwards. I had been in the kitchen with him; there is no bed in the kitchen - there was nothing happened between us on any bed that day. I was not examined before the Magistrate. I was the only person who had the care of the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you asked to go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, but I was not subpoenaed, and my master and mistress I lived with would not let me go; I had lived with the prosecutor three months. I am sure the prisoner said he would return next morning to his work; he had left the scrutire unfinished - he said he had not finished it, and would come in the morning to do it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What enables you to recollect having four 10l. notes? A. Their being stolen soon after made me recollect it. I heard of the robbery on the Tuesday following; I will not swear this is the cheque, but it was for 50l.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Tremain, a hatter, of King-street, Holborn. I know the prisoner, and remember his coming to our shop on the evening of the 6th of June, 1825, between seven and eight o'clock - he purchased a hat for 24s., and gave me this 10l. note, No. 5278; I knew him before this occurred, and cannot be mistaken in him - he mentioned his name to me in the shop - he waited in the shop while I went to Mr. Young, a baker, in Holborn, to get change; I wrote Mr. Tremain's name on the note, in Young's shop - I never wrote my master's name before on a 10l. note - this is the note, and has my writing on it. The prisoner came again in about two hours afterwards, and ordered a drab hat of my master, and paid 4s. in part of it - he was to call for it on the Saturday, and pay the difference - it was to be 24s.; he never called for it. He called again on the 21st of July, 1826, and had a black hat - he deducted the 4s. which he-had paid the year before out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mr. Young here? A. No. I recollect the date - he appeared to have been drinking, and said master could never make him a hat big enough - master said he had not got a block big enough. I recollect it was the 6th of June, because I have the book here in which master made an entry when he came home, and I told him of it- I never changed a note for the prisoner before, and never saw my master change one, to my recollection; I never changed so large a note as a 10l. at Young's before; Young wished me to go back for my master to put his name on it. but he not being at home I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When your master came home you told him what had happened? A. Yes, and he entered it in the book with the date, and when the prisoner returned I saw my master enter the white hat down - here is the entry: I had seen him frequently at the shop before, but only once since - that was in 1826. I am certain he is the man.</p>

I found a box which I had left locked was broken open, and missed a 10l. Bank note, several sovereigns and half-sovereigns, some half-crowns, shillings and sixpences, a cloak, two gowns, a shawl, petticoat, and apron - they were all my husband's property, and I am certain I left them locked in the box - every thing was on the Sunday, when I went to the box, and I kept the key in my possession.

            . I live in Short's-gardens, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields - my husband, whose name is David, rents the house; Coffee and his wife lodge with us. Between seven and eight o'clock on the morning in question I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner come out of the passage into the street - she had a cloak on - it was on a Tuesday morning, but I do not recollect the date; I saw no more of her: Mrs. Coffee came home about eleven o'clock- I lent her some keys; the child was locked in the room, and crying - she complained of missing her property. I did not examine her box.</p>
               <p>JOHN COFFEE. I am the husband of the first witness. I received a 10l. note, about June last, from Mr. Lockey, a hatter, in change for a 20l. note; I gave it to my wife to put by - I saw it in the box several times since - there was 45l. 5s. 6d. in all. I saw all the money safe on the Sunday afternoon, about three o'clock; I took it out of the box and put it in again - it was stolen on Tuesday, the 13th of March - my wife's clothes were also in the box on Sunday.</p>

Bank note and seventeen sovereigns, which I have had ever since - I delivered them up before the Magistrate; I put the box and all the property into the trunk, which I corded and sealed - Coffee was present when I examined it.

Mr. Waddington left several coats, waistcoats, and trousers there - I saw Webster take a key from a hat-box, which the prisoner used to claim as his - it was kept in the kitchen, where we clean the plate - I have seen him take things out of that box.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Leg-alley. The prisoner's wife took an apartment with me on the 13th of April - he came on the same evening, and asked if a person named Farr had come to ledge there - I said Yes, and asked if he was her husband - he said Yes, and I showed him into the room; he came there once or twice a day, and sometimes not for two or three days - I do not know that he slept there - his wife went to lay-in at the hospital on the 7th of May; he came there about three hours afterwards, and I never saw him again - he had the key of the room. Mr. Joy and an officer came on the 11th, and showed me the key of the room; I opened the door, and found the clothes there - the prisoner paid me one week's rent on the morning his wife left: he kept the room locked all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The lodgings seem more to be taken by the wife? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in Dove-court, Lombard-street. I saw Coveney with two baskets; he brought the prisoner into Dove-court; what took my attention was, that the prisoner put his head into our window, which was open- Coveney then took one basket to Mr. Traver's in Swithen's-lane, and the prisoner followed him, but immediately returned, took up the other basket and went away - I did not see him again till the 2d of May, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor in Cheapside, and being a baker, I asked if he knew of any work - I was acquainted with him, and followed him to the place, he left his basket there; I said, "You had better take it into a public-house, and then nobody will take it"- I then went away.</p>

On the 11th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner shoreing fish from the fish-boat to the stairs - he, (being a waterman plying at those stairs), contrived to get his wherry between the fish-boat and the stairs, and as he carried the fish on shore, he contrived to drop part of the fish into his own boat; there was no occasion for his boat to be there; after the fish-boat was unladen, all but two fish, he went on board, and took out two plaice, which he put into his own wherry - he then put the board of the wherry over the fish to conceal them - I then desired my man to go on shore, while I hired a boat, and went round in his rear to secure him - I got round without his perceiving me - he was in his own boat - I told him he had got stolen fish there; he said he had not; my man got into his boat, and under the boards we found sixteen Dutch plaice and two maids; he said he would not be taken out of his boat, but we secured him; he surrendered quietly; the fish belonged to Mr. Spashett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was the boat Hero there? A. That is the boat he took the fish from - I never knew him in Mr. Hall's employ; they have 1s. for carrying the fish from the boat - I never knew any fish given to them besides.</p>

Mr. Goldham went to him, and said, "You have got some fish there;" he said he had not - I took up the boards and found the fish under them; they could not have dropped through there by accident; he then said he would not be taken out of his own boat.</p>

            . The Hero is my boat. I have partners - I did not see the prisoner till about eight o'clock on this morning; these plaice would have sold for about 6s., and the maids for 1s. - I had not given them to him, nor was he employed to land any fish from our boat - I paid another man 12s. to shore them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not persons you employ hire others to help them? A. We had three men; but he was neither of them; they sometimes employ others, but none were wanting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was hired by the waterman to bring the fish on shore for 1s.; the man on board said I was to have a bit of fish as well.</p>
               <p>MR. GOLDHAM re-examined. I saw the waterman who brought Spashett's fish on shore give the prisoner 1s.; it is usual for them to get men to help them; he gave him the 1s. on board the Hero - I do not consider that the waterman was at all implicated.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of April, about a quarter to five o'clock in the morning, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310009"/>was in Crown-street, Finsbury, and saw two men standing in a door-way, one with a livery coat on, the other had a hat tied up in a handkerchief - it was broad daylight; they were about the eighth of a mile from Mr. Sykes'; while my back was turned they shifted across the street into another door-way; while I was ringing at a public-house to call some people up, a man passed, looked at the two men, and then looked at me - I thought all was not right, and was going to challenge them, when a private patrol in the same street got out of his box, and started them; they moved off, and as I went towards them I saw a piece of linen drop from under the coat of the man in the livery coat; that man went up Clifton-street, and got away - I followed the other, who was the prisoner Smith; he was caught, and given into my custody - I lost sight of him three or four times, merely as he turned the corners; but am sure I caught sight of the same person, and that he is the man - I saw him throw a hat down, which was tied up in a silk handkerchief; it was the same as I had seen him with in the door-way - I do not know that I have seen the man who was in his company since - I saw him make a blow at Holden, who pursued him - I also saw him drop a bottle which had some liquor in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you the first person who pursued? A. Yes; persons who were before me joined in the pursuit, after I gave the alarm - I had a great coat on, and had been up all night, and was tired - Holden ran faster than me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. Q. Did you not see the man in the livery coat give me the hat. wrapped up in the handkerchief? A. No - I saw him pull the coat off, and the linen dropped; my brother watchman took up the coat and linen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Jackson? A. I saw him a little before five o'clock the same morning, standing at the corner of the City-road, just out of Finsbury-square - I was without my watchman's coat, and saw him look at me, and walk away - I then went after him, and called Stop thief! - I lost sight of him for about a minute; but am certain he is the person; he was taken by a watchman of St. Luke's; I saw a hat drop off his head; it appeared never to have been worn before.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is Mr. Sykes' house from Finsbury-square? A. I cannot exactly tell; the hat which fell from him appeared the same as the others found; they all three appeared hats of one sort and east; I believe nothing was found on his person.</p>

On the 20th April they sent a bale of goods to the Catherine Wheel - I directed them myself, to William Laing of Thetford, and packed them up myself; they were twilled cambric stripes and florentines - I saw a piece of striped florentine at the Mansion-house afterwards; here it is - there are thirty-two yards of it; it is worth about 34s. - I am sure it is part of what I packed; (looking at the invoice) I know this is what I put into the package; it is in our clerk's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know the florentine? A. The length is on it, in my hand-writing; it is the only piece I have marked since I have been in the house.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Cooper, a hat-manufacturer. I sent a package of hats to the Catherine Wheel, to go to Littleport, and believe I assisted in packing them - I saw three hats at the Mansion-house, which I believe to be part of them; they are from 5s. 3d. to 5s. 9d. each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You believe you assisted in packing them? A. I am sure of it; we have made a great many of this sort - I cannot tell how many have been sold; we never sell any single ones, and sell none in London; we might have sold 5 or 600, but they all went into the country; no doubt there are 1000 of the same quality in London, but these are our manufacture.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Long-alley, Sun-street. On Sunday morning, the 22d of May, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner Jackson, alone, coming up Long-alley: he passed me as I sat in my box - I thought he seemed rather intoxicated; in about a quarter of an hour after that I heard a rattle spring, at the corner of Clifton-street - I went to the spot, and saw this piece of print lay on the pavement; I left it in charge of the watchman, and went in pursuit - I turned back, came down Long-alley again, and saw Smith coming up Long-alley, in the custody of Bollen and another man; I went with him to the watch-house, pulled off my coat, and went in pursuit of another, and in the City-road I saw Jackson running - I called to another watchman to stop him; one tried to stop him at the corner of Featherstone-street, but he crossed over, and got down Tabernacle-row; he was secured; he had a hat on then, but it fell of several times on the way to the watch-house; it was delivered to Tickner - I did not observe whether it fitted him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did it happen to fall off?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310010"/>A.

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 22d, between six and seven o'clock, I was fetched to Mr. Sykes' premises; I found two locks broken open, and one picked; and in the top warehouse I found a taper, two old hats, and an old cap left behind; they have all been a good deal worn; one hat is torn; an old umbrella was found in the yard, which nobody claimed - I have not fitted the hats on any body.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Thompson. On the 14th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the sweeps rang at the bell - I did not expect them, and they were strangers; I opened the street door to them; the prisoner was one of them I am certain - they were both dressed as sweeps; his companion said he was desired to call and sweep a flue, which leads from the oven into the kitchen chimney, which the boy had forgotten to sweep six weeks ago when they swept the chimney; I said I was sure he was mistaken; he said, No, his master had desired him to come - I said, "Who is your master?" he said, "Mr. Shipley of Broad-yard" - I let his companion in; he came down into the kitchen, and began to sweep the flue; the prisoner did not come in with him, but walked down the street; about five minutes after the prisoner came up the steps, and knocked at the door - I went up to the door, leaving his companion sweeping the flue in the kitchen; the prisoner came down stairs: the other said, "Here Jack, take the brush and sweep;" he did so, and the other took up the soot, and then said,"Now, will you be so kind as to let us out?" the other put the soot into the yard, and went up-stairs before me; I followed him, and the prisoner followed behind me - I had left him in the kitchen; he followed me directly, but when he got to the kitchen door he closed it - I had got out, and he being inside, I turned back, saying, "What do you mean by this?" and pushed the door open; he said, "Nothing, Ma'am;" it must have been done on purpose - I immediately said, "Please to deliver up the silver spoon, which you have taken off that dresser." as I missed it; he looked at me, and without saying a word, delivered the spoon from his bosom; the other came down stairs, and said, "What is the matter?" I said,"Why this fellow has taken a spoon off the dresser;" he said, "Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself; don't you know better, you may rely on it, I shall tell your master" - I said, "You need not trouble yourself, I will do that;" I then let them both out of the house, and when they had been gone about five minutes, my master asked me what the time was - I went down into the kitchen, and missed the watch, which hung over the dresser just before they came in - I had hung it there that morning; it was mistress', and has never been found; one of them must have taken it: it was worth full 10l. - I told master I had let the sweeps in, and instantly went to Mr. Shipley - the prisoner was brought to me on the 22d - I had described his person to the officer - I swear positively he is the man who had the spoon - I should not have let them in if I had not believed they came from Shipley.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On Thursday the 10th of May, about half-past seven o'clock, Mrs. Pomeroy came to the office; in consequence of what she said, I went to her house, to a room up two pairs of stairs, and on entering the room I saw the child's head on the table, and a quantity of blood - I searched, and in the corner of the room was a bed, with the body of the child covered with a counterpane; there was a great quantity of blood on the floor, as well as on the table; the head appeared as if it had been cut off with some sharp instrument, which I looked for, but could not find - I had been at the office from six o'clock in the evening, and in the morning from nine till three - I heard of no disturbance in the neighbourhood - I found nothing in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say you had been in the office all day? A. No - I had been about executing warrants and other things - I cannot say how long I was there; there are a great many Irish in White chapel, but not exactly in the neighbourhood; there are frequent disturbances among them.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. As far as you know, was there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310012"/>any complaint of a disturbance made at the office? A. No.</p>

            . The prisoner is my son. I live in White's-yard, near Rosemary-lane; he came to my house on a Thursday evening in May, about eight o'clock - I cannot remember the day of the month - I think it was the second Thursday of the month; he was dressed in his shirt sleeves, and had no hat on: he said very little - I asked if he had been fighting; he said he had been fighting some Irishmen in the skittle-ground - I walked with him a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whether any thing had happened while he was fighting in the skittle-ground? A. He made mention, in going along, that the parish-officers were after him for relief, for his wife and child, which I did not recollect before - I accompanied him to Mr. Pugh's in Carnaby-market; he said nothing more about the Irishmen, that I can recollect - I think there was something mentioned about a knife - I really cannot say the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us, as well as you can, you must tell the truth: did he say any thing more? A. He got 10s. at Mr. Pugh's - I accompanied him to Oxford-road, and he said he was going to Barnet; he mentioned something to Mr. Pugh about a knife, which I did not particularly attend to, for I was drinking a glass of gin at the time; he went to Pugh's for a coat and hat, which he got there, and 10s. to put into his pocket; I left him in Oxford-road; he shook hands with me - I bade him good night, and did not see him again till he was in custody; he had been married about five weeks - I suppose his wife had had the child two or three months before - I think her name was Beadle before she was married - I did not know the name of the child till after it was dead - I do not recollect, that I ever heard him call it by any name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The name of the woman who afterwards became his wife, you had only heard, I suppose? A. No; I heard it before and since their marriage; she went by the name of Beadle - I was not acquainted with her myself, she was such a bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only know what name she went by before by report? A. Yes - my son was a humane hard working, well conducted lad.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I went to Pomeroy's house about eight o'clock in the evening of the 10th May, after Dalton had been there - I did not search the room then - I saw the child's head on the table, and the body on the bed - I searched the same room the next morning, between ten and eleven, and found a fustian coat lying on the floor, towards the back of the room, opposite the window: it lay thrown down carelessly; there was some blood on both sleeves, and the front: the blood was splashed upon it; there was a good deal upon it in one place or another - I produce the same coat - I knew the prisoner before this happened - I had seen him often, and have observed his dress; I have seen him wear such a coat as this - I saw him two or three days before the 10th of May, but cannot tell what coat he had on then - I have seen him wear such a coat within about a week of that time - I marked this coat, and locked it up at the office - I examined the child's head on the Thursday night, and observed a dent or little bruise on it - I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him at a farmhouse in Radnorshire, Wales, called the Lane-house, on Thursday, the 17th of May, a little before ten o'clock in the morning; I had been in search of him from the day after this happened - I found him sitting in the lower room in the chimney corner - I had made a complete search of that house, at three o'clock in the morning of that day, and did not find him; the prisoner said, when I went in, "O, Davis. is that you? I shall go any where with you" - I secured him, and took him to the Seven Arms inn at Penybout, where I had a horse and chaise - I did not search any other house in that neighbourhood - I took him afterwards to a house at Radnor - an old lady there, who appeared to be the landlady of the house, said to him, "In God's name," or "In the name of God, how came you to do such a cruel thing?" (I had not used either threat or inducement to him - I had asked a question, which he declined answering); his answer to the woman was, "It was not God, it was the Devil;" when we were on the road from the farm-house to Penybont, I asked how he came to be guilty of such a thing, he would not give me any answer - I had not then told him why I took him, but I had before the landlady asked the question - I told him immediately I got him out of the house, that I took him on suspicion of murder; he said, "Very well, Mr. Davis;" this was before I asked him how he came to do such a cruel thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use the word cruel? A. Yes; nothing more passed between us; at Kinton, about sixteen miles from Penybout, I saw him change his shirt: the one he took off was bloody; here it is, (producing it) it is bloody on the left sleeve, and in front of the breast; it was just as it is now, and appeared to have been worn a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during your journey from Radnor to London, use any threat or promise to him? A. Never; I heard him say, "Oh, my poor mother, when she knows I am taken it will break her heart" - I heard him say nothing more. I put my name and the day of the month on the jacket before I locked it up - it is on it now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the only person who keeps the key at the Police-office? A. No. The landlady of the inn is not here. I was in the prisoner's lodging twice, but did not search until Thursday night; there was daylight enough for me to see - I did not see the jacket there then; there was a considerable quantity of blood on the floor. I cannot say whether the room had been occupied on the evening of the 10th, or whether the jacket was there then.</p>

            . I live in Cooper's-yard, Carnaby-street. On Thursday, the 10th of May, I was at home - old Mr. Sheen came to the house between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, and got a coat and hat - I saw him have the coat and hat, and 10s. The prisoner came in about ten minutes - the old man had not left; I saw the prisoner standing at the door when the father came; the father got the coat and hat the first time he came, and the second time I lent him 10s.; I lent it to the father.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner? A. At the door: that was the second time the father came - he then had my husband's coat and hat on, which the father had borrowed- the father had said something to me, which induced me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310013"/>to ask the prisoner what he had done with the knife which he struck the Irishman with - he gave me a knife, and told me to burn it for God's sake; I threw it on the sink: I gave the same knife to Dickenson, the officer, the next morning. The prisoner said nothing more, but went out; I never saw the prisoner before, but I knew his father, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your husband alive? A. Yes - he was at home, and heard what passed, but he had had rather too much; he gave old Sheen the coat and hat - there was no blood on the knife; it was much in the same state as it is now.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What did you say about his having had too much? A. He had been out all day, and had had rather too much liquor - his name is Thomas.</p>

            . I am beadle of Whitechapel. I examined the head of the child and the neck, and I looked at the body, and the part of the neck there; the skin at the back part of the head was very much in notches - it was cut off directly at the upper joint, at the back part of the neck; there were some notches in the skin, at the back, about the place where the joint had been cut through - the head could be taken off with such a knife as this, according to my judgment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you examine the head? A. I first examined it on Friday, about eleven or twelve o'clock - it was afterwards pointed out to me by Dickenson; I then examined it very minutely, and rubbed the saw-dust off; this was just as the Coroner's Jury were leaving the room. After they had returned their verdict on the Saturday, the master of the workhouse had the care of the body - he is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you form your judgment from the head, or the body? A. From the head mostly; I saw the head on Friday - it was in the same state with respect to the neck, but was all over saw-dust.</p>

            . I am clerk to the attorney for the prosecution. I have examined the register of baptisms at St. George the Martyr, Southwark; I saw this extract made from the register, and examined it with the original - it is correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you examine it? A. By taking the register in one hand and the certificate in the other, and comparing them; the parish-clerk examined it also, but did not read it to me, nor I to him - I saw it signed - it was signed at the time I examined it.</p>
               <p>This certificate was here read, and stated the child to have been baptized on the 31st of January, 1827, as Charles William, describing it as the son of Lydia Beadle, of Mr. Willis' poor-house, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>SARAH POMEROY. I have heard the prisoner's wife called Lydia.</p>

I said, "For what?" he said a 5l. note - I said I had; he gave me the note, and I gave him four sovereigns, and said, "Is this a good note?" he said, "Yes, as far as I know;" I went to look at the cart, to get the direction to put on the note, but found the cart was gone; I went into Mr. Jackson's, and showed him the note, which he looked at, and said it was bad - I ran up Piccadilly, and caught sight of the prisoner going into Regent-street, with the basket of fowls on his shoulder; I caught him by the shoulder, and said he must come back, for I believed the note he gave me was a bad one - he told me to let him go and stop the girl who was gone on with the cart, for fear she should go astray; I refused - he then put his hand into his pocket, and gave me the four sovereigns and the fowls. I then let him go and stop the cart - he returned in about a minute, and asked where the note was - I said at Mr. Jackson's, if he would return with me he could get it; we each took hold of the basket, and went to Jackson's - he said his name was

            . I live at the corner of the Hay-market. Hayes brought me a note, which I at first thought was good, but afterwards said it was bad; he afterwards returned with the prisoner: I had kept the note in my hand, unmixed with any other; I asked his name; he said."Samuel Panton, No. 6, James-street, Kensington;" I said, "Are you quite certain you live in James-street?" he said, "Yes, that is my address;" he afterwards said Jennings'-buildings; I wrote both addresses on the note - this is it (looking at it); he said he took it from a butcher at Kingston, named Bourton, for the sale of a horse - I have written on it, "Of Mr. Bourton, Kingston." I sent for Herring, and he was secured. I gave Herring the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain he did not say he lived in Jennings'-buildings? A. He at first said he lived in James-street, but afterwards said Jennings'-buildings - my impression was that Jennings'-buildings were in James-street; I believe he said he was employed to sell the horse.</p>

            . I am inspector of the patrol, and took the prisoner in charge; he said he took the note at Barnet fair, in payment for a horse - he at first said he lived in James-street, and then in Jennings'-buildings; I asked who knew that he had the horse - he said it was not his own, but a gentleman in St. Paul's-church-yard, named Smith, gave it him to sell; I said, "Well, we will go there;" he said, "No, he is in the country." I found three persons in St. Paul's-church-yard of the name of Smith.</p>

On Sunday night, the 29th of April, a little before twelve o'clock, I and my family went to bed; I had been into the cellar about twenty minutes past eleven, and tapped a barrel of ale - the cellar flap was all fast then - it was fastened with a padlock, which was safe. I was alarmed by the watchman about twenty minutes after two o'clock; he knocked at the door, and said there were thieves in the house; I came down, and got a light from the watchman - we both went into the cellar, which is part of the dwelling-house; I found the prisoner concealed behind two hogsheads of ale; I asked how he came there - he made no reply; I brought him out, and gave him in charge; he was taken into custody. I had locked the cellar door before I went to bed; when that door is open there is a communication from the cellar to the rest of the house - the flap between the cellar and the street was locked outside with a padlock, which fastened the bar of the flap - I found it broken open, and the padlock thrown away; the small flap was open - he must have got in that way.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone-office. I have known the prisoner for three years; on Saturday night, the 28th of April, at a quarter or twenty minutes past ten o'clock, he passed me in Dean-street, Lisson-grove, with a bundle under his right arm; the instant he passed he turned, and seeing me following he flung the bundle down; I followed him about fifty yards, calling out Stop that man! the streets there have a number of turnings, and I did not pursue further, but turned back and picked up the bundle, fearing I should lose it; I am sure it is the same bundle. I saw him again next morning, at a quarter-past eight o'clock, standing at a corner shop in Lisson-street, with his face towards me - I was about fifty yards off; I suppose he saw me, for he turned his face, and looked into a shop: I ran up, and caught him by the collar of his coat; he did not run away; I said, "You ran from me last night, but I have caught you this morning, and you must go with me;" he asked what for - I said for the bundle which he had flung down; he then laid down, and said he would not go unless I fetched a coach - I took him to the office. I am positive he is the man, for I have seen him about twelve times a week for the last two or three years. I produce the bundle.</p>

I was on the opposite side. I ran across, and secured Croson - Lovell, who was with me, took another of them; I put Croson into the watch-house, which is close by, and then ran to assist Lovell, who had hold of one of the prisoners; Cox had the other - I am sure they were all three in company, and close together at the time the handkerchief was taken.

I was on Holborn-bridge, and saw the three prisoners following two gentlemen; they left them by Snow-hill, and turned back - a gentleman passed them, whom they immediately followed; he had a parcel in each hand, and his handkerchief hung a little out of his pocket. Between Ely-place and Hatton-garden I saw Saunders take the handkerchief, and give it to Croson; the three prisoners were then together; I and Wiltshire directly crossed - they were then turning up Hatton-garden; Wiltshire took Croson, and I took Vicary - Cox took Saunders; I saw two handkerchiefs found on Croson - one of which was red, with a border to it, and that was the one he took from the gentleman's pocket - it has not been claimed.</p>

On the 7th of May I went to Leadenhall-market with his cart, and a gelding belonging to Charles John Brickerton Chesterton; Parsons was with me - we got there about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and went into the market to purchase poultry, leaving the cart and horse in Gracechurch-street, as usual- I bought twelve fowls, twelve chickens, and six ducks - the fowls were delivered to Hart, to take to the cart; when I returned the cart, gelding, and all were gone.

I have seen two fowls in the possession of Wallis, and know them to be two of those I bought; I had sent them to the cart by a porter; when I went to look for the cart it was gone - I had been absent about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you still in Chesterton's service? A. Yes - his horse was brought to Jermyn-street by a person; my fowls were dead and plucked - I had put no mark on them - I had bought two dozen, and these two were precisely of the same quality and sort as the cost; they were tied the same way, by the leg; fowls are not all tied that way. I say they are two of the fowls - I bought them of Brooks, who had a great many fowls.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you see them? A. I think it was the day after I lost them - they had a few feathers left about the head.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time was this? A. It might be twenty minutes before seven o'clock - he had a hat on, and I think he wore the same coloured coat that he has now; he was driving very slow, and without a whip; I did not suspect him - he was not more than a minute passing me, it was just by the Cross Keys, opposite the market; his hat shone - I cannot say whether it was a glazed one.</p>

On Wednesday, the 28th of March, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to see a gold watch, which was taken from the window and shown to him; that was not exactly what he wanted, and another was shown to him; and in all eight were shown him, one after the other; he did not bargain for either of them, but wished then to see some watch-chains; three were shown him; he very quickly decided that one would suit him, and then wished to see some seals. and Barnes, our shopman, took a tray out of the window and before he could lay the tray down on the counter, the prisoner, in a very hurried manner, said, "I will just step over to the India-house and fetch my father, who will select one for me; he had not looked at the seals; the shopman stepped to the door and watched him; he never returned, either alone or with his father; in the space of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes we missed a gold watch; no other customer had been into the shop at all, from the time the prisoner was there till the watch was missed; I had been in the shop all that twenty minutes; nobody could have come in and taken it without my perceiving it; I had put the watches in a place of safety. I did not see him again till a month or five weeks afterwards, when he was at Hatton-garden. I did not know him before he came to the shop, but was quite sure he was the person who had bargained for the goods; he was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310017"/>within my observation, with only the counter between us; he did not pay for any thing, nor fix on a watch; I saw the watch at the office, and am quite certain it is ours, by a private mark - I should charge 20l. for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had never seen him before? A. No; I was not showing him the goods, but merely looking on; he had a hat on; Mr. Dobson has no other Christian name; I have known him thirty years; the watch is worth 20l. at an under value; the price of it is 24l.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. On the 28th of March I saw the prisoner in the shop, and am quite certain of his person; he was there fifteen or twenty minutes; he came in and asked to look at a gold watch; I shewed him one - he looked at several in succession, but agreed for none of them - they were put on the counter before him - he then asked to look at some watch-chains - three were shown him - he chose one almost directly - it was not paid for - I do not recollect the price - he then asked to look at some seals - I took a tray from the window, and before I had put it on the counter, he said he would step over to the India-house, to fetch his father to make choice of a seal for him - he left the shop, without paying for any thing, and never returned - I saw him go under the portico of the India-house, but could not observe whether he went in - we missed the watch in fifteen or twenty minutes - I had not delivered him either watch, chain, or seal - if he took either away it was without my knowledge or consent - he was a perfect stranger before - I never saw him again till he was in custody, about a month afterwards, at Hatton-garden - I saw the watch there, and have no doubt of it - the selling price is twenty-four guineas ready money.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 25th of April the prisoner was given into my charge for stealing a gold watch - I searched him, and found in his breeches pocket a gold watch, which I produce - it had a chain and seal to it - I took him to Hatton-garden - Mr. Glover and Barnes both claimed the watch there - I have had it ever since - the prisoner gave no account of it.</p>
               <p>MR. GLOVER. This is the watch - it has our private mark, which is a number and figures in a private character; I can tell that the number is 1878, but cannot tell the private number without looking at it - I put that down on a piece of paper, but not as soon as I missed the watch - there is a private mark on it, made by my young man, besides the number - I observed the private mark before it was stolen; it is still on it; my stock-book corroborates the mark; I have not got the book itself, but a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look at the private mark when you stood up here? A. Yes; but I could not carry it in my mind; I saw the private number at the office, but did not take it down there; I copied this number from my stockbook to-day; I can swear to the hand-writing on the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been asked at the office what the number on the watch was, could you have told without looking at it? A. Yes; I had advertized it in a bill as No. 1878 before that, but that is the manufacturer's number, not my private one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After seeing the number at the office, did you know it to be yours? A. Yes; I knew it from its general appearance as well, and am certain of it - the private mark is scratched on it by my shopman - I enter in my shop-book the manufacturer's number and my private number against it - my shopman can also swear to it.</p>

             re-examined. To the best of my recollection the private number is 104(looking at the watch), that is on it - it is a private mark made by myself - I have not the slightest doubt of its being the watch, both from the private mark and its general appearance; we have never sold No. 104, nor one with the manufacturer's No. 1878 - we always mark them off when they are sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What paper did I see you give your master? A. The ticket which was in the window, specifying the price of the watch; I told the magistrate the private mark on the watch before I saw it - I have looked at the watch-paper since I have been here to refresh my memory; both the paper and the number on the watch are my hand-writing; we have two letters of the alphabet as private marks, each answering to one number - the first two letters are either F. B. or B. N. - there must be two of those letters on the watch, but I do not name them as coupled, and I think the selling price underneath is either E. N. or I. R. two of those four letters; I have put no figures on it besides 104 myself; if 6 is on it, it has been added since - I have been two years and a quarter in the shop, and do not recollect selling any of this particular description of watch; my master has no more of that make and fashion, though it is not peculiar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the bill printed about the watch? A. The next morning; that only stated the No. 1878; No. 104 on the watch is in my hand-writing; I never marked any other gold watch with that number; I have not the slightest doubt of this being the watch.</p>

On Sunday, the 18th of June, 1826, at eight o'clock in the morning, I missed a pair of silver candlesticks from the pantry, which is in the middle of the house, down-stairs; I cannot swear that I had seen them since Friday morning; the area-door is occasionally open - I saw them again at the Police-office, on the 7th of July, and knew them; I brought them from the office on the 14th; they are now in Court- I know them to be the same.</p>

They have been in common use, mixed with other candlesticks since; there are two pairs of the same pattern; but I can tell those which were stolen; my mistress is not married; she is the daughter of a Duke.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 17th of June, 1826, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Petticoat-lane with Hanley, and saw the prisoner on the same side of the way as we were; he crossed over, and I crossed also; he had a basket, and was in company with another man; they immediately ran away, and separated; he ran down a small alley into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310019"/>Bell-lane: his hat fell off - he threw the basket down, and one of these candlesticks fell out - I picked up the basket, and the other candlestick in it - Hanley still pursued him, but lost him. I was on the top of a Hackney stage, on the Thursday following, and saw him - I got off, and caught hold of him by his coat and handkerchief; but he got away, leaving his coat and handkerchief in my hand - I found him in the police van the other day, and identified him - I advertized the candlesticks, and marked them before I delivered them to the butler.</p>

On the 17th of May I went to the prisoner Bailey's house, No. 9, Roger-street, Bethnal-green, and saw my glass hanging up in his parlour - it was worth about 4l.; the plate is worth 2l. 10s., and the frame 30s. - it was not nailed to my wall, but hung on a hook, and rested on two nails at the bottom - the weight was on the door at night on the 18th of December, and the next morning it was cut off, and found laying on the ground; it must have been taken off by somebody inside. My house is in the parish of St. George, Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time do you generally get up? A. At a quarter to eight o'clock; my lodgers are working men - I had two others, one of them is here; if a man wants to go out early he can pull the lock back and open the door; I had not moved any of my goods about this time. I have had the glass about five years, and have a mark on it, which I can swear to; any body might see it hanging in Bailey's room, if the parlour door was open - his is a private house; Smith was discharged a week after the 24th of January, and retaken on the 17th of May.</p>

            . I lodged at Daniel's house at this time, and slept in the adjoining room to Smith; I have to go through his room to get to mine - he came to bed after me on the night before the glass was missed; I did not hear him come to bed. Between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 19th I saw a light shining under the door of his room; I got up, went into his room, and said I was afraid he had left the candle near the bed, and danger might arise - he was laying on the bed, with his clothes on, quite dressed, and the candle was placed very near the grate; he told me to go into my own room, and not trouble myself with him; I went away, and went to sleep; I awoke again, and heard the clock strike four; the candle was then burning, but I did not see it afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. Smith was given into my custody on the 24th of January; I asked where he lived, and he refused to tell me; I asked again, and he said sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, but refused to say where; I asked if he wished to send for any body; he said No, but after the examination he sent me to the prisoner Bailey; I found him at work at a house in Bedford-square, Commercial-road, and told him Smith wished him to come to him in prison; he said he would go. I told him he was charged with stealing a looking-glass. Daniels, who was with me, had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310020"/>some conversation with Bailey, who promised that he would have some conversation with Smith, and get out of him what had become with the glass if he could, and that he would let Daniels know the result. I saw Bailey at the office about a week afterwards, and asked if he had seen Smith - he said Yes, and that he believed he knew nothing about the glass at all, and that he himself never knew any harm of him; Smith was discharged, and Bailey, he, and Bailey's wife, as I suppose, all went away together; Bailey's wife was at the office with him all day, till Smith was discharged. On the 17th of May a warrant was put into my hands, and I went, with Daniels and Blabey, to No. 9, Robert-street, Bethnal-green; I saw the same woman in the house as I had seen with Bailey; this looking-glass was in the room - Daniels said it was his, but it had been altered; I brought it away, and have it here. I went that day to Tottenham-court-road, and found Bailey working at a house there, as a carpenter - I told him I had been to his house, No. 9, Robert-street - he said he lived there when I asked him; I said, "The glass we have found in your house is said to be stolen from Mr. Daniels;" he said, "That glass - I bought it at a sale in Gracechurch-street;" I asked what he gave for it - he said 5l., about two years ago; I asked who was the auctioneer - he said Mitchell, of Norton-falgate. I took him into custody, and on our way to the office he said, that when he bought the glass it was in a mahogany frame, and he had since had a new gilt frame put to it, and that he could produce the person who had put the frame to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take Smith? A. Yes, the first time - it was on the 24th of January that I told Bailey that Smith was taken for stealing the glass; he knew I was an officer. I did not know where he lived till the 17th of May - he did not deny the house being his.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Pitcher, a looking-glass manufacturer, at No. 16, High-street, Shoreditch. I remember the day of the Duke of York's funeral - I think about a week before that a man and a woman brought a looking-glass to the shop, and I took it of them; Bailey is the man, I am quite sure; I saw him at the Thames Police-office afterwards, and saw the woman at a public-house just by the office, with two ladies. I am sure Bailey is the man who brought the glass - they asked if we brouzed glasses over, and the woman said, "We want this glass done over" - the frame was all gilt then; she said they wished some parts of it bronzed, like one which I showed them in the shop - I did it according to her direction, and should know it again - we kept it till the day of the Duke of York's funeral; the same woman who brought it then called, and asked if it was done; I said Yes, and showed it to her; she approved of it, and asked me to take it home - I took it to a street on the left-hand side of Bethnal-green-road, and the house was on the lefthand of the street - I think it was No. 9; she went with me, and I left it there; I am sure Bailey is the man who accompanied the woman with it. (Looking at the glass) I am certain this is it; the parts which are now bronzed were gilt before - we were obliged to take the glass out of the frame while we did it - we put this black stripe inside the frame.</p>

               <p>GEORGE DANIELS. This is my glass - I can swear to it; it was all gilt when I lost it; some part is now bronze - I know it by a bruise in the frame, and a defect in the quick-silvering - it was valued by an appraiser at 4l. 10s. - it is worth 4l. now - I have been in this trade myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not sleep in the very same room? A. I could not swear about it, as I did not take notice of the room - I had dined before the prisoners met me, and drank half a pint of beer, but no spirits - I treated Driscoll with two-penny worth of gin at the public-house, and had one penny worth of beer myself - she asked me to treat her, and stood at the door talking to a person, while I was at the bar - I showed them all my goods - they examined them for about five minutes - I never let go of the bundle while they were robbing me - I did not see the goods taken, but when I opened the bundle I missed them; I used to see Driscoll at the White Lion before, but never saw the other.</p>

On the 21st of May both the prisoners came into the shop, at a quarter-past 8 o'clock in the morning; I did not know them before - they asked to look at some cotton braces, which I showed them - they objected to the first parcel, but selected a pair from the second which I showed them - there were no handkerchiefs within their reach - they then asked to look at some stockings - I showed them some which were too large - I turned round to look for some others, and saw George Wilson pulling aside the glass sash, which protects the goods in the window - he was then near enough to reach the handkerchiefs - I watched him - Thompson stood close by him - I turned round, and saw another sash was drawn aside - there are three sash slides which separate the goods in the window from the shop- I then perceived that the handkerchiefs were gone - a boy had followed the prisoners into the shop almost immediately they came in, and before I observed the slides drawn aside - the boy did not speak to them, but went away before I missed the handkerchiefs - I did not know him - the handkerchiefs were tied up in a bundle - when I perceived that they were gone, I accused the prisoners of being concerned with that boy - they denied it - I am certain George Wilson drew the slide aside - I had not perceived it drawn aside before the boy came in - he stood behind the prisoners, and could not have drawn the handkerchiefs out himself - he was not tall enough to reach them - he could have drawn the glass partition aside, but could not reach the handkerchiefs out - I did not see him attempt to touch it, but I saw Wilson doing it - the handkerchiefs have never been found - they are worth about 5l. - I detained the prisoners, and sent for a constable - I gave them in charge - they only said that they were innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you the only person in the shop? A. Yes; they did not attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did your mistress come down directly after? A. Just as I missed the handkerchiefs; I asked her, in a hurried manner, if she had taken the handkerchiefs away, as I was confounded at missing them - I had seem them just before the prisoners came in, but I was much flurried on missing them; there was a chair between the prisoners and the window, and the counter parted me from the prisoners - it is not a yard wide - the handkerchiefs being taken would make no difference in the shade of light, as they did not hang up, but laid in a corner of the window, in a bundle - my back must have been turned when they took them - I asked mistress, in a hurried manner, if she had taken them- I was sure she had not, for they were there the minute before, and I missed them before she came down - Thompson bought a pair of braces, which I think came to 1s. 6d.; he put the money down just as I missed the handkerchiefs; I did not take it up; the other boy leaned over the counter, and did not speak; he did not appear connected with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>ELIZA GARTON. I am in partnership with Ann Garton- we rent this house jointly, and both inhabit it - it is No. 97, Cheapside - I was not present when the prisoners came in; when I came into the shop, I observed the two prisoners standing there, and noticed two cases standing open, which contained handkerchiefs and other things - I went to pick up a ticket, which laid on the floor; it had been attached to some Angola hose - I was going round to put the ticket on the counter, when Latimer passed me, and in a very hurried manner, asked if I had taken some silk handkerchiefs out of the window (the boy had left the shop before I came down) I had not taken them, and said so - he accused the prisoner Wilson of moving the case; the handkerchiefs could not be got without moving the case - Wilson said he had not moved it; Latimer then said he was positive they were both connected, and that they were connected with the boy who had gone out of the shop; he accused them both of being concerned in taking the handkerchiefs - they denied it, and a constable was sent for; I had not been in the shop that morning before - I had left the shop at twelve o'clock on Saturday night; this bundle of handkerchiefs was then in the window, with the glass slide secure; I did not particularly notice them, but every thing in the window was even and smooth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You did not particularly notice the handkerchiefs? A. Yes, I did - my sister is not here; she occasionally serves in the shop; nobody else does, besides Latimer; we both took the house together; nobody is engaged in business with us; it was between eight and nine o'clock - I sent my maid servant for a constable, who came in a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was nobody in the shop but your young man? A. No; they heard me send for a constable, but remained quietly till he came; when Latimer spoke to them about the slides, he had come round the counter between them and the door - one constable came first, and said he would send for Smith, another constable; he asked what I knew of it - I said the young man missed a bundle of handkerchiefs from the window, and accused Wilson of moving the slide, and he was positive they were connected with the boy; Thompson asked me if I belonged to the business; I told him I did; they were in the shop three, four, or perhaps five minutes before the constable came.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for. I found the prisoners standing in the shop, Latimer was between them and the door; they were charged with opening the window case, and a third person had come in and stolen the handkerchiefs; I found 35s. on one of them, and 15s. on the other; I took them before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON's Defence. I was coming from my house, in Marsh-place, to go to Whitechapel; and in Cheapside I bought a pair of stockings and braces; I put the money on the counter, and was going out; he asked if any thing else was wanted; I said No; he said, "Here are some good stockings;" and I bought a pair and put the money down; I was accused of the robbery.</p>
               <p>WILSON's Defence. I had been from Mile-end to the West end of the town, and received 12s. 6d.; on returning I went into this shop to buy some shoe-ribbon, but waited for the prisoner to be served; I was accused of pushing the casement back, which I denied.</p>
               <p>J. LATIMER re-examined. They did not ask to look at the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not usual for persons sometimes to look at a piece of handkerchiefs? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he drew back the slide, did he say,"I want to look at the handkerchiefs?" A. No; I observed Thompson point out something to Wilson; they came into the shop together.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Wilson a good character.</p>

I went by the house, and saw two or three silver spoons on the kitchen dresser; I then followed after the men. A person in the street could reach to the window, through the area railing- it was the house of Messrs. Shepherd, Thomas, and Lepard; I ran down Cloak-lane, and followed them till they came to the very same place again; I saw nobody about - I saw a watchman - and saw Johnson stopped.</p>

I delivered him the invoice; and suspecting something I followed him, to see if he went to the right place - he went towards Cheapside, away from Love-lane; I followed him into Cannon-street, and there saw a Jew join him - they turned down Bush-lane, into the Bell public-house together. I then went to a friend, and brought him down to the public-house, to watch them, while I fetched an officer - we opened the tap-room door, and there he had got the goods laid out - the Jew was standing over them - we took them into another room with the goods, but finding nothing on the Jew we let him go. I asked the prisoner who he ordered the goods for - he said for Barker and Adams - I asked why he did not take them there - he gave no answer. I went to Barker and Adams, and saw the prisoner's brother; when I got back I saw on the on the top of the goods these three pairs of ancles, in a parcel - I am sure they were in the warehouse when the prisoner came in- Barker and Adams have not claimed the goods which I delivered to him.</p>

I opened it, but did not look at any thing in it.

               <p>MRS. WHEELER. The box was brought to me by a gentleman whom I sent to inquire after it, and that gentleman brought me a duplicate.</p>

               <p>"I want to see if you can mend that box up, it has been broken by the sea-faring people, or somebody, and I want it mended up tidy, that it may not be laid to us;" it was very much broken - I know something was in it, because it rattled when I turned it about; it was three parts full; he came to me again in a few minutes, and said, "Can you make any thing of it?" I said, "No, I don't think I can, for the box is broken, and the bag is so rotten;" he said, "Very well, I suppose you can't, I am going to write an order for some bags;" he called me on deck soon after, and went to the ship-keeper; he wrote an order for some bags, and I went and got either two dozen, or one dozen - he said,"Take one of the bags, and take the things out of the box, and put them into the bag," which I did; they were paper parcels, about a foot long, three or four inches thick, and nearly square - I put them into the bag; he said,"Put them aside for the present, I will see about sending them out by and by;" he said, "This broken box, break it up smalier," which I did; there was a tin case inside, which was bent about very much - I broke the box into small pieces, and while so doing, one of the men, who was working near me, came and asked me what I was about - I said, "Breaking this box up; the foreman is there, you can ask him what it is for;" he was near enough to hear that - one of them called the man away to mind his own work; after breaking the box up, Rudolph came to me, took the box up, and threw it about the hold, some on one side and some on the other; the bag was put on one side, with some mats thrown over it - I then went to my work - the next morning Rudolph said to me,"Go up and tell Wilson and Bright to clear away off the fore-hatchway" - I did so, they were the only men at work there: they cleared off, and in the afternoon, Rudolph ordered the hatches off, as he said he wanted light; some time after they were off, he said, "Eager, you hail Wilson" - I said, "Who is Wilson?" he said,"The tall man" - I did so, and he said, "Hand that bag up to Wilson," which I did, and towards the evening, when they were going to shut up the ship, I said something to Bright, and saw the bag forward in the ship in a hole under some ropes, but I saw it through the ropes,</p>
               <p>Q. When you handed the bag up to Wilson, did you say any thing to him? A. I said the foreman ordered me to hand it up to him - I gave him no directions about it; next morning I went down into the hold, and Rudolph came to the hatchway and said, "What has become of the tin-case which was here yesterday?" I said, "I suppose it is forward where the box is;" he said, D - n it, I thought I saw something shine;" he then said,"Take and hand it up between decks" - I said, "Who too?" he said, "To Wilson" - soon after that I had an accident with my foot, and in the afternoon the gang went to work between decks - I said to Wilson, "What has become of that tin thing which was handed up this morning; he said, "I have put it under those coals, where he told me to put it;" in the evening, before I left work I went between decks, and Bright pointed the bag out to me - I examined it, and saw a shawl or scarf which I had put at the bottom of the bag: it was loose in the hold, and the papers in the bag were much broken - I saw some silks with handsome flowers on them in the papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell how many parcels there were in the bag? A. I did not take any notice; the loose pieces were put into the bag, at the top; the paper parcels were quite in a different state to when I put them in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you been employed much on board ships which come from the East Indies? A. Yes, for the last two or three summers- I have heard of packages being broken in the voyage; Rudolph was foreman of the gang, and it was his business to superintend the men; the ship was half empty when I went to work: the box was in the hold when I heard Rudolph last give any order about it - I do not know what was in the box of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know Wilson? A. Only by sight - I do not know whether he was an extra man that day - I never saw him before - Rudolph told him and Bright to clear the fore-hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a pulley used to get the things from between decks? A. Yes, afterwards; Wilson had been at work at the pulley.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You found the package broken when you were first called to it? A. Yes - I was to repair the bag, if I could have done it neatly, it would not have been noticed - as I could not, he told me to break it to pieces, and he threw it away himself about the hold.</p>

            . I am one of the East India Dock Company's labourers. On the 4th and 5th of April I was working between the decks of the Eliza with Wilson - Rudolph was generally below; I saw a tin cannister handed up from the hold - I was not near enough to see who handed it up - Wilson received it, and shoved it forward; nobody but me and him were between decks; about five minutes after I asked him what was in the tin-case, as I observed something yellow, which I thought was nankeen; and he said it was; I saw a bag come out of the forehold on Thursday; the ship-keeper called me below, just as the bag was coming up, and I went, Wilson was between decks, and he said to me, "Will you have one?" meaning a silk scarf; he mentioned some scarfs - I said I would not; I never saw the scarf; but he had told me, after he said it was nankeen, that they were silk scarfs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not Rudolph's business to give orders to the men? A. Yes; he was in trust of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310027"/>the goods, and constantly on board, except at meal times; he took twenty minutes for breakfast and dinner. Mr. Lighterness used to overlook Rudolph - I did not see Rudolph on deck when the tin or the bag were handed up - I was between decks, and could not see; he was not there when Wilson asked if I would have a scarf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you an extra man? A. Yes - Wilson and I were both taken on together; there were seven or eight men in the hold; only I and Wilson were between decks: the other men were in the hold, but not within hearing - I acted under Rudolph's direction - I saw the mouth of the bag come up - I did not see the tin-case opened.</p>

I am a superintendant at the East India Dock - the ship Eliza lay there: all the property in the ships is under the cave of the Company - James Mahon is the captain - I superintend the delivery of the cargo, and employed the two prisoners amongst others; Rudolph was foreman. On the 6th of April I was directed not to suffer any men to go down to the ship; the constable and dock-master accompanied me on board - I saw the constable find a bag under the rigging in the forehold; it contained crape scarfs - I found the pieces of the wooden case in the hold and was present when the tin case was found among the coals, with some rigging over it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the bag and tin-case in their proper place? A. Certainly not - I produce the pieces of the wooden case, the tin-case, and bag; the port of London was the port of entry and discharge of the ship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what day did you find these things? A. On the Friday - I was on board every day - I do not remember Rudolph being seat to another vessel - I have occasionally sent him on business while I remained on board - I did not send him away on either of these days.</p>
               <p>Q. The very way to discover the robbery, was to leave the tin-case and things on board? A. That I cannot say; they could have been thrown overboard.</p>

We sent them to the office, by some of the officers, and when the officers returned I took this cork off the shelf - it has some paste on it. I perceived this board on a shelf over the door - it is marked in places with the size of a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence. I found a file, which appears to have been filing metal - also some sand-paper, which is used to rub the sharp edges off the money; I found a small phial with aquafortis in it, and this jar of paste; I tried the paste on copper, and it produces the colour of silver. I found this shovel in the room, and showed it to Prideaux; I found some pieces of paper cut, large and small, to wrap half-crowns and shillings in.</p>

I examined the chair he had been sitting in, and found in it one half-crown, wrapped in paper, and another loose; I now produce them in the state they were in - they were on the chair when he got up. I saw a great many pieces of paper of this description on the table, near to where he sat, and by the side of the fire-place, close to the chair in which he sat, I observed an old handkerchief, and in that handkerchief, in a bag, I found, wrapped in separate papers, ten shillings in one paper, separately wrapped up, and five shillings and four shillings, all in separate parcels - I produce them in the state they were in. I also found another paper, containing three counterfeit sovereigns; I found a brown bag, containing three hundred counterfeit shillings, which were bright, and not ready for circulation. I also found a cotton stocking, containing a quantity of sparable nails and sand paper, which was broken into very small pieces - there was the appearance of a great deal of metal, of a yellow nature, among the nails - on our way to the watch-house the male prisoner said it was all up, that it was laid on well, and had we been a little later he should have been out; that we came at a very bad time, for he was very short blunted, as he had laid it all out yesterday; I searched Harvey, and found a good half-crown on her - I observed her hands - the internal parts seemed blackish, and the finger ends yellow; the paste found will produce that effect; I have tried it several times on a halfpenny, and it produces a yellow colour on the finger.</p>
               <p>Here the witness rubbed some of the paste on a halfpenny, which produced the colour of silver.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint. I have seen the various articles the officers have produced - here are two half-crowns which have been fitted for circulation, by being rubbed down, then resilvered, greased, and blacked, to give them the appearance of having been in circulation before; the rubbing down, is to remove from the surface of the coin the sharpness which it receives from the die - it is coloured by nitrate of silver and salt, which forms a paste - this paste is now dry. [The witness here moistened the paste with some water, and rubbed a small portion of it on a half-penny.] This operation, performed by the fingers, corrodes them, and produces a deep-yellow stain on the fingers, which remains some time, more or less, according to the quantity - here is some grease, which is applied to the coin after it is re-silvered; it is of a glutinous nature; it is spinal marrow; this makes it appear to have been worn, and kept in a greasy pocket. Here is a phial with nitrous acid, which is used in colouring; here are two half-crowns and two shillings, which have been prepared in the manner I have described. There are a great many more here. All the coin produced is composed of brass; the file has metal in the teeth of it, in which metal there appears to be silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WARNER. Q. How many shillings did you find in the bag? A. I never counted them; there were above two hundred. I have seen a bag of sparables and small pieces of sand-paper - this might be used for the purpose of friction; there are particles of metal among<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310029"/>them, which have been rubbed off by friction. The whole of the coin produced is counterfeit.</p>

               <p>WARNER's Defence. This woman was my hired servant - I gave her 2s. a week and her victuals; she had only been six days with me. I am a gardener and fruiterer, and hired her for the summer - I took this lodging, and had been there six days, and on the morning the officers came I cleared the top of the cupboard, and found a handkerchief and a bag, with a great deal of counterfeit coin in it; I asked the woman who it belonged to - she said she did not know; I said, "I shall call the landlady up, and ask who it does belong to;" she said, "Stop and get your breakfast first;" I did so, and the officers came - I never moved; they seized me by the hand - there were four or five half-crowns laid on the table. The officer touched the table-cloth with his coat, and the half-crown fell down.</p>
               <p>HARVEY's Defence. I was engaged by this man to do what he had to do, and work at my own business if I had any - I had some shoe-binding the day before; I saw him on that morning take the bag from the cupboard; I knew nothing of it - he said he would go and ask the landlady about it after breakfast; he took some of them out of the bag; the officer came in - my hands were dirty, as I had been lighting the fire, and the shoe-leather stains my fingers very much.</p>

On Friday, the 30th, we found the Matthew barge at Chertsey, laden with coals, covered with stones - I could see the coals when I looked at the surface - the stones did not entirely cover them, but nearly so - it was an open barge - the prisoners were on board - I asked if they had any certificate of the coals; they said they had got none; it is necessary to have a certificate, stating what quantity are in the barge - I asked Parker if he did not lay at Trig-stairs on the Tuesday night, the 27th - he said he did; Trig-wharf is in the City, between London and Blackfriars-bridges - I asked if he did not take the coals in on Tuesday night; he said he did - I asked whose barge he took them out of; he said Mr. Spedding's; he then stated that a gentlemanly looking lighterman spoke to him on the Coal Exchange on Monday, and asked if he would take a score of coals to Staines; he said, Yes; and the man said the barge should come over on the next day, but he did not come till night - that the lighterman came down in the barge and hailed Parker's folk, and went below the barge, made her fast, and then went on shore; that he saw nothing more of the lighterman; that he then dropped his own barge down along side of the lighterman's, then went, and got a man to assist him in heaving the coals out, and when the barge was empty the lighterman came and took her away; that he had never seen him before, and did not know him; I asked who he was going to take the coals there for; he said for a gentleman, named Davies, at Inglefield-green - Isbester took them into custody; I went with the barge, and delivered the stones to one Knight, at Staines, as Parker said they were for him; she was brought back to London with the coals, and on Monday they were put back into the Rose again; there were twenty-one chaldrons, as near as possible, and filled the Rose the same as before; they were very large Londonderry Wall's-end, and appeared to be the same coals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Parker want to go to Staines, saying the man, who employed him, would be there? A. No; he wanted to go there to deliver the stones; he did not say his employer would be there; I did not hear him say he wanted to go to Staines; I have been a lighterman thirteen or fourteen years; it is not regular to take coals on board without a certificate; we are bound to take one; I never let them go without, in our firm; we have sent coals into the craft, and sent the certificate afterwards; I cannot say what other people may do; I have known it done in other concerns; it is not regular.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you have known it done, has not the certificate followed? A. Yes; these coals have never been claimed by any body; the Rose belongs to Mr. Horne, his name is painted on it.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 30th of March I went with Scott to Chertsey, and found the Matthew there; the two prisoners were on board; Scott asked Parker if he had a certificate of the coals; he said, No - he was then asked if he did not lay at Trig-wharf on Tuesday night; he said, Yes, and that he took the coals in there on Tuesday night, and he believed they came from Spedding's; their wharf is on the Surry side of Westminster-bridge; he said he was on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310031"/>the Coal Exchange on Monday, when a gentlemanly looking lighterman came to him, and asked if he would take a load of coals to Staines; he said his barge laid at Trigstairs, and he should have the coals to-morrow; but instead of that the barge did not come till eight o'clock at night - that the lighterman, who fetched the barge, hailed Parker's folk, made his barge fast a little below, and went on shore; that he dropped his barge down along side, went on shore, and got a man to help him to turn the coals out of that barge into his own - that the lighterman then came and took the barge away, but he never saw him. I went to Inglefield-green, but could find no gentleman there of the name of Davies; there was a servant living in a gentleman's family there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sized place is the green? A. It is large; but I do not suppose there are a dozen gentlemen's houses. I inquired at the different public-houses, several people assured us no such person was living there - Knight expected the stones, but not by Parker; Parker did not ask us to let him go on to Staines - he never told us where Davies was to be found.</p>

            . I am inspecting surveyor of the Police ship. On the 30th of March the prisoners were brought in custody - I found a bill of lading for the stone on Parker, to go to Knight; and he had a receipt for a score of coals, which I returned to him; it came from Davey and Peggs - it was for a former voyage - it was money paid for coals; he gave me a similar account to what the other witness has stated; I could find no Davies at Inglefield; the coals were never claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He always persisted in the same story? A. Yes; handbills were posted from Vauxhall to Limehouse about the coals; I made sufficient inquiries to be satisfied that no Mr. Davies lived at Inglefield - it is a small village.</p>

            . I live in Trinity-lane, Queenhithe. On the 27th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Thames-street, and saw Parker; he said, "Jolly. I have got some coals to throw, if you will go and help;" he asked if I could get another man; I said, Yes - he said he would go and ask Bates (who is his fellow-servant) to help - I went on board, just below Trig-stairs - Parker's barge laid just below Trig-stairs; the barge, with the coals, was on the London side - Parker, I, and Bates, went into seperate rooms, and threw the coals on board Parker's barge; it was a very dark night - I remained on board till the coals were nearly all out - nobody came on board while I was there - I neither saw nor heard any body - I left about one o'clock, leaving the prisoners in the barge; Bates works on board Parker's barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Bates was brought there by accident, as you were? A. Yes, for all I know. I could see there were only three rooms to the barge.</p>

On the 27th of March, about half-past seven o'clock at night, Parker called to me out of his barge just below Trig-stairs, and asked me to lend him my boat, to go across the water - he said he wanted it to discharge two tarpaulins; he came and brought it back in about half an hour.</p>

On the 27th of March, in the evening, I was at Trig-wharf, with my barge - the Matthew laid alongside of me, inside, next to Trig-stairs - I was putting my things to rights on my timber about a quarter past seven o'clock, and saw Parker and another man go over the water; they returned about eight o'clock, and Parker dropped his barge down below another.

            . I sold no coals to Parker after January - he wanted to buy some on the 26th of March, but I refused to sell them.</p>
               <p>PARKER's Defence. I carry goods for hire. On the 26th of March, a person came up and asked if there was a Staines bargeman there; I said I was one - he said he had some coals to send to a gentleman named Davies, at Inglefield-green. I gave him my card, and asked for the order - he said there was no need of an order. I asked him on whose account they were; he said on account of Spedding, and he would bring them down to me. On Tuesday, after high water, he brought them to me - on Tuesday evening, a little below bridge, he hailed the barge - I answered him. I said it was rather late, and rather refused taking them in; he said, "Then somebody else must," for he wanted the barge. He went on shore, and I went for a man to help me to throw them out - the lighterman then came, and took the barge away; I asked for the certificate - he said it was sent down to Davies, of Inglefield-green. I went from thence to Limehouse, and took in the stones for Mr. Knight - I then went to Chertsey. I wanted the officer to let me go to Staines, but he said he could find an owner in London. If I had stolen them I could have claimed them by the bill and receipt in my pocket, as it was about the same quantity.</p>

            . I live in Bath-court, Islington. On Monday morning, the 30th of April, I saw John Broadway - he came through Islington church-yard; he had a little blood on the top of his head, and on Tuesday morning I applied something to his head, which was wounded, but nothing that I thought would be of consequence - there were three very small wounds - I could scarcely see them - he died on the Monday following. On Sunday, the 29th of April, he was in company with my husband and another young man, at our house. about a quarter-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner had come there at half-past two and left - he was always very affectionate to his brother; he came again about a quarter-past nine in the evening, the deceased was still there - the prisoner was then not altogether sober, nor was he drunk; his brother John was quite sober. He came a third time and they went away together; there had been a few words between the prisoner and my husband - the brothers went away together, apparently in good humour. John did not go to a regular surgeon until Saturday - I applied Dutch drops to his head; I saw him on Friday evening - he said,"I am very bad, God bless you, I shall not see you any more." The brothers always lived very affectionately together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROTCHE. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the prisoner, and the deceased together after the words? A. No; I have seen them at other times; the prisoner was remarkably attached to him, and would have died for him. I do not know why he came to my house the last time, unless he expected to see my youngest sister, who he was very much attached to - he was then so much in liquor he seemed not to know what he was about; he quarrelled with my husband - his brother did not interfere.</p>

            . I live in Brittania-row, Islington; the deceased was my son. On Sunday, the 29th April, when the prisoner was at supper, he said he would go and fetch John home - he went out for that purpose, but came back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310033"/>alone, and sat down; John came in a short time afterwards with a can in his hand, which he had some beer in - the prisoner was not affected with liquor in any way, though he was not sober. John threw the can down and struck William, who had not said a word to him; but John told him that he would do for him that night, he would know who was master. William then walked out of the house, down the yard, saying, "John, I will not fight nor quarrel with you." John immediately followed, and knocked him down with his fist; he got on him, and beat him when he was down - William said, "For God's sake, mother, call somebody to help, or I shall be murdered;" the watchman opened the door and came in, having heard him call out - the watchman took John off him - William then got a stick and struck at John over the watchman's head. I really do not know what stick it was - I had no rake, but whether he borrowed one I cannot say - he was gardening that morning: whatever it was, it lay on the spot - he did not go any where for it. I was so frightened, I cannot tell whether he hit John - the watchman took it from him, and threw it over the pales - John went out, and William came into the house - his face was bruised and bleeding; I put something to it - they slept together that night, and did not have a word afterwards. John only went next door, and came back almost directly. I do not know the cause of their quarrel, they were always particularly sociable.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. William bore all this before he cried out, and only took up this thing to defend himself? A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at half-past ten o'clock at night - I heard a scuffle in the yard, and the mother calling out; when I went in William was on the ground and John on the top of him, beating him over the eyes with his double fist - his face was very much swollen; I collared John, and pulled him off, and kept hold of him, expecting he would fly at him again; William jumped up immediately, and caught hold of a small garden-rake, which laid close to him, and struck John on the head; he did it all in a moment - I saw blood run down his face - I suppose the teeth of the rake made the wound; it was a small iron rake - I snatched it out of his hand, and threw it away. William was rather in a passion when he jumped up - John did not attempt to got to him again; I staid there about ten minutes - William went in doors quietly, and his mother dressed his eye. I have not seen the rake since - I begged of John to let me look at his head, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was John on the floor in the course of the scuffle? A. No. The rake must have been close by, for it was done instantly - it was small, and would feel like a stick in his hand. John was so violent that any one would have defended themselves against him; he said he would doctor the wounds himself, and went to the water and washed them - he went next door, and had half a pint of vinegar to wash them.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on Saturday, the 5th of May; I found him nearly insensible; there were three small wounds on his head, which might be produced by a garden-rake; he was bled, and the usual remedies applied, but he got gradually worse - it was too late to do him any good - he died on the Monday; I opened his head, and on turning back the scalp I found a great effusion of blood- the wounds had penetrated the scalp, and through the skull; one of the teeth of the rake had passed the dura mater - no doubt death was caused by those wounds; if medical and had been applied sooner it would have had no effect on the wounds - he might perhaps have lived a short time - there was a large quantity of pus formed on the dura mater.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it the extravasated blood which caused the pressure on the brain? A. There was no extravasated blood on the brain - it was an outward effusion - it is possible he might have been cured, but not very probable.</p>

            . I am a mariner, and was chief mate on board the Woodbridge - we sailed for Sierra Leone on the 8th of April, 1826, and returned on the 5th of November - there was a seaman named John McDonald on board - he shipped at Sierra Leone, not from this country - he died on the passage home - he had been about six weeks with us. He had fifty-seven Spanish dollars, 7s. 6d. in English money, and 81/2d. in copper, which he gave into my charge just before he died, and told me where to send it; when we arrived at Spithead Captain Lamb demanded it of me, to put with his wages, and I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you give the captain the direction which McDonald gave you? A. Yes; there was only one McDonald on board.</p>

            , and directed it to No. 19, Fore-street, Plymoth - I made a mistake, it should have been New-street. The prisoner Driscoll applied to me at my house, No. 26, Lower-John-street, Commercial-road, a few days before Christmas, to know what wages McDonald had due to him - I told him, and that there were also fifty-seven dollars, and that he had left a verbal will, that the dollars were to be given to his daughter - he said the daughter was gone to Ireland, that she was a natural child. I had told him I had written to her at Plymouth - he said he had married a sister of McDonald's, and had a will made by McDonald before he left England - I said if he would give me the daughter's address I would write to her, and if she consented, I would give the money to him or any body else, provided she went before a Magistrate, and swore she was a natural child, but I should not pay him or any body till I heard from the daughter - he said nothing about McDonald being in debt to him - I saw no more of him till early in February, when he said he had come after the money; I said I expected he was going to give me the daughter's address, or have written to her himself - he said he should not, that he had proved the will, and had the probate; that he was left executor to all McDonald's effects, and if I had paid the daughter, he should have arrested her, as McDonald owed him near six times the sum. I saw him again on the 17th of February, at Munnings', the owner, in Little Bell-alley, in the City; he then produced the probate of the will - Munnings said he had looked it over, and believed it to be correct - Driscol said it was the probate of John McDonald's will, and that he had a right to every thing he died possessed of - Munnings said it was extracted by Clarkson and Son, and he thought I should be justified in paying him the money; this was on Saturday; I said I would leave it with Munnings on Monday, and if he would call there on Tuesday morning he would pay him. I saw Munnings on Monday, and on Tuesday, the 21st of February, I paid Driscol myself 12l. 6s. 51/2d. sterling, at Baxendon and Co.'s, King's Arms-yard, Coleman-street; I found afterwards that the direction the mate had given me, was New-street, Plymouth, instead of Fore-street - I never saw Morgan till he was at the office; I received a note, but never talked with him about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a letter had come to you by post, signed Catherine McDonald, you would have paid Driscol the money? A. Yes, if she desired it - I have not seen any person purporting to be Catherine McDonald - McDonald came on board on the 24th of July, but he is dated a mouth back in the ship's articles - he would receive a mouth's wages more by that - the owners would have been informed of it - he shipped himself on those terms, on account of the lowness of the wages - I did not tell the owner of it on my arrival; I believe it came out by accident at the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You first found you had directed the letter wrong in February? A. Yes; when he said he had got a probate; he repeated that she was in Ireland, and was merely an adopted child.</p>

Driscol said it was all right and he would come again with the will; I then left the room; I saw Driscol afterwards, and he called me very unbecoming names; I said he should never draw it if was in my power to prevent him; he had only got part of the money then.</p>

Mrs. Hughes came to my lodgings in town, and just as she was going a way Driscol came - I told him to mind what he was about, for that woman charged him with forgery - he said, "It is all correct what I have done."</p>

To two or three; he at last took me to the Bull's Head public-house, in Bread-street, and said that was it, for he knew the pot-boy, by his having sore eyes; he told me all this of his own free-will; he was at liberty from the 22d of February to the 8th of March; at the second examination he said that every word he had stated was false, that was when the book was offered to him to be sworn - I did not hear him say he had stated it all out of malice: he was then made a prisoner of, instead of a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him to get somebody else to help him in swearing to the will? A. No - there is a man named Barry outside, I suppose you mean him - I asked him if he knew Driscol's hand-writing, but did not ask him to swear to it, or any thing to that effect, nor that I would get him well rewarded if he did - I asked Barry if he knew Driscol's hand-writing, and he pointed out one Mahoney, whom I summoned.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What Morgan said at the office was taken down in writing? A. Yes - he was not sworn at the first examination.</p>

            . I am a mariner, and live in Red Lion-street, Poplar. I know both the prisoners - I gave Morgan 15s., by order of a man named Driscol, but not the prisoner - I did not see the prisoner Driscol on the subject.</p>

               <p>DRISCOL'S Defence. All I have to say is, that the will is genuine.</p>
               <p>MORGAN's Defence. Driscol called on me at Mr. Hughes', and promised to pay me for the trouble of proving McDonald's will, as I had witnessed it. In consequence of a dispute I had with him, and to be revenged on him through spite and malice, I went and told him every thing that came into my head, thinking it would only get him into a little trouble - Wilson promised to get me 50l. and a free pardon, if I would prosecute, and if I would get another person to join me in evidence he would give him three or four sovereigns - I was requested to make oath of my first words, but could not, unless I perjured myself - merely to satisfy Wilson I went to show him where I said the will was made; on my saying I could not find it, he said, "Well, go and look for it, and if you don't, say any house you like;" it was made at a public-house at Poplar - Wilson always said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310036"/>he would be my friend, and I should get more money than I should by two voyages to the Indies.</p>

Not a single sentence of this is true, as it respects any promise or hope of reward held out by me - I never had any quarrel with Driscol - I should have stated, that in Morgan's presence, I asked Hughes if McDonald ever lodged with her, Morgan replied, "No, Mrs. Hughes nor any body else never knew such a man, till the arrival of the Woodbridge."</p>

            . I am a gold-refiner, and live in Cox's-court, Little Britain. The prisoner came to my house, in company with another man, whose name I do not know - I knew the prisoner before, he is a watch-gilder; he tendered me a bill of exchange, stating he would take 6 ozs. of gold out of the amount of it, if I approved of it; it was drawn by Weston and Son, on Messrs. Herries the bankers, in favour of John Barton, and not being indorsed by Barton, I said, "Who is John Barton, who should have indorsed it?" the prisoner replied, "This person with me is Mr. Barton;" and perceiving him to be a working man, I said, it was extraordinary, a person like him should be in possession of a bill of that amount; the prisoner replied, that Barton was to receive a legacy which Weston and Son had to pay, and they had given him this bill upon the banker for it, to turn into cash - I said Barton could have nothing to do with gold; he said, he had arranged with Barton respecting it, and he should use the gold in his business - Barton said nothing to this. Considering the bill not regular, it being drawn by the town house, on a town banker, which is unusual, I told Hilliard, his story appeared to be correct, and if he gave me time to ascertain that it was so, I should have no objection to take it; they then talked together, and asked if I would ascertain in half-an-hour, I said I might in the course of two hours; they promised to call in two hours, and left me the bill - I sent my clerk with it to Herries, and in two hours Hilliard returned without Barton, and asked if it was approved of - I had determined to have nothing to do with it, but told him it would do, provided he brought his friend Barton to endorse it - I did not communicate my suspicions to him; he went to fetch Barton, and returned in two hours, and said he was surprized he had not met him, as he had appointed, at the Ram at Smithfield - I said the bill would not be negotiable till he had indorsed it, and be must continue to search for him; he went to look for him again, thinking he had missed him - I heard no more that night, but next morning the prisoner's nephew came and said, he had called from his uncle, to know if Barton had been respecting the bill, and in case he called, not to pay him the proceeds, as he was afraid something was wrong - I found the prisoner in custody about an hour afterwards - I did not exactly know where he lived.</p>

On the 29th of June I was cash-keeper; he never paid me this money; here is his book in which he enters the cash he receives; he has entered 8l. received from Stevens on the 24th; he has only accounted for 8l. on the 24th; he left about the 14th of July, the very day we found this account.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Elmes present when he said he found them? A. Yes; I have eaten a good many almonds without master's leave - that is allowed, but we are not allowed to take any thing out - they are worth 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the sugar - I bought the almonds, in Botolph-lane, and found the lemon-peel.</p>

It is worth 5l.; the prisoner is a labourer, and lived in the neighbourhood - he worked for me eighteen months ago, and knew my premises.</p>

I put the mare into the field, by the farm-yard, at five o'clock, on Saturday, and fastened the gate in the usual way, with a peg; she was very good-natured - at nine next morning, I found the gate open and she was gone; she always laid in that field at night. I informed my master. I have seen her since - it is the same.</p>

            . I am supervisor of the watch, at Islington. On Sunday morning, the 6th of May, at a quarter-past four o'clock. I was in the Green-lanes, near Stoke Newington-turnpike, five or six miles from Mr. Heath's, and saw the prisoner riding this mare towards the turnpike - he got off, opened the toll-gate, and let himself through, and put it too again - I went up to him and asked where he was going with the horse, he said to Islington - I asked where he got it from - he said from Southgate. I took hold of him and said I suspected he had stolen it - he resisted and tried to get from me - our noise awoke the tollman, who opened the door and I forced him into the toll-house, handcuffed him and took him to the watch-house. I found a phosphorous box, matches, a piece of candle, and a piece of brown paper, two skeleton keys, and some money, in his pockets, and in his hat I found a pair of cassimere leggings for riding - a halter was round the mans's neck, also a bridle - it is the sort of halter which horses are generally caught with, and is a shew halter, with red tape to it, to make it appear as if the horse was for sale - he had spurs on. I secured the mare till Heath claimed it - Arnold also saw it.</p>
               <p>W. HEATH. Neither the halter nor bridle are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man in the road who gave me half-a-crown to take the mare to Islington.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the night of the 5th of May I was on duty near Kensington church; Young was on the opposite side of the way, and about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in company with another; it had then been day-light above an hour; they were coming towards Kensington, in a direction from Hammersmith - the two prisoners had nothing that I knew of at the time; the other man, who has escaped, was carrying a bundle under his left arm; they were all three in a line together, in conversation - I saw them a great distance before I came up to them; I did not know them before; when I saw them there was a watchman named Wilkinson on the side of them - I told him something; he is not here - I called to Young, with a low whistle, but before he came to me the prisoners and the other man came up to me; all three were together; the man who carried the bundle was on the left, Backstay in the middle, and Hayes outside - I saw them all three look down, as if they had done something - I collared the man who had the bundle, and said, "What have you got here?" I said this in the prisoners' hearing - I was answered by Haines, "Grub," which means victuals; the man said, "Bread and cheese;" I said, "That be d - d," and threw the bundle down on the ground - I felt what was in it - I immediately collared Backstay with my left hand, and the man who had the bundle with my right; the handkerchief came off that man's neck - I immediately laid hold of his coat; he got away, but before that Haines ran away; my partner and a watchman who is not here, ran after him, - I was left with Backstay, and the one who is absent - Backstay said, "What do you collar me for? I have got nothing;" he shook about a good deal, and up with his fist and struck me on my left side; he ran away, and made his escape - I turned round to see that he did not take the bundle which laid on the ground - I cried loudly for help - I turned my face to the man who had the bundle as quick as I could, to hold him, and thought I would draw my cutlass, but could not get it out, before I received a slap in the face; he knocked me down on the ground, then put his foot on my breast, and kept kicking me - I held his coat fight, till he slipped it off - I was then left with hat, handkerchief, dark lantern, and coat, and the bundle which contained Mr. Prince's property, all of which came from the man who escaped; my partner returned with Haines, who they had taken - I stood by while he was secured, and then went in search of the other two men, taking the bundle with me - I produced the same bundle afterwards before the Justice at Queen-square; it contained the same things - I am quite sure of both the prisoners' persons; they were full ten minutes in my presence during the scuffle; I saw Haines again the same night; he was taken and brought back - I saw Backstay again on the 14th; I have never had a doubt of his identity - I did not know the officer who apprehended him, and never saw him before in my life - I went in before the Magistrate and said, another man was taken; the officer came up, and said, "Is your name Warren?" I said Yes; he said, "Is this the man?" I said it was - I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The scuffle lasted altogether ten minutes? A. From the first of my seeing them, till they got away - it was after Haines got away, that the man who escaped, put his foot on my breast and treated me as I have described; I should think that lasted five or six minutes; Haines ran away almost directly - I looked at the two men who were loose from me; I never saw either of them before to my knowledge; I am a patrol on the Hammersmith-road - I saw them two miles and a half, or rather better, from Mr. Prince's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You state you were about six minutes on the ground, being kicked by the man who got away? A. Not kicked all that time - I was holding him and scuffling - Backstay had escaped about two minutes before that; he struck me the first blow, but did not knock me down - I was not on the ground six minutes, but was scuffling; I swear Backstay is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think you stated that the place you met them was in the direct road from Hammersmith to London? A. It was. I took Wilkinson to Queen-square, but he was not bound over.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Camden-hill, Kensington. On Sunday morning, the 6th of May, near four o'clock, I heard a watchman's rattle spring, and saw a man come running up the New-road, Camden-hill, towards me, in a direction from Kensington church, towards the Uxbridge-road - I saw a watchman and patrol in pursuit of him; there was nobody else near the place; the watchman sprung his rattle, and the patrol hallooed Stop thief! the prisoner Hames came up to me - I told him he must stop; I took him by the collar, and held him till Young, the patrol, came up - I delivered him to him; the spot where something has been found, was pointed out to me, by two boys, Boult and Leeson, about a week after; I took him about forty yards farther, but he would have passed that spot, and I saw him make a stop - it was some time before I heard of any thing having been found; I then got them, and they both pointed out the spot to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose they are here? A. Yes - I think it was a full week afterwards that they pointed it out; it was in the exact road the prisoner had run - it is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310042"/>foot-path leading from Kensington-road to Uxbridge-road; it is a public-road.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Sunday morning, the 6th of May, I was in Kensington, and heard a whistle from Warren, which first called my attention - I turned round, and saw three men coming in a direction from Hammersmith, towards London; one of the three had a bundle on his left arm - I have heard part of Warren's evidence - I came up, and saw him collar two of them, which was the one who had the bundle, and the other was Backstay; I am quite sure of his person; my attention was particularly attracted to him; when I came up I looked him in the face some time - he stood nearest to me - the third man, which was Haines, ran away; I followed him - he ran towards Hammersmith, and turned up a lane called Camden-hill, and about twenty or thirty yards after he entered the lane he made a stop - I observed him put his hand under his coat, as though he was feeling for something - he started and ran again; I saw Hall, the watchman, coming down the lane, and called to him to stop him - he did so; when I came up he gave him up to me; I took him back to the place where I had left Warren, and found the two prisoners, whom I had left him with had escaped. I then handcuffed Haines; I had not lost sight of him at all, and am sure he is the man - nobody was running before me, in the same direction; the other watchman followed me in the pursuit; Boult and another boy pointed out a spot to me - it is the same spot as where Haines stopped and did something under his clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you did not lose sight of Haines till he was taken; how was it that you before said your attention was principally directed to Backstay? A. After he ran away, I said I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long were you with Backstay? A. I might be looking at him for about a minute and a half or so; I saw him again on the 17th of May.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw him on the 17th of May, or to this moment, had you any doubt of his identity? A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOULT. I live at Thornton-street, Kensington. On Tuesday, the 8th of May, I was on Camden-hill with Leeson, and found a crow-bar, and Leeson found a cornelian stone - we found them both in the ditch, by mere accident; I gave them to Warren afterwards; we were playing, lost our ball, and went into the ditch to look for it; I pointed out the place to Hall first, and then to Young; it was about a day or two after, I cannot exactly say; I showed them the very same place, as near as I can tell - it might differ a yard or a foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this a public place? A. No, Sir; it is a footpath, but no thoroughfare for carriages; a good many people may pass there - it leads to Camden-hill, from the New-road - it is a short cut- I did not put any mark on the spot, but knew it by the stump of a tree; it was about a yard from the stump.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the place much frequented, compared to the many people who go on the highway? A. Very few people go that way.</p>

            . I live at Thornton-mews, Kensington. I was at play with Boult on the 8th of May, in the fields adjoining the New-road, Kensington. Boult found a crow-bar, and I found a cornelian stone in the lane, in a ditch, by the footpath - Boult pointed the place out aftwerwards. I was not present then; he went with me, and pointed it out to Hall, the watchman; we showed him the place as near as we could judge; it was within three or four feet of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you make a mark on the spot? A. No - it was guess work; I pointed it out to Hall the same afternoon, and so did Boult.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why, you was not with him? A. Yes, when he pointed it out to Hall - it was the same afternoon as we found the things.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was not two or three days after? A. No; I am not quite certain that it was the same afternoon, but think so - I think I pointed it out on the Saturday too, we pointed it out to Hall twice; he was at work on the road on Saturday, and we were there; it was on Tuesday we found the things, and I am not certain whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday that we pointed it out to him first; I showed it him again about three days after - it is a public thoroughfare for foot-passengers - a great many people come down that way from Kensington gravel-pits, but not so many as go along the carriage-road.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure you pointed out the same place to Hall? A. Yes; There is a bit of wood put up there to keep the bank up, close to where the crow-bar was, and some lilac there.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL here stated he had received information that Warren, the officer, had been talking with the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any body been speaking to you about any thing? A. An elderly man asked me if I picked up any thing; he said nothing about what I was to say.</p>

            . I am married, and live at No. 10, Little Falcon-court, Borough - I go out to washing and charing - Backstay lodged with me for seven months; I recollect Saturday, the 5th of May - he lodged with me then - he came home on that Saturday, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, and went to bed at a quarter-past twelve - he supped at home - it is my custom to take away his candle - I did so that night, at one o'clock - he was then in bed - I sat up that night to finish my ironing, till about twenty minutes past four in the morning - he could not have gone out without coming through my apartment - he never went out till I called him up in the morning at half-past eight o'clock - he was in bed when I called him - he was very well in health; he breakfasted and dined at my house, and went out at nine in the evening - he did not go out before, because it rained, or he was going to his father's; he was very regular in his habits, and never out after ten o'clock - he often went to his father's, sometimes for three days at a stretch, when he had no work; he did not go to see his father that night because it rained so hard - he was only out from nine to ten - he bore a very honest character, and worked hard.</p>
               <p>Q. What impresses it on your mind that it was the 5th of May that he came home before twelve o'clock? A. Why, I left him to keep my place while I went home with my work, which I frequently did - I have no other reason for remembering it, only he came home late; I asked where he had been; he said he had just left a friend twenty minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for knowing it was the 5th of May? A. I read in the newspaper, when I had it with a pint of beer, what a burglary had been done on the 6th, and I was certain the young man was at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you read it in the paper? A. On the Wednesday; I have said all I know, and can say no more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at that person (Warren), and tell me if you ever saw him before? A. No, sir, I do not know that I ever saw him in my life, till I saw him here - I swear I never spoke to him - I know Grossmith by seeing him about, but he never had me in any trouble; Falcon-court is close to what is called the Mint, but it is not in it. My husband's name is Samuel - he lives with me, and was at home on this night in bed and asleep by ten o'clock; he slept in the same room as the prisoner, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the 5th of May particularly well? A. I do not remember it particularly, no more than when Grossmith and them came - I do not remember any thing more; I did not read any thing about Backstay in the papers - I read that a burglary had been done.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but you said you recollected Backstay was at home on that day? A. No, nothing particular about that day - I heard him say his father lived at Greenwich - I was never at the house - I cannot say where he was on the following Saturday - I know he was at home at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was the Saturday following? A. I do not pay attention to the day of the month - I know it is June, but cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear where he was on Saturday, the 12th? A. No, I cannot indeed - I will not swear he was at home at ten o'clock - he was not at home all - I thought he was gone to his parents - I did not know he was going - he was not at home on the Friday - I do not think he was at home on Thursday - he left me on Wednesday I think; it was Wednesday evening when I came home from work, that I read the paper - he went away that day - I had been out to work at five o'clock that morning, and did not see him after that - Grossmith only called at my house once - he did not inquire about Backstay - he said nothing - he walked in and walked out - that was on Thursday; I have another lodger, who has been ten years with me, and an old gentleman - nobody else, except my family - I left my husband at home this morning - he is very well - there is nobody here but me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard of Backstay being in custody, did you go to Queen-square? A. I was sent for and went. but was not called upon - some young man came, and said Backstay wanted me; I do not recollect when that was - I did not want to go - I am no relation of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, recollect what you are saying; on your oath, did you or not, when at Queen-square Office, talk to Warren? A. No, I do not know that I spoke to him, on my oath, if I was to die this minute, I do not know that I ever saw the man before to-day with my eyes. I will not swear that I did not talk to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you was Backstay's mother? A. No, I never did; I never owned that I was Backstay's mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You never owned it; is it true then? A. No; my name is Walter; I am sure I did not say so - his mother was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him if he was a father himself; if he was a parent of children? A. No, I did not - I never said such a word, I will take my oath; nor did I say, "If you are a father, be lenient with this young man;" or any thing of the sort - I never spoke to him; he said the other day, "D - n the woman, what business has she here at all?" he said that outside the door several times - a great many people outside heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire Warren to be as lenient as possible, because Backstay had been led away by bad people? A. No, I did not; I never said I was his mother, nor any thing to that effect - I had two young women and a young man with me - one of them was his fellow-servant; they are not here; I was not at Queen-square above five minutes, and came away directly when I saw him handcuffed; I was not near the place; I did not go inside no further than the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the officer, or any one there, that you knew he could not he guilty of any such thing, for he was at home at your house all night? A. No. I never said such a word - if Warren will take his oath that way, it is very false - it is a pity he should have his way just as he likes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310044"/>JOHN WARREN. On the 21st of May, when Backstay was under examination at Queen-square, I saw Mrs. Walter there, in the yard - Backstay was in the strong-room; she asked if I was a father, and if I would he lenient to Backstay, for he had been led away by bad company; and in answer to a question of mine, she said she was his mother - a young woman was with her, in a black beaver bonnet; she was quite a girl, not old enough to pass as Backstay's mother - I am sure Walter is the woman who said this to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was this in the yard of Queen-square Office? A. It was; it is a large yard - I saw only four persons besides themselves, and a boy there - she came aside to me, and dropped a curtsey when she spoke - I never saw her before - I had a red waistcoat on; I suppose she knew me by that - I was coming out of the gate - she said, "Are you the officer who apprehended Benjamin Backstay?" I said, "No, but I am the officer that lost him; I can swear to him" - she said, "I suppose you have got children of your own;" I said, "I have; are you his mother?" she said, "Yes I am, be as easy as you can, for he has been led away by bad company." I walked away, and left her - I had only one conversation with her; as I came out of the office into the yard, she met me full butt, and curtsied; there was only a girl with her, a boy, two soldiers, and another in the yard; that young woman has been here all the Session; I believe she is a witness for the prisoners - nobody is here to support my evidence.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did either the boy, the soldiers, or the other person hear a word of the conversation? A. No; nor did the young girl.</p>

               <p>Before Mr. Recorder.</p>
               <p>1081. REBECCA SMITH was indicted for stealing, on the 26th of May, 2 fur tippets, value 4l., the goods of James Salthouse, in his dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WILLS. I am shopman to James Salthouse, a linen-draper, of Goswell-road, On the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for Mr. Salthouse - she was informed he was expected in, in half an hour; she went away, and returned in half an hour - I said he had not returned, and asked if she would leave any message for him - she said she supposed I could do as well - that she wanted to select half a dozen fur tippets. She looked at some and came again about twelve - o'clock; she had then selected half a dozen, which I told her the price of; she said she would go and fetch the money - and as she left one of the shopmen came round and asked if I knew what tippets I had on the counter - I counted them, and found one of a particular sort wanting - which I am certain was in the shop when she was there - I went out, and in about a quarter of an hour found her at Northampton-square, and desired her to walk back - she said she would, and did so. I told her I pretty well knew what she had got about her - she said she had no doubt but I did - and begged me to let her go; when she got to the shop she delivered up two tippets which had been shown to her - they might cost about 3l. 10s. I am certain I saw them both when she was with me the last time. I did not know her before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you saw both when she was there, how is it you only missed one? A. I only counted one sort, and missing one, I went after her directly. I counted them all after she left in the morning.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Marsh. On the 14th of February I looked the prisoner out a certain quantity of goods, which I entered on a slate - when he comes home at night I always rub it off the slate, and enter what is deficient in the book. I cannot tell how many I delivered him, but he was deficient twelve dozen. I am sure I delivered him that number, or more, that morning - he was to take them round to the customers and account for what were deficient: the entry remained on the slate when he came back, which was between three and four o'clock. I entered from his own book into our day-book, (which is here) - the number deficient - I find I have entered to that date, from his book,"3 dozens to W. Salthouse, 3 dozens to Brown and Son, 6 dozens to Venable's" - we have inquired of those parties, they are not here - but we have found the goods in pawn; he went out on the morning of the 11th, and never returned - this was discovered afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know how many you gave him out? A. No; I only know how many were deficient - I will swear he was twelve dozen deficient - I always see that his book corresponds before I clear off the slate - they are ladies' gloves, which we call habits in the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. MARCH. The prisoner went out one morning with goods and never returned - he had given me no notice whatever - I agreed to give him at the rate of 80l. a-year, for the first three months; a small sum was due to him when he left - he made no application for it. I got information and went to his lodgings in the Lambeth-road, with an officer - and while we were in the house he escaped out of the back window - we found some duplicates in the pocket of a waistcoat which I had seen him wear - twelve dozen of habits were afterwards produced, which have my private mark on them - I never sold them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you were told he lodged there? A. Yes; I have heard he was once in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310045"/>business for himself - there was no dispute about his salary, for I took him from a place of custody, and he was thankful for the situation - his success did not depend on his making a number of sales.

On Sunday evening, the 22d of April, at eleven o'clock, I was going home, and found the door ajar; my friend Collins was with me - I had been absent since 7 o'clock in the morning. I pushed the door open. I sent a boy for a watchman, and two came (my father lives in Drury-lane - I live in this house for him); the watchmen, I, and Collins searched the house - we found nobody in it; I missed a great quantity of snuff-boxes out of the window of the shop, which were there when I left the house in the morning; I had left a boy to lock the door, but do not know whether he did it. I missed other snuff-boxes from shelves behind the counter - I missed more than two hundred in all; I have since seen seven or eight of them at Mary-le-bone Office, when the prisoner was in custody - this was within a week after, I think. I am certain of part of the boxes being my father's and brother's; the value of all I missed is about 60l. I did not see the prisoner near the premises - he is quite a stranger.</p>

Yes, for my father, who lives at No 141, Drury-lane; he never sleeps at Fleet-street, but in Drury-lane; it is his own house; my father very seldom takes his meals in the house; the business is carried on there for him; I do not pay the rates - I believe my brother does.</p>
               <p>JOHN MICKLAM. I am in partnership with my son, William Plucknett Micklam; the rent of this house is paid out of the partnership funds - my son Thomas lives there, by our permission - we sell snuff-boxes and other things. I saw the house on the Saturday - the stock was all safe then. On Sunday night I had information of this robbery - I did not go there that night, but went on Monday - about sixty doxens of Scotch snuff-boxes were missing, which are worth above 100l., near 120l. I knew nothing of the prisoner till he was before the Magistrate - some boxes were produced before the Magistrate; I can swear to two or three being part of my stock, which was safe on Saturday night - the house is in the parish of St. Dunstan in the West.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any second Christian name? A. No. I sleep at my house in Drury-lane, not in Fleet-street; my son Thomas lives in Fleet-street; I have marks on the boxes, by which I know them; they are not private shop marks, but some of them have marks by which I know them; I think I swore to two at the office; I and my son who is in partnership with me pay the rent and taxes of the house in Fleet-street - we pay every thing belonging to the house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Baylis, a pawnbroker, of No. 35, Upper Mary-le-bone-street. On Wednesday, the 25th of April, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at my employer's shop - he came to pledge six snuff-boxes, and wanted 25s. on them; I asked if they were his own - he said they were not - that he had had them on commission for sale, from a friend of his in Scotland - they are Scotch boxes. I told him I had information of such boxes being stolen, and must detain him - he said he hoped I should not, and entreated me to let him go, and said if I would allow him to go he would send the person who sent him; I said I could not, and detained him till an officer came and took him into custody; I gave the boxes to the officer - I attended at the office, and Mr. Micklam identified three of them, I believe.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 25th of April I was sent for to Baylis', and found the prisoner there; I took him in charge. The boxes were delivered to me - I have kept them ever since, and produce them; the prisoner was locked up in the parlour till I came to take him - I searched him, but found nothing particular on him; I asked where he came from - he said he did not wish to tell me, he did not wish to disgrace his friends; I asked where he got the boxes from - he said they were given to him by a man at the corner of Well-street, to pledge - he did not say who the man was, nor his name, nor say where I could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean Well-street, Oxford-road? A. Yes. Mr. Micklam claimed some of the boxes. The prisoner had a child in his arms at the time, about two years old; the Magistrate wished him to give up where he lived, that the child should not be locked up - he then told the Magistrate that if it was taken to No. 19, Queen-street, Golden-square, somebody would take care of it; I took the child there by his direction - I afterwards went to No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310047"/>4, Whitcomb-court, Oxendon-street, Haymarket - I saw the prisoner's wife there.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say she was his wife? A. I never saw the prisoner and her together, or heard them acknowledge each other as man and wife. On searching the first floor front room in that house, in a cupboard, I found three snuff-boxes, which were claimed by Mr. Micklam, besides what the pawnbroker delivered to me. On searching in the wash-hand-stand drawer I found four keys - I cannot say that they were ever in the possession of the prisoner - he has not claimed any thing in that house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On what day was this? A. On Wednesday, the 25th, three days after the robbery; I never saw the prisoner in Whitcomb-court.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. When the prisoner was brought to the office he told me to take the child to No. 19, Queen-street, Golden-square, and to say it came from Charles Green; I took the child there, but did not deliver that message; from what I was told there I took the child to another house, nearly opposite in the same street, and from what I heard there I took it to No. 4, Whitcomb-court, Oxendon-street; I went there with another man, and delivered the child to a female there, in the first floor front room; I never saw her and the prisoner together - I searched that room, and in some of the boxes there I first found a small bunch of keys, four of which are skeleton, and under the bed I found this basket, containing three dark-lanterns, a small crow-bar, a chisel, and one or two odd keys, and under the same bed I found another box, containing forty-one skeleton-keys; I then searched the cupboard in the same room, and found a box, containing a number of skeleton-keys, and a bag containing twelve skeleton-keys and several others; I then found a pocketbook with some memorandoms and certificate of a marriage; I saw Gibbs find in a cupboard three snuff-boxes, which the prosecutors claim; the prisoner said nothing about them - I found nothing else. I brought the female in custody to the office with the child which the prisoner had delivered to me; I cannot be certain whether what the prisoner said was taken down in writing; the clerk was writing there the whole of the time; the prisoner spoke to that woman and to the child; he was prevented by the Magistrate from having any conversation with her till the examination was gone through, and the gaoler stood between him and the woman to part them; they spoke to each other before the examination began; he was going to say something to her, and the Magistrate ordered the gaoler to stand between them; I did not hear what he said - he whispered to her, and addressed the child; I do not know whether they talked together afterwards - the woman then gave her name Maria Clements; after the examination was taken, I produced the certificate of the marriage which I found in the pocket-book; the Magistrate asked him whose certificate it was - I cannot say whether what he said was taken down.</p>
               <p>The Court here referred to the examinations returned from the Magistrate, and they contained no statement made by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Magistrate ask the prisoner? A. Whether the certificate was his - he said, "Yes, it is, and this is my wife," meaning the woman who gave her name as Clements; the Magistrate asked him if the name, Henry George Clements, in the certificate was his - he said it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The only house the prisoner desired you to take the child to was No. 19, Queen-street, Golden-square? A. It was; I never saw him in any of the houses I have mentioned, not to my knowledge; I never saw him at Whitcomb-court; I did not search No. 19, Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that the child was in the office at all during the time of his examination? A. I will not swear to its being there all the time - it was there part of the time; it might be outside the office part of the time; I swear positively, to the best of my belief, that it was in the office part of the time; I will swear it was in the office during part of the examination.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Whitcomb-court, and rent the house; I took it on the 5th of April - there is only one room on a floor. I let the prisoner the first floor room, and the second floor to two young men; the prisoner lived there, with his wife and one child; I saw him at the office on the Monday after he was taken, but did not see his wife there - he went by the name of Clements, and she was called Mrs. Clements.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday that the prisoner was taken up, did his wife and child live in that room? A. Yes; I knew nothing of the officer's having been till the Friday following, when they came for me to attend at the office - I do not know where Mrs. Clements and the child live now, but believe some where about Queen-street, Golden-square - she gave me a week's notice to leave on the day after the prisoner was taken, but she did not stop all the week; the things were moved away on the Saturday following, when they paid the week's rent - the prisoner and her lived together in my house as man and wife for ten days, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at home from Wednesday night till Friday? A. I cannot say; I had not heard of the officers searching the house till they came on Friday; I sleep at home every night, and go out in the day-time when I have no work - I have a wife and four children; I did not hear of the officer's searching the house till they told me so on Friday; it was never searched before to my knowledge; I was at home all day when I had work - whether I had work on Thursday I do not know; my door is generally shut; it can be opened by litting a latch; it is often open in the day time; I have no servant; I saw the prisoner's wife on Thursday morning after breakfast; she knocked at the room door, and gave warning; I did not hear from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310048"/>her that the officers had been and searched - we had agreed for a week's warning; there are only three rooms in the house; I was at home on Wednesday and at work, I dare say - I did not hear of the officers being in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If they had made a noise, should you have heard them? A. Certainly; or if they had knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to H. STOWELL. Q. Did another officer go with you to the house? A. He did; a man took us to the house - he opened the door, and walked up-stairs; we walked up after him very softly - there were three of us; we might be there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I will not swear to five minutes, but think it was about twenty minutes; we went into no other room; I did not see Ware or any of the family.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to P. WARE. Q. Did the prisoner or the woman take the lodging? A. His wife took it of my wife - I was not present; he paid his first week's rent himself to my wife - they lived together then as man and wife till he was taken up, and treated the child as theirs - nobody else lived in that room.</p>
               <p>J. MICKLAM. (Examining the boxes produced by Chapman). Here is one box, which I can swear to by a stroke over the head of the figure on it, and another stroke besides - here is another I can swear to by a mark close to the shoulder of the dog, and a scratch inside; here is another I know by a spot on it; I only know these three - I lost a great many different sorts of boxes (looking at the three found at the prisoner's lodging). I can speak to one of these by the gas having fallen on it, and spotted the varnish in different parts - I only know one of these, and the three produced by the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You talk of a mark on the head, where is it? A. Just over the head of the fox; it is an old shopkeeper; I have had it four years, and seen it much too often. I have seen the mark a great many times; I have had the one with the spot on it some years most likely; I may have seven hundred boxes in my house, but not fifty of this description now, for they are taken - this one I can tell by one mark outside and two inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the office, on examining the boxes, that you could be more positive about them if another had been found? A. I do not believe that I did, but will not swear I did not; I have been thirty-five years in the trade - there may be fifty thousand Scotch boxes is London.(here the witness pointed out several marks by which he identified the boxes.)</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a private shop mark on any of them? A. No; I speak to three; there may be many thousands of the same description; here is one which has a mark of my own making, though not a private mark - I made a mark with a penknife on the one with the dog, before it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did this with a penknife? A. No, I will not swear what it was done with, but I recollect making the mark; I thought I did it with a penknife, and I do not now say that it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at the office that you was sorry another box was not found, as you should then be more certain? A. I do not recollect it, but will not swear one way or the other; my brother formerly slept in the house, but has not done so for six months or more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to say that the boxes are my own; they were sent to me for sale on commission by a friend in Scotland - as to the keys I was not at home when they were left at my house, which was the day before, as my wife stated at the office.</p>

            . I work for Wm. Honeywill, of Berner-street, Oxford-street. On the 18th of April, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming out of the counting-house, with this box-coat under his arm - he was quite a stranger; as soon as he saw me he threw it down.

On Thursday morning, the 10th of May, at half-past six o'clock, I missed six sheep, which I had seen between five and six o'clock the evening before - they were in some fields which I rent, in the parish of Cranford, in Middlesex. I had one hundred and fifty-six sheep all safe there the night before; they were in different lots - the six missing were, four of one sort, and one of each of another sort; they were four ewes, a Lancashire, and a South-down. On the 17th of May I saw the whole six again, at Westall's livery stables, Curtain-road; Garton and Armstrong, the officers, showed them to me, and I claimed them. I had one hundred and fifty left. I could not find any where that they could have crept out - but I saw the marks where a cart had been backed up, close to the paling, and a piece of the paling was broken off. I examined the sheep in the Curtain-road, and am quite certain they are the same - they are store sheep, and worth about 9l.; I saw the prisoner at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a field were they in? A. A pasture field - there are three fields, which open by gates, for them to run into; they are parted from the road by hedges, gates, and palings - two of the fields join the high road - the bedges were very close; a hare could not get through. I counted the sheep at night myself; they were alive when I found them - my father is living, and he is the same name as my own, One ewe had two brand marks. I know them by their description and species - there was none like them in any of the adjoining parishes.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at No. 45, Turk-street, Bethnal-green. On the 10th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house; I did not know him before; he said Mr. Green had recommended him to me; he wanted me to kill half a dozen sheep for him; I knew there was one Green, a cow-keeper; I said I would go and look at them first - he said they were at the back of Bethnal-green church, near Hare-street-fields, and that he had bought them of his brother, at Beaconsfield; I went with him to see them, and found them in a yard of a house in Hare-street-fields - I looked at them, and asked what he gave for them - he said 1l. 8s. each; they were worth that - I said they were not fit to kill, they were not fat enough, but I would kill them - he said he thought they were fat enough for the neighbourhood; I was to kill six, and take five of them to market for him - we went and had some porter together; I did not kill them - I was to go again the same night, but did not - I saw Armstrong, the officer, on Friday, and told him, and on that night I went to the prisoner again - he and Green, and another person or two, were waiting in this yard for me to come and kill them; I had not been there two minutes before Armstrong came in, and asked me, in his presence, whose sheep they were; I said "They are mine, I am going to kill them;" Armstrong said, "Where did you get them from?" I said, "You must ask that man that question, I have got them to kill;" he asked the prisoner, who told him he bought them of Mr. Reeves, of Woburn, in Buckinghamshire; Armstrong secured him; I assisted in driving the sheep to Westall's stables, in the Curtain-road, near the office, and on the 17th I saw the same six sheep delivered to the prosecutor, at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep a butcher's shop? A.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. Butt came to me on the 11th of May, and in consequence of his information, I went with Attfield, another officer, to a house in Hare-street-fields that night - I found Butt, the prisoner, and Green, in a back yard of a house, with these six sheep - Butt had hold of them - I asked him whose sheep they were; the prisoner heard that - Butt said "They are mine, I am going to kill them;" I asked who he was going to kill them for, and he pointed to the prisoner; I asked the prisoner how he came by them; he said he bought them of a man named Reeves, of Woburn, in Buckinghamshire, and paid 28s., a-head; I asked if he had a receipt for the money - he said Yes, but his wife had got it; I took him to the office - I let the sheep remain a day or two with Green, as I knew him - he works at the gas-works opposite; the officer and he then drove them to Westall's livery-stables, Curtain-road; I delivered them over to Green; I can identify one of them, which is here.</p>

            . I am drover to Mr. Rogers, and saw the sheep three or four times a week; I took the hundred and fifty sheep to market on Wednesday; I do not exactly know how many I took, but am sure these six were among them; I saw them again on the 18th at the stables; Mr. Rogers showed them to me; I knew them all again; they are part of the sheep which I took to market on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Butt swore before the Magistrate that I had these sheep shut up in the house, and that he was to kill them, and take five to market; that is not what I said; I told him to inquire if the market was up, and let me know, and as he did not come on Thursday evening, I thought the market was not up; my brother-in-law's name is Reeves; he lives at Woburn, near Beaconsfield; I had taken their shop to open as a butcher's; I had saved a little money while working with Mr. Arnold, and took this shop and parlour of Green; it was not ready to be opened, but Green persuaded me to open it on the 9th; I set off on Sunday to go to buy some sheep of my brother, who is a dealer; I got into conversation with a man on the road, near Southall; he said he had some sheep to sell, and could suit me without going so many miles; he said if I would go to a public-house at Hayes, he had some sheep; I went, and stopped till nine o'clock; it was quite dark, and I did not know the road before; he took me to a field where he had some sheep, which he said were his own; he had six in a fold in the corner, which he wanted to sell for 30s. a head; I gave him 28s. a-head, and brought them home; I had plenty of time to have put them out of the way if I had known they had been stolen, but I drove them home through the open street, and kept them from Thursday till Friday without altering any marks; I entirely depend on Divine assistance to instruct me in the way to go on; I have been teacher in a Sabbath-school, where I lived in great joy and peace; but I have lately failed in business, and have not attended a place of worship as I ought to have, and through backsliding from the Almighty I have been suffered to fall. Butt has done this more to injure Green than me; the man I had the sheep of said if I was asked who I had the sheep of, I need not tell; I told Armstrong, on the second examination, how I had been led away; I did not know they were stolen; these things are facts; my friends are twenty-eight miles from town.</p>

I am the prosecutrix's son-in-law, and slept with her on this night; I awoke when my mother was coming to bed, and saw the prisoner with my mother's pockets in her hand; I had been in bed about two hours; she asked my mother where she should lay them; my mother said at the bed head, and I saw her lay them there in about two minutes; I saw her rather rumpling about them; she went up to bed. On the Sunday, about nine o'clock, she went out, and about eleven or twelve my mother sent me to Mrs. Davidson's - I returned, and saw the prisoner, and said, "You have not been to Mrs. Davidson's;" she said she had - I said she had not; she said I was a liar. I said the things in the bundle she had bought with my mother's money, and that Mrs. Davidson had not moved; she said she had. We set out to go to King-street - she wanted to go to the smack, but I would not let her. I went to No. 23, King-street, where she said Davidson had moved to, but could not find her - I then called the prisoner a thief, and said she had stolen my mother's money; she told me to hold my tongue, and asked my mother into a public-house, and she would tell her all about it; she told my mother to give me a penny to get some cakes - I went out, but stood by the door, and heard her say the servant had given her 2l. of the money, which she bought the things in the band-box with; my mother called in the landlord; I said I dared to say there were more things at the smack; she went to the door, to prevent my going out - I got out of the window, went to the smack, and got a trunk full of clothes, a piece of linen, and a shawl; I showed them to the prisoner - the officer asked if she had the key of the box - she produced it, and he opened it, in her presence; there was some linen, a new hat, and other things in it. I had been on board the smack before with the prisoner. There were two sovereigns, 7s. 6d., and 7d. in copper in the box.</p>

Wallace delivered a box to me, which I took to the prisoner, whom I had left in custody in Maidenhead-court, and asked if it was hers - she said it was, and gave me the key from her pocket; I opened it, and found two sovereigns, 7s. 6d., 7d. in copper, and a quantity of linen-drapery; I left Cromarly to examine it - she had a hand-box in her hand, with a Leghorn bonnet, six yards of cotton, and a new gown - she said Taylor had bought it her, and if I could find Taylor I should find eight sovereigns about her, as she had given her two - she was dressed in a Scotch cloak- I do not think it was a new one.

            . I have been more than eight years in Mrs. Ayer's service. On the night in question I took the prisoner's child up to bed, as she complained she was so much in liquor, she could not carry it - she was in mistress' bed-room when I went in, and when I came back she was sitting by mistress' bed-side; mistress called me down to look for the tinder-box, and I went up-stairs directly. I slept with the prisoner - I went up to bed in ten minutes; she had then undressed her child, but laid on the bed, pretending to be tipsy; I undressed her, and when I got her into bed I pulled down the quilt, and found a sovereign and a dice on it; I laid them on the mantel-piece, and in the morning, when I got up, I found a Duke of York's medal on the floor; I took them all down to mistress before she got out of bed; my mistress afterwards asked her if she had got the 10l. note, and said if she would give it her she would forgive her - she at last laid all the blame on me. I never had a farthing of the money, or ever gave her a farthing in my life. I never bought her any thing.</p>

On Sunday, the 28th of April, she gave notice to leave - she assigned no reason, but wished to go in a fortnight or less, if convenient - the next evening, in consequence of suspicion, I fetched Drummond, the beadle. I called her up, and told her I suspected she was dishonest, and wished to see her boxes; she expressed her surprise, but consented immediately. She went up stairs with us; Drummond unlocked her box with the key which he got from her, and found in it a new beaver bonnel, and a basket, with a quantity of new satin ribbon in it. I asked her who they belonged to, she said to me, she had taken this bonnet out of the shop, and cut the ribbon off a whole piece. I am a batter and tailor; the hat has my private mark in the lining, and is worth about 7s.; the property altogether is worth about 40s. or under; she showed great contrition and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She bore a good character? A. Yes; and expressed all the sorrow she could - she is an orphan.</p>

Cole, the next door neighbour, came out, and gave me my key - I unlocked the door and went in, without shutting it after me; my son-in-law came in, in two or three minutes - and while talking to him I heard a noise at the up-stairs window; I immediately ran out, and saw a person struggling with Mr. Carter, he got from him - Carter immediately called Stop thief! and my son stopped the man, who was the prisoner, - I never lost sight of him; we secured him. I immediately said "I will go up stairs to see if any body else is there," and at that instant a person rushed down-stairs, ran out and got away; my wife went up-stairs. I followed her, and we missed some property.</p>

               <p>FRANCES TOKELY. I am shopwoman to Mr. Orme. On the 31st of May the prisoner came into the shop, and asked if we sold white Persian - she bought a quarter of a yard, and gave me half-a-crown - I had to go the top of the shop for change,leaving her alone - when I returned Arith gave me information - she asked for something else - I placed myself behind her, and she appeared much confused - she was tying up her change, and I heard the end of the roll knock against the counter - she had gone about a yard and a half from the counter - I said, "You have a piece of silk under your shawl;" she produced it from under her shawl, and said she was going to look at it - I had seen it safe at twelve o'clock, wrapped in paper, and it had not been unfolded at all - she was given in charge, and I delivered the silk to Mr. Orme.</p>

On the 31st of May, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Inner Temple-lane, and saw two men dressed in dark clothes, trying to put a key into the lock of this shop-door; I watched them under an archway for about five minutes - they continued at the door; then Sangster came up and stood for about five minutes before the one who was at the door; I called the watchman - we stood under the archway - I then went up Hare-court, came up and saw four at the door; Knight was the fourth; I went and told Mr. Slann; I believe the key was put into the door before I saw either of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night of the 27th of April I saw the defendant at the corner of Ivy-lane, about ten minutes after nine o'clock in the evening; Mr. Allies' warehouse is at the corner of the lane - I passed by him, and turned round; two gentlemen passed me, coming down Newgate-street; I saw the prisoner stoop down, and enter the house; I watched between two and three minutes, saw him come out, and seized him at the corner of the lane - he got away, and I lost sight of him - I followed, calling Stop thief! I caught his coat tail, and by some means fell down, and he got from me into a public-house; I got up in half a minute, and caught him in the public-house; I saw him sufficiently to swear to him, and have no doubt of his being the man - I saw his features after he came out. I searched him at the public-house, and found on him some half-pence, a pencil-case, and a piece of wax. While I was tying his hands, to take him to the Compter, I said, "Take care that he drops nothing from his pocket;" a man behind him immediately lifted up a bunch of keys, and said,"These keys I found" - the prisoner was dropping them from his pocket; the prisoner said he did not drop them. Nothing disturbed him in the house; he came out quietly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was a dark night? A. Yes; he was about six yards from me when he went into the house; I saw him before at the corner of the lane; I will not be certain that I have seen him before; I only saw his back as he entered the house; he was inside two or three minutes, and when he came out I was about as far from him as I am from you; I seized him immediately - I lost sight of him afterwards for about half a minute or a minute - he turned the corner of a court, going into the public-house - he was stopped by three or four persons in the public-house; it is called the Hope; he was taken in the public-house - I do not know who keeps it; I saw no Mr. Jones there. I swear positively he is the man - the keys are not skeleton ones.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did he appear to let himself into the house? A. He stooped down - his head and body were nearly to his knees - he opened the door, but I do not know how.</p>

I was at the public-house with the last witness and the prisoner; I searched the prisoner, and found a skeleton-key on him - in trying it to the lock of the house I broke it - it went into the lock, and appeared to fit it; I tried it, and in getting it out it was broken; I cannot recollect whether I told the Magistrate that I tried the key, and it fitted. The prisoner was a stranger to me; I have been at the public house, but do not know any of the people who frequent it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLIES. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Hope public-house - Mrs. Wright, who keep it, has left; I remember seeing the defendant there on the night of the 27th of April; he used to come there for a glass of grog; he came about eight o'clock that evening, or rather before - I am sure of that; he had his refreshment in the parlour; there were other persons there, but they went away; there were three or four bookbinders, who live in the market. I remember some persons coming in and taking the prisoner out about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been out of the house from the time he first came in? A. I never saw him out; he could have gone out while I was in the tap-room, but I never saw him out; I heard a cry of Stop thief! when I was in the parlour - I did not see the prisoner there - several people came into the house, and ran right through into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken did he appear out of breath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any men run in at the time you heard a cry of Stop thief? A. Several people came in, and one man ran through the house, opened the back door, and went away; Mrs. Wright took and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the very time the cry of Stop thief! was raised? A. Yes. Our house has two fronts, one in Ivy-lane, and another in Turk's Head-passage; after that man ran away the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He might have gone out while you were serving? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the person came in can you swear you saw him in the place? A. About three minutes before - there was not a soul in the parlour at that time - there was when first the prisoner came in; they were gone before the alarm; I went into the parlour to stir the fire, and as I came out I heard the cry of Stop thief! he was not in the parlour when I went in to stir the fire - I saw him three minutes before that, standing at the bar; nobody was in the bar but my young mistress, Miss Wright - she is about twenty-seven years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Then somebody reshed through almost immediately after you had seen him at the bar? A. Yes, and the constable followed.</p>
               <p>Q. He got in at one door and out at the other? A. Yes; there were about six people in the house - they were all booksellers, who carry books about.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, I suppose you told the constable a man had run through the house? A. No, for they collared this gentleman - they never asked me a question; when they collared the gentleman I thought he might be the one - I did not know whether he was the person they had come after.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you doubt about that if you had seen him at the bar? A. I had no doubt about it; the gentleman asked me to fetch a coach for him, as they were pulling him about - I went, and in the mean time he was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310057"/>Q. When they were pulling him about why not say the right man had run through the house? A. I did mention that a man had run through - I told the witnesses James and Jackson so. Our house is about one hundred yards from Mr. Allies'.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what they seized the prisoner for? - A. No; I heard a person say, "I have picked up a lot of keys," and those keys I had seen Mr. Sadler take out of the bar two or three days before; I heard the cry of Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Could you doubt about what they took him up for? A. No. I told Jackson and the other gentleman about a person running through the house.</p>

            . I heard him say nothing of the sort, I am quite certain of it - he never said a word; when I went into the house, the man's hands were tied, and he said he would not be searched; I said, "You won't be searched, won't you?" I immediately put my hand into his pocket, and took the keys out.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Will you swear he did not say, in your hearing, that a man had run through the house, in at one door and out at the other? A. I never heard an observation of the kind, made by any person whatever.</p>

               <p>ROBERT JONES. I am a boot-maker, and live at Charing-cross. On the 23d of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner running, and a crowd following him, calling Stop thief! he had something under his great coat - I pursued, and he threw out this print - a boy took it up and gave it to me; the prisoner was secured at the same time; I am quite certain it was him who threw it down.</p>

I was standing behind my counter about eight o'clock in the evening, and a person called out that a man had run away with a print; I went out and endeavoured to pursue, but I fell down in the street, and lost sight of him; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man - he was brought back in about five minutes; the print had been just inside the shop, by reaching his hand in; I had seen it safe about five minutes before.</p>

On the 19th of May Messenbird was in my service; I had missed hay for a long time, and I missed some that day; the prisoners were taken before Mr. Morees; I was present; there was no threat or promise held out to them - what they said was taken down - I saw them sign it; they were charged with this felony; one was examined against the other. (Deposition read.)</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MESSENBIRD being charged with having purloined and robbed his master, Dr. Gwynne, the complainant, of hay and corn, says, "On Saturday last I gave nearly a whole truss of hay to Thomas Mallett, of Tottenham, who keeps a horse and some cows, and about a fortnight before that I gave about half a truss to the said Thomas Mallett; and a little before that I gave him about half a bushel of oats, which I put into a sack for him, and for which I told him tocome in the evening, which he did, and took the same away; I gave him the hay and corn about three weeks ago, as a recompence for the loan of his horse, which Mallett promised to lend me when I left my service, he go to see my friends." W. MEASENBIRD.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MALLETT says, "On Saturday night last I carried a blackbird and cage to Dr. Gwynne's servant; I do not know his name - between nine and ten o'clock, and he gave me part of a truss of hay - I think about 40lbs., which I took home to my house - he also, about a week or ten days ago, gave me half a bushel of oats in a sack, which he told me to come for about nine o'clock - I took the same home - he gave me hay twice - I keep a horse and two cows, but have no land."

            . I am a Police officer. On the 3d of May I received information, and went with Webster to Bayswater, to Mr. William Welch's, he lives at Southwell, and sends hay to town; we met two cart loads of hay in one waggon - Smith was the <rs id="t18270531-106-deflabel544" type="occupation">waggoner</rs>

I stood about one hundred yards from where the waggon stopped - the boy turned up the tarpaulin and pulled down the truss of hay, and Sewell, (who was the hostler there), took it up, and carried it away into the yard; it appeared, in my judgment, to be a truss of hay, and was taken from the middle of the waggon - the waggon drove on and I followed it. Smith was by the side of the horses - but I cannot tell whether he saw what the boy did, though I think he could not avoid seeing it. When the waggon had got about one hundred yards I went to see whose it was, and I said to Smith, "Does your master allow you to leave hay in that way?" he said "No; he does not;" I said, "I shall take notice of it, and let your master know;" he said "I hope you will not take any notice of it." I said I certainly should; but he might go on with his waggon, which he did - he said it was the first time he ever left any. I am sure he used that expression. I went back to the hostler, and said I should certainly take him into custody for that hay that was left there; he said, he had some hay left, and he went and brought a small bundle out - which I am sure could not be the one I saw him take in. I then took him into custody - he said he would give me a crown, or anything I chose, to let him go - he said it was a busy morning, and no one knew anything about it but ourselves. When the hay was dropped he took it up and carried it in immediately - they waggon stood by the road-side. I took him to the office. I came on to Tyburn-gate, and took Smith as he was returning. I let the boy go home with the team.</p>

On the Thursday evening, when the lad came home without the man, he said the officers had taken him, for leaving a truas of hay at Bayswater; the load of hay had been sold to go to a wharf at Paddington; my master received a note for the amount of the two full loads; it was sold for 5l. 8s. a load.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Welch. I saw two loads of hay in the waggon, on the morning of Thursday - Smith and I sat off early; there was not a word said about the hay as we went along; there was a tarpauling on I - rode on the top of the waggon, from this side of Acton: when we got to the Swan public-house at Bayswater, he told me to chuck a bit of hay down, which I did - Sewell came out of the yard, but I cannot say whether he heard what was passing; I cannot tell how much I threw down; I cannot guess; it was bound up, and had the regular bands on - Sewell took it up, but I do not know where he carried it; there were seventy-two trusses altogether; we took it to Paddington, and sold it to Mr. Allen - I saw it anloaded, but I did not halp - I did not see it paid for - there were seventy-two trusses when Mr. Allen bought it; it is always counted over; there must have been seventy-three with the bit that I gave; it was all pretty much alike; it must have been all brought from my master's farm - I did not see him take any up on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When the trusses were taken out of the waggon, where they were put? A. Into the barn - I did not carry them in, nor count them - I cannot say there were seventy-two, there might have been but seventy-one or seventy, for what I know, but the man always counts them where we take them to, and I think he would have objected to it if there had not been seventy-two.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this hay delivered in the usual way, as it is to any person who buys it? A. Yes - Smith threw it out of the waggon, and Allan's men carried it into the barn - I was in the barn, but did not hear the man count them; he made no complaint that there were not seventy-two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into the loft before you set out with the waggon? A. Yes - Smith told me to go up, to put the truss of hay down which we left on the road - I did not know what he was going to do with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a thing was it, was it a truss? A. There was not a truss - I said it was like the others, but it did not weigh so much; I did not tie it up: it was not quite so big as the other - I am sure it was not a truss; it was the one that was got out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310061"/>loft that was thrown down - I know it was not a truss of hay; they were all tied with two bands; no one saw us leaye the premises with the hay; the foreman was at Southend - I have often been with the hay carts to Paddington, and we stopped at the Swan every morning regularly to bait - I have never known hay borrowed of the hostler, except once, that was when master was there, and he told us to bring him a bit again, which was done; it is usual for our horses and carts to stop there, as we go back, but the first tier does not stop for the other; they stop about half an hour, and then go on again - I do not know that hay is ever left to be eaten by the horses on their return- I do not remember hay being left for that purpose.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST to J. GIBBS. Q. You say you got some bay from the premises? A. Yes; the hostler brought out a small bit of hay, which appeared to me to be a lighter colour than the one I saw taken from the waggon - I did not make that observation at the time; he said, "This is the hay I had from the waggon" - I took him into custody, but did not search the premises - I was satisfied in my own mind, it was not the hay - it appeared to have two bands on it, when the man took it up; it was as like the other trusses as possible; the hay he produced was not like the trusses at all; it was taken to the office because he said it was taken from the waggon; it was taken to be the hay till Mr. Griffin said it was not, but I thought it was not before that, and I said so to Webster, my brother officer - I did not tell the Magistrate so.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. There was some hay taken to the Police-office? Yes, but that was not master's.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Kensington-gravel-pits. On the 23d of April, about ten o'clock, the prisoner and another ran past me; the other had a basket under his arm - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw Mr. Brand running after them - I ran and overtook them in Elms-lane - I detained the prisoner till Mr. Brand came up; a witness said they had thrown the things over a hedge - I went and got them, and gave them to Mr. Brand; there was a tea-pot a spoon, and a basket with some sharings over them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see any one else? A. Yes, another man close by him; they were walking when they passed by me, and then they set off running, when they got about two hundred yards. - The prisoner did not try to make his escape; I held him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

I occupy a farm of Mr. George Worrall - I missed some lead from the force-pump and some from the roof, on Saturday, the 21st of April; I set Giles and another man to watch - the lead had been fixed to the dwelling-house, some on the roof, and some on the garret window; some part of it was gone, and some was left rolled up on the roof; it is a large mansion, which I have the care of; no person lives in it. I know nothing of the prisoners. I afterwards saw some lead fitted, which corresponded with the remains of lead on that house, it fitted the sink, and every thing else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say whether one person might have cut and removed this lead? A. One person might have cut it, but there must have been three or four to carry it away; there was 500lbs. and more. That from the top was cut and rolled up, and put into a room; the tearing away, rolling, and removing, would have required at least three men - they had removed the keys, and we found them in the drawing-room, near the window, with a chisel; this was on the Saturday - I saw the lead safe on the Wednesday.</p>

            . I am the son of Henry Pope. Giles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310062"/>and another were set to watch on the Sunday night; Giles came to me about half-past ten o'clock - I got up, and went to the lawn facing the house; I heard a knocking about in the house several times between ten and three o'clock, and just as the clock struck three, one man pushed the window up, and one said, "Don't let us get up yet - we cannot see - let us lay half an hour longer;" soon afterwards I heard them coming out, and Giles stepped forward - they heard him walking on some gravel stones, and one of them said,"Here are some men;" they were then either in the house or in the balcony, just coming out. We stopped the three prisoners, and asked what they did there; they said they were going water-cressing - I told them it was a very queer place to go to for water-cresses. I had been over these premises on the Tuesday, and all was right then; we found 6 cwt. and 3 qrs. of lead, I think that was all - some of it had been taken from the balcony and put into a cupboard, and some in other places; some keys had been taken out of the locks of the doors, and put into the water-closet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the keys were found in a room? A. Yes, and one of the rooms in which the lead was, was locked by one of those keys; I had been on the premises on Sunday - there was no chisel or keys there then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say whether any of the lead had been removed on the Saturday? A. No.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Kingston. I watched on the Sunday evening with a young man who is not here - I was there about eleven o'clock at night, and saw three or four persons come past me; we were waiting in a little water-closet outside the house; they went round behind me, and got on the balcony; I then heard the sash come down, and the bar of the window fall; I then heard the sash put up again, and the shutter opened very easily; I waited some considerable time, and heard a knocking about in the room; I then slipped out, and called Mr. Pope- when we came back I heard a noise in the room; we got over a fence to go on the lawn, and the sticks snapped under our feet, which I suppose gave an alarm, and we heard no more for some time; we stood there till about three o'clock - no person got up to the house after we got there; when the clock struck three one of the persons said,"It is two o'clock - let us get up;" another said, "No, it is too dark - let us lay half an hour longer - we shan't see the cresses;" the other said, "Let us get up, I am so bl - dy cold;" one of them then said, "There is somebody below," and they called out, "Halloo, mate, what is it o'clock?" I said, "You know the clock - you heard it strike;" the three prisoners then came down, and we said we had lost some lead - they said they knew nothing about it. This is a large gentleman's house, but is not now inhabited.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PIDGEON. Q. Did not you say it was half-past ten o'clock when we came there? A. No; we had been waiting about an hour, and you came at eleven o'clock- there was no lead in the room where you were; there was 6 cwt. 3 qrs. 5lbs. in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you first see a chisel? A. In the morning, after we took them; I had been there the day before, and there was no chisel there then; they could get into the room adjoining the balcony.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. H. POPE. Q. Had you been into the room before they were taken? A. Yes - there was no chisel there then and no keys; I could not get into the water-closet that day.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received some lead at Mr. Pope's premises - I compared it with what remained on the premises; it fitted exactly; this piece fitted the pipe of the force-pump; these marks of the wall-hooks correspond exactly with the marks in the wall - I have no doubt whatever that it came from that building.</p>
               <p>PIDGEON'S Defence. We set out to seek for watercresses - we went round Watford, and were coming back through Edgware; we staid all day, and asked a woman where we could lie down - she told us there was an empty house in a field; we went and looked in an open shed, which was very wet; we went round the house, and saw this balcony - we got up there, and staid till three o'clock; we counted but two, and I said to Clements, "There is two o'clock, let us get up" - he said, "No, let us lie half an hour longer - we shan't be able to see the cresses;" we got up, and heard some men; they said, "Come down" - we came down, and they took us into custody; we said we would go, as we had done nothing - they have the watercress bag I suppose now.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. POPE. Q. When were the keys first missed from the doors? A. On the Saturday, when we first found the lead had been cut.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 5th of April, about half-past five o'clock, I saw him in Mr. Toppin's barge in the basin - he had no business there, not being employed by any body; I saw him again soon afterwards on the side of the basin, walking towards the gate where I was stationed; when he came within about thirty yards of me he made a balt; I mentioned my suspicions to the foreman of the lock-gate; the prisoner would not come up towards me, but loitered about, and in a few minutes he went to assist in opening the lock, which is not part of his duty - he then went on board another barge, called the Jeffrey, No. 549, which was laden with twenty casks of brandy - he appeared to want to get out, and instead of coming to the gate he got on board another barge, which was going into the river - I went on board, secured him, and found in his hat this bladder, containing about a quart of brandy - I had asked if he had any thing in his hat, and he said No - I then asked what craft he had been watching - he said a craft in the basin - I said, "Is it that one with the brandy?" he said Yes, and that he was employed by Mr. Toppin - I said, "I suppose this brandy is part of what you had charge of?" he said, "Yes it is; for God's sake don't say any thing about it; it is only a small drop, make away with it; don't make a noise about it, you will get me into a serious trouble;" I said I could not think of that, and gave him in charge of the patrol - I then went on board the Jeffrey, and found two casks had been plugged and spiles put into them, and some dirt rubbed over the spiles - there was some brandy under the casks, it had run down the side of them; they were marked B. A Nos. 2 and 9 - I found a skin near the barge; it had evidently burst after being filled - it corresponds exactly with that found in his hat - I could find no gimblet - I then went, and asked if he had got the key of the cabin- he said No, but I found three padlock keys on him; he begged hard that I would return them to him, and I did; I then took him to the Thames Police-office, where we saw Mr. Toppin, who desired me to search him again for those keys, but he had then made away with them - he said did I think he should be such a b - y fool as to have the keys about him then: that he knew better if I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you find any implement that could have bored the casks? A. No; he did not say he was watching Mr. Pedley's barge; he said afterwards he was watching Herring's barge - there was no barge of Herring's which he could have got at - there was none in the Import-dock.</p>

            . I am a Custom-house guager. I went on board this barge on the 7th of April; I examined the casks, and saw Nos. 2 and 9 marked B. A C. were leaky from being spiled - there appeared something like dirt covered over the spile. I guaged them, and missed six gallons from No. 2, and two gallons from No. 9; the brandy would be worth from 3s. to 3s. 6d. a gallon without the duty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the brandy found in the bladder? A. Yes; it was nearly one per cent. weaker than that in the casks, but it was similar in quality; I can account for that, it was the same colour, but in so small a quantity the alteration would not appear - a tea-spoonful of water would have made the difference - I will not swear it is the same as that in the cask - evaporation would cause the difference in the strength; I believe it the same.</p>

I live with Mr. Element; three soldiers came in together, and called for beer; the beef was then in the room, in the show-larder - Ashton took it, and gave it to House, who went out with it - I was in the bar, behind a curtain; the meat was brought back with House, and my uncle gave it to the prisoners at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the larder from the bar? A. Two or three yards - Ashton was tipsy; he remained behind with the third man, who offered to pay for the beef; the skewer was stuck quite in, but could be seen.</p>

On the 22d of February, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came in - he had formerly lived with us - he selected a set of fire-irons, brasses, and a tea-tray, and said he would send the money for them if his wife liked them, or he would return them - the boy went with him and the goods - I have not seen them or the money since.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer. I was formerly in partnership with Mr. Bousfield. I live in Chiswell-street, Finsbury. I knew the prisoner first twelve or eighteen months ago - he then lived in the Crescent, Euston-square, I believe; I knew nothing of him as a resident there, but he came to me in Chiswell-street, and said he had an instrument to sell, and would I sell it - he said"Mr. Godfrey, you recollect buying some furniture of my mother." I said, "Who was she?" he said "Mrs. Arnott," he said he had something in the musical line to sell. I looked into my book and found the name, and recollected the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. You never took the trouble to go and see where he did live? A. No; I knew nothing of him, except for selling goods for him at my auction-room. I had sold two instruments for him before, one of Golding's and one of Clementi's - his mother kept a very respectable private house - I bought some furniture of her; the prisoner represented himself as a musical dealer I found the harp on my premises at nine o'clock - I believe Mr. Bousfield took it in - it came about six in the evening - it was not dark - it was darkish. I saw the prisoner there and gave him 12l. on it; it was sold on the 29th of that month by public auction in the evening, for 32l., to Mr. Paine. I paid the prisoner 16l. more; 4l. was the auction duty, commission, and trouble - the duty was 32s.; we sometimes sell by printed catalogues - this was not in a printed Catalogue. I told him at the time, that till we had a respectable sale, we should not get a good price. I have an auction every week - it was regularly advertised.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever sell any instrument besides these for me? A. No; only these three, but I have sold many without a catalogue.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Have you not heard that this was worth 70l.? A. I did not know the value.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who generally pays the duty? A. The seller always does at respectable sales - it was advertised in the Times.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I never authorized him to apply for this instrument for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly deny that I ever obtained it for my brother's use, or even used his name - but as a respectable individual, with whom the prosecutor was acquainted. A note accompanied it charging me two guineas a month for the hire - if it was for my brother's use, why send a note to me - I have lost the note. I had been totally out of employ for twelve months, and much reduced. Being arrested for 65l. I was induced, by the persuasion of a friend, to dispose of this instrument to relieve me; I got released the very night it was sold. The law I believe, requires I should have a felonious intent at the time; I was assured by a friend, that it should be purchased and he would give me his acceptance for it.</p>

We found the bag over a fence and his shoes near it - he was taken in the chimney of an empty house. When he came to the watch-house, he said "These are not my shoes- I shan't have them." I said "You had better put them on," he did so - he said a cap, which I picked up, was not his. I said he had better put it on, which he did; they both fitted him well - the bag contained two quartern loaves, a plate, some butter, three aprons, and a towel.</p>

I said I had nothing then but my watch, and as we were going along Oxford-buildings, she snatched my watch - (that is not my way home, but she wished me to go there;) she snatched my watch and broke the guard. I called Stop thief! she was taken and the watch picked up- I had been drinking that evening. I did not know her before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty a few minutes before one o'clock - and saw the prisoner and prosecutor together - he appeared a little in liquor, and seeing the prisoner enticing him into these buildings, I went down Woodstock-street, and saw a scuffling between them in the passage of No. 21; she got up and ran past me; the prosecutor said he was robbed. I pursued, and saw her throw the watch over some high fence - I still pursued, and sprung my rattle. Partridge caught her - and we took her back to the place. Partridge got over; and found the watch - she said it was her first offence, and wished to be let go.</p>

            . I am constable of Hammersmith. I received a note from Mr. Burrage, and went to watch at his shop on the 19th of April - he deals in marine-stores. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I saw Hewitt go into the shop with a sack - Burrage went in after him; some time after I saw Minter go by, on the other side of the way, with a sack - I went over and took him; I took them both into custody at Burrage's shop, and saw both sacks emptied - they contained lead - I heard them say they found it that morning, while bird's-nesting - I went and saw the lead fitted to the top of Mrs. Humbert's house - it matched exactly - I have known Minter a long time, and have seen Hewitt before.</p>

            . I deal in marine-stores, I directed Edgson to attend my house on the morning of the 19th - at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 18th the prisoners came and sold me an axe and spade; one of them asked if I bought lead - I said Yes; they said, "What do you give?" I said, 12s. 1cwt. - one of them, with an oath, said, "In the Dover-road we can get 16s." - I asked who from; they said, with some hesitation, "Mr. Homer, a lead-melter;" they went away, and at half-past seven o'clock in the evening they came with another person, and asked if I would give any more; one of them said, "We heard there was a stoppage at your shop;" I said that was immaterial to me, if the property was honestly got, there was the money; next morning, about seven o'clock, they came and said, "Master, we have got 1cwt." - I asked when they would come; they said, "In about an hour;" I said"Make it nine" - I then informed the officer, who came.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in New-street with my wife - I saw Thomas take a handkerchief from Stead's pocket, and give it to Featherstone, who crossed over to me, and I caught him in my arms - the handkerchief dropped from the side of his coat - he was then about six yards from Stead; my wife crossed over - I went over also, and left the handkerchief with her, while I pursued Thomas and secured him - I knew him before, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was Featherstone at the time the gentleman was robbed? A. Close behind him; I caught the handkerchief as it fell - it was never on the ground.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I came to town on the 10th of April, and on the 11th, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I received thirty-five sovereigns from Mr. Akers of Richmond, and I had two half sovereigns before - I put them in part of an old handkerchief, and put it into my fob, which is a deep one - I received it at the George and Gate public-house, Gracechurch-street - I only had two penny worth of gin there - I then went down to Shoreditch-church, and on the road some man overheard me, and began talking about farming and the country; I never saw him before, I slipped down and dirted one of my knees - I went into a public-house, to scrape of the dirt; the man came in, and called for a pint of beer or ale, and asked me to drink, which I did - I then went on to Shoreditch: he followed, and asked me into a public-house, and we did go into the Green Gate public-house; we had not been there long, before another man came in, and then the prisoner came in, one of them then said, he had got a great deal of property about him, and he hoped we were all gentlemen, and would not rob him; it was then about eleven o'clock- the man who talked of his money, then pulled out some sovereigns - I do not know how many; the man who had gone in with me, then pulled out some money, and then the prisoner pulled out two or three sovereigns, and after that I pulled out some money - I did not show it all - I then put it into my fob again safe, and felt it safe after I got out of that house; we all came out together; we only had one pint of beer there; the man who said he had this property, said he wished to get into a bettermost house; they at first seemed to be strangers, but they all talked about money, and all shewed some; we then went to the Bird Cage public-house, as they told me - I do not know what street it was in, they said it was Hackney-road, I think, but it was not; it is about a quarter of a mile from the other house; they talked of having a beef-steak, and the gentleman who said he had the property ordered some; we all eat together, and had a pot of beer - I know my money was safe when they were going to have the steak cooked - I left there between one and two o'clock I should think; after we eat the steak, they called for some brandy and water, and then the prisoner said, "I must go out, I have to attend to a shop" - this was between one and two o'clock, I think; he went out, and came back again (we sat at a large table; the prisoner sat at my right hand, and the man who joined me in the street, on my left; my money was in my fob); the prisoner sat down again, at the same place as before - I believe; he staid some minutes, and went out; he returned again in about ten minutes; we were an hour and a quarter in the house altogether; after I had drank the brandy and water it made me stupid - I do not know what was done, but I am told we all went out together- I did not go to sleep - I came to my recollection about eight o'clock in the evening, and found myself somewhere at the west end of the town - I know I had left the house with them; I walked, or they led me - I was found somewhere in Mary-le-bone, as I am told - I felt there for my money, and it was gone - I should judge that I had my money safe when I left the Bird Cage public-house - I have recovered no part of it, or seen any of the men, except the prisoner; he was taken on the 14th - I had informed an officer - I described their persons - I did not know either of their persons, so well as the prisoner's - I knew him again the moment I saw him, and swear most positively he is the man - I was sober when I felt for my money - I lost the half-sovereigns and all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you been in London before? A. Yes; I had only two-penny worth of gin - I had no more spirits till after dinner, and after drinking the brandy and water I was stupid - I do not know that they gave me any thing more - I was not drunk but insensible, and have no recollection of any thing that passed after two o'clock - I believe the three men went away with me, but I had lost my senses then - I know they went away with me - the last thing I recollect is that there was a step at the door; whether I fell down I do not know - some of them led me away - I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the officer you should not know any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310073"/>of the persons? A. I do not know that I did; I cannot tell whether I was in any woman's company after I came out, nor whether I went into any public-house - I had not sense enough to know; I do not know whether the prisoner is a sailor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he dressed like one? A. No, he had a blue coat, and a ring - I should have taken him for one from his appearance.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Wednesday, the 11th of April, I saw the prosecutor going down Hackney-road, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, two gentlemen were with him - the prisoner was not there then - one had hold of his arm, the other was close by - they went on into the Green Gate public-house, remained there some time, and came out - I saw the prisoner come out last - I had not seen him go in, but am confident he is the man - they went up Crabtree-row, to the Bird Cage public-house, at the corner of Bird Cagewalk, Bethnal-green - I followed them; the prisoner walked behind them within a few yards - I did not see them go in - I was close behind, but they turned a corner- there are two doors to the house - I turned, and supposed they were gone in; I went into a house opposite, and staid some time - I saw the prisoner come out; he went in again in a short time - I then sent a woman for Newsom, my brother officer, who came - I told him to go in, and have a pint of beer in the same room with them - when he went in, the prisoner had gone out a second time; he returned shortly after, and went in - Newsom directly came out; we waited, and after some time they all four came out together - we watched them on to Brick-lane - this was about two o'clock; the prisoner was pretty close to them, a little distance behind - the prosecutor seemed to walk steadily - I did not consider him intoxicated - they all turned down a street out of Brick-lane, except the prisoner, who went straight on - we then lost sight of them, and went to several houses to look for them - I found them in a house in Brick-lane - I think it is called the Tap public-house; they all went out together - the prisoner was then with them - it might then he half-past two o'clock, I cannot be certain; we went up, and said they were after something, and told them to leave the countryman - they then went away from him, and as we had to be at Bow-street by four o'clock we went away - next morning I heard the prosecutor had been robbed - I went, and asked if he should know them; he said No - I said, "But we know them, and no doubt we shall find them;" I knew one of the others before, but not the prisoner - I have not seen the others since. On the Saturday night we went to a certain house where the other two had promised to meet us - they did not come, but I saw the prisoner walking on the other side of the way, and looking into a house - I went to him and said, "You are one of the men who was with them - the countryman has been robbed, and I shall take you; your companions promised to be here, you had better come in" - we went in, and staid there some time; they did not come. I said it was our duty to detain him - he said, "I should not like to be locked up, here are two sovereigns;" I certainly took the two sovereigns, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The other two men and the prosecutor came out of the Bird Cage first? A. Yes; the prisoner might be six or seven yards behind - I think they went separate ways when we spoke to them; the prosecutor seemed to walk on very well - he appeared to have had a drop, but knew very well what he was about. I did not see him again till next morning myself - when I took the prisoner he said he knew nothing of the robbery: he said if we would not lock him up all Sunday, he would come before the Magistrate on Monday; that he did not care about it on the Monday. I have heard he was steward to Captain Parry in his last voyage.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. About one o'clock Tyrrell sent for me. I went to a house opposite the Bird Cage, and afterwards went into the house, where I found the other two men talking with the prosecutor, about the country and farming, and in about ten minutes the prisoner came in - I left just as he went in - he did not seem to speak to them while I was there, but I left and went to Tyrrell, to watch them; they came out about two o'clock, all in company together; they went on down to Brick-lane - nearly facing Hanbury's brew-house we lost them for a short time, and then we found them in the Tap opposite the brew-house; I went into the house, and saw them- I do not know whether they were drinking; they had not been there long. Directly they saw me they came out; I had seen the prisoner once or twice before; I am quite certain of him: I came out - Tyrrell and I went up, and spoke to them, and they dispersed. The prosecutor appeared to go away; he called on me next morning, and said he had been robbed; I asked if he should know them again- he said he thought not; I said I should know them, and would try and find them. On the Saturday morning I met the other two in Chiswell-street, and said, "You are the men that drew the countryman the other day;" they denied it, and offered me a sovereign; I said, "Go with me to the old man, and clear the case;" they said No, they would not do that, but they would give me a sovereign; I proposed to meet them the same evening, down in Shoreditch - we went- they did not come. The prisoner came, and was taken into custody - he gave Tyrrell two sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not take the two men? - A. No. The prosecutor could not tell where he lost his money. They dispersed about three o'clock - I went into the Bird Cage that I might know them again; the prisoner went up to the table, and sat there. I was not there above a minute after he came in.</p>

I received the money - one paid for all. I am certain of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see them come in? A. No. I did not see the prosecutor go out alone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the Green Gate, and saw the prosecutor and two others sitting together; they appeared to be friends. I had a glass of gin and bitters, and the paper; the prosecutor told me he had a great deal of money, and that the others had also; he pulled out his money first, and then the other men, and with a great deal of persuasion I pulled out a sovereign or two; I was invited to go and have some steaks, and after some time I left them to go to Brick-lane, to look for a person who I was to meet about a shop; I said I would come back and be a glass of brandy and water with them; I did so, and afterwards we went to another house. I never saw the prosecutor again for nine days, and he asked which was the man, though I stood close to him in the office. I have been out with Captain Parry.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the two gentlemen leave the house? - A. One did - the other remained with him some time, I do not know how long. One of the gentlemen came to me, and said, "Don't give those men any more beer or spirits."</p>

I secured Twyford, and charged him with having another sack under the dung; he denied it, but we found it there, and a sack in the stable; the contents had been emptied into the bin, and among the mixture I found some pieces of paper, which Crafter identified; Miller said it belonged to a person whose horse he had at livery.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's. On the morning of the 27th of April I was in Ironmonger-row, and saw Spiers at the corner of a street; he saw me, and ran away; I suspected him; I turned to the right, and saw Smith at the corner of a house with this ladder - he stood there about ten minutes, then took it away on his shoulder - I followed him; he put it over the rails of the work-house; I went, and asked what he brought it there for - he said a man told him, and that Spiers was the man- he said it was for a lark; I told him to carry it to the watch-house, but at the corner of Whitecross-street he threw it down and ran away; I caught him, and secured him; Spiers was taken that morning.</p>

I was sent for, and received information; the prisoner came into the Coach and Horses about an hour after - I took her and searched her, she said, "Don't be indelicate" - I made her loosen her clothes; 9s. 6d. was found in her bosom; she said at the watch-house, that she had taken the watch to the North Pole public-house, and given it to one Ryan for this 9s. 6d.; she was quite sober.</p>

On the 5th of May Seims, my servant, gave me information, and I went to a side-board, in which I found a quantity of veneers - I took them out and marked them- I did not count them, but am certain there were ten, or more; I put them back, and fetched an officer, then went up to the shop, and said, "Who put those veneers in the side-board?" the prisoner said, "Not me;" I said, "Nobody else could," and gave him into custody - he fell on his knees and begged for mercy, and said he did not know he was doing any harm - they are not worth above 10s. - we then went to the front room floor of a house in Baldwin-street, City-road, and found a great quantity of mahogany veneers and rose-wood, which I can swear belong to me, and are worth about 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not the side-board stand in a yard? A. Yes; I have three apprentices and four journeymen; they all had access to it, but nobody but the prisoner had come that morning when they were found; I do not know when I had seen them last - Seims is a pretty good boy - I have had him before a Magistrate three times, but not for dishonesty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the wood? A. From its quality and particular grain.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been an apprentice? A. Four years. I quarrelled with the prisoner several days before - but we had made it up and spoke together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did your husband go to sea? A. Two years ago. I have not seen or heard of him since. I did not tell her to take charge of my furniture to prevent expence. I saw her in September, selling oysters in the street, and went home with her; but did not see my things there; she said they had been taken away by a neighbour. I have received a box and 25s.; I did not drink tea with her afterwards - I did not go before the Justice till April - I tried several times before that to get money from her. I have not said if she could raise 5l. I would not appear.</p>

I shewed it to him, and put it into my right hand waistcoat pocket - we went to a variety of places - he said he had no money, and I must stand treat - and, in the Minories, I lent him 2s. 6d.; and about three o'clock, he told me to say nothing about it.

I accused him of it, he denied it - he was searched, and one sovereign, and 17s. 6d. found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you dined? A. Yes; in the Minories. I dropped some money which he picked up, and gave the landlady for me - nobody else was in the room - he told me he was quite stumped - and had not a halfpenny.</p>

I said, "Yes; walk up;" he went up-stairs before me - I opened Wallis' room door, told him to go in, and I ran down to look for a man, and he got away - he was taken in about an hour - he was quite a stranger, and had no right in the house - I had gone out at eight o'clock in the morning, and left my door locked - it was not broken open.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner with another person go up to the mob at the new linen-draper's shop, at the corner of Essex-street; I saw them both very active at the baskets and reticules - they went close up to the prosecutrix - the prisoner was nearest, his companion closed behind him, and all in a moment he turned back and bolted up Essex-street - I followed, collared him, and said, "I know you have got it, tip it up;" he said, "I have done nothing - I picked it up" - I said, "Give it me;" and he gave me this purse; Fowler came up - I gave him to him- I went to the shop and gave notice that I had found a purse - the prosecutrix came that evening, and claimed it.</p>

No; there were two or three others, who appeared of his party - he at first said he had not got it - another boy was taken, but not detained; I do not remember his friends talking to me about it - the prisoner's father came to me on Sunday, and said his son did not take it - I told him I wished to get the money and not attend, for fear I should lose my situation; the Magistrate asked if I had received 10s. for my handkerchief; I told him I had; I value it at 4s.; the man said he would give me 1l. or 2l. - I said I wanted nothing.</p>

            . I am a gentleman's coachman. On the 15th of May I had leave to go out to look for my wife, who had run away - I went to Pentonville and had two glasses of gin and water; being agitated it took effect on me - I remember some woman coming to lead me a long; she wanted me to go into the Park with her; I would not- I found myself giddy, sat down on the stones, and missed my watch; I complained to the officer, who said she had got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no recollection of seeing the watch at all.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 32.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Camden-town. On Tuesday, the 22d of May, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I was in a stable near the canal - I found Smith there, with a shawl round his shoulders, and the other two prisoners were laying down, asleep. I gave them to the patrol, and in the stable I found a bundle, containing all these things; they said they did not belong to them.</p>

No - my wife had seen his sister; I received it on no condition; he said he was very sorry, and gave me a list of sums he had received from different people, amounting to 12l. or 14l.; he left me on the 7th of April, without notice; the note is his hand-writing; If he had staid till Saturday 23s. would be due to him; sometimes when he has paid money on Saturday I have said, "Take your 23s."

On Saturday night I met a man in a cart who said he had fourteen pantiles for me - I told him to put them down by the side of the brook, which he did, as I had my child with me.

I told the men' they were there - they had been there for two months before.</p>

I had been out that morning and saw the two prisoners going to and fro, past Riley's shop. I saw Hayes pull the dress down - Gadd followed him immediately; they went down a turning. I went down another turning to meet them, but could not get that way, About eleven o'clock, I was in Shoreditch, and met the two prisoners in company and took them.

On Thursday last I and Goddard went with a search-warrant to No. 15, Grafton-street - I found the female prisoner there; I said I had come to search for some notes, which had been stolen from an hotel; she appeared to be going to faint. I proceeded to search, and soon found these stays; I said,"Where did you get these?" she said, "I bought them at Mills';" I said, "Do you mean in St. Clement's church-yard?" she said Yes - that she gave 12s. for them; I said,"How did you pay for them?" she said in silver. I went into the bed-room, and between the bed and mattress found this silver snuff-box; I called her into the room, and said,"You seem to be a respectable woman - I expect you will be candid, and answer me - how did you become possessed of this box?" she said, "I know nothing about it;" I said,"Now - when you went to Mrs. Mills', to buy the stays, did you not give her a 10l. note to change, and tell her to write 'Mrs. Lee, No. 5, Dean-street,' on it?" she said, "Yes, I did;" I then said, "Now, was not your husband standing at the window at the time?" she said he was - and just after this the male prisoner came up, opened the door, and went into the front room; I said, "Your name is Taprell, is it not?" he said, "It is." I took him into the back room, where his wife and Mrs. France were, and said, "I have found this snuff-box between your bed and mattress, and expect you will tell me how you came by it, and there is a 10l. note your wife passed at Mrs. Mills', and you stood outside;" he then said, "Three weeks or a month ago I went to Exeter, to my mother, and she gave me this snuff-box and 20l.; the 10l. note was part of the money;" I found some promissory notes - he said he knew nothing about them. We then went in a coach; he said on the road, "If there was a boy standing at my side at Mills' window, he was not in my company;" I said, "Then you were alone"- he said Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310091"/>given the men permission to take any of this lead away? - A. Never; they often asked me, but I never would. I put the lead which I took from him, into a closet in the lobby at Carlton House, and it was lost, but I found part of it afterwards, and it has my mark on it - it is the same. I found two pieces in a water-closet; I swear it is what I found on him - he had it in a blue handkerchief, which was lost with it - it is now in my handkerchief, which is blue also. I found nine pieces on him, but I have only found five.</p>

               <p>JOHN McELLIGOTT. On the 19th of April I was coming from Astley's. I had got to No. 11, Tottenham-court-road, and I asked the watchman for a lodging - the prisoner came up and said she had a good lodging - I went with her - she showed me into a room - I went to bed - she did not go to bed in that room - when I went to bed I had three sovereigns and a half, and a small Spanish piece, in my pocket - I said to the prisoner, "Take away the light"- I had left my clothes on a chair, and as soon as I was in bed I saw her put her hands into my pockets, and take out the money from a purse - the light was then gone, but I could see that; I was quite sober - I said, "What are you about?" she went out, and said she would be back in a minute - I then went to my clothes, and missed my money - I put my clothes on, and told a watchman that the woman had robbed me - we took her the next night - I am certain of her person.</p>

I was examining the doors and windows of the next house, and I saw the prisoner go out of this house - the prosecutor came to me in a minute or two, and said he was robbed by the girl just gone out - I had seen them walking together past my box a few minutes before - I could not find the prisoner that night, but I found her the next night - I found on her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310092"/>6s. in silver, and 11/2d. - the prosecutor appeared quite sober.</p>

On the 19th of April I received information, went to the prisoner's house, in Salisbury-square, Hoxton, and found all these articles; both the prisoners were there; the man said he did not know how they came there; the woman said she had been to the house where the box was; that there was a hole in the lid, and having a nurse-child with her about three years old, she might have taken them out - I found the duplicate of a shift, and got it out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate so? A. Yes; she said so at the house, and repeated it before the Magistrate - she said nothing else at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated in your deposition, that she said, "I am very sorry for what I have done; my husband knew nothing about it;" and why do you say she said nothing else? A. She did say that - it was not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you to say she did not state any thing else at her lodging? A. I might not be correct for a word or two; she did say she was sorry for it - I beg pardon for omitting it.</p>

On the 13th of May, about two o'clock, I was in the cellar; an alarm was given; I came up, and missed these things from the kitchen; I went to the prisoner's room, which is about thirty yards off, about eight o'clock at night, and found them all - the man said he did not know they were there; he had handed me a candle to look for them, but I found them out on the stairs - the woman said she had brought them there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner J. FITZPATRICK. Q. Did I not say to her, "What business had you to bring them here?" A. Yes; the woman had been drinking, but knew what she was doing. I had seen them both at my house that afternoon; they were customers.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. On the 23d of April I was in Osborne-street, at half-past 12 o'clock at night. I know Nathaniel Skuse, he lives in Wentworth-street; he was in <placeName id="t18270531-237-crimeloc1268">Osborne-street</placeName>

I followed and saw the prisoner take his right-hand from Skuse's right-hand pocket. I went up and asked if he was his friend - he said he was - I said, "I think you have robbed him." I took him to the watch-house - Skuse, said in his presence, that he had lost two sovereigns. The officer found two sovereigns in the prisoner's fob pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not see a friend of Skuse's there? A. Yes; the prisoner did not say he had asked him to assist; he is not here, nor is Skuse.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. Skuse was brought in, and said he had been robbed of two sovereigns by the prisoner, who had laid hold of his arm, and put his hand into his pocket - the prisoner said he had only got 7s. I searched him and found that. I then said"I'll search your fob," which I did, and found two sovereigns. I then searched the prosecutor and found some silver on him, his right-hand breeches pocket was turned inside out - he had a bundle of papers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the silver? A. In his waistcoat-pocket; his friend was not bound over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home and saw this man laying insensible on the ground - a man, calling himself his friend, asked me to assist; the watchman came up, and asked if I was his friend - I said "No; but I was assisting;" he said he thought he saw my hand come from his pocket. I can prove how I got the 2l. 7s.; the prosecutor afterwards said he had lost nothing. I declare my innocence - the prosecutor was locked up himself, as he was drunk - his friend has not been heard of since.</p>

Windmill-street; it leads from the front area to the cistern; there was in the same bundle two copper coal-scuttles, and a large kettle - Scott brought Williams to the watch-house - James said he was going to some square, and that he had got the things from some back street just by; the edges of the pipe were quite bright, and I should think had been just cut.</p>

            . I was under White in Mr. St. John's service. About three months ago White proposed to me to rob master - I told him I would do nothing of the sort; he then went and got three bushels of oats from the granary, in a sack, and put into Grant's car, which stood in the yard; John Grant had brought it there, but was gone to town - William was not there - Grant is a hay-jobber; I had heard no conversation between White and him - John had brought a load of hay in the cart; he went to London to fetch another cart; he returned about half-past eleven o'clock, with a horse only, and took away the cart - I was afterwards coming back from Edmonton and met John Grant drawing the cart, with the corn in it, and a little loose hay; shortly after this White asked if I would have any thing to drink out of what Grant gave him; I said No; he said he had got some money from Mr. Grant, and if I liked to drink, or have part of it, I might; I had only seen John Grant there that morning; Mr. St. John turned me away on the 17th of May, about some corn found under the manger; I could not get a place, and came to him and gave information; nobody requested me to do so; White had left him that day; I believe it was after I gave the information; I have not spoken to White since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your master accused you of stealing oats? A. Yes, those under the manger; I ought to have mentioned this, but did not wish to make a disturbance; I went to tell him of it this day week, because he was blaming me to every body, and I could not get a place; I should have told him if I had got one - the Grants live at Enfield-highway; I was driving a coach when I met him in the cart, about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock; I did not speak to him; he had returned about half-past eleven; the oats were in a sack; I was going out on a coach when he came to the yard; White handed the corn from the granary; I saw him do it; I did not mean to have a shilling of the money it fetched; White told me he was going to send some hay-seeds away - I cannot swear that the sack contained corn.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any hay-seed at the granary? A. No: the sack I saw in the cart was the same as I saw put into it; I had passengers on my coach when I saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you tell what was in the sack? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ST. JOHN. I have missed no hay-seeds; I had not got so much as a sack; there was nothing in the granary but oats; the oats were worth 12s.</p>

White said to me, one day after that, "George, if you can get any corn out, Mr. Slee will take it;" I saw White put a sack of corn on the footboard of the coach, and he said to me, "There is some corn for Slee, you can get Terry to carry it;" there was about three bushels - Terry is a labourer, but not in Mr. St. John's service; Terry came and took it away - this was about six weeks before I gave the information; I saw White, after that corn had been taken, at the Roebuck, public-house, where there is a shoe-club held; he said to me there, that he had got some money, if I liked to take part of it, I might; I owed him 1s. 3d. for my share at the club, and asked him to pay it for me, till master came home - he did so, and I paid him the next day.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Tottenham. George Brown sent his cousin William (a boy) to me, to say he had a parcel to take to Slee's; I went to the yard, and took it to the house - Slee was not at home - it was brought out of Mr. St. John's yard, and put on my back; White was in the yard at the time, looking in at the window, to see that all was right - Mrs. Slee was at home - I put it into the coal-hole; when I came away I saw Slee about three minutes after I left the house; I said, "I have left a parcel at your house;" he said, "It is all right;" this was on a Saturday night, between eight and nine o'clock - it was dark; I then went to the Roebuck, and had a pint of beer, and in a short time, Slee, White, and Brown, came in together; White gave me 21/2d. for my trouble; I do not know whether Slee and Brown saw that; there is a shoe-club held there.</p>

I said, Yes; he then asked what he had better do; I said he must know whether he had received them or not; he said he had received no such quantity - that he had received a bushel, and about half a peck, and paid 5s. for them, which he thought the full value; he said to his wife, "I am going to Edmonton about them;" whether he said oats I cannot say.</p>

               <p>SLEE's Defence. These two are most vile characters, and gentlemen can prove it. I was not at home, and did not know White, nor where he lived, at all; Brown is a most base character; he told the Magistrate that White gave the oats - there was a bushel, and about half a peck; I told White, myself, I thought them very dear - but as they were left I did not send them back. I told my wife never to take in a parcel again. Brown owed me 3s. 9d. I asked him for it - he said he would send some oats, and that would make all right. Terry was in the cage last week.</p>

In consequence of information I went to Mrs. Wood, in an alley, in Bunhill-row, with Plaistow, early in March - I there found six muskets with our mark on them, a quantity of ramrods, a Dutch barrel, and a barrel guage. Morecock had given me information that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know the muskets? A. They have the mark L. and W., which we always put - we never sold them, for they are not quite finished; they are guns, but not finished - they have no triggers, but they are guns - we had no other outdoor workman - we had six or seven workmen who had goods of this description - there is no mark on the stock, but on the barrel - we never sell them in that state - guns of manufacturers are sometimes mixed, but no man takes in any but his own - this stock has had a mark on it, but it has been sawed off.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. It was my duty to give out stock-guns. I delivered the prisoner out some goods the latter end of the year - we had great confidence in him - we allow those men, whom we have confidence in, to come into the warehouse, but no others - we gave guns out in twenty-five or fifty in a lot, and very seldom give out thirty; such a thing might happen - I bring out five at a time from the warehouse - the prisoner has, perhaps, taken them from my arms, or I might put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310102"/>them just at the door, or he might come into the warehouse - he would take the furniture with them, according to what number he had; the small work is kept up-stairs - he used to take the work away in a truck, which he and a boy brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You deliver them to a boy? A. He sometimes brought a boy with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever send a boy alone? A. He has I believe sent a boy when he has been busy - there was one other man whom we placed confidence in - he would have them delivered out in the same way; the prisoner could not get into the stock-room when I was not there - I kept the key, but I might be at another part of the premises - I do not think he could take twenty-five guns, and the materials without my knowledge - I delivered him the last lot about November - I enter them on a slate, and a clerk enter them in a book - he is not here, but the books are - I know he had some work home in February - all the work, which goes out and comes in, are entered; and these entries have always tallied - I cannot say how long I have left him in the warehouse; he might have taken guns without my knowing it - nobody else is in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he employed by your master the end of last year? A. Yes; I cannot tell how many indoor workmen we had, but we had no out-door workman then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He could not take thirty guns without your knowing it? A. No - he sometimes took his own work himself.</p>

            . I was a gun-screwer in the prosecutors' employ, and left him on the 4th of November. I remember seeing a Dutch gun on his premises. I have since that seen the barrel at Plaistow's. There was a guage there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know it? A. The breech nail-hole is not exactly in the middle - that might happen to others.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you seen it in his premises? A. Ever since I have been there, which is about twelve months, and I left it there - the prosecutors' servants used to come there at times. I do not know whether they could see it - it might be behind other guns.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutors' employ, from October last, till May. I was a screwer - the prisoner gave me one hundred and twenty-one rods, and one black Dutch barrel, and a guage in April - he told me to take them to my own house; I did so, and returned them to him by his order - he came in just as I was going away, and asked if I had any friend, who I could leave them with for a week - I said in two or three minutes that I thought I did know a person; Mrs. Ann Wood, of No. 42, Banks'-court; Blue Anchor-alley, Bunhill-row; he told me to leave them for a week. I took them there; he said he could go for them, and if he said his name was Chambers, she was to let him have them. I told Wood so - I continued to work for him until the 5th of May, I told him what I had done - after this I heard of the prosecutors' being robbed, and gave them information. Mr. Lacy went with me, Ward and the officer, to Wood's. I found the goods in the same state as I left them; we took them out of the cellar there and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known these goods at the prisoners? A. From November - they were not there before; not on the part of the premises where I was. Lacy's servants called occasionally about work - the Dutch barrel was in the cupboard, which was not locked - there were six English guns and one India gun, in the same closet, the room was locked when we were absent. Only two lads worked there besides me - I heard of the robbery about the 2d of May, from a stranger whom I met in Lambeth-street. I did not see the prisoner after that - I worked for him that evening. I thought he had a reason for sending them away - I have been at Birmingham to work since; I gave the prisoner no notice of going - I lived there from June to August last year - I took nothing with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now; how much did you pay him when you returned? A. Twelve shillings for the rent of my room - he did not charge me with any offence. I went to work with him immediately - I had some unfinished work of his before I went.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You worked at piece-work and thought proper to go to Birmingham? A. Yes; I left the prisoners working in town - I took my wife with me, being ill. When I was at the prisoners we worked in the second floor back room, the cupboard was in that room. I returned to work with the prisoner as soon as he had work: which was in October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the prisoner you had left the work unfinished? A. No; he employed me again - the work was always in the open shop.</p>

I was in the prosecutor's employ the latter part of last year - I saw a Dutch barrel there, and have seen the same since at Plaistow's - I brought thirty guns to the prisoner's in a truck the beginning of November - he brought them down the prosecutor's passage himself, and gave them to me - I took them away in the truck - I left them in Fenchurch-street, and Morecock took them the rest of the way.

On the 23d of December we went to Richmond, leaving nobody in the house but the prisoner, Kelly, and Mr. Smith, my brother-in-law; we returned on the 8th of January, and the prisoner said Kelly had been in the habit of having men living and sleeping with her, and unless she was dismissed she would not stay; Kelly was then dismissed; and two days after we sent the prisoner away, not respecting dishonesty but her morals, for doing precisely the same thing. I paid her 5s. I think - I believe there was about 1l. due to her - I have not paid her the rest - it has been demanded - she applied for a character on the 24th of January - my wife gave her a written one - she and her mother came to the house next day, and after that the prisoner summoned me for the 15s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What complaint did Kelly make of the prisoner? A. She said she had taken bread and meat and butter - the prisoner said Kelly had done the same - my wife was confined to her room, or she generally settles wages.</p>

            . I lived as servant to Mr. Hume. The prisoner was there before me - she was cook; while master was away the last time there was victuals sent out; one day I remember a loaf of home-made bread, between a quartern and a half quartern, and about a pound of round of beef - she went out with it, and returned without it; she said it was for her brother John; I told master of it after I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had complained of you? A. Yes; I had my mother there once or twice, and a man once or twice a week - they had victuals there. I said nothing about any money - Mr. Hume sent to me - I went and told him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. By whose advice did you admit this man? A. By Callow's; the man who came to see her, brought the one who came to me. I was summoned in January; I told every thing to Mr. Hume then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you told this did you know you had lost your place through her? A. Yes.</p>

            . On the 16th of April, in the evening, I was going in at McDonald's back gate - and saw the prisoner on a ladder, reaching the pigeons out of their house. I went down to the stable, and when I returned he was on the ground - I asked what he did there, he then went into the tap-room - I went and told McDonald - it was dark. I was going to feed the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 18.</p>

On the 29th of May I left the key in the wine cellar-door; I went down, and missed one bottle from a bin which I had seen safe that morning, it had laid very smooth, and if a bottle was gone I should know it; the wine had been there for six months; the prisoner was my pot-boy, and had access to that cellar; on the day following I left the key in the door on purpose, when he was going down to fetch a pail of water - I afterwards went into my bed-room, and saw him, (while he was washing his pots,) pour some wine out of a bottle, into a pint pot, and drink it - I had before this seen the bottle in the wash-house - I went down, and the bottle was gone - I told my wife; she said, "I will call him to tea;" I then went down again, and found the same bottle filled with gin - I fetched a constable; and he denied the whole of it- I knew the bottle by these two distinct marks of mud on it, which it got in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. But if your bottles had been elewhere, might they not have got some dirt on them? A. Yes - I missed the bottle on the evening of the day he drank the wine; I told him I was going out for an hour, and then I went to my bed-room; I saw it empty after he drank the wine, and I then missed it for about three minutes.</p>

I had seen him on the Friday night before, in Whitechapel, but had no quarrel with him - I said nothing to him; I did not see him do any thing - but Smith came and took me into a hairdresser's shop, and told me to feel my pocket and see if I had lost any thing. I found my pelisse was cut as if with a knife - I lost nothing; I had a silver thimble and pencil there.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM PERKINS. On the 10th of April I was mending a fence by the road side, at <placeName id="t18270531-288-crimeloc1550">South Mimms</placeName>

Barratt then passed by, and dropped a needle-case out of his hat - Adams took it up, and asked if it was mine - I said, "No, it is that man's" - he said,"I wonder what he has got in it" - he shook it, then opened it, and there was a needle in it - he took it out, and said,"Now I'll have a little fun, and get a little beer of him" - he then called to Barratt, and said "Have you lost any thing?" he said "Not that I know of" - he then said "Yes, a needle-case;" he called him back, and gave it to him. Barratt took it, touched his hat, and said, "I am much obliged to you," and was going away - Adams said "What is in it?" - he said"A needle;" Adams said he would bet a pint of beer that there was not. Barrett said he would lay 5s. there was; they went on till they got up to a sovereign. Adams asked me to lay the sovereign - I refused, but through his persuasion I did, at last. I gave Adams my watch to hold against the sovereign - the case was opened, there was a needle and pin in it. Adams then gave him my watch - I said"It is a complete swindle, but if you will go home with me I'll give you the sovereign" - they went 40 or 50 yards. Barrett then attempted to run off - I seized him, and they both struck me violently. Barratt exclaimed with an oath,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310109"/>"Knock his head off." Adams struck me violently, and rather stanned me, but as soon as I could, I cried Murder! and still kept hold of Barratt; they then threatened to kill me if I did not let go. Huntley and other people then came up; and then they gave me my watch and 1s. 6d. which I had laid with the watch. I had them secured.</p>

               <p>BARRATT's Defence. On my way to Barnet I saw the prosecutor in conversation with this man, who is a stranger. I accidentally dropped a case, containing two needles, but did not know it; the prosecutor betted his watch, and 1s. 6d. that it did not contain two needles - it was found to contain one pin and one needle, which he must have placed there - this caused the dispute; he refused to comply, struck me violently, and injured me; after recovering, I returned his watch and money. He demanded 5s. for the insult which I gave him, and went away, but he had me apprehended.</p>

The blow did not hurt me much; I felt my watch go - it was a gold one, and had a gold chain and three seals - it might be worth 40l. or 50l. together; my watch-chain hung out. I saw the person who took the watch, and followed him; it was after the mud was thrown in my eyes that he took it, and whether he came in front of me I cannot say, but I saw him, followed him, and seized him by the shoulder, and am certain that was the person who took it - he had ran about fifteen yards before I took him; he then turned, struck me a violent blow in my mouth, and disengaged himself by struggling; and left a piece of his coat in my hand; I am certain he left it in my hand - I dropped it, pursued, and caught him again, about fifteen or twenty yards further - I then struck him - we had a struggle; he struck me, and he fell from a blow of mine; I fell upon him(this was in one of the narrow streets in St. Giles', I do not know the name) - he then disengaged himself again, and ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get away at that time? A. By struggling on the ground, and crawling on his chest; I followed him again a very little way, and then caught him by the skirt of his coat, and that came off in my hand; I dropped it, and pursued again; he ran about ten yards, and entered a house - I was about to go in, but was surrounded by an immense number of men and women, who had collected; they said if I did I should be most probably murdered, and I declined it; I am not able to say whether the prisoner is the man - I cannot form an opinion about it. I do not know what became of my watch.</p>

            . I am a cooper, in the employ of Mr. Ladd, a wine-merchant, and live opposite to where this robbery was committed; it was in George-street, a most notorious place; I was in the street, going to the permit-office; I saw the prosecutor coming up the street; there was a young woman following him, soliciting him to give her something to drink - that made me notice him; he put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and gave her a shilling - I was three or four yards off; I noticed, at the same time, that the chain and seals hung a long way down Mr. Helder's thigh; Mr. Helder then passed on, and the prisoner was waiting at the corner of a little street, called Ivy-street; immediately on Mr. Helder's coming up, the prisoner drew his watch from his fob; I saw his hand go up; Mr. Helder said, "You d-nation villian!" and immediately pursued him; he ran round the corner; I am quite sure the prisoner is the man - his face was familiar to me; he and his friends live in the same street as me; I lost sight of him for a moment, while they turned the corner; I ran up, immediately, and when I got to the corner Mr. Helder had hold of him, against the wall, endeavouring to take him into custody; the prisoner struggled with him for half a minute I suppose - they both fell on the ground, and Mr. Helder came nearly between my legs; the contention continued altogether about ten minutes; the prisoner's coat was torn almost to pieces in the contention; they came on to the end of Church-lane, and there Mr. Helder knocked him down; he got up again, and ran up the lane; Mr. Helder pursued him, and I saw no more of them at that time; I returned to my own place, because I had left my door open. I attended at Marlborough-street, nearly five weeks afterwards, and saw the prisoner; I was quite certain of his person. I had seen him walk up the street one evening, about three days after the robbery - he merely walked past.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said he lived in the street? A. Yes, with his father and mother; I do not know that they are his father and mother - I did not assist the prosecutor, because I had just recovered from a violent fit of illness - I saw no blow struck previous to taking the watch - I was then five or six yards from the prisoner, and behind Mr. Helder; the prisoner's face was towards me; a blow or push might have been given without my seeing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310110"/>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could a blow have been struck without your seeing it? A. Not if a man had lifted his arm up high; if he had run against him with his hand in his pocket I might not have seen that; if there was a blow it must have been so (making a sort of thrust) - Mr. Helder must be the best judge whether he was struck; I did not see it. The prisoner lives with his friends - I did not give information at any office; but I did to Furzman, the officer, the day following; I both named and described the prisoner, and saw him at the office five weeks after - I may have seen him twice in that interval - Mr. Helder appeared perfectly sober; I was pretty near him, but saw no blow. The prisoner was not an instant in his presence before he took the watch; he was waiting at the corner of the street - all the fighting and struggling I saw was afterwards - I solemnly swear the prisoner is the man, although his life depends on it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see any mud thrown? A. I did not, nor do I think there was any thrown - I did not observe any mud, my attention was so much taken with to the contension.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. HELDER. Q. This was at six o'clock in the evening? A. A little before six. I was going to my sister's in Bedford-square, and going the nearest way; I had dined at two o'clock; the mud, the blow, and the taking of the watch came all in a moment; it was not a raised blow; he struck me in the belly. I think the blow must have been given with one hand, and the watch taken with the other; the same person did both certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you quite certain the blow was given before the watch was taken? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What sort of a day was it? A. A lowery day; it had rained in the morning and the evening before - it was dirty there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was he parish-clerk before the passing of the Act? A. No, after. Mr. Plimley, the vicar, appoints the parish-clerk. Nine trustees form a board - they have appointed a clerk for themselves, that is John Scarr; the prisoner was parish-clerk, but had 12l. a-year for receiving these fees. The church-wardens rendered their accounts when they were called upon, and their accounts are audited by the trustees at their audit committee; there is but one general audit in the year, that is about June; the account is sworn to, and signed by the trustees present; that account should include fees received by the clerk for the burial-ground. There was a struggle between the vicar and the parish about who was to appoint the parish-clerk; it ended in a law-suit giving the vicar the right; the prisoner has had the place ever since. I have not heard of a desire lately to appoint somebody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the bearer of a letter from the prisoner to the Board of Trustees after he was accused of dishonesty? A. Yes. I gave it to the chairman.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The contest was about the parish-clerk? A. Yes - a man named Limming then received the parish fees, and then the prisoner did it. The Vicar always expected the clerk to receive the parish fees. I believe the prisoner attended with his books and vouchers in June, when the churchwardens' accounts were audited. I do not know whether he accounted on oath - the churchwarden did. The prisoner accounted to me once a month, when I was churchwarden - he rendered no other account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he account every month for the receipt of burial fees? A. Yes, and for vaults and tombs - that was his duty, and he did so with me. I was churchwarden in 1819 and 1820. I was a trustee in August 1825.</p>

            . I am a trustee of Shoreditch parish, under the Act of Parliament, and was so the beginning of this year. I was appointed one of the committee to investigate the churchwardens' accounts for the last four years. We had a number of meetings - the business was exceedingly complicated, and took a great deal of time; we began the last week in December, or first in January. Mr. Lane's accounts were investigated - he had been churchwarden, and left off a few weeks after Easter, 1826 - he was churchwarden in 1825. A very long report was made from the committee to the Board, and it was resolved that the prisoner should be prosecuted. I knew nothing of any charge against him before; the investigation was gone into without any idea of a felonious charge. After various applications made to the prisoner, at length these books (looking at them) were produced, under an order from the churchwardens, other applications having failed; here is one containing an account from 1823, to June 1826, it professes to be an account of monies received on account of the churchwardens for graves, vaults, and burials - it contains an account of money received in August, 1825. I have examined it throughout - no credit is given for money received from Mr. Brown, for a grave - there is no account of money received for a grave for Miss Storey - if he received any sum for it, it ought to have appeared here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am at the head of a large establishment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not a teacher of a congregation? A. I am, of the independent denomination. I was elected trustee seven or eight years ago - I attended pretty regularly. I generally saw Mr. Westall there - I cannot say whether he is more active than myself. I never heard him called the King of the parish. I have no wish about who shall.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310111"/>be parish clerk. I never said I would do all I could to get the prisoner moved out - it is very probable I may have said in conversation with the inquiries of the committee, that such a man ought to be turned out. I am ready to admit that; I have no recollection of saying I would do all I could to get him turned out - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say "I should he glad to hear he had run away and fixed his bail?" A. I never did. I said it was more than probable that he would, having done so on a former occasion. I believe the Grand Jury threw out two bills.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you not say, "It matters not; I will have another bill, or I have not done with him yet?" A. I met Mr. Westall, the church warden, on his return from the Grand Jury. I used no such words to him, nor to Mr. Teal - I have frequently talked with Mr. Teal on the subject. I believe I was one of the first who went before the Magistrate - several of us went; I believe Mr. Searr attended as solicitor. Mr. Harmer was applied to - but, I believe, I and the other trustees thought he had neglected us - we attended on the Magistrate three or four times - there was an application to discharge the warrant when the bill was thrown out, we opposed that - Mr. Harmer attended us; we understood that certain links of evidence had not been gone into; and we merely stated, that the case on which the warrant was granted, had not been brough! before the Grand Jury. I think only one charge was investigated by the Magistrate - several were made. The board ordered hand-bills to be printed to cause the prisoner to be apprehended - I believe I gave the order to the printer, he was taken three or four weeks after. I did not send three or four paupers to take him - he was taken by some paupers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any human being, by looking at this book, tell whether the money paid by Brown, for Miss Storey's grave was paid in or not? A. We looked through all the bills which the church warden rendered - no such entry appears either in the book or the bills, this book was obtained by a particular application from the Vicar. The prisoner afterwards applied for the book, to go over it, and give explanations. I believe his application was denied - I do not recollect having any conversation with Mr. Lane; something was said about a vindictive feeling, and I said if a fine of 1s. would answer the ends of justice, I should be satisfied.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were the monthly accounts produced by the prisoner? A. No; by the churchwarden; I saw them - they were in the prisoner's hand-writing; there is no account in any of them for Miss Storey's grave - here are the accounts delivered at the time Mr. Lane was churchwarden, there is no such entry. I believe they are in the prisoner's hand-writing - the names are in ink, but in many instances the figures are in pencil, I only went before the Grand Jury on this bill; when Mr. Westall said the bill was thrown out, I said "The board will not allow the business to rest here - there are too many charges; other bills will be preferred.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this the same charge as the other hills related to? A. No; we could not swear to particular pieces of money in the other cases - what I said about a fine of 1s., was merely to shew that no vindictive feeling actuated us.</p>

            . In 1825 I was a churchwarden. I allowed the prisoner 12l. that year for receiving the dues - he rendered me an account of them; but not regularly, every month - there was sometimes a delay; when they were delivered, they were called over with this book - there is no account of a grave for Miss Storey - it should he there, I presume; but previous to my being in office they were not so regularly kept. I received the sums, entered here, at various times, but not always when the book was given in - he balanced his account at the close of the year; there is no sum of five guineas entered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Though there is no specific entry, can you take upon yourself to swear that neither him nor his wife ever accounted to you for it? A. I cannot tell what he might have paid it from (looking at a receipt for 35l.) - I do not know whose writing this is - here is written, on the back, ten guineas and five guineas. I would not swear this five guineas has never been paid.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled that there was no proof of the money coming to the hands of the prisoner, in the particular specie charged.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Gregory, the solicitor - I went with them to the Bank, and saw the money paid, and from the state the prosecutor was in, I was afraid he might be robbed, and desired the cashier to give him five 50l. notes, as they could be better traced - he put his money into his trouser's pockets - we went into the Mansion-house public-house - Mr. Gregory wished us to stay by him, as he owed him 18l. - we had 3lbs. of beef-steaks and some porter - he put a 20l. note on the table, and I desired the persons there to mind that it was a 20l. - the prisoner was one of the company - I took the note (Heck then called him out) - I think he put his notes back into his pocket - we took a coach in Cheapside, and I went with him to Welbeck-street (the prisoner was on the box) - I saw him take out the notes, which were wrapped up closely - he there paid two 20l. notes - I then went with him to another public-house, staid a few minutes, and then left them, exactly at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Heck called him out, did you go with him? A. No; when he came in he said he was trumps, and had lent the money - I have heard that Heck is absent - the prisoner is a letter-sorter.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY. I am an ironmonger. I was with Bell - his account is correct - I left them at the Mansion-house public-house.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Oxford-street. On the 29th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop with two men and two women, who said they wanted some boots and shoes, and could I give them change for a 50l. note, or they must go into the City - I fitted them all but one man; a young man who came with the prisoner paid me a 50l. note - I asked for the name and address - the prisoner himself wrote in it, "Jones, Bank of England, Prade-street, Paddington," and I wrote "March 29, W. M." I gave the change to the young man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a foreigner there? A. Yes; he came in after the note was produced, I think - when I asked for the address, one of the women said to the prisoner, "Put your name and address."</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Blackman, a linen-draper, of Judd-street; the prisoner came to my shop with two women, the latter end of March, or beginning of April; they bought 2l. or 3l. worth of goods, and he gave me a 20l. note, which I gave Mr. Blackman, who gave him change - I did not ask the prisoner for his address, but he gave it to master, as "Bishop Cromer-street" - I did not see master write the note.</p>
               <p>- BLACKMAN. I remember some persons coming to my shop - I cannot say the prisoner was one - I received the note, and paid it away to Messrs. Leaf and Severs, Old Change; he mentioned the name of Bishop - I put my initials on it, when I paid it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear to that note? A. Yes - because I had no other at that time; I paid it away eight or nine days after - I had no other 20l.; I only know I paid them the same note; I sent it by my man; I have not been to see if Bishop lives in Cromer-street.</p>

            . In April last I lived with the prisoner Plummer, in Pettiford-court, Drury-court, Strand - the prisoner Harman lived with Condell, in Grange-court, Clare-market. On Monday night, the 2d of April, I was at Condell's, in Grange-court, with Plummer - Condell and Harman were there; I heard Condell ask Plummer to go with him to Mr. Wood's; I had heard it mentioned two or three nights before; Condell said they could go and get money at Mr. Wood's, and would Plummer go with him, and it was agreed that we should meet on that Monday night. On Monday night Condell asked Plummer to go with him - he said they were to open the door of an empty house next door, and get in from the roof of the house; I went with them - Condell did not say I was to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Condell and Plummer go out on Sunday night? A, Yes; they came back, and said they had been to Mr. Wood's, but could not do it, as there were women about. On Monday we went and had tea at Condell's, when he asked Plummer to go; he said he did not mind; I and Harman went with them; we set out about eight o'clock or a little after - we went on to Thompson's, in Holborn, and there had some gin; Harman said she should like to go with them - Condell said he did not mind, and it was agreed we should all go together; we went straight to Mr. Wood's- I think it had struck nine when we got there; it was dark - I did not know the house; Condell pointed out the empty house, but did not go in then; we went and had some beer at a corner public-house, and staid there till about ten o'clock; we then came out, and walked up and down. - Condell said, "It is too soon yet;" we all four walked about till near twelve o'clock; Condell then opened the door of the empty house, with a crow-bar; there was no one about at that time; a coach was going by, which prevented the noise being heard - the door opened a little way, and they put in pieces of wood; Condell and Plummer went into the house - Harman and I staid outside - it was agreed before that we should not go in. The door was fastened after they went in - Harman tried it; we two then went straight home. We left our place again about four o'clock, and got there about five; they had not desired us to come back; we went of our own accord; it was them just daylight. We went up to the empty house; there was a coach going by at the time - Harman coughed, as a signal for them to come out, and they came out with two bundles; they said they contained lace; we passed over to St. John's-square; Plummer gave me one bundle, and Condell gave Harman the other; we took them to Condell's lodging; Harman said, when any one came by, "We had better make haste, or we shall be too late for the coach." We got to Condell's near upon six o'clock; Condell opened the bundles there - there was a great deal of lace, caps, and veils; there were three coats; Condell had one of the coats on when he came out of the house, and a pair of trousers on; there were three pairs of trousers; Plummer also had a pair of trousers on; there was some necklaces and bracelets; Harman gave me some of them - they opened them all, and put them into a box in the room; there was some lace, veils, and caps, tied in a yellow handkerchief; there was also two umbrellas; I went out, and pawned a pair of trousers, and Harman went and pawned a coat at Cameron's; I went into the shop, and Harman into the box; Condell asked me to pawn them - we went straight home to Condell's lodging. The officers came there as soon as we had done our breakfast; they handcuffed us three together, but Plummer was not there; he had gone out about two minutes before they came; Avis broke the box open, and Clements found the bundle. A man named Williams came there, and had some tea and gin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Nineteen last Saturday; I have come from the House of Correction; I have been there nine weeks; I am an unfortunate girl; I first told this story on Easter Saturday - I had then been in custody a week and a few days; I was the first to communicate it; the officers did not ask me to do it; I have no annuity, or any thing but what my mother sends me - she has 2l. a month for me, but keeps it till I am of age - Mr. Oliver pays it. I have come here to save myself, not to save my annuity; I know I should lose it if I was convicted. - Plummer is nineteen years old to-day.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long had you known Plummer? A. I had lived with him for twelve months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after they went into the house did you remain there? A. Five or ten minutes; we then went home, and when we went in the morning we waited about ten minutes before they came out.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. I think it must have taken them an hour to break into the house.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Tuesday morning, the 3d of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I and Clements went to Condell's lodging, in Grange-court, into the front parlour, on the right-hand; we found Condell, Harman, and Vandevelde there; I went up to Condell, said I wanted him, and handcuffed him; Clements took the others; I found a number of articles in this box (producing it) - I found a crow-bar, a picklock, a centre-bit, and punches - they are such tools as house-breakers use; it is not a complete set; I have had the property ever since. Condell said the box belonged to him; I asked him for the key - he said he had lost it, and that the box had been brought that morning, by two men, named Welch and Smith (Vandevelde was there); I asked Condell if he knew where they lived - he said No; he said the implements were brought in by the same men; I then got Mrs. Westcoat to search the women; she gave me a duplicate, which she said she took from Vandevelde - also a pair of bracelets, and in amber necklace; Vandevelde said Harman had given them to her - Condell was present. I also found in a cupboard in the room, some duplicates of lace, and different things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were all in Condell's lodging? A. Yes. A pair of blue trousers were found on Plummer.</p>

I have laboured hard through life, but I have had the misfortune to become acquainted with this wretched character, who is trying to swear away my life - I have kept her by my industry, little knowing her extravagant ways - she has had acquaintances at my lodgings, which I was utterly ignorant of. She has had a brother found guilty at this bar; another brother, a reputed thief, and herself, a common prostitute, I trust you will consider these things, and that she has been prompted to attempt to prove this to work my destruction.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Plummer a very good character.</p>

I went all over the warehouse the evening before, at seven o'clock, and at eight the next morning, I was told by one of my boys that the house was broken open; the persons had broken through a trap door which led to a loft, and from thence to my warehouse; they could not break the warehouse door, but broke through the ceiling; there was an empty house adjoining, and a pair of trousers, and one or two duplicates were found in that house. I lost a number of articles, worth 60l. or 70l.</p>

            . About three nights before Mr. Balfour was robbed I heard a talk about it. I and Harman staid at Condell's lodgings while Condell and Plummer went to Mr. Balfour's - it was one Sunday evening, about eight o'clock at night - they returned about six in the morning, and said they got into the empty house, and got in at the roof of the house; they had taken a dark-lantern with them, also two crow-bars and some pieces of wood; they brought back some cloth, and some silk, a shawl, some breeches, waistcoats and cambric. Condell gave me some cambric, which I pawned at Mr. Cameron's, for 3s. (two or three weeks after - I have lost the duplicate - Harman was there at the time.</p>

About eight o'clock in the evening of the 9th of May, I was sitting in my shop, near the window, where the snuff-boxes were in a paper case - a pane of glass was cut, which was quite whole before this; I did not hear the cutting, but I saw the case drawn out about two inches; I saw two boys at the window, and could distinguish their features, as there was a great light from the gas; the prisoner was the biggest of the two. I went to the door, and took hold of the prisoner; the other ran away with the boxes; I should think it was light enough to see a person's features. I did not see more than the two boys.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of May, at a quarter past nine o'clock, I was serving a lady, and heard a report of a pull, which pulled these stockings down, they hung about two feet within the door, and were pinned with two strong pins. I turned my eye, that way and missed them. I made no noise, but pursued the prisoner, who I caught sight of about ten yards from the house, and stopped him forty yards off with the stockings rolled up in an apron, which was tied before him - there were two others in his company. I had see the prisoner before, and cautioned him to be careful.</p>

To the best of my belief it was - I recollect giving him the 6d. over - I had received parcels from him before, and am certain he brought these - I am sure I gave him one shilling.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Sepulchre. I took Marshall into custody about a month ago - I neither threatened nor promised him any thing - I told him I took him for making bad entries in Mr. Hearn's book - he told me, at the top of Newgate-street, that he was drawn into this case by the two porters, Oulds and Satchell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What case? A. This case of felony - he said, "I was drawn into it by the two porters" - this was as he was going to Guildhall, to be examined on this charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he was first taken did he say any thing? A. He fell down on his knees to Mr. Hearn, who said, "I do not want any of that nonsense."</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to S. JESSOPP. Q. Do you keep the accounts of the office? A. I receive all monies from the porters - this would be entered in the book B.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you receive it? A. Oulds comes to me and accounts for monies he receives for different parcels - Marshall enters it in the book B. I check it off from that book into the cash-book - when Oulds brings the money he pays it to me only - he ought to do it every night; but never less than every other night - he might bring me 3l. or 4l. I have an account of the payment made on the 31st of March, be paid me 4l. 14l. 8d., - I entered that in my cash book, it is not here; it should appear in this book B - the items are entered here and the different sums. I and Oulds cheque them off from the delivery book B. Marshall had nothing to do with the money - he was only to enter the parcels and deliver the tickets to Oulds.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then, when goods arrive from the country. does Marshall take an account of them and make out the tickets for the porters to deliver? A. Yes; he enters on the ticket the amount charged - and in the evening the porter gives me what he has received, and I tick it off in this book. I enter the gross sum in the cash-book - the fraud could not be effected but by the joint operation of Marshall and Oulds - if Marshall had entered the 4s. in the book, Oulds must have accounted to me for it; as it would have drawn my attention to it, and I should have had to demand the 4s. of Oulds.</p>
               <p>MARSHALL's Defence. (written.) I have just to say, that if I made out the tickets it was with proper charges, and if anything happened afterwards the account was made to Jessopp; I knew nothing about it. I have a wife and four children to support.</p>
               <p>OULDS' Defence. The way of settling was sometimes twice a week or oftener. As soon as we settle the book we cut the leaves out. I had no opportunity of knowing whether any money was deficient - if any was short I had to make it up.</p>

He had a delivery-book, which he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310121"/>took it out that day, I cannot say - Marshall made that book out, as he called the parcels over to the porter - the leaves are all here - as soon as they are full they are taken out and filed - they are all here - the goods of this date are entered here, but these are not there.</p>

On Saturday evening, about half-past seven o'clock, I was on the wharf, and saw the prisoner in George-alley, about fifty yards off, walking from the premises, with a large bag. I went and stopped her, and found this iron in it - she said a waterman had given it to her; but she had taken it off a pile on the wharf - I know one of the pieces well.</p>

            . I am an officer of Cripplegate. On Thursday, the 12th of April, I went there in consequence of information, at a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Woolf's premises, <placeName id="t18270531-327-crimeloc1762">No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310123"/>11, Aldermanbury</placeName>

I have reason to believe he threw it at me, but it did not hit me - I followed, till he got to Moor-lane, in the parish of Cripplegate without, and then I secured him, with the assistance of others - I suppose he had run near a quarter of a mile - I brought him back to the watch-house, in Aldermanbury - I found on him eight skeleton keys, a little jemmy, a knife, and a piece of string; the other officer, who was with me, picked up a crow-bar in the street - I accused him of coming from Mr. Woolf's; he said he had not, I was mistaken; we placed him in the Computer - I and the officer came back and opened Mr. Woolf's door, with one of the skeleton keys which we found on him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he carry anything with him out of Mr. Woolf's? A. No; when we opened the door there were nine ends of cloth, tied together, ready to be thrown into a cart - on the right-hand of the warehouse is a door which goes into a passage that appeared to have been attempted to be broken open - the wood-work of the partition was broken away. I went on further, and found another door, which was open, and the patent padlock broken off; on the counter there were eight more ends of cloth tied together the same way as the others and with the same sort of string - there was a piece of striped cotton and a piece of sheeting; this is some of the string I found on the prisoner - it is the same as that the cloth was tied with - it does not belong to the prosecutor. I found a great quantity of string on the prisoner; the property removed was of great extent - some was in the passage and some on a shop-board in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great many persons passing? A. Yes; it was not possible that any other person could have come out, and I mistake the prisoner for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you been an officer? A. About fifteen months. I found this key opened the door. I saw the other officer open the door. I saw him come out; there were several people in the street - the lamps were alight; he walked out of the house and shut the door - there were no persons between him and me - when he walked away there were three or four persons at one corner and another. I did not lose sight of him, as the street he went down was opposite - there are several turnings between the prosecutor's house and Moor-lane; but I did not lose sight of him - there were two other officers following him. I did not pick up the crow-bar - it was brought to the watch-house. I was not more than two or three yards from him, while he was running. I struck him once or twice, but could not lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he run immediately he left the house. A. No; he walked across the road. I could not take him- he was about three yards from me; I could not reach him. I began to run and so did he.</p>

            . I have been an officer for fifteen years. I was with Henman and another officer. We went there by design. I saw the prisoner come out of No.11; he walked across the street, into Philip-lane; Henman stepped pretty quick after him - I followed, and Neal came after me- when we came to the end of Philip-lane I heard a piece of iron fall; a young man took it up; I took it from him, Henman ran down London-wall, up Aldermanbury-postern, across Fore-street, and up Moor-lane; I lost sight of him, but when I got into Moor-lane Henman had got him; we took him to the watch-house, and found these skeleton-keys on him - I am sure he is the same person. I went back to the premises, and found them in the state that has been described; I opened the door myself, with this key; the string round the parcels corresponds with this found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there not thousands of pieces of string like this? A. I suppose there may be; there were no persons by the side of the door, but there were others at the top of the street, and some at the bottom; I suppose there was no person nearer than fifteen or sixteen yards from the door when the prisoner came out - Henman was about three yards from him. I heard him shut the door - he took time to do that; the door was shut I know before he came out; I believe Henman was not certain whether he belonged to the house or not - that is what I understood; we have not particularly talked this business over - we have spoken of it, but I never think much of it after a prisoner is taken up, till he is tried. I lost sight if Henman while I stopped to get the crow-bar; I suppose he was then two or three yards from the prisoner; it is a straight line into Phillip-lane - there is no turning there; I lost sight of the prisoner directly almost; I only saw Henman and him in Philip-lane; he was not more than three or four yards from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Corners, or no corners, do you state, upon your oath, that is the man who came out of the house? A. Yes, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there any other person came out of the house? A. No. A cart came about eight o'clock, and stood by the door-way.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with the other officers, and saw the prisoner come out of the house - he shut the door after him; what they have stated is correct; these tools were found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What distance were you from the house? A. About five yards; the lamps were alight; there was a lamp just over the house - he crossed the road, into Philip-lane; I was in the middle of the road when he came out; I did not see him taken - I can swear to him, from seeing his face, and seeing him come out of the house; I could not seize him - he was about five yards from me; I did not run at him.</p>

On Thursday, the 12th of April, I left the warehouse at about half-past four o'clock. or a quarter before five, perfectly locked up and secured; I went out at the side door - there was a door leading from the passage to the warehouse - it fastens inside; there is a bar, two bolts, and a double lock in the middle warehouse; there is another door, with a bar and a padlock, which is here. When I went out I fastened the street door with a double lock - I had left all the woollen cloth safe in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310124"/>warehouse, as usual, not tied up with string, nor in the passage, but in the cases, and the lined cloth also. I heard of the robbery afterwards, and went to the warehouse; I overtook Mr. Woolf and the officers - when I got there I found the property tied up in bundles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave any one in the warehouse? A. No. It was Mr. Woolf's dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>MOZELY WOOLF. I am a warehouseman - my warehouse is at No. 11, Addle-street, Aldermanbury - I am sure I do not know whether it is in the parish of St. Mary-the-Virgin or no; it is my dwelling-house; my servant sleeps there at night, to guard the property; he sleeps there as my servant; he leaves at five o'clock to go to dinner; he calls at my house in Goodman's-fields, and returns at nine o'clock to sleep there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES WEBB. Q. Did you sleep there that night? A. Yes, with the officer; I slept there the night before; I am always in the habit of sleeping there; I have slept there about eleven weeks altogether; I have slept away, and had slept there about a month before the removal of these goods, but will not swear I slept there constantly; I can swear I did not sleep out of it for four nights in that month; I do not dine or drink tea in the house, but I sleep there to take care of the things.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. WOOLF. Q. At What hour was your attention drawn to this warehouse? A. The officer came, and told me of it about ten o'clock, and I went there; I lound my clothes tied up by threes, and a number of things removed; one piece of sheeting was very much cut with some instrument; there were three hundred or four hundred yards of cloth and kerseymere removed, to the amount of 170l.; my servant slept there by my orders since Mr. Fanchard left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did he sleep there to take care of your property? A. Yes, that was my object; he was my porter then; he does other things, such as clean boots and shoes, and knives; he slept in the warehouse to take care of the property; I live at No. 26, Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields, not at the warehouse; I do not intend to remove there; I have lived in Mansell-street ten years; it is at Mansell-street he acts as my domestic servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have sent him there to take care of your goods, and watch the house at night? A. I do not sleep at the warehouse; Goodman's-fields is where I eat my meals; I have taken a lunch, and have dined at Addle-street; if I were asked where I reside, I should say, from such a time to such a time, I should be at Addle-street, and other times at Goodman's-fields; my servant sleeps there, and does other things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have occasionally eat your meals there? A. Yes; and this man is to do any thing there which I bid him; I have no bed there myself.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PEGG. I was coming from Drury-lane with my wife on the 2d of May - I was in Pickett-street, and a person came to me and asked if my name was Johnson; I said No, and came on to <placeName id="t18270531-328-crimeloc1768">Temple-bar</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say you were a little in liquor? A. Yes; I had not seen the two persons together who asked me the question; I had a quarrel that evening, and had been fighting at the Blue Anchor public-house, in Feathers-court, about half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. You were very drunk, I believe? A. No; I was rather stupid with liquor - I saw my watch go.</p>

            . I was with my husband - he was stopped by a person in Pickett-street, but I had not hold of his arm at that time, and do not know any thing about it - I had been at the Feathers, and saw Lyall there, leaning against the table - I should not have known Lyall, but he walked all the way close behind us, and before we got to Temple-bar he tapped my husband on the shoulder - I had not hold of his arm, and did not hear what he said; when we got on to Temple-bar Lyall took hold of the flap of his coat, and said, "Is your name Johnson?" I said, "No, you blackguard," and then he took the watch and ran up Shire-lane; I ran after him, and he turned to the left - I am sure he is the man who was in the public-house, and who took the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. You say that when he took the watch he said something about Johnson? A. Yes; I never went to a public-house to find out the man. I have said the man had blue on, but I knew him by his face. I saw him again in about an hour, when the officer brought him into the public-house. I did not point out a man of the name of Heath.

I saw Batty accost him first; but was not near enough to hear what he said; I then missed sight of them - I went through the gate-way and went on to Fetter-lane.

I put my hand to protect it, and in a short time I felt a hand at my pocket. I put my hand down and missed my handkerchief. I turned round and saw the prisoner putting his hat on his head, in which I saw a handkerchief. I said "You have my handkerchief;" he said "I have not." I said "I know you have, and I insist upon seeing it, if not, I will call the Marshalman." I put my hand to his hat, and he showed me a silk hand - kerchief, and said "Is this yours." I said No - mine is a cotton one." I called the Marshalman, and the case was heard - this is the handkerchief - it was in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. On what business had you gone there? A. To make an affidavit; the prisoner was behind me; I felt a hand at my pocket, but I cannot tell what hand it was; there was a crowd of people, some before and some behind me; I turned round, and the prisoner was putting his hat upon his head; no person could have stooped behind me; there was not room - it was not a pressure behind me, it was a fumbling; it might have been done by a person raising his hand up from the ground, but the prisoner was upright when I saw him; he might have stopped and raised a hand from the ground, but I should think he could not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he deny having it? A. Yes; and he told the Lord Mayor that I said the silk handkerchief was mine - I said I did not; the cotton one was mine - he told the Lord Mayor he picked it up, but he could not, there was not room.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. But how do you known he could not have stooped? A. Because the people were so pressed together; he had a silk handkerchief of his own and mine in the bottom of his hat; his handkerchief covered mine; I took mine out of his hat; it has never happened to me to feel any thing under my feet, and to mistake another handkerchief for my own; he, I understand, had been a person in a respectable situation in life, but has left his family.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found this handkerchief on the floor, and took it up; the prosecutor turned round and took hold of my handkerchief, and said, "This is mine" - I said, "It is not" - he then took hold of the one I had found, and said, "This is mine" - he then gave me in charge.</p>
