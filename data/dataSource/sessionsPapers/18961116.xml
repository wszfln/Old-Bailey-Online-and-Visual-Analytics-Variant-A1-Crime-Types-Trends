Berger's manufactory, at Homerton—I had spoken to Mr. Garston, the manager, and we were watching the gate of the factory—I saw the prisoner drive up in a horse and cart in company with another man; in the bottom of the cart was a sack, apparently full—the prisoner is a greengrocer and carman—the prisoner got out of the cart and entered the factory by the gate—I remained there while he went inside—he was inside for a minute and a-half; he then came out, crossed the road hurriedly, got up in the cart, and drove off at a rapid rate—I came out of my hiding-place, got up in a cart, and drove after him; Lee remained there—I went to the prisoner's house; when I got there the sack had been taken from the cart into a room at the back of the shop—I asked him what he had got there; he shot out the gloves, twenty-six pairs—I produce one pair; I should say they are new—some, not all, are tied together at the top; about half may be so tied—I examined the gloves; some of them are marked "W.H.G.C."—apparently an attempt has been made to erase the name, especially as to the others—this pair is apparently new—they are all new—I asked the prisoner where he got them from—he made a statement; he said, "I will tell you the truth and all about it, if you listen;" this is the statement (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I, William Wilkes, of 16, Vallance Road, Hackney Wick, state that on several occasions I have bought gloves from a man named Jemmy Finch, of Bromley. He is a stoker, and works at the West Ham and other gas factories. The gloves are the same as these produced. I always give him 8s. a dozen. The gloves, I believe, are collected by Finch from stokers at West Ham and Beckton. About two and a-half years ago Finch told me the gloves in future would be marked, as so many had been</p>

               <p>seen outside the works. I told him they were no use to me if they were marked, as nobody would buy them. Since then he has brought me some not marked, several times. I used to buy some off the foreman at Bromley gas works, but he is dead; his name was Samuel Haynes. About two months ago Finch brought me some; they were marked G. L. G. C. I refused to have them. I have bought some off the foreman at West Ham, but I don't want to get him into any trouble. I did buy some off Finch two months ago, and those I sold to Berger and Son. I signed that receipt you have got ('B' <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). I have also bought some off Alfred Moore; he works at West Ham gas works, and lives in West Ham Lane. I have also bought some from stokers who work at Beckton gas-works, but I don't know their names; but I don't think they were stamped. This afternoon I went to Berger and Son's factory, Morning Lane, and saw Mr. Andrew's, the foreman. I said, 'I brought some gloves.' He said, 'There has been a row about them. The governor thinks. they are stolen. If I was you I should take them back home, and send word up to say you have not got any. I left the factory at once. There was two dozen and two pair. I bought them off Finch; they are not marked."—I have not been able to find Finch—I have made inquiries—I arrested the prisoner on the night of September 5th—I told him the charge was receiving—he said, "It is a very bad job"—I have also received from Messrs. Berger thirty-two pairs of gloves, four pairs of which are marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether Finch is still working at the gas works—I made inquiries, and they told me he was not there—when I went to the prisoner's house he took the gloves out of the sack and threw them on the floor—I saw the thirty-two other pairs of gloves on the Thursday at Berger's—I left the twenty-five pairs at the prisoner's house, after taking one pair away with me, and they were there when I returned on the following Saturday; they had not been removed—I produce one pair of gloves coming out of the sack—the others were handed to me by Messrs. Berger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the last witness—some few weeks ago the prisoner told me that he was going to sue a company, which he was manager to, because he could not get his money; I said, "The governor will do it for you;" that was on October 13th—he also said that he thought he would put another matter in his way, as he had some money coming from New Zealand—this was about 5 or 5.30—he came to the office door and asked me to come out, while he spoke to me about the company Mr. Terrell came up the stairs, and I said, "Here is Mr. Terrell"—this was on the 13th; I goby the call-book; these are my initials; that is an indication that I saw him first, and then my principal—he told me he was coming into some money, and I may have said, "If you want money; why don't you ask the governor?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am married to the prisoner, but I am his deceased wife's sister—on October 14th I answered the door to the postman, and took in a letter—I took it into the kitchen; he opened it and read it—I said, "That is another application for rates"—he said, "No, it is another on letter from New Zealand"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter and envelope—Tuesday, October 13th, we went out together at ten o'clock and re<lb/>turned at five; I never lost sight of him all chat time—we were in the City about eleven a.m., near Finsbury Pavement—we were not there again in the afternoon—I do not know Mr. Tyrrells office; I have never been there; I have heard of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CURTIS</hi>. In January, 1895, the prisoner told me that he had a share in the estate of his aunt in New Zealand, and I took some instructions from him—I asked if he had any correspondence; he brought me a bundle of correspondence, and in February I communicated with New Zealand, and an answer arrived in March, stating that the lady was alive.</p>

I am a domestic servant at 63, Weston Park, Crouch End—about the end of July or the beginning of August the prisoner called at the house and asked me if I would subscribe to the Free Meals and Fresh-air Fund for Poor Children at Stepney—he said, "I come from Stepney, from Dr. Carlisle, of Dalgleith Place, Stepney"—I gave him a penny; he wrote something in a book, and went away—he came back in two or three days, and said he was going to take some poor children to Weymouth—I told him if he would make me out a paper I would get what I could, possibly—a little while afterwards he brought me this paper. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi>" £2 <hi rend="italic">wanted to send twenty poor children for a week. Address.

                  </hi>. I am an Austrian, and a naturalised subject here—I have traded as a money-lender and bill-broker at 131, Jermyn Street—in April, 1896, Bentley introduced Francis and Rowell—about April 15th I saw Francis and Rowell at my office—Bentley said Francis was the son of a General in India, and Francis confirmed it—Bentley said Rowell was a widow, and was entitled to £60,000 from an uncle, and to two houses,</p>

               <p>76 and 78, Brewery Road, settled by an aunt—Francis said he was trustee to the settlement—I was told the aunt was about eighty-three or eighty-four years old—Bentley showed me these letters (Nos. 12 and 13) about two weeks afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 12 <hi rend="italic">was dated from</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Park Place, St. James's, March</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1896, <hi rend="italic">and asked Mr. Bentley whether he could do any<lb/>thing in the matter of a lady who was raising a loan of</hi> £2,000 <hi rend="italic">on freehold property</hi>, 76 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 78, <hi rend="italic">Brewery Road, Hottoway, of the present value of £2,800 settled on her by her aunt, aged eighty-three; and stated that the matter was in order; the solicitors were Munk and Co., of 40, Broad Street House; the security was absolutely clean, as far as borrowing was concerned, a fact which, as trustee, the writer, Francis, could answer for; No.</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">was dated from Broad Street House, and dated March</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th, and was to the effect that Mrs. Firman, of Brewery Road, had settled upon their client, Mrs. Rowett, two freehold houses in Brewery Road, the rentals of which were</hi> £60 <hi rend="italic">a year each, and that Mrs. Rowell had instructed them to negotiate for a mortgage of her interest to the extent of £1,500, which they expected to carry through within the next two or three weeks; it was signed Munk and Co.</hi>) On April 14th, after the conversation at my office, I went with Francis and Rowell to the office of Munk and Co., solicitors, Broad Street—I there saw Jones—Bentley introduced me to Jones, and said, "This is Mr. Jones"—I said I saw written on the door, "Munk and Co; "I thought he was Munk—he said, "Oh, I am a partner to Munk; this is just the same"—I said, "They are stating that you are arranging for them money on the two houses, 76 and 78, Brewery Koad; you are the solicitor; they are stating you are the family solicitor"—he said, "Yes, I am"—I said, "To Mrs. Rowell?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you the family solicitor to her aunt?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you acting?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is the settlement revocable? What is the nature of the settlement, supposing I let her have the money? I might let her have the money, and in another couple of days the aunt might take away the settlement"—he said, "No, that cannot be done, because it is irrevocable; the aunt is responsible for any action she has done through me; you will be safe for the money"—I said, "Did the aunt consent that the niece should charge it?"—he said, "Yes"—he said they were buying a public-house, which was a big bargain, and it was with the aunts consent that she should borrow money on the houses—I said, "How do you know, supposing the houses are already charged?"—he said, "They are not charged; I am the solicitor" to it, and I state to you they are not charged"—I said, "I shall want so that you shall state that her aunt does not charge already"—he said, "Certainly not;" this was a first charge—they wanted £200—I agreed to lend that—this document was drawn up by way of a charge at Jones's office by Jones—I told him what I wanted, and he put it into English; I did not give him the exact words, I could not do so—he started to write the document in the way of a memorandum, and I thought he was a very innocent family solicitor, and did not know how to draw up a document; and I said, "You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> excuse me; I will tell you what I want, and you will put it in English," and I told him what I wanted, and he put it all right—that document mentions a settlement of March 18th, by Louisa Firman upon her niece—from beginning to end of this transaction I</p>

               <p>never saw any such settlement of March 18th—Mrs. Rowell signed this document at Jones's office—for the advance of £5 and £200 I was to take this bill for £300, payable on May 1st—when I was first introduced to Jones it was as the solicitor for Mrs. Rowell, but after he spoke to me very kindly and nicely, I said, "Shall I call my solicitor?" and he said, "If you like; I can act for you," and I said, "I don't mind this"—I think I paid him £1 1s. on that occasion, and he gave me this receipt for it—I left Jones's office and went to the bank, and they cashed this cheque for £200 which I had drawn at my office, and handed over to them in Jones's office—I paid the £5 in Jones's office—I gave this notice of charge, dated April 15th, to Messrs. Munk and Co.—Jones drew it up; it is in his writing—I got this receipt for the notice of charge—I kept the bill for £305—Jones gave me the receipt for the notice of the charge, signed "Munk and Co."—on April 21st I saw Bentley, Francis, and Rowell at my office—they wanted another £100 upon this further charge on the same security—I agreed, and drew these two cheques for £15 and £50, and took this bill for £145, drawn by Mrs. Rowell, and accepted by Francis—the charge recites the same settlement of March 18th, and was executed by Catherine Rowell in Jones's office—it is witnessed by a clerk to Munk and Co.—I did not go there personally then; my clerk went—this is the notice of charge in my clerk's writing, and this is the receipt for that notice. (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the notice, on behalf of Mrs. Rowell, of the advance of</hi> £5, <hi rend="italic">and of the discount of the bill for</hi> £145, <hi rend="italic">and undertaking to repay the</hi> £145, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> £5, <hi rend="italic">in addition to the previeusadvance</hi> of £305, <hi rend="italic">out of the first moneys received by way of mortgage, which was then being negotiated, and as to which they were not aware there was any hindrance to its being carried out in due course. This was signed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Munk and</hi> Co."). On May 1st Francis called, and wanted money and clothes, and he took £50 in money and clothes for himself and Bentley, I and he gave me a bill for £150—this is the cheque by which I made the I advance—I took no charge for that; it was done personally with Francis, because I thought he was all right—on May 9th Francis, Rowell and Bentley called again, and I agreed to make a further advance of £200, and did so by these cheques for £150 and £50—I took a charge by way of this endorsement upon the last charge—I gave the usual notice of charge, and got this receipt of that notice, signed "Munk and Co."—I also took a bill for £600, and got back the bill for £150 which Francis had given on May 1st—I saw Jones myself in regard to that transaction, and got this receipt, signed "Munk and Co.," for £1 1s. costs, written by Jones—on April 15th I asked Jones, "Where are the deeds?"—he said, "They are with the other side's solicitors: you cannot see them now"—I do not think he named the solicitors—after the advance on May 9th I made further inquiries of Jones about the deeds, and said to him, "You are taking of me more money, and they promised me the deeds, and I consider now it is a big amount; I think I am entitled now myself to the deeds, and I might write it low, at five per cent., if you get the deeds, because the amount is a big amount"—he said, "A parson has got hold of them"—I said, "You told me the other side's solicitors"—he said, "76 and 78; one house belonged to the late husband of Mrs. Firman, and as he dropped dead suddenly, there is no question the house is the property of Mrs. Firman, but she must put in order"—he said, "Those deeds the</p>

               <p>old lady gave up to a parson with whom she was acquainted, to take care for her, and this clergyman had put it in the bank, and drawn £80 on it"—I said, "I don't mind to give £80 to get the deeds if this is all the stoppage; it is not worth while"—he said, "Not at all; I can prosecute him"—I wrote him a letter, and he said "The clergy<lb/>man or the solicitor, "I don't remember which, "wrote to me, and promised to return the deeds within a week"—I went to him again another day, and he told me, and a clerk of his also told me, they had already got an appointment on Friday to get the deeds—afterwards I think he told me that the old lady had got the deeds and stuck to them—I had conversa<lb/>tion with Francis and Rowell about the same thing—Francis told me the same thing about the old parson, and said the whole stoppage in the business was through the old parson—Rowell used to say the same thing—Francis gave me this letter (No. 6), from Mrs. Firman, 76, Brewery Road, with a deep mourning border. (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that she was sorry she could not at present send the deeds, as one of the houses was in her deceased husband's name, and his business man was transferring it to her name, and as soon as everything was in form he (Francis) should have everything as he said; she hoped he was looking after her daughter Kate's interest, and all business matters for her, as she was now too old to be troubled with those things; but she felt she could always trust him</hi>). On July 3rd, I had a visit from Rowell, Francis and Jones—Jones brought some deeds under his arm, and said, "Now, you are safe like the Bank of England; you have got a £5 note in your pocket"—that was when, he handed me this settlement (No. 4). (<hi rend="italic">This was a settlement between Louisa Firman, as settlor, and Catherine Rowell and George Herbert Francis, and witnessed and declared that in considera<lb/>tion of natural love and affection and</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Firman granted to Rowell and Francis, and the survivor of them</hi>, 76 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 78, <hi rend="italic">Brewery Road, to have and to hold the premises in trust for Rowell after the death of Mrs. Firman. This was sealed and delivered by Louisa Firman in the presence of Elizabeth Tucker, and by Francis and Rowell in the presence of Jones</hi>)—I said to Jones, "Here is Tucker, a woman; why did not you witness the signature?"—he said, "Oh, this is just the same"—I said, "Suppos<lb/>ing she died; I suppose Mrs. Firman has not got only Mrs. Rowell; she has someone else after her, and they might kick up a row, and say she signed it not with her own will; I should rather like, for safety, as we don't know when the matter is going to be settled, her solicitor to wit<lb/>ness it"—he said, "It does not matter; that is not different; I am a soli<lb/>citor, and I tell you so; my father's will is witnessed by his footman"—he said he had not time to wait for Mrs. Firman's signature; he had got some<lb/>thing else to do; it Was an old woman, and it would take a long time to sign, so he did not want to bother—I kept that document, after he had taken it away and stamped it, and brought it back to me—the date on it is July 3rd—I said to Jones, "My charge is made previous to this date, and you should recite the whole of the previous settlement of March 18th"—he said he had not been able to do it in any other way—afterwards certain further advances were asked for, and I advanced £170, and took these two statutory declarations (Nos. 33 and 34) from Rowell and Francis respectively in Jones's presence. (<hi rend="italic">These were identical, and were to the effect that the signatories were the Catherine Rowell and Herbert George Francis mentioned in the mortgage deed; and that</hi> 76 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 78,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Brewery Road, mentioned in the mortgage, were the absolute property of Louisa Firman</hi>). I got this letter of August 1st from Jones—an arrange<lb/>ment was made with all three prisoners that I should take a mortgage of this property—the mortgage was to be £1,400—this mortgage deed (No. 5) was given to me executed). (<hi rend="italic">This deed was dated July 31st, and was between Rowell and Francis of one part and Honour of the other part; it recited the settlement of July 3rd, and that the two houses were Rowells absolute property under that settlement, and stated that in consideration of</hi> £1,400 <hi rend="italic">advanced by Honour, and,</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">interest, Rowell, an beneficial owner, conveyed to Honour all her interest under the settlement of July 3rd, and she covenanted for herself and her trustees to deposit the title deeds of</hi> 76, <hi rend="italic">brewery Road with him, and she, Francis and Mrs. Firman agreed to pay interest, and undertook not to assign, underlet or part with possession of the premises without Honour's consent. It purported to be signed by Rowell, Francis and Firman in the presence of Elizabeth Tucker and W. Gerard Jones, Solicitor</hi>). This docu<lb/>ment (No. 35) was given me by Jones—before I parted with the money I asked him to write all he knew about it, and he said, "With pleasure"—I said, "You see I cannot get the deeds, and they are delaying, and you want me to part with more money, and I should like to have every<lb/>thing settled by you, because you are a solicitor, and if you state it, I believe it"—it was written in my office—some he wrote himself, and some I asked him to write—I asked him what he told me to put in writing—the whole of it is in Jones's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This, signed "W. Gerard Jones," stated that he was retained by Mrs. Firman in connection with the settlement of</hi> 76 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 78, <hi rend="italic">Brewery Road upon Rowell, which he was instructed to draw, and that he had been retained to act for Mrs. Firman, Rowell, and Francis in connection with the mortgage of those premises to Honour; that he had been consulted by them, and had advised in connection with all the transactions with Honour and the mortgages; that he had seen the deeds relating to the property, which was freehold, and in the name of Louisa Firman; that her title was not encumbered in any way, and that Mrs. Rowell had not mortgaged her interest or tncumbered it in any way, except the prior interest with Honour, which was now to be cancelled</hi>). Upon getting this document and the mortgage deed I gave these three cheques for £625, £500, and £275, making £1,400—my clerk went with them to the bank—the previous bills which were at the bank were taken up with the money represented by the cheques for £1,400, and the difference of £170 Rowell kept—a little while after I saw Francis and Rowell again, about the equity of redemption—Jones brought this document (No. 39), and said he had pre<lb/>pared it—Francis and Rowell said they would sell me the equity of redemption if I gave them another £100—I agreed to buy it, but the document was not executed, because in the meantime I determined to make some inquiry as to the value of the houses before I advanced more money—I sent my clerk to make inquiries, and he came back and reported to me, and then I sent for the prisoners—I told them all three, "I heard it is a beastly fraud; I don't believe it; it is impos<lb/>sible"—Francis laughed at it, and said, "Your clerk has been drunk"—Mrs. Rowell denied it; they all denied it; they were very cool—Jones said, "It is impossible; what! you think I am a fool? I am a gentleman;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189611160023"/>
               <p>I am a solicitor. Do you think I would go in for a thing like this? It is all right"—they laughed at it, and were very cool, and I thought there was some mistake—Jones came alone to see me one day—he said, "I am a gentleman, and everything is all right," and he made a couple of appoint<lb/>ments to go and see Mrs. Firman, but he failed, and in the end he said, "She is an old woman; we should frighten her if we go together; let me go by myself"; and he was supposed to go and see her, and he came to me the day after, and said, "I went to Mrs. Firman, and I told her her position, and I explained it to her; that if she does not give up the deeds we can make her give them up; but it seemed she did not understand at all her position; she thought directly she would give up the deeds she would be turned out of the house, and I explained to her that she cannot be turned out of the house, because the mortgage on the house is only after her death, and then she was satisfied, and she would give up the deeds in another couple of days"—I got no deeds after that—I went to see Mrs. Firman, and after I came back I saw all the prisoners separately—Francis said, "The old lady did not know what she was saying, and Mrs. Rowell gave instructions to the old lady to say nothing; and so she did not say anything. Mrs. Rowell told the old lady, if anybody comes tell them nothing, and so she did not tell you anything, but she did not understand what she was saying; it is her house, and she has the deeds in her possession, and you will find everything all right"—I told Jones that Mrs. Firman had denied all knowledge of this, and the houses were not hers, and she was a tenant, and he said, "I will issue a writ against Mrs. Firman; she is a fraud," and he said a lot of things like that—after that I got this letter (No. 40) on September 12th, from Francis on paper with the heading of a club at Park Place, St. James's. (<hi rend="italic">This, signed "G. Herbert Francis" stated that, with reference to their recent transactions re Mrs. Firman, in the course of next week he should pay</hi> £300 <hi rend="italic">on account of the debt, and that he felt that as it had been made a matter of pure honour, and his promissory notes had been handed back. Honour was entitled to the greatest con<lb/>sideration</hi>). I did not get the £300 mentioned there—I did not get back a farthing of my money—I went to my present solicitor, and this prosecution began—the defendants were com<lb/>mitted for trial some days before the last Sessions here—I paid Jones £15 for costs; I have receipts for £5 and £3—I advanced to the prisoners £775; and then there was £15 for costs to Jones, £10 I lent Francis on one occasion, and £25 the discount of some small bill to Rowell—I advanced over £800 to them, and I paid £120 commission to Bentley—I got none of it back—I believed the statements made to me, in reference to the two houses, that they were the property of Mrs. Firman, who had settled them on Mrs. Rowell; that Francis was the trustee, and that I was taking a security for the money I had advanced—on the faith of that I parted with my money.</p>

               <p>went straight to her, and so I left it all to Jones—I should not have parted with the money if Jones, the solicitor, had not made the state<lb/>ments to me—I have had some dealings in reversions—I cannot say that is my business—I make no distinction in the amount of interest I charge in advances on reversions and on acceptances—I do not charge 600 per cent, on reversions; if people are pleased to give it to me I accept it, that is all—I advanced the money upon the statements made to me—I did not advance the money upon the statement that Francis's father was a General in India, but that statement made me think I should believe his statements; if a man is respectable you trust his statement—I went to see Mrs. Firman, with my clerk—he first went by himself about the neighbourhood, but did not see her—my clerk said to a girl at the door that he wanted to see Mrs. Firman, and Mrs. Firman came out, and he said, "we wanted to know are the houses belonging to you?"—she said, "I am only a tenant, and a monthly"—he said, "Does not 76 belong to you?" and she said, "No"—he said, "I am a Christian, and you are a Christian; we must speak the truth," and I said to her, "We must speak the truth; we want you to tell us, are you a rich woman or not?"—she said, "No"; somebody helped her with 5s. a month—I said, "All I want to ask you is is this your signature?" showing her the mortgage, I think—she said, "No"—I said, "Will you write me your signature?'"—she said, "I am not going to give strangers anything more; I am afraid to give strangers any more information"—I said, "Do you know Mrs. Rowell?"—she said, "I know Mrs. Rowell"—I said, "Did she come to you?"—she said, "She did not come to me, and I do not want to see her"—I asked her whether Mrs. Rowell was her niece—I did not say she said she did not know her—they had told me that she had thirteen cottages somewhere, and asked her, had she got somo cottages—she said, "No; I have not got no cottages"—the defendants had tried to borrow more money from me on the cottages; that was my reason for asking about the cottages—I said, "Have you got some more property?"—she said, "I have some money in the Savings Bank"—I did not say anything to Mrs. Firman about her getting into trouble, or about Francis and Rowell being likely to get into trouble—I asked if she knew Francis—she said she saw him once—I asked her if Rowell was her niece, and she said, "Yes"—it seemed to me Mrs. Firman did not understand what a settlement meant; how could I ask her if she had made a settlement?—I don't remember that these cheques were not cashed on the day the declarations were sworn to, because the bank was closed when the cheques were given—the declarations were sworn on the 31st, I cannot remember the time—I do not think that the declarations were already prepared, so that the cheques should be cashed at the bank before four o'clock—I remember that they took of me £25 as a temporary loan till next day, when they would cash the cheques, as they did want money very badly—I do not think that the declarations were put before the prisoners to sign at the last moment, so that they could get the money at the bank before closing hours; I will swear it was not so.</p>

               <p>tired of swearing; that is my real reason—I do not believe in making the Bible so cheap; I saw so many swearing—my places of business are 131, Jermyn Street and 36, Moorgate Street, and Arthur Street, Covent Garden; nowhereelse—I carry on business under the names of Dent and Honour—I do not go in the name of Shakespear—I think I used that name a very short time in business, three or four years ago—I did not call myself Mil<lb/>ton; that was my manager—I only use those names for the purpose of ad<lb/>vertising, as people object to paying in cheques to their banks signed by names which are advertised in the papery as money-lenders; when I come to know people I never deny my name is Honour, and nearly all my clients know that that is my name; there is no secret in it—I did advertise in the name of Shakespear—I cannot say that when I started business in England I used the name of Shakespear, because I started a perfumery business (which I have still) in the name of Honour—when I started the money-lending business in England I used the name of Shakespear—I do not use the name of Milton—at my Jermyn Street premises there is painted up "Milton, Manager"—my clients want everything strictly private—my clerk's name is Winters, but he took the name of Milton, because his name is known in the money-lending trade, and it is for the benefit of our clients and for adverting—when we do business we tell the client our name is Honour, and we sign the bills Honour—my name is Honour, I swear; it is the translation of my real name, <hi rend="italic">Ehrlich</hi>—Bentley, who introduced this business to me, is also called Bentote—I have known him two or three years—he has sometimes brought me business; I cannot say how often—I should think he is a money-lender's tout—I don't think he id here; I have not seen him—I see him frequently—I think I saw him a week ago in London; I do not know where he is now—I have not taken any steps to secure his attendance here—before producing the letter, Bentley verbally gave me the account of this matter, and who Francis and Rowell were—he said Rowell was entitled under this settlement to these two houses—he got £120 from me—I don't know that he had something from Francis, and I have not heard it, but I should say he did—Bentley at the time was under committal for trial on a charge of fraud; I knew that—I did not understand that he was getting this money to assist him in his difficulties—he has not been convicted, I think—he had no office on April 15th, but about June, I think, he had an office, after this happened—all agents are anxious to get money—Bentley went with me on April 15th to Jones's office, and introduced me—I don't think I under<lb/>stood from Bentley that he had already been to Jones's office and seen him—Bentley gave me this letter from Munk and Co. after the first interview, in conversation; he gave it me a couple of weeks after April 18th—I had not seen it when I made the first advance on April 15th—when I went to Jones's office I should think there were a couple of clerks there, and I saw someone I identified as Mr. Munk, I think; he walked behind us, knocking about the office; I did not know it was him at the time—I asked for Mr. Munk, and they told me he was out—I have seen him now—I think I saw him at the office on that day, but he has not been introduced to me—I saw more than one clerk—I think, when we were discussing the terms of the document that was to be drawn up, the shorthand writer was present, because he was called in to take down what I wanted; and Jones</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189611160026"/>
               <p>said, "Tell him what you want, and I will put this in English"—the clerk took down in shorthand what I wanted—I don't remember if he went into the next room and wrote it out—I know Jones wrote it in his writing, but I do not remember what happened—I still swear that Jones wrote out the whole of this charge of April 15th in my presence—the shorthand clerk did not take it down and go into the next room, and write it out, and bring back this document; this is in Jones's writing—I cannot tell whether that man (McNair) is the clerk who took it down in short-hand; I would say he is not; I will not be responsible for this—Jones never denied to me that he wrote this letter, signed "Munk and Co."—Jones did not point out to me on April 15th, when the clerk was in the room, or at any time, that the settlement was only signed in draft—I saw a draft of it; my solicitor has it—it was handed to me by Jones nearly at the end of the business, before the settlement of July 3rd—I do not know what you mean by draft—I do not call this the draft, because he wrote to me: "A fair copy of the draft of the within settlement was signed by Mrs. Firman, in the presence of a witness, on May 18th, 1896. Mrs. Firman has received notice of the advance made to Mrs. Rowell by Mr. Victor Honour"—this has been endorsed to me to keep me quiet, be<lb/>cause I asked him very much for the deeds—when this was handed to me I did not understand from Jones that Mrs. Firman had signed a draft of the settlement only up to that time; she signed a settlement—this is a draft, but a copy of it is a settlement—I swear that on April 15th there was no conversation or statement about this settlement only having been signed in draft, because he says he was negotiating a loan, and a loan cannot be negotiated on nothing—I told Jones he was not drawing up a document in the right form, and corrected it—I said, "Shall I have a solicitor?" and he said, "No, I can act for you also"—Jones did not say to me, "You ought to be represented by a solicitor"—I think I said that I can take care of myself, because he said to me, "You should be a solicitor"—he flattered me, and I said, "Well, I can take care of myself"—I thought at that time I could take care of myself, and did not want a solicitor; if it is a straightforward way, I can take care—he has been my solicitor—I asked Jones to register this deed of settlement at the Middlesex Registry, and he took it of me to register it, and search if there were not other charges on it—I think he registered the settlement in the Middlesex Land Registry—I called several times at his office to ask him for the deeds, but I don't think I called on July 9th—I called on one occasion, when the same clerk who was there on July 3rd was pre<lb/>sent—Jones did not tell me in the clerk's presence that he had tried to get the deeds until he was sick of doing it, or that excuses were constantly being made by Francis and Rowell for not bringing them—I swear he never said it in that way; he might have said it in some other way; he did not say, "Excuses have been made"—he told me not to part with any money if he was not present, and he said, "I will take care of you; you are a foreigner, and I will protect you"—he advised me to buy the equity of redemption—at one of the interviews I suggested to Jones that he should write to Francis, saying that I was going to consult another solicitor—he suggested it to me—he said, "If I write a letter to Mr. Francis, that you are going to another solicitor, and are worrying for the</p>

               <p>deeds, I think it will bring them up"—we spoke of it together, and I thought they were trying to get on the deeds money from someone else; that was what he suggested also—of course, I considered him as a friend of mine, and I thought I would stick to him; and he said he would write a letter—it must have been said that doing it might frighten them into bringing the deeds—I think a letter was then written out in my presence by Jones to Francis.

               <p>again—when you have let your certificate lapse you must get a certificate from a practising solicitor before you can renew it, and he was going to get one from me—besides him I had two clerks, McNair and Dolman; they had authority to sign letters in the name of Munk and Co., connected with business in the office—for some time after taking the office in the City I kept on that in the Haymarket, and then I had notice to treat from a railway; I was at my office in the City every day—McNair and Dolman, have occasionally signed "Munk and Co." without adding "p.p.," and their initials, though, as a rule, they add them; it was generally unim<lb/>portant letters they so wrote—I had not done business for Honour prior to April 15th, but since then there are two entries of instructions to sue people—Jones gave me the particulars, and letters for payment were written—I knew something was going on in the office in connection with Francis and Rowell—very probably their names are entered in the call-book—the initials of the person who saw them would be put against them—I have no doubt their names are entered, and I presume Honour's also—I only saw him in my office once, Jones introduced him, and I shook hands, in a casual way as I passed out—I am not sure if at the time we had had instructions—I did not know at the time that he was a money lender, not for ft long time afterwards—I knew it before this prosecution started—I heard Honour swear yesterday that this document was written out by Jones in his presence—I have no doubt it is in McNair's writing—it is signed by McNair as attesting witness, and it is quite obvious that that signature is in the same writing as the body of the document—there are two interlineations in Jones's writing; they are formal amendments, such as a lawyer might put in correcting the clerk—this purports to be a flimsy copy of a letter of July 9th, 1896, from Jones, not in his writing, I think; the signature is his—it is addressed to G. H. Francis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Messrs. Munk and Co., 6, Broad Street House—on April 15th Francis and Rowell came, and Bentley fol<lb/>lowed shortly after, and then Honour came—I showed Honour into the room, and remained there for a few minutes—Honour said, "Is this Mr. Jones?" and one of them, I think Bentley, said, "Yes"—Honour asked Jones to draw up a mortgage of Mrs. Rowell's interest, under the settle<lb/>ment made on her by Mrs. Firman—Jones said, "The settlement is only in draft; you ought to be properly represented by a solicitor; I would prefer that it should be so"—Honour said, "I can take care of myself"—I left the room—Mr. Jones afterwards rung for me; I answered him by the telephone which runs from the private room to the clerk's office in which I was—he called me, and I went into the private room—Jones said to mo, "Mr. Honour wants to draw up his own mortgage; I have protested against the business being done in this irregular manner, and I wish you to bear witness to it"—Honour said to Jones, "You write; I will dictate to you"—Jones said, "As you are in a hurry will not it save time if the clerk takes it down in shorthand?"—Honour assented, and he dictated the charge of April 15th to me, and I took it "down in shorthand—when Honour was about half-way through it Jones said, "This is being done in a most irregular manner, and I won't be responsible for it," and, turning to me, he said, "I wish you to remember it later"—Honour said, "Allow me, Mr. Jones," as if he did not want to be interfered with; he said, "I always do them like this," and he finished dictating it then—I read it over to Honour from my short-hand note—he said he was satisfied, and then I was told to write it out—I went into the next room and did so; this is the transcript of my notes (No. 14)—the body of it is in my writing—Rowell signed it in my presence, and I attested it—the two interlineations are in Jones's</p>

               <p>writing—after I had witnessed it, Honour said, "I should like to give you something for your trouble, Mr. Jones," and he put £1 1s. on the table—Jones said, "Anything I expect to get I must get from Mrs. Rowell"—Honour pressed it on him—I saw Jones write—I do not know whether it was a receipt or not—Honour repeated that he wished Jones to have something for his trouble—after that day Francis and Rowell called several times at our office and saw Jones—I have heard them more than once promise to bring the deeds to Jones, in reply to his asking them to do so—Rowell has said, "We cannot let you have them just yet"—I have heard him ask more than once for them—I have heard Rowell say that, owing to Mrs. Firman's age and infirmity, it was difficult to get her to attend to business, and that was why they could not get the deeds—Jones said on one occasion that if he did not get them he should go to Mrs. Firman himself—Rowell said that would be no good; that Mrs. Firman never did anything without her—the interviews were friendly; they seemed civil to each other—I heard high words one morning between Jones and Francis; I could not distinguish the actual words—I was present on July 9th, when Honour called—he asked Jones if he had been able to get the deeds yet—Jones said, No; he had not; he had tried very hard to get them. "In fact," he said, "I have tried till I am sick of doing so "; and he said Rowell and Francis were always making excuses for not bringing them—Honour said, "I must have the deeds "; and then he suggested to Jones that he should write a letter to Francis asking for the deeds, and said, "You see, I shall consult another solicitor if they don't give up the deeds, if they don't produce them to me"—Jones then dictated to me a letter which I took down in shorthand and transcribed—Honour suggested what Jones should say—Jones signed it—this is a copy of the letter—I should say the letter was posted in the ordinary course in the office. (<hi rend="italic">Francis here stated that he had received the letter.</hi>) The letter was copied on these loose sheets because we used sheets out of an old letter-book to save expense—we have some copy letter-books, numbered; but we nearly always take copies on loose sheets, and keep them with the papers in the matter to which they belong. (<hi rend="italic">The letter to Francis was to the effect that Honour was extremely angry at things being allowed to dawdle on; that he must beg of Francis and Rowell to call next day, when he was instructed to register the deed of settlement, and that Francis must then explain to Honour why the deeds were not handed over at once, as, if it were not done forthwith, Honour would instruct another solicitor to enforce their immediate delivery.</hi>) I heard Rowell speak of this business in the office—from what I saw and heard of Rowell and Francis, I saw no reason to suspect that the business was not genuine—in the mortgage deed of July 31st there is an interlineation in Jones's writing—Mrs. Firman undertakes, in this deed, to produce the title-deeds within fourteen days, and Jones had inserted a clause providing that the trustee, Francis, shall be responsible for the production of the title-deeds—I have seen Rowell sign her name, and I know her writing—I should say this letter of March 18th, to Jones, is in her writing, and also this ad<lb/>dressed to Munk and Co.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the Police-court one day when Honour was in the box—I cannot say that I heard any questions put to him about the conversation on April 15th—I first gave a proof of my evidence about three weeks ago, since the last Sessions—I made that up solely from my recollection—that was the first time I had been asked to recollect what had taken place in the preceding April—I prepared it myself, and sent it to Jones—no suggestion was made to me that I should be called at the Police-court—I had seen Francis and Rowell at the office several times before April 15th—Jones had been at the office since December—I saw Rowell once at Munk and Co.'s office in the Haymarket—all the time the Honour transaction was going on Munk and Co. were at Broad Street House—since Jones has had a seat in Munk and Co.'s office, and be<lb/>fore April 15th, I have only seen Francis there—he came several times, shortly before April 15th—I made no notes of what took place on April 15th, when Francis, Rowell, and Bentley came—I have not kept my shorthand notes in which I took down the indenture from Honour—Jones asked me to remember the transaction, and twice protested against the irregularity of Honour's proceedings—I made no notes to assist my memory—I thought Jones objected to them coming to do it in that kind of way, Honour drawing up his own mortgage—Jones suggested to Honour that he should have a solicitor to act for him—Honour said he preferred doing it himself, and that he would do it himself; he wanted to do it his own way—while I was in the room I was looking for some papers—I could not help hearing the conversation—one thing that impressed it on me was Honour's manner of saying the words, his bad English, and Jones seemed very much upset at Honour wanting to do it himself—Jones did not proffer his services as a solicitor to Honour in my hearing—I did not see the receipt given for £1 1s.—this receipt is in Jones's writing—I don't think it can he said that Jones acted as solicitor for Honour on that occasion, although he received £1 1s. for costs—Honour pressed the £1 1s. on him, and said he wanted to give him something for his trouble—it might be called costs; it seemed to be a gift—Honour dictated this indenture to me in legal phraseology, and I took it down from him, but Jones had to help him now and then when he got mixed in his English—he only had to be helped once or twice—Jones did not dictate the document to me after Honour had said what he wanted—Jones stopped Honour, and protested it was irregular at the part where the deed speaks of consideration—I don't think the consideration is pro<lb/>perly stated; it first speaks of £5, and then of a bill—I did not see the £5 paid; no one knows what is given for the bill—I saw Jones write something after Honour pressed a guinea on him—that might have been the receipt for the costs—I cannot say what mortgage Munk and Co. were negotiating on April 15th—I never heard of the Sun Fire Office having anything to do with this business, nor of Mr. Yansittart or Mr. Warner—I did not hear of any letters going to the Sun Fire Office or other people about this matter—I think I saw all the letters that came to</p>

               <p>the office; so far as I know there was no letter about a mortgage being negotiated at this time—when Honour was dictating this document to me Jones sat at the table; he had no pen or pencil, and made no notes—I never take down shorthand notes in a book; I very seldom take anything in shorthand now—it was part of my duty to tike down letters in short-hand if required; I did not keep any book for the purpose, but used slips of paper—the endorsement of this draft in the fold is in Jones's writing—I first saw this fair copy draft, signed by Mrs. Firman, about the beginning of April, in the office, among Jones's papers—generally when Mr. Munk goes out of the office he says where he is going, and so does Jones—I never heard Jones say he was going to see Mrs. Firman; I cannot say he ever told me he had seen her—it is usual for a solicitor to enter up his daily doings—we have such a book—I have not looked to see where Jones was on July 3rd, or whether he had appointments which took him away suddenly from Brewery Road—I only remember Honour coming to the office once and pressing for the deeds; that was when this letter was written—the copying-press is in the clerks' office—I never press-copied a letter to a parson who had deposited these deeds for £80 with his bank; I have no knowledge of such a letter being sent—re<lb/>tainers are generally kept with the papers—I saw a letter from Mrs. Firman, and signed by her, on Jones's desk; in April, I should think—it was on blue paper—Jones said, "That is Mrs. Firman's retainer; put it in the drawer"—I should think it would have remained there—after Jones was summoned he continued to go to the office—he took his papers to his solicitor, I think, Mr. Abrahams, of Marlborough Street—I did not see the retainer in the office after Jones ceased to go there—the only kind of excuse I heard from Francis or Rowell for the non-production of the deeds was the age and infirmity of Mrs. Fir<lb/>man—I went to the Middlesex Registry in respect of this matter—I registered this deed of July 16th—you have to register the title of property in Middlesex, and every mortgage and transfer, and anything affecting the title—I never went there to inquire whether Mrs. Firman was registered as the freeholder, or anything of the kind—I registered the mortgage of July 31st; I did not then search the register—the fee for searching is about 2s. 6d. or 3s.—this draft will is in my writing—Jones asked me to draw up a will of Mrs. Firman, leaving all her property to Rowell—I suppose that was on July 30th—I saw no instruc<lb/>tions from Mrs. Firman to prepare her will—Jones was alone when he gave me those instructions—I believe he got them from Rowell; I did not hear them given, but I believe a will was executed—I believe the fair copy of a will was made from this draft by the other clerk, by Jones's instructions, I should say—I cannot say what was done with the fair copy will; I have never seen it since—I did not see it executed, or hear of its execution—my only reason for saying I believed a will was executed was that a fair copy was made—I should say the sheet on which this press-copy of the letter of July 9th was made came from a book which is at the office—the book was only partly used, and was not used in the office generally, and it had some unused leaves—these were unused sheets taken out of old letter-books, not Munk and Co.'s letter-books at all—I don't think I can produce any other flimsy copies of other letters written by Jones in reference to Francis and Rowell's transactions—I don't remember press-copying any other letter except this of July 9th—it</p>

               <p>did not strike me at the time as strange that letters about raising money on reversion were not copied—I was in Mr. Munk's employ, not Jones's—I knew Jones when Mr. Munk's office was in the Haymarket—I only knew Jones by sight when he had an office in Adam Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A letter-book, in the proper sense of the word, has never been kept at Messrs. Munk and Co.'s office at Broad Street—letters have always been copied on loose sheets like these, and put with the particular papers they belong to—I have not been with other solicitors, but I have been in and out of plenty of offices, and it is a common practice to copy letters on loose sheets of flimsy—I should say it was a very convenient way—it is done at one or two places—the advantage is that if you have an action, and have to produce letters, you do not have to take the letter-books to the Court—Jones told me to register this settlement at the Middlesex Land Registry; any person going there could see it had been registered—it was equally open to Honour as to a solicitor to go and search at the Registry; anybody can go—when Honour first came into the office, on September 15th, and said he wanted a mortgage drawn up, Jones's first objection was that the settlement was only in draft—I did not hear Honour ask to see the draft, or anything more said about it—I should say a charge ought to come after the settlement had been executed properly and formally.</p>

I am a financial and general agent, residing at Walthamstow—I would rather not answer whether I am an acquaint<lb/>ance or relation of the Mr. Bentley mentioned in this case—I believe it was in February last I made Francis's acquaintance; I met him in a casual way—he asked me to procure him a loan of £150 on the security of Ro well's reversion on two freehold houses in Brewery Road, and settled</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill-discounter and money-lender, of Lend<lb/>enhall Street—the prisoner had been in my service for three years on June 30th, when he left—when I left the office on Friday evening, May 8th, I left the prisoner £5 for the purposes of the businesses appears by the office diary in his writing—I do not go to the office on Saturday usually—I next went on Monday, at eleven o'clock—I examined the diary with the prisoner—he told me "A friend of my brother introduced a man to me to borrow £5"—I said, "Have you seen your brother?" because I knew his brother, but not the friend—he said, "I have seen my brother, and he is good for the money"—the name of the borrower was A. F. Rogers; he said he was employed at Smith-Payne's Bank as a clerk—he gave me this bill of exchange, purporting to be accepted by Rogers—there is this entry on May 8th in the office diary in the prisoner's writing, "Left cash, £5, A. F. Rogers (from Field) had £5, and paid 5d."—5d. would be for the bill stamp—whoever is sitting in my</p>

               <p>office and seeing callers enters the full names of the callers in the office diary; he does not initial it, because I can tell who makes the entry by the writing—the prisoner has never accounted to me for that £5—on May 11th I handed the prisoner £15 for the purposes of the business,—next and that appears in the diary in the prisoner's writing, "Left cash, £15" day, the 12th, I was at the office; I examined the diary with the prisoner, and asked him what he had done with the £15—he told me a man, named P. Martin, had called, introduced by a friend of his named Bradburne, and that he had lent him £10 out of the £15—he said Martin was employed at the Queensland National Bank—he handed me this bill he of exchange, purporting to be accepted by Martin for £10 and interest—said, "I have made inquiries at the bank, and the man is all right and I find he is employed there"—except by giving that explanation and handing me this bill, he has never accounted for that £10—Bradburne was a friend of the prisoner, and had introduced other customers, and had borrowed money from me—I had never seen him—the prisoner was entitled to 5 per cent, commission per annum on friends—on introduced by Bradburne, because he had introduced Bradburne Friday, March 6th, I handed the prisoner £5 for the purposes of the business—the entry in the diary is, "Left cash, £5," and after that is, "Charles Goodwin had £5, and paid 5d. for the stamp"—I was next at the office on Monday, March 9th—I examined the diary with the prisoner—he accounted for the £5 by giving me a bill purporting to be accepted by Charles Goodwin, of 13, Albion Crescent, Barnsbury, and the Queensland National Bank, Princes Street—he said, "Goodwin is a friend of Bradburne's, and is employed at the Queensland National Bank; I have inquired, and find he is all right"—he has never accounted for that £5 beyond giving me the bill and that explanation—the bodies of the bills are in the prisoner's writing; it would be his duty to write them out; whoever lent the money should write out the bill—I had no suspicion as to the writing of the name of the acceptor—I find these press copy letters of May 18th and June 30th, to Goodwin, and June 20th to Martin (<hi rend="italic">asking them to remit the amount of instalment due</hi>)—they were not returned through the Dead Letter Office—there are entries in the bill-book in the prisoner's writing on March 7th, "C. Goodwin (Bradburne)," "A. F. Rogers (Field)," and May 11th, "P. Martin (Bradburne)"—the names in brackets are those of the introducers—Field was a friend of the prisoner's brother at Smith<lb/>Payne's Bank, and Rogers was supposed to be a clerk there—all those bills were dishonoured when presented—I have not been able to find, any of the acceptors—on June 30th the prisoner left on notice; his work had been done so badly for the last six months, I told him it was better that he should find another place if possible, and he told me he had been he able to find another place, and left me—he left me by mutual consent—called two or three times afterwards to explain certain matfers of business, and on August 27th he called at my request—I asked him, "There have been many bills forged; are your people all right?" meaning his connection—he said, "Yes, they are"—I said, "Well, some of them seem to get very much in arrear; I wish you would go and give them a call. Will you give them a call for me, will you go and see them?"—he said, "Yes"—on the evening of the same day I wrote this letter—I had mentioned Martin's bill that morning</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189611160059"/>
               <p>—Martin was one of Bradburne's connection—on August 24th the prisoner called in reply, and said he had not had time to go round—I made an appointment to meet him at London Bridge Station at four Hicks o'clock to go to Peckham, where Hicks, my senior clerk, had lived—had robbed me of £4,000 or £5,000, and bolted—he confessed to £5,000, but the books have been falsified—the prisoner did not keep the appointment at London Bridge—on the evening of August 24th I wrote a letter, of which this is a press copy, to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to call next day, between eleven and</hi> 2.30, <hi rend="italic">to give an account of certain transac<lb/>tions.</hi>) He did not call—on August 26th I wrote to him, saying that, unless he called next day, and gave a satisfactory explanation of certain transactions, a warrant would be issued against him—he did not call; I received this letter from his solicitor—I handed certain documents and books to Mr. Inglis for the purpose of comparison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have described Hicks as my manager—he had no control in the office—he had been with me about fifteen years—he has admitted that he has committed forgeries—I have got a warrant against him—he gave me a list of some of his forgeries—among others in that list is the name of "P. Martin" on a bill for £13—Hicks did not admit any<lb/>thing before he left me—this is the only bill for £13 of Martin's that I have—I believe this is the bill to which he referred—Hicks has stated that he forged the name of Rogers to a bill for £6 10s.; this is the only bill I have for £6 10s.—Goodwin's name is not on this list—I have found: out other forgeries than those admitted by Hicks—I knew the prisoner had gone into business himself as a bill-discounter; I cannot say exactly the date I learnt it—I did not tax him with it on August 24th, or say, "You have been writing to my customers"—I was not annoyed at his I going into business—I do not know of his writing to my customers—did not say I would get an injunction against him if he did not give up his business—I never complained of his going into business; I had no<lb/>reason—I to—I don't think he would get my customers if he went into busi<lb/>ness was not generally absent from my business for months to<lb/>gether; I used to come to town about twice a week—the customers did not know Hicks and the prisoner a great deal better than me—some of the small customers never saw me, but the big ones did—I think I said to the prisoner, "I hear you are going into business on your own account," that was all—I am gradually reducing my business, as the books will show—I did not suggest to the prisoner that he should give me £300 to square it, or offer to square it for £300—I did not write to my solicitor to square it for £300—I saw the prisoner and Mr. Wilson in the presence of my solicitor, and Mr. Wilson said, "Will you take £300?" and I said, "I leave the matter entirely in the hands of my solicitor"—Mr. Wilson is the prisoner's father-in-law—I said to him, "It is not a question of money at all; I have been robbed of £4,000 or £5,000; I must have the facts told me; I cannot tell which, are forgeries and which are not"—I refused to see him without my solicitor, who was there the whole time—my solicitor suggested that he should employ his solicitor—I did not refuse to see the prisoner in the presence of his solicitor—Mr. Burgess called, with the prisoner's brother, and I said, "Is Mr. Burgess acting for you?" and he said, "No"—I do not know that Wilson and his brother were brought on the scene because I had offered to square the matter for £300—there was no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189611160060"/>
               <p>thought of squaring—the prisoner's brother said, "Will you see Wilson?" and Wilson said, "Will you take £300?" and I was careful to have my solicitor there, because I was told they would set a trap for me, and I refused to make any offer—I see his brother here—I did not offer to settle the matter if they would pay £300; I did not know half the forgeries then, and I knew he could not pay it; he owed me £100 himself—I found out part of these defareations on August 23rd, but it was a month before I found out all—I applied for a warrant on October 8th—I did not think anything of the £300 offer; I left the whole matter in my solicitor's hands—the £100 the brother owed me has been paid—one of my customers came, and said it was rather annoying that my clerk should stop him in the street, and ask if he wanted to borrow £50, and I said I thought he should go to Manchester—this was on or about August 23rd, after I had begun to find out the defalcations; I had my suspicions at that date—they said, "Will you take £300?" and I said, "Before it takes place I must have definite explanation of these matters; I don't know if they are forgeries or not, I want the truth and the facts "; and the brother said, "He will go to Manchester; he has a business of his own," and I said I must leave it to my solicitor—I did not require or request him to go to Manchester; the suggestion came from the other side—I complained of my customer being stopped in the street—that was before August 23rd; it is difficult to say the date—I had seen the prisoner on the 21st and two or three days before—the stopping my customer did not trouble me; I thought it was rather foolish—I mentioned it in the course of conversation; I did not complain of it; I thought if I told him I knew about it, he would not do it again—to the best of my belief, I did not write to my solicitor to settle the matter; the whole matter was discussed at the interview, and I left it in his hands—there is no letter in my press copy letter-book to my solicitor to settle for £300—Ross was in my service—I did not give him the letter to copy—I have my letter-book here, and there is no copy in it; Hooked through the book, because I had notice to produce all the letters—I do not put business letters in my private-book—I have only one private-book—I prosecuted McBride, and he afterwards brought an action against me and recovered damages; the Judge stopped the case and suggested that certain mistakes had been made, and gave McBride £15 more than I offered him—I don't remember prosecuting anybody else—I cannot pledge my word to every single word used between me and the prisoner—I spoke to him about Martin's bill, and he said Martin was at the Queen land Bank, and was introduced by his friend Bradburne, and "I have made inquiries "; I can swear he said that—the prisoner would not act under Hicks's orders; Hicks had his work, and the prisoner his own—if Hicks lent money, Hicks would take the bill—I trusted Hicks—it was my rule in the office that whoever lent the money was to draw the bill, and be accountable to me—if Hicks had consumed his own money, and brought or sent on anyone to the prisoner, the prisoner would give the money to Hicks, and Hicks would have to sign for it—I have no entry of such a transaction; the prisoner had his money, and Hicks had his own—I left out blank cheques, for Hicks principally—the prisoner, and Hicks, and Ross, all wrote in this book—on Tuesday, 17th, there appear entries by all three; they were about the office on that day.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This asked him to call immediately, and stated that Hicks had embezzled thousands.</hi>) I had known the prisoner's brother for two or three years, and I wanted to induce him to come and tell me all the real facts—I wanted the matter cleared up because all my books were in confusion—on the 28th Mr. Q. F. Henniker, the prisoners brother, called—during the interview my solicitor happened to call—I never asked the prisoner's brother or his father-in-law to square the matter—when the brother came he asked if I would see the prisoner's father-in-law, who was outside; and the father-in-law then came in and made a suggestion to me—I never agreed to stifle or withdraw this prosecution—I never instructed my solicitor to enter on any terms about withdrawing the prosecution—I heard the prisoner had gone into business with people, and had left a month afterwards; I simply know what his brother told me, and one man came and complained to me; and I looked on it as a sort of joke—either the prisoner's brother or Mr. Wilson said he had been in business in Manchester, and I said, "I think it will be best"—there was only the one conversation about it, some where near the end of August—I cannot say if it was before I threatened the warrant—I did not know on August 23rd that he had forged these acceptances—I did not take out a warrant before October 7th, because the brother said the prisoner was away, and they did not know where he was, and they had been looking for him all over the country—my solicitor said; "You can-not do anything now," and advised me to go through the books, and find out all I could—I thought the prisoner was abroad—I wanted to get the whole thing clear—his solicitor called, and I declined to see him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no feeling on the part of the Magistrates against the defendant as far as I know—Mr. Hammond usually sits, and Mr. Gotto; they live close by—this case was not treated differently from any other case; it was remanded from the 29th to the 30th, in order that there might be more than one Magistrate there; only enough evidence was taken to justify a remand—there was no professional man on either side—the notes I take are taken roughly, for the information of the Magistrates—he said nothing on the 30th about the Magistrates increasing the fine to enable him to appeal—the notice of appeal is dated October 3rd, and was given by a solicitor, Mr. Freke Palmer—an application was made to the Magistrates subsequently to increase the amount—the application for a warrant for perjury was made on October 28th to Mr. Bascoville Smith, Mr. Gotto, Mr. Mowett, Mr. Morris, General Young, and others: by Mr. Stanford, a solicitor, and a summons was granted—the Magistrates come as suits their convenience—the prosecutor was represented by Mr. Colam, and the defendant by Mr. Wontner—the summons was dismissed.</p>

I am a surveyor, of 107, Queen Victoria Street, and have had considerable experience—on November 18th I went with a copy of the Ordnance map to Nuttall Gardens, which leads into Finchley Road, and measured the streets with it—it is correctly drawn to scale—the distance from Belsize Mews to the corner of Nutley Terrace and Netherhall Gardens is 762 yards, and from there to the corner of the slope, leading to Frognal, 116 yards, and from the bend to No. 34, Frognal, is 108 yards, and from No. 34 to Arkwright Road, 103 yards—I examined the two pillars at No. 34; they are composed of brick, with red sandstone cape—the height of the north pier is 5 ft. 3 1/2 in. high, and the south pier is 5 ft. 9 1/2 in.; there is a gradient—the caps are fixed on with cement, and some of thom with mortar—No. 48 is mortar, but both caps were cemented; there is a square base, an ornamental thing with a ball—I estimate the weight at upwards of 300 lb., including the base on which, it stands, from where it is said to require more than one man to move it—I tried to move it; the position of the cap, 5 ft. 9 in., is such that you</p>

I am a surgeon, and have practised in Hampstead a great many years; I have only just left Avenue Road, where I was thirty or forty years—I examined Parrent on the day before I went before the Magistrate—I found he had sustained very serious injury to his left elbow, not of recent date—the effect was that he could not raise his arm straight, like the other, and if you supported it for him at the shoulder it fell over; there was no power at all—he would not be able to exert any pressure on anything at the height of his head, pushing or lifting, not above his shoulder—there is no exceptional power in his other arm; he is able to work, but he has had a severe attack of pleurisy on his left side, of which I found traces—it has left very considerable adhesions, and it is quite impossible that he would be able to do any hard work since his accident; he told me that he used to be able to run five miles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I take a great interest in the case—I had never seen the prosecutor before—he told me he had been to Mr. Edward Jessop, who set his arm—he did not tell me whether Mr. Jessop had formed an opinion as to his muscular capacity—he told me that someone had written to Mr. Jessop to say that he had made a capital job of it ten years before—I did not know that he had gone to Mr. Jessop in this case; I examined his muscles generally—I have heard Mr. Willett's evidence, and I disagree with him; the muscles of the forearm are all right—I went to Mr. Willett of my own accord; I did not take a statement from</p>

               <p>him; I told him the story—I do not think I mentioned that I was a wit<lb/>ness in the case; I asked him if he would see me to<lb/>morrow—I had no interest in the case except to see a poor man righted; I considered he had been cruelly treated—I have said, "My evidence was based on what he told me," but it was based on what I saw—I believe he was speak<lb/>ing the truth—if I was dealing with a man who was injured in a rail<lb/>way accident, I should have in some measure to rely upon his statement told me how he felt when he put his arm up—he can use his arm below his shoulder, and can raise his hand to his head—I went to a friend at the end of last week to ask him to see a patient; I did not hear that a doctor from Hampstead might be called—it did not occur to me to go to a man who lived in the neighbourhood—Mr. Jessop practises in the same district that I do, but I have never met him; he lives close by—in a large district of that kind there are a great many doctors.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a gentleman's gardener for many years, and twenty-three years in the same employment, in private service; but the staff was reduced, and I became a jobbing gardener in March, in the employ of Robert Wood—my wife keeps a little dairy—I am a member of a benefit club which meets at the Load of Hay—I was at a meeting of the club on Monday evening, September 28th, the night before I was arrested—after the business had been done, the landlord, Mr. Martin, asked me to go with him to see a new take house, with a flat, iron roof, which he had built, and he wanted to know whether it would be better to have straw under it, to keep it warm—we had to go through a yard, and along a bricked passage, perhaps a yard wide, perhaps not so much; I passed the remark that it was very narrow for a horse to go through—we came back through that passage to the bar, and I left the house about 10.55—five or six men came out at the same time, and I walked with more than two of them down England's Lane—that is a long way before we got to Belsize Lane—we stopped at the Washington, and my friend said, "You paid for the glass we have had, come and have some more"—we arrived at the Belsize Tavern at past twelve o'clock—the time for closing there is 12.30, and before I had finished my glass of ale the house was cleared, and eight or ten of us came out and waited there, and more men came out; there might have been twenty of us—I went along Belsize Lane, and turned into Belsize Mews; one man left me there, and another twenty, or it may be fifty, yards further on—I live two miles beyond Frognal—before the first friend left me, the clock struck a quarter to one outside the Mews—that is the clock at what they call the New College; but it has been there over thirty years—I walked on with my other friend, and only stopped to wish him good<lb/>night, and he went into his house—he is a coachman—I then went to Daleham Mews, and stopped two or three minutes to eat, and then went on through Nutley Terrace, and kept straight along till I gotto Netherhall Gardens; I went across the gardens to the left to go down the slope, but I did not get there, as the prisoner came and took hold of my right arm, and said, "Old fellow, I have got you now"—I looked at him, but did not know him; he had uniform on—I said, "I do not know you; what do you mean? I thought you were somebody I knew, coming up like that?" he said, "That is all right; you must come along with me, "I said, "Where?" he said, "Why, to the Police-station" I said, "What do I want to go to the Police-station for?"</p>

               <p>he said, "That is all right; you are a builder, are you not?"I said, "What do you want to ask such a question as that for? I am walking home to Cricklewood, where I live, what are you taking me to the Police-station for?" he said, "Why, for pushing off a pillar cap"—I walked with him to the Police-station up Nutley Terrace and Maresfield Gardens, and crossed the road into a passage, and went into Hampstead—we crossed the end of Fitzjohn Avenue into the passage walk—when we got to the station a constable opened the door, and I could not hear what was said—I was told to go and sit down—I was there half an hour, and got up, and went to the inspector's room, and asked if I could not go home—I was not charged—I went and sat down, and got up a second time, and a policeman told me to sit down again and be quiet—Mr. Maxwell came, and I was then charged with damaging his pillar—I said that it was no such thing, that I was not there, and asked Mr. Maxwell if he could not bail me out—he said that he could not, because he did not know me; he had forgotten me; he asked me if I had not better wire and tell my wife—I said "No," because she was very ill, and I sent for Mr. O'Hara, a butcher—Mr. Martin, the landlord of the Load of Hay, bailed me out at seven a.m.—I had to appear before the Magistrates at ten o'clock, and only had time to go home and have my breakfast and come back, and the case was remanded till the next morning, when I had no legal adviser, but Mr. Anderson, my employer, attended to me—after the prisoner had given his evidence and the value of the damage done, I said, "Can I have a remand for a week?" and Mr. Gotto said, "It is sworn evidence of the constable; you must pay the money, or go to prison"—the Magistrates fined me £3; and £4 damages; I paid all of it except Mr. Maxwell's share, which he refused to take—when I asked for a remand before the case was heard Mr. Gotto denied me, and Mr. Anderson asked the Chairman for a remand for a week; the Chairman asked him what he had to do with the case—there are two ways to Cricklewood; one by Nettlehall Gardens, and the other by Frognal—I went round to the left; 'it would have been out of my way to go by Arkwright Road; I go down this little piece of slope—I had no business in going home to go that way—it is not true that I knocked, or attempted to knock, any of these caps off; I was never in that part of Frognal at all—it would be a quarter of a mile out of my way to go that way home.</p>

I am a widow, of 14, London Street, S.E.—on Sun<lb/>day, November 8th, I got into an omnibus at the Elephant and Castle, and sat next but one to the door on the left, getting in—two or three persons were in the omnibus—two men got in at Waterloo Station, and the omnibus was then full—they sat right at the end, and then came and gat on my right-hand side—a lady was on my left—I do not recognise either of them here—they got out at the corner of the Strand, and a man jumped on the tail-board of the omnibus—I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my purse, two florins, sixpence, some halfpence, a biscuit, and a little bottle of whisky—I had paid my fare at Waterloo Station, and put my purse back in my pocket.</p>

On November 8th, in the afternoon I was in Waterloo Road, and saw the prisoner having his boots cleaned at the corner, outside the York Hotel—I have known him five or six years, and the other man too—after the prisoner had his boots cleaned he stood back in the public-house doorway, and I stood facing him, and as soon as the other man had his boots cleaned they walked to Waterloo Station, and met the Camden Town <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>, and sat on the right—there was one lady next to the conductor, and the prosecutrix next, and the prisoner next—I would not get on the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> for certain reasons, but I followed to the Strand, and then spoke to the last witness; she was agitated, and did not seem to realise what it meant—as soon as I got information from her I looked, but could not see the men—I took her to Bow Street—she entered a charge, and I gave the names and addresses of the men, and that evening I went to Leman Street Station, and saw the prisoner, detained by Detective Smith—I said, "That is the man—the prisoner said, "That is not a proper identification; what is it for?"—I said, "For stealing a lady's purse in an omnibus from Waterloo Street, Strand"—he said, "Instead of my being in the dock, you will be at the Old Bailey for perjury"—the conductor appeared next morning, and picked out the prisoner, who said, "What time was it?"—I said, "Between three and a quarter past"—he said, "I was serving behind my brother's bar at that time."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus conductor, 13023—on Sunday, November 8th, I was conducting an omnibus from the Bennet's House, Camden Town, to Waterloo Road—two men got in; the prisoner is one of them—there were four ladies there, and the men sat between them—the other man sat next the lady who lost her purse; he had a cape on—they both got out at the Strand, and paid with a florin—I went to the station next morning, and saw a number of people in a row, and picked the prisoner out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Anybody who gets on the omnibus can go the whole way for one penny, but everybody does not go the whole way—there is not much traffic across the bridge on Sunday, but we do not go much quicker—we go quicker than a man can walk; seven miles an hour; there would be no difficulty in a man running and keeping up with us—if he ran he could get to Wellington Street as soon as we could—I only saw I one man running, and hailed him; it was Sergeant Hammond—directly I he came he asked if anybody had lost a purse—I don't believe he asked me where the two men got in—I saw Hancock at the station, but did not speak to him before I went in to identify—there were about two dozen men there; there were a dozen in the row I picked him out from—I was not called on the Monday morning because I was telegraphed for else<lb/>where, and gave my evidence on the Friday—they got out with other passengers, and I do not know which got out first—people often pay me with two-shilling pieces, but I had several coppers.</p>

I said, 'No, I am young Hack; I will knock your brains out'"—I took him to Tottle's house—she said, "That is the man that struck me in the face"—Hack said, "I did not; God's truth"—she said, "Yes, you did"—he said, "Yes, I smacked you; God blind me! who would not?"—I took him to the Police-station, and he was charged—he said nothing in answer—on the same day, at 2.10 a.m., I went to 22, Stanley Street, Plaistow, where I saw Mallett—I said I should take him into custody for assaulting a woman in Milton Street last night—he said, "All right, sir"—I took him to Tottle's house, and confronted him with the prosecutrix—she said, "That is the man who kicked me"—he said, "You Are a liar"—in answer to the charge, he said, "Very well,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If she is pregnant, she has not been so for more than three months—a chronic prolapse would not affect a pregnancy at that stage—if the prolapse was caused by violence, it would require consider<lb/>able violence—I do not think one kick would be sufficient to cause it—a</p>

               <p>kick sufficiently severe to produce prolapse of the bowel would leave a terrific bruise, if not laceration—I do not think a woman suffering from prolapse of the bowel would lose consciousness if she stumbled, or did anything of that sort.</p>

J. Evershed, Solicitor, 17, Ironmonger Lane, Cheapside. Dear Sir,—My client, Miss Parke, of Cleveland House, Clapham Park, has handed me your account to attend to on her behalf. I shall be obliged if you will let this matter stand over for a short time, as I am endeavouring to arrange a sale of certain investments of hers which should realise a large sum, when I will send you a cheque for the amount owing to you. Kindly let me hear whether you agree to this proposal.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWIN J.

               <p>Mr. Jackson came on Tuesday, June 23rd—I saw him in communication with Mr. Everehed—Jackson and Evershed took an inventory of the goods in the house—Miss Parke took no part in taking the inventory—she was in one of the rooms upstairs, I believe—Miss Parke left the house on Saturday, June 27th,. between four and five p.m.; she said she was going to the seaside, and would return in a week's time—she did not return while I was there; I left on July 1st—Jackson came to the house on Monday, June 29th, about ten a.m.; he took a further list of the furniture—I saw him, with a book, taking down a list of the things in the house—he asked me for some keys, which I gave him—he had a woman with him—he stayed till two p.m.—the woman did not appear to be a lady; she walked about the house, and did not do anything in particular—she took charge of the plate; she had the keys of the cupboard—about eleven the next morning, the 30th, Mr. Arthur Parke discharged me, but I refused to go that day—he went away, and returned at six p.m. with Jackson and Evershed—Evershed suggested I should go that night, without any payment; I re<lb/>fused because it was late—it was about seven p.m.—I said I would go the next morning; I went the next morning—on that morning, July 1st,. Evershed came and paid the five servants, but nothing in lieu of notice—Evershed said on the Tuesday I should have to go and see him at his office; I went to see him on Thursday, July 2nd, but did not receive any wages from him then—on the Tuesday I had this paper, saying I should get them in the course of a few days.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JELF</hi>. I told my story at the Police-court—a statutory declaration was placed in my hands—I have had business deal<lb/>ings with Evershed—I found him honourable and straightforward in them—he is a solicitor, about twenty-three years of age—I saw him about an advance about two days before the date of the bill of sale—he asked me if I was open to an investment of that kind, and offered as security the bill of sale on the furniture at Cleveland House, and a reversion in some property—he said there was a settlement—I think he showed me the settlement—he said Miss Parke and her two brothers had a reversionary interest in it, and that she and one of her brothers were prepared to make their two shares part of the security for the loan—I held out hopes that I would advance £400—Evershed had every reason to believe that I was going to lend him the money on the security of goods and furniture and (the reversionary interest—I made a stipulation that the bill of sale should be executed and registered before I parted with (the money—I thought more of the other security, but I wanted the two—Evershed seemed extremely anxious to get the money—the rate of interest was agreed at 5 or 6 per cent.—I believe he came on the 18th. but he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189611160095"/>
               <p>was to bring the bill of sale registered, and get the money—he brought it in the evening with a £1 stamp on it, to show that my condition was ful<lb/>filled—I read the articles of furniture from the bill of sale, and came to the conclusion that they would not fetch the money, which I declined to lend, as I thought it was not sufficient security—he seemed disappointed—he said he thought he could get another security, and I expressed a readiness to carry out the loan if he succeeded—when he called again he told me that Miss Parke and Mr. Arthur Parke did not think it right to involve the share of the other brother being tied up—in consequence of that extra security not being obtained I declined to make the loan—then Mr. Evershed was in this quandary, that he had the bill of sale filed, but had not got the money—he asked me, and I signed a release—he also asked me to make <hi rend="italic">this</hi> statutory declaration of the facts.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I never agreed to lend money on the security of the furni<lb/>ture alone—I understood from Evershed that the reversionary interest of Miss Parke was worth £200—it was worth more, but I believe there was another mortgage on it—the value I should get would be £200—I was not told of that mortgage on the 18th, I heard of it afterwards—I should have taken Mr. Evershed's word with. regard to the reversionary interest at the time, but should have made further inquiries afterwards—it must have been on the 18th I told him. I required further security than Miss Parke's reversionary interest, because it was on the 18th he brought the bill of sale, and I declined to lend the money—it was the second brother's, the invalid's, security I asked for—I wanted the security of the sister and the two brothers; the whole of the reversionary interest—Evershed said he could not get Mr. William Parke's share—I thought it was safer to have the deed registered, before I parted with the money—he said it would have to be registered, and I said, "Better have it registered and complete before I part with the money"'—I did not at first say anything about having the bill, registered; I did not know whether it would be registered or not—I cannot remember the exact conversation; we were talking more about the furniture—it is six months ago that I signed this document of July 1st—Mr. Evershed read a few lines before I signed it (<hi rend="italic">the release</hi>)—I have employed Evershed in some little matters.</p>

The first cheque is dated June 27th—I heard of the bill of sale on the night I bought the furniture—Evershed told me it was taken off the file—that was the reason I gave my cheque to Jackson, because it was made a condition that the bill of sale should be got out of existence if it was not so—these are the receipts for the £30 and the balance, £75. (<hi rend="italic">Two receipts produced.</hi>) I was at Henley Regatta on the day Moss and Jameson paid me this cheque for the furniture—on July 6th—I knew Jackson was selling the furniture to Moss and Jameson—I gave him instructions to sell it as he liked, privately if he could, or I intended to sell it by auction, when I should lose by it—I think he told me the price he was getting—I knew he would carry out the sale without bothering me—I daresay I was consulted; probably on the 6th, the day of the sale; there was no mystery about the transaction, only the lies you have told. (<hi rend="italic">This was apologized for.</hi>) There was no reason, so far as I know, why Evershed should not have disclosed the transaction—I did not desire him to keep it back; I had nothing to hide—the prosecution sent me a subpoena, but were afraid to call me—I was present at the Police-court on your subpoena—I was requested by the defendants to give evidence at the Police-court—I was not called I was there for the purpose—I made an offer for the furniture on July 3rd—I do not know when Moss and Jameson made their offer; I have no reason to think it was not the 3rd—we took possession—Jackson took it away, and delivered it to Moss and Jameson, and received their receipt—I cannot tell you whether it was Jackson, but he is here—I do not know under whose instructions the goods were removed from Cleveland House.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Westall—I was instructed by him to go to Cleveland House and make this valuation of the furniture on June 26th (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I worked out the figures and made the schedule I valued it at £151—I received instructions from Mr. Westall to sell the furniture—I went to Moss and Jameson on the Saturday, and asked them what they would offer for it; they offered £135 a few days afterwards, which I refused—they sprang to £145, which I sold at—it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> deal, without having anything to do with Miss Parke.</p>
