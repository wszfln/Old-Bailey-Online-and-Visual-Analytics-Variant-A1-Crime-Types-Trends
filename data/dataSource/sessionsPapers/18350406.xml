                  </hi>. I live in Trafalgar-square, Stepney. On Sun<lb/>day night, the 15th of March, I was returning home in company with my wife, and passing down Mile-end-road about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock—I was on the pathway close to the houses—just before I got to the Trinity Alms Houses (my wife was by the tide of me) four or fire persons came upon us very hastily—we were surrounded in a moment—I think there were four or five of them—they came up hastily—one of them, which was the prisoner, rushed up against me—I know him again—he said, "What do you mean by assaulting me?"—I said "My friend, there is no harm done"—I put my hand out to put him on one—I had a ring on my right hand finger, and had not put my glove on—he instantly seized my hand, and never quitted it until the ring was wrenched from my finger—I say wrenched, because it was on tight—he had some difficulty in getting it off—he had hold of my hand a few seconds—I struggled, trying to get my hand away, but I could not do so, he had got tight hold me—the moment the ring passed over the joint of my finger I found he had got it, and called out, "He has stolen my ring"—at that moment I was tripped up by him and thrown down—there was nobody but him near me—I could not save myself, and I got a severe blow on my head with the fall—my wife immediately called out "Stop thief"—the policeman was close at hand—the prisoner ran to<lb/>wards the policeman and was instantly secured—I lost sight of him when I was tripped up, and when I got up he was in custody—he had got sixty or seventy yards from me, perhaps, before he was taken, but I cannot tell the distance—I did not see the ring again that night—I saw it next day—he hurt me in getting it off—my finger was sore for two or three days afterwards.</p>

               <p>the prisoner drove up against my husband, which occasioned him to jolt against me—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—he said, "You have assaulted me, Sir," my husband said there was no harm meant—I saw him grasp my husband's hand very tight—I had no idea what he was doing—he held hold of his hand tight—my husband endeavoured to put him away, and at last, as he was falling down, called out "Police, he has stolen my ring"—I called "Stop thief" repeatedly—I saw the prisoner taken—I had not lost sight of him at all from the time my husband fell till he was taken—he was walking briskly—I concluded he was among the others—they were all together—I cannot say he joined the other four—I think he was taken too soon—he was going in the same direction as the others, but he was alone when he ran away, and had not joined any body—I am quite sure the policeman took the man who ran against my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in the Mile-end-road, on Sunday night, the 15th of March—I heard a call of "Stop thief"—I had not observed any thing before that—I went towards the voice—I was about thirty yards off—on looking that way, I saw the prosecutor and his wife and a man near them—I could see him holding the prosecutor's hand—there was, a cry of "Stop thief," and the man ran towards me—I kept my eye on him and took him—it was the prisoner—I am sure I took the same man as I had seen with Mr. Clarke—there were four other men a<lb/>head of him between me and Clarke—they were walking on, and had passed me—there was not then any body between me and Clarke but the prisoner—after he was taken to the station-house, I returned with a light to the place where I took the prisoner—I saw my sergeant pick up a ring, which I produce—it was on the ground about the spot where I took the prisoner—I found it about one o'clock the same night.</p>

On the night of the 14th of March, I was in the kitchen, which is over the counting-house—while I was there I heard a noise about half-post eleven o'clock—the noise proceeded from the counting-house—on hearing it I went down stairs, and discovered the counting-house door open—the one leading into the counting-house from the packing-room—I had been in the counting-house about three-quarters of an hour before—when I left it it was locked, and the key in the door, on the side towards the packing-room—I had left a candle burning—when I found the door open, the candle had been put out—I had fastened the packing-room doors before I went into the kitchen—I locked the door on the counting-house side—I did not fasten the other door, but I saw it was fastened—both the doors of the packing-room were fastened on the inside—one was barred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having discovered this, what did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went out into the yard, by opening the packing-room door—I found the bar undone—on getting into the yard, I asked who was there—I saw a person upon the roof of the melting-house, and when I said, "Who if there?" the reply was, <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi>, they are coming"—I then ran for a policeman—I saw them get<lb/>ting out of the trap-door, in the roof of the melting-house—I saw two or three persons—I cannot say how many—there were some persons—I got</p>

               <p>a policeman, and took him to the back of the premises—the front gateway in the Southwark-bridge-road was safe, and the private entrance was also safe—the persons who had been in the house must have got out by one of the packing-room doors, both of which had been unfastened inside—there was a petty cash-box in one of the counting-house desks before I went up—that desk is never locked—the box was locked—it has a small hole cut in the top of it to drop money in—that box was kept in the double desk by the win<lb/>dow—there was money kept in the other desk, which was locked—I did not go into the counting-house when I came down stairs after healing the noise—I did not miss the petty cash-box till I came back—I was with the policeman when he found that box on the roof—there were no men melting on the premises at the time—it is usual to melt every night except Saturday night.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any way from the pack<lb/>ing-room into the melting-house and manufactory, without going into the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there is no communication from the dwelling-house to the melting-house or manufactory, except through the yard—one factory is by the side of Southwark-bridge-road—there are sheds which run from one manufactory to the other—the flaps in the roof are in the manufactory—the melting-house and manufactory are together, but are separated by a wall—the flaps lift up towards the roof of the factory—there is a yard behind the melting-house and manufactory—I saw the per<lb/>sons get out of the trap-door, and go along the roof to the right—I could see any person as I was standing in the yard, at the top of the manufactory—the flaps are very near the furthermost will of the manufactory—I had left a candle burning in the counting-house all the evening—I am quite sure I locked the door of the counting-house leading to the packing-roonm—the servant was up stairs with me in the kitchen—Mr. Richard Brook lives in the house—the other partner lives in the Borough.</p>

               <p>the packing-room and counting-house—he has been in the habit of fetching the petty cash-box from one premises to the other—I think I have seen him carrying it from one premises to the other, at any rate he must have known that it was fetched from there—it is kept for the purpose of placing small sums in, for goods sold at the warehouse—the box is sent by some of the servants from the premises, to Blackman-street, but not by any one in particular—this petty cash is kept separate for a particular use—on the night in question, before I left the pre<lb/>mises, I removed the petty cash-box and the till—there was a con<lb/>siderable quantity of petty cash in it, but what, I do not know—I left the premises about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, and went to my uncle's—I saw all the premises made fast and safe—I had put money into the box several times that week—it had been there about a fortnight—our men are up every night in the week, generally, except on Saturday—Parker would know that, and he knew I am always away on Saturday night, as I always go to Blackman-street—I got home this night just as Taylor was giving an alarm—I went down the yard, and heard a rattle spring—next morning I saw a chisel, found on the premises behind ours, in the yard adjoining the side of the premises where the flat is in the roof of the manufactory—it is Stevenson's yard—I observed marks of vio<lb/>lence on the desk, which was kept locked, and this chisel exactly cor<lb/>responds with the marks where the desk had been attempted to be wrenched—that is the single desk—it is usual to keep the desk in which the petty cash-box is, unlocked, and the other desks locked—this desk had marks of violence, and they exactly corresponded with the chisel—in wrenching, they had turned the desk off the stand—it is not usual to keep money in that desk for more than two hours together—it is usual to de<lb/>posit money there, under lock and key, till I take it to Blackman-street—Parker most likely would be aware of that—I saw the prisoners when they were brought out of Stevenson's yard, at the back of our premises, in Guildford-street—that was Parker, Parkenton, and Wayling—I saw New<lb/>man brought out of a ditch, over some pales, at some distance from Steven<lb/>son's yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Woodford, in the parish of Woodford, Essex. On Thursday, the 12th of March, I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I went to bed before my footman—I was called up at three o'clock in the morning by my daughter—I proceeded to her room, and then down stairs into the hall—on the mat of the dining room door I found a pair of shoes with dry dirt on them, and small coal dust on the soles—I found in the dining-room a hat which had been taken off a peg in the hall, and two odd boots, which had been in the dressing-room adjoining my daugh<lb/>ter's room—the fellow boots were gone—the dining-room window was open, and the blind drawn down in a particular twist—the window was forced open from the inside—I went into the passage leading from the hall to the kitchen, and missed four coats and a silver sugar-ladle—nine shirts were packed up in a handkerchief, and left at the door of my daughter's bed-room—I missed a lancet-case and a case of instruments—I examined outside the house under the dining-room window directly, (at three o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing,) with a candle, and found the mark of a foot without a shoe—I could trace the toes distinctly—I examined the coal-cellar door—the bolt was shot but the staple was forced open—I am in the habit of having my gate left open, that was always usual—in consequence of information from the police, I went to the station-house, and found the prisoner and my property which I had missed—I took the shoes with me to the station-house, and showed them to the prisoner—I asked if the shoes belonged to him—he said "No," and when he was brought to town I said, it was a pity to let him walk without shoes, he had better have them—he then put them on, and said they were his—I had not told him he had better confess—I did not myself hear him say they were his shoes—I now recognise the prisoner as having been in my service seven or eight years ago, as footman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Moss, of 27, Charles-street, Berkeley-square. On the 22nd of March, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was returning from a walk—I did not leave home till late—I do not always walk out so late, but I had been in-doors all day—I am a footman—I am still in the same place—I was perfectly sober—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Windmill-street, Coventry-street, Haymarket—my attention was attracted by a man in the street—whether he was drunk or shamming I do not know, but I went up and spoke to him—he was taken away by a policeman, and after that, there was standing by me, the prisoner, another man, and two girls—both the men were stran<lb/>gers to me—the girls asked me to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some drink—they were strangers—I had not spoken to them—I said I had no money, or I would—that was to get rid of them—the prisoner offered in a very kind manner to give me a glass of ale if I would accept it—I accepted the offer—we were to go to the nearest public-house—we went on—several were shut—the prisoner asked his companion if he did not know a house that was open where he could get it—he made some answer which I did not understand—</p>

               <p>we went as far as Long-acre, near Mercer-street, and crossed over into a street which leads to Queen-street, Seven-dials—on the way there, the prisoner and the other man were talking about policemen, and the conversation ended by the prisoner saying, "How can a fellow help himself, when they (meaning the policeman) take him in this way?"—he then put his hand inside mycravat, put his knuckles to my windpipe, and pressed me against the wall forcibly—I could not call for help—he held my head up by his upper knuckles and my chin and jaw—he then put his left hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took my watch out—made a snatch at the guard—he let go of my neck and ran away—he had forcibly thrust me against the wall as I have described before he took the watch—the watch-guard broke by his pulling it—he got posses<lb/>sion of the watch and chain and ran away—I immediately pursued him, call<lb/>ing "Stop thief," till I got into Neale's-passage, more than one hundred yards—he there tried to get into a doorway on the left of the passage—it was quite dark there—I knew he was there, by his hard breathing—I was afraid to touch him, being afraid of him—I called the police, who came di<lb/>rectly from Great St. Andrew's-street, and the prisoner was taken into custo<lb/>dy—he immediately threw out his hand, and the watch went against the wall opposite—I heard the glass fall out on some shavings—one of the officers picked up the watch—it is mine—the policeman kept him—I have not a doubt of his person—I was nineteen years old last June.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson's Defence (written.</hi>) On Saturday, 28th of February last, being in the town of Woolwich, and meeting with George Ellard, my fellow-prisoner, about nine o'clock in the evening, we went into the Hampshire Hog pub<lb/>lic-house, to take a glass together; and getting into conversation, we did not retire till near the hour of twelve. When proceeding homewards, in company with my said fellow-prisoner, we began talking of some geraniums I had at my house; when he, my fellow-prisoner, said he had planted two in the garden of the prosecutrix, in whose service he, my fellow-prisoner, had two months back lived as servant, and proposed, if I would accompany him over to the place, he would make me a present of one of them; and it not being far from my home, and at the same time not having proper com<lb/>mand of myself, in consequence of the liquor I had taken, I did not at the time see the impropriety of complying with his request, and finally accom<lb/>panied him to the place. When we got to the place, we found we could not get the geraniums without getting over the wall, which we accordingly did; but it being rather dark, and being in liquor, he, my fellow-prisoner, could not exactly find the place where he had set them, so we agreed to return back, and go home. Accordingly we left the place, and was proceeding homewards; but at a short distance from the place I came in contact with something, which threw me down; and on recovering my legs, found it to be a bundle, which we took home with us, and on examination we found it to contain wearing apparel; upon which discovery, he, my fellow-prisoner, wished me to keep it in my house till the morning, which I at first hesitated to do; but thinking there was nothing wrong, and my wife being from home, I consented, and in the morning, being Sunday, on my awaking and discovering what I had got, and nothing being mentioned in the neighbour-hood about any thing being lost, it was determined we should dispose of them; but my military duties engaging me the whole of Monday, and on the morning of Tuesday having to attend a concert, which ended at three o'clock in the afternoon, after which we came over the water to try to dis<lb/>pose of the property; and on returning home, being a great distance, and fearing to be late, we engaged a cab for our conveyance. When at the turnpike, in consequence of a dispute arising between my fellow-prisoner and the toll-keeper, we were taken into custody; and on arriving at the station-house, my fellow-prisoner being alarmed, he tried to make his es<lb/>cape, leaving me alone in the cab, where I remained till the return of the policeman and the cab-driver, who were accompanied by my fellow-pri<lb/>soner, whom they had captured. I have held my situation in the army upwards of eight years, and that with propriety and good conduct, which the master of the band and my commanding officer can testify; but through this unforseen circumstance I am fearful I have lost my situation, and my wife and two small children are deprived of a father, and all means of sup<lb/>port;</p>

               <p>and I pray you, my lord and gentlemen, in mercy to my family, and being the first time I was ever in trouble, that you will take my case into your most serious and kind consideration. At the time the bundle was found, I was dressed in my regimental uniform; which, had I been going to plun<lb/>der, &amp;c, I leave it, gentlemen, to your judgment, to think whether I would have gone in that dress or not."</p>

I re<lb/>member this Sunday, at four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Holy well-lane—he asked me if I had seen Sergeant Brown—I told him I had—he asked me which way he went—I told him, on the next man's beat—he said then he would wait for his coming back—I told him he had better go round his beat—he said nothing to that—I asked what was the matter—he said Sergeant Brown had taken him to the station-house, and reported him drunk—I said, "Never mind, you had better go round your beat"—he said no, he would wait till he saw Sergeant Brown, and then he would give it to him—with an oath I said, "You had better go round your beat"—he made no reply—I turned round and left him at the corner of the lane—in about five minutes I heard something pass between Brown and the prisoner, and two or three more police-constables, but I did not go to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday morning. March 15th, I was in company with Brown at a little after four o'clock—I saw the prisoner in Holy well-lane—I saw him cross over to the same side of the way as we were, in Shoreditch—he made a rush at Brown, struck him with his right hand, and with the truncheon in his left, he struck him on the head or face—he was swearing violently at the same time, and said d—n him he would learn him to report him for being drunk—Brown immediately turned round—his hat came off—he ran as hard as he could, the prisoner followed him, and I followed too—I called out to the prisoner "Baldock, for God's sake what</p>

               <p>are you doing? come back," but they were ten yards before me, I could not reach them—I came up to them at last—they were then both on the ground, and the prisoner was kicking violently, and swearing—Brown begged me for God's to take him off, or he would kill him—I took his truncheon out of his hand, and pulled him off Brown—he then said, "Let me alone, let me alone; d—him I should like to kill him, and then I shall die happy."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was sent for on the morn<lb/>ing of Sunday, about four o'clock, as soon as the prosecutor got home—I found him in bed—I examined him, and found several bruises on both legs, on his arms, and a severe contusion on the upper part of his forehead—it was more a contused wound, evidently from the blow of a blunt instrument—the skin was broken—the blows on the legs, I should think, were caused by kicking—there was one on the elbow, more severe than the rest—it was more a bruise than a wound—the forehead was swollen, there was a slight appearance of blood—the skull was not fractured—the blow on the head certainly must have been severe—in cases of contusion, the pa<lb/>tient does not appear in danger at the moment, still for forty-eight hours I could not say he was out of danger—he is under my care now, but is doing well.</p>

On the 13th of March, at a quarter before seven o'clock, I was at the corner of King-street—I felt something at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side, putting his foot on the curb-stone—I went and accused him of it—he said he was innocent—I said he should go to the station-house—</p>

               <p>he said, "Very willingly"—when he got a short distance, he struggled very violently, and I saw him put his hand behind him—he dropped the hand<lb/>kerchief when I got him to the corner of Snow-hill, and the officer came and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Stepney. I was put into a cottage by Harrison, a policeman, to take care of it—on the 16th of March, the prisoner came there and presented a paper, which he said was a memorandum of an agreement between his father and the late landlord, Mr. Greenside—that his father had received a note from Mr. Gordon, the solicitor, instructing him to repair the roof of the house, and he came for the purpose of examining, and to go to Mr. Dempsey, the builder, for him to send a man to examine the tiles, and for Mr. Bampton to inspect the lend—he went on the roof, and after he had been there some time, he called for a hammer and nails, which I handed to him—after being there some time, I got up to see what he was doing—I found some loose pieces of lead in the gutter—I asked how they came there—(I had never been on the roof before)—he said he did not know, but he found them there—I said, "It is evident to me, they have been recently taken from their places"—I could see that, by the places over the sky-light and under the sky-light, it had been evidently removed recently—I told him so—he said he did know—I re<lb/>placed the lead on the places—it all corresponded and fitted—after that, we both came down together—he left, and about three o'clock he came to show the same paper to Harrison, the policeman—I called him to Harrison, as he had stated that he wished to see Harrison, who lives a few doors off—he told him the same story as he told me—he went away—at six o'clock the same day, he knocked at the door, and said, "I desired you to keep that window shut," pointing to a window which was open—he bid me good night, and said he would be with me in the morning with Mr. Demp<lb/>sey's man, about the repairs—about half-past seven o'clock, I heard a noise on the roof of the house like footsteps—I did not go up—it was quite dark—nearly an hour afterwards, I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

On 22d March, at ten o'clock at night, I was in Cockspur-street, Charing-cross, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—I met Fitness carrying this carpet bag, with this property in it—I asked him what he was carrying—he said his matter's clothes—I asked where he brought it from—he said from a house in Pall-mall—I asked him the number of the house in Pall-mall; he could not tell me—I said then I should take him to the station-house—he said rather than go there, he would go back to the house he had brought it from—as we returned he laid he brought it from No. 6, Pall-mall—we went down Pall-mall, and found that was false—I told him I should not leave him till I saw whether he was right or wrong—he then took me to No. 6, Cleveland-row, which is the prosecutor's—he rang the area bell, and Taylor came up the area steps to answer the bell—I said, "I have stopped this man with a carpet bag, which he says is his master's clothes, and that his master has been dining here"—Taylor said, "It is quite right, I am sorry you detained him, he ought to have been home by this time with his master's clothes;" the servant girl came up, and also said it was right—I said, "Then I shall let him go; "he got about twelve yards from the house, when the prosecutor came out of the street door, and asked what was the matter—I told him, and he said, "I know nothing about a carpet-bag; where is the man? "I said, "There he goes;" he, hearing me speak to Mr. Keily, turned into Russell-court—I followed, but could not see him—I ran to the end of James-street, but could not find him—I returned, and said I believed he had escaped—the gentleman said the court was no thoroughfare, and he must he there—I returned again, and called a brother officer to come with his lantern, and at last I saw him run—I pursued after him—he was making his way across St. James-street—a man stopped him—I took him back to the court, and asked him for the bag he was carrying—he said he knew nothing of any bag—it was found and brought to me—I took possession of it—I detained him till Mr. Keily brought Taylor there in custody—the bag was locked—it was broken open, and the articles, named ill the indictment, found in it—the spoons are not silver.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of April, 1834, I went out—I locked the street door and took the key—I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and found the street-door open, and the parlour-door, which I had locked, was open—I missed from the parlour a bundle of linen off the chair—I lost the article stated in the indictment—I noticed a man, who has since been transported, leaning over the pales, before the house, as I went into the house—he has since been convicted of this robbery.</p>

I can see Bell's house from the side win<lb/>dow of my own house very distinctly—On the 17th of April, last year, I was at work in my shop, and observed three men lounging about; one had a paper parcel in his hand, tied with red tape, and sealed—they all three went up to Mrs. Bell's door—one separated from the others, about fifteen yards, and stood against the pales, while the others looked through the key-hole and one corner of the window—I hardly knew what to make of it—I thought it was an execution, and they wanted to get into the house—di<lb/>rectly afterwards, they pulled something out of their pocket, opened the door, and went in, and shut the door—I could see they were up stairs, rummaging about—I ran out of the house, and just before I got to Bell's door, two men came out with a bag, three parts full of things—I, being an old man, (and they young, and at a distance,) was not able to get hold of them—I secured the one who was set to watch, and he has been convicted—I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of the other two—I am not posi<lb/>tive; he appears to me about the size of the man.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183504060064"/>
               <p>I will call my husband"—she then took the child out of Thrope's arm, put the shoes under the child's clothes, and went out past the window—she returned with the child, but not shoes—they were than taken to the station.</p>

On the 10th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Orchard-street, and saw the two prisoners coming along—M'Carthy had a bundle—he crossed the street—I crossed—then he crossed again, and the two prisoners ran off, throwing the bundle down—I caught M'Carthy by the neck, and brought him back—the bundle contained this lead—he said some man give it him, and he did not know the other man—I asked where he worked—he said no where—I took him before the Magistrate—he then said he brought it from Tottenham-court-road, where he worked, and that Conden gave it him—I went next morning to Lincoln's-inn-fields, where I took Conden, who was at work—I asked him where his coat was—he said, "At home"—I said I knew better, for I had it at the station-house—I took him there, and he said it was his coat.</p>

On the morning of the 1st of April I was on the wharf at Pimlico—I heard a boat come along the Grosvenor Canal—I watched, and saw the boat come along, and the pri<lb/>soner in it—he went to the side of a barge, and took some coals into the boat—the boat then went on—I followed him—he went by the side of a barge—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "Nothing"—he had the rope in his hand at that time, and dropped it—I took it up, and pulled the boat up—I saw the coals in the boat—I said, "Is this nothing? I saw you take these"—he said, "Say nothing, and I will give you half-a-crown"—I left the boat with another officer, and took the prisoner to the watch-house—he said he was guilty—he said there were four other person on board the barge; but he told me not to disturb them, for, they had nothing to do with it.</p>

The prisoner slept in the same bed with me—on the 22nd of Febru<lb/>ary, I got up at eight o'clock in the morning and left the prisoner in bed—I left this property there—when I came home at night, it was all gone—the prisoner did not return to his lodging—his week was not up—I have not found the property since—no one could have gone into the room but the landlady, to make the bed.</p>

The prisoners came to our shop on Friday evening, the 16th of March, between seven and eight o'clock—I saw them in the shop, and in a short time my young man, Clemow, informed me he suspected the younger prisoner had purloined some article, she having gone out of the shop at that time—we immediately went after her and brought her back—she was waiting just below the house—we charged her with taking away something, which she positively denied—on lifting her cloak on one side, we discovered this piece of silk under it—seeing that she had several bundles at the time in her hand, I sent for a police-officer to examine them, and he discovered two shawls and various other articles in them—I found the private mark of some shop on the shawls, but not of our shop—the silk is ours, and men<lb/>sures eighty-four yards and a half—it is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can swear to it—I believe some has been cut from it, but it is now eighty-four yards and a half.</p>

I was attracted to the house by the cries of "Murder" about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning—I found the door fast, and was obliged to force it open—I went up stairs and found the room door open—I saw the male prisoner and the prosecutrix struggling together—the prosecutor was calling "Murder" in a very low tone—the female prisoner was standing in her shift, apparently in a tremor, with a petticoat or something across her shoulders—there was no light in the room—I got one from a person who lives close by—the prosecutor and prisoner were standing up struggling together—the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor with his knuckles against his throat, inside his shirt—the prose<lb/>cutor was bleeding, and blood flowing all over his face and hands—blood came from his face and nose—there was something hanging from his nose, as if part of the nose was separated—I could not at first see whether it was flesh or congealed blood—I found afterwards that it was a piece of flesh—he was bleeding very profusely from the head also—I found this poker in the room—the prosecutor appeared very faint—I seized the man and had great difficulty in keeping him from the prosecutor—he fastened on me, and I could not extricate myself from him without a brother offi<lb/>cer's assistance—another constable took the woman—the prosecutor ap<lb/>peared to have been drinking; but I should say he knew what he was about, from the account he gave me of the transaction—the male prisoner appeared the same—the woman was more gone in liquor than either a them—I took them to the station-house.</p>

I am a silk-dresser, in the employ of James Smith and others, in Horse-shoe-alley, Moorfields—I live in Bethnal-green-road—about a quarter to nine o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of March, I went up to the shop; the prisoner was there—he ought to have been at his breakfast at that time—I saw, by his side, four pieces of silk handkerchief and a pair of scissors—the handkerchiefs had no business there—I asked him what business he had there, he said, "Nothing"—I said, "What do you do with these pieces?"—he said, "I was doing nothing with them"—I said, "They have no business here, did you bring them up?" he said, "No"—I looked over them, and there were eleven handkerchiefs on each piece instead of twelve—I said, "What have you done with the other handkerchiefs?" he said "Nothing"—I took his hat off; and found four handkerchiefs in his hat, which corresponded with the four pieces, and I believe were cut from them—I examined them, they seemed to correspond in quality—I gave them to Mrs. Smith, who gave them to William Smith, in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman baker, and live in Mary-le<lb/>bone-lane. On the 21st of March, I fell in company with the prisoner at the Queen's-head, High-street—she came into the company I was in, and as they were quarelling she placed herself by my side, and asked me to go to the bar, and take something—we went and had a pot of half-an-half, and a quartern of gin—she then asked me the road to Oxford-street, and said she wanted to go to Brentford—we went on towards there—she said she was poorly, and should not be able to go to Brentford that night; could I tell her where to get a lodging—I asked a man, who directed us to No. 14, Woodstock-street—I went there with her; they said, it was too early—I said the woman was poorly—the woman of the house went up stairs and came down again, and said, she could have a lodging, and it would be two shillings—the prisoner told me to pay it and she would treat me—we went out, and had some half-and-half and some oysters—she then agreed that I should go to the house to take care of her—I was to go to bed and she was to sit up—we went back—I took my watch out of my pocket, and laid it on the table—I then undressed and went to bed—I went to sleep, and when I awoke, I missed my watch and the prisoner—I went and found her at the Hog in the Pound—I got an officer, and said that was the wo<lb/>man—the policeman took her, and said, "You have stolen this man's watch" she began to fumble, and pulled out the case of the watch—I said "That is part of it, but there is more"—I then saw she had my handkerchief, which I had not then missed, but I had left it in the room—she was then taken—all that she said was, "Here they are"—she did not say she had taken them to take care of.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had accosted her in the street, and promised to take her where she could lay down, she being ill; but to her surprise, he took possession of the bed himself; upon which she refused to lay down, and afterwards went to the public-house for refreshment; and that the prosecutor had given her his watch to take care of for him.)</p>

"The first intimation I had of the letter not having reached its destination, was on Tuesday, the 17th of March, (a period of exactly three months afterwards,) when Mr. Lawrence, one of the inspectors, inquired if I recollected delivering such a letter. I did not, and accordingly told him so; stating at the same time that I would endeavour to do so. On the following day, Mr. Lawrence again spoke to me on the subject, and told me that he had reported to Mr. Stone, one of the acting presidents, my answer of the preceding day; but on referring to the money-letter book, had found my name signed for it; adding 'Then of course, you have got the receipt for it.' I interrupted him by saying, that since he had first spoken to me, I had recollected delivering such a letter, and giving it to a woman, who appeared to be occupied in the shop, who signed the receipt; which however I had unfortunately destroyed at the end of the year, with a great many others. Finding myself likely, in consequence, to lose my situation, I applied among old servants of the establishment for advice; and being told by one or two, that when similar circumstances of losing their receipts had happened, they were obliged to make the money good, and all parties were satisfied. I, unfortunately, listening to this suggestion, went on the 19th to Mr. Liffiton, and although I asserted then, as I do now, my positive conviction of having delivered the letter, I said, that sooner than get into any difficulty, I would pay him the three sovereigns, upon his saying that he had received the money and was satisfied, should any further inquiry be made about the matter. I may have acted imprudently and indiscreetly, but I deny having been actuated by any guilty motive."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ladies' shoemaker, and live in Matilda-street, Commercial-road. On the evening of the 2nd of March, I was in a public-house in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, about eleven o'clock—while I was there, the prisoner came in with another man—he and I got into conversation about the county of Kent, for about twenty mi<lb/>nutes, or it might be half-an-hour—we left the house together—I went away with both of them, walking one on each side of me—we went to the Bell, opposite to Whitechapel church, and had a quartern or a quartern and a half of rum—we had a glass each—I had not taken any spirits till I was in Osborne-street—I was rather the worse for liquor when I left the Bell, but knew perfectly what I was about—I walked arm-in-arm with them into Cannon-street-road, and there the one not in custody tried my fob, for my watch—my trowsers being tight he could not get it—I tried to get from them, but the prisoner held me tight, by my right arm—we went on about half a dozen yards, and then I was knocked down by the other man—the blow stunned me—when I recovered, I found my watch gone, and the prisoner standing by me declaring his innocence—I called out, "Watch" and "Police"—mine was a silver watch with a double case—it cost seven guineas when new—it was jewelled—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken up last Tuesday week, I think—it was about ten days after the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Henry Bradshaw Fearon, wine-mer<lb/>chant, Holborn-hill. On the 24th of March a porter came to the house with this note, signed "D. Hill"—I received it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Union Pottery, Vauxhall. Please to send by bearer, 2 gallons best brandy; ditto, rum; ditto, gin; packed for the country; do not keep the man long for the permit, for the cart is waiting for it in the City. Yours, D. Hill. Please to put them in one hamper." We have a customer named David Hill, who lives at Union Pottery, Vauxhall—I believed it to be his hand-writing at the time, and delivered the goods—I saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 26th of March, in consequence of receiving a second order, which was brought by another porter about three o'clock in the afternoon—I then went out into Holborn, and saw the porter who brought the second order—he pointed out the prisoner to me as the man who gave it to him—he was standing nearly opposite the entrance to our house—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—I asked him who gave him the note—he said Mr. Hill's foreman—I then said it was very strange Mr. Hill should send an order by a strange porter, when his own cart was at our door delivering goods (which was the case)—he then contradicted it, and said a strange man had given it to him, a tall man at the gate, who he did not know—I took him over to Mr. Hill's in about half an hour, as he wished me to go with him—he told me he was employed at another pottery, two or three doors from Mr. Hill, and asked leave to go in to his employer—he got out of the cab, and went in to his employer's—I followed him—he went in to the upper part of the premises and I took him—I found he was employed there—I saw him in custody at Guildhall on the next day—I told him we had received an order in the same writing two days before, and delivered the goods—he said he knew nothing of any but the one he had delivered, and expressed his surprise at our having had one before—he said he knew nothing of the first order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Fearon. On the 26th of March, a porter brought me this letter—I went out with him into Holborn at one door—the porter left by another—I saw the porter talking to the pri<lb/>soner—he pointed him out to me, as the man who gave him the note—I asked the prisoner who gave him the note—he said, Mr. Hill's foreman at first—I said, "It is very strange he should send an order by a strange porter, when his own cart is here"—he then said, "It is a tall man that has just given it to me—I do not know his name"—(<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>)—"Please to send by bearer, two dozen of port, and two ditto of sherry—Yours, &amp;c. D. Hill."—I had sent the spirits on the Tuesday—I asked him to walk into the counting-house, and called Hill's man forwards, who said the prisoner was employed within a few doors of his master's—he wrote me down his name, "J. Watkins"—I took him to Vauxhall in a cab—he said, "I will go in and ask master to go with you to Mr. Hill's"—he then went into his ma<lb/>ter's—we went and searched his master's premises, but could not find him—we found wet foot-marks on the window—he had escaped over the houses.</p>

I missed some milled boards, about two o'clock on the 27th of March—I detected Wood as the thief, and he pointed out the prisoner's shop—I went with an officer to his premises in Bear-street, Covent-garden—the prisoner came out of the back room—the officer said he had a warrant to search his premises for stolen property—he said, "You have, have you? what may it be?"—he then asked if he had lately bought any milled boards—he said he had the day before, and had sold them again the same morning—Kentish asked him if he had sold them with the Government wrapper on them—he said no, he had no Government wrapper on them—Kentish then inquired who he sold them to—he hesitated some time, and said they were not far off, they were in the neighbourhood—Kentish looked behind the counter, and found a piece of the wrapper which had been on the boards—he showed it to him—I said, "This is what I want, find as much of this as you can"—he searched further, and found part of the duty stamp which corresponded with the part he had found—I then asked the prisoner what he had given for them—he said, "I sup<lb/>pose you know I gave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound"—I told him he was aware they could not be got honestly for that—they would cost me 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they had not been used—they were just as I received them from the sta<lb/>tioner's shop the day before—they had not been in my house half an hoar before they were stolen—the prisoner said he thought it was a fair price, and admitted he had sold them to Mr. Roe, a few doors lower down—I went with the officer to Mr. Roe's—I then went back with Mr. Roe and the officer to the prisoner's—Mr. Roe said to him, "This is a bad job, Denny, for if I had paid you for them I should have been in a nice mess"—the prisoner said, "These are the boards I purchased yesterday; at they are your property, you are welcome to take them away "—I said I must take him, I was very sorry, but I was compelled to do it—we took him to Bow-street, and Wood was there—the moment the prisoner saw him he said, "God bless me, that's the man I bought them off"—the Magistrate then referred the case to Guildhall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Museum-street, Bloomsbury. The pri<lb/>soner Carroll was in my employ for nearly four years—he was foreman, and had nearly the whole management of my business—I did not know Job till I saw him at the station—I have heard Carroll mention his name, and believe he knew him—I went to the station on the morning of the 1st of April, at half-past, seven o'clock, and saw this bobbin of silk, and four hanks of worsted, which are mine—the silk is worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the worsted about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Job said it was not miner that he had bought the silk in St. Martin's-lane, and the worsted in Ropemaker-street—he was then in custody—I went home, and said to Carroll, "How do you account for what I have seen at the station-house?"—he said he had taken 1 1/2 lb. of worsted and 5 drams of silk, and sold it to a poor man who was <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>—he had au-thority to sell my silk and worsted—he books the account of what he sells, immediately, but he had not booked this, or any part of it, nor has he paid me any money for it—he ought to pay it to my wife, who is generally pre<lb/>sent—I asked him if he had entered this in the book—he said, "No."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it Carroll's habit to enter every little trifle at the moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he ought to do it—if I saw him leave the book, I called him back to enter the articles—if the book had been made up in the evening, I should have been satisfied—these things were taken in the morning—he said be had sold these articles to a poor man, who would call and pay in a day or two, and he would not enter them till they were paid for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of attending the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when goods are sold on credit, Carroll did not pay me for them till they were paid for—I have seen Job at the shop, I think, six or seven times in the last twelve months—he came to purchase articles there—he is a bell-rope maker, I believe, and for that business he would require such articles as these—Carroll never took articles to supply his private friends, and paid for them out of his wages—I never knew it, nor did my husband ever speak to me about it—I am always in the shop—Carroll had the entire management of the retail business—we have a good many customers in a day, but he ought to enter every article as it is sold, if several cus<lb/>tomers are in the shop—I do not remember any article being sold by eight o'clock in the morning and not entered by three o'clock in the afternoon—I have said to him, "You have forgotten to enter such and such articles which have been sold"—Job sometimes bought half a pound or three quarters of a pound of worsted—I never saw him buy silk—we do not allow silk to be sold except to persons that work for us—no persons in our business have bought silk of us—I do not think I should let any fringe-manufacturer have any silk—when Job has come to our shop I have called Carroll to serve him—I think Job has not made any purchase that I have not seen—our business was increasing—I cannot say whether the stock was increasing—I never complained to my husband of the deficiency of any articles—I never had reason to suspect that I had lost any thing through Carroll.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Thomas Burrows and Son, Houndsditch, but the concern belongs to John William Burrows. On the 3rd of April I took a bag of confectionary from their house—it contained the articles stated—I was to take it to the King's Arms, Holborn-bridge—as I went I saw the prisoner and another man—I had seen them before about town—the other was a carman—he had a town-cart and a load of cases—the prisoner said, "How do you do?" and asked where I was going—I said to Holborn-bridge—he said, "That is just right, we are going across Smithfield"—I then, at their request, put my load into their cart and walked behind—when we got to the Brown Bear, the prisoner said, "We are going to have a drop of beer, have you a mind to have a drop?"—I said "No, thank you"—they went into the public-house—I stood outside—they then came out and went on to Ropemaker-street, where they stopped, and again said, "We are going to have a drop of beer, will you have a drop?"—I consented and went in—the carman who was with the prisoner, said he should have half-a-pint of ale—the prisoner said he would have half-a-pint of beer—I said I would have the same—the prisoner drank out of the pot and then came out—I came out and saw him outside—he said, "I shall be in in a minute"—I went in and drank the beer, and when I came out the prisoner and the man were gone, and the cart and my bag—I never saw the bag again—I was going over London-bridge the next day, and saw the prisoner—I <hi rend="italic">pounced</hi> upon him, and said, "I want you"—he said, "What do you want with me? I do not know you"—I said, "You knew me yesterday, and I know you now"—he resisted a little—I told him I would knock his head off—I took him a fewpaces till we met an officer and took him to the Mansion-home—when we got there, I said, "What an infernal brute you must be to rob a poor fellow like me, who you know would have to pay for the things and most likely lose his situation"—he said he should not have done it unless he was drunk; but he was as sober as I was—I said, "What have you done with the bag?"—he said, "If you will go along with me you shall have the bag, just as it was"—he said it had been opened, but nothing taken out—at that moment the officer came up and said, "I will have no compromise here"—I told the officer what he had said—he said I must have nothing to do with it—I had before said, I would not go any where without an officer—I have not found the bag.</p>

I asked Johnson how she came by the articles she had in her possession—she said a young man named Prouse had given them to her, that he had just received his advance note, had it cashed, and had given her four sovereigns last Saturday—she requested me to go and see Prouse—when Clamp was brought in, I said, "What money have you about you?"—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

On Saturday, the 28th of March, I was in master's shop—the prisoner was there—I saw her concealing something white under her apron—she went to the further end of the shop—I followed, and took a shirt out of her apron—it had hung in the shop, pinned with three pins—I detained her—the handkerchief had hung at the door—it was produced at the office—it belongs to my master, and is worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I remember the prosecutor being there—he went to light his pipe; and while he was gone towards the fire, to light it, the prisoner, who was the waiter, came up to the table, took the brown paper parcel off the seat, and went towards the bar with it—I thought he was bringing it to the bar for safety—when the prosecutor returned from lighting his pipe, he asked if I had seen the parcel—I said, "Yes; I saw Thomas, the waiter, take it to the bar, and I believe it is all safe, or all right, but I will inquire"—I went to the bar, and made inquiry—I am quite sure I saw the prisoner take it away—I do not know what became of it—he went out of the tap-room, towards the bar, and might have left the house without my seeing him—when he returned to the room, I asked what he had done with the parcel—he asked what parcel I meant—I said I meant Byrn's parcel, which he took off the seat—he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "You do know something about it; I saw you take it off the seat, and I will make you find it"—he was my pot-boy—it has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap-maker, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. At the latter end of February, Thomas Fitzgerald came to my warehouse, and produced a letter purporting to be from Mr. Parton, of Chatham—I read it, and returned it to him—it stated that he was a buyer of soap—I inquired of him as to Mr. Parton—he stated that he was a most respectable man, and he had done a great deal of business for him; he wished to recommend him to us—he advised me to send him some samples and prices—I furnished him with four samples—he called again in three or four days afterwards—he produced a little memorandum-book, from which he read an order, which he said he had received from Mr. Parton, which he said was to be sent, in the course of the week, to Cole's Upper Wharf, to be sent to Chatham—I directed sixteen hundredweight of soap to be packed up to his order, which came to upwards of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he returned again on the following Wednesday afternoon—he was in a hurry to have the soap sent off, as he said the barge would be going—the soap was then packed and sent—while it was being packed, he came to me and said he wished me to send it in his own name, as he had other goods which were going at the same time, and he wished them to be sent in one invoice—he produced a bill of exchange, drawn by a Mr. Ormsby—I did not accept, or consent to accept, that bill for the payment of the goods—I expressly refused it—I then went to the warehouse, and met Merrell at the door—I told him I had agreed that the soap should go in Mr. Parton's name alone, and he was to make the bill in that name; the prisoner then said it was the last time he would take any orders for soap—I told him he should have the usual commission, which is one shilling per hundredweight—the soap was then sent off in the cart; and Thomas Fitzgerald left about the same time—he left the bill of exchange on the desk—I did not see my clerk make the invoice, but I saw the bill of parcels which our clerk sent; it was in the name of Parton—our clerk after<lb/>wards addressed a letter to Mr. Parton—here is the letter and invoice which were sent—on the 7th of March, James Fitzgerald came to the counting-house; we had, in the mean time, received a letter from Mr. Parton—I asked him how it was that Mr. Parton had not ordered the soap, which we had sent down—he stated that they found, upon going down, that Mr. Parton was in bad circumstances; he had called his creditors together, and he did not think proper to deliver it—I sent Merrell to Chatham, and in consequence of what I heard, I took James Fitzgerald into custody.</p>

I never gave you any orders to that effect"—he said, "I know that, I was going to take it down to your house"—I think James Fitzgerald could hear that—I said I had a letter from Mr. Sturtevant, making a demand on me for the amount, and that a person would call upon me for it—he seemed rather to doubt it, but said, "Well, I can get rid of it in the towns; I can dispose of it"—alluding to the three towns, Chatham, Stroud, and Rochester—I was close to the barge, and I saw the ends of two of the chests of soap—I saw this paper, which I took off and read—it contains the weight of the soap, and has my name upon it—I had not compounded with my creditors, nor called them together—I have been in business fourteen years, and am in good circumstances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Castle-street, Hounds-ditch, but am now in custody. I had dealings with the prisoner about the 26th and 27th of February—it was on the Thursday and Friday I dealt with him—he came to me on the 26th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, with a parcel of samples of silk in a paper, and asked me to buy some of them, and ultimately we agreed for 144 or 145 yards, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, all round—it was silk and cotton mixed—the shots were cotton, and the other parts silk—he came back again, and said, "Won't you buy any more of it?"—I said, "No"—he came back in about ten minutes, and said, "If you will have more of it, I will let you have it a fraction cheaper"—I offered 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for about 300 yards—he would not take it without I took 400 yards, and he brought 425 yards—I think that was at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had them to sell for a gentleman who wanted to raise money—I bought 552 or 553 yards of him in all—about three weeks after that I went to Plymouth—I was very ill at the time—I saw Messrs. Dabb had Stevens, at Plymouth—they bought 115 yards of the silk of me, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it was that which I bought of the prisoner at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but I gave them liberty to pick out the best patterns—Mr. Dabb and I had some conversation afterwards about the silk, and in consequence of what he said, I left the silk in the hand of Mr. Hertz, where I lodged, and came to London for the purpose of ascertaining about the silk, to get the man I had them from—to get a regular bill of parcels of the silk, which I had asked him for when I first bought it—he had promised he would bring it to me immediately, but he did not—after coming to London I saw the pri<lb/>soner on Wednesday morning—I had a great deal of trouble in going after him, and not letting him know what it was about—he came to my house by his sister's orders—I did not want to tall him what had taken place—I said to him, "Mr. Lazarus, you must make the measurement good, and had better give me a regular bill of parcels of the goods I bought of you"—he said, "I will bring it to you in less than two hours; I will go to my man, if you say there is short measure, and will bring it in two hours"—he went away, and promised to come again, but did not—I was looking for him the whole afternoon, and found him in a public-house in Gray's-inn-lane, or Portpool-lane, in the evening—I went out with him, and kept him in conversation, meaning to give him to the first policeman I saw; but I did not see a policeman—it was dark—I gave him into the custody of an officer in Barbican.</p>

               <p>refused to call him—the Magistrate said he would call him as his witness, and he was called—I deal in every description of goods; such as silks, linen, hardware, jewellery, watches—I go to sales and coffee-houses, and buy any thing in an honest way—I was a general dealer when I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act—I have been a bankrupt—I called myself a general dealer then, to the best of my memory—I can hardly tell; either that or merchant—I do not recollect which—I took the benefit of the Act about four years ago—I have not paid any thing myself—I do not know whether they got in the debts—I never inquired—I gave up all I had—I think there has been something paid, but I am not sure—I live in Castle-street, Houndsditch—I use my back parlour as a wareroom—I have dealt with Lazarus before, and always found him a very honest man—I had no hesitation in buying these goods—it did not strike me that I had got a good bargain—I thought them worth that money, and no more—you may buy job lots in a warehouse quite as cheap or cheaper—I never went to Plymouth before this transaction—I have a sister living there—I was very ill at the time—the doctor advised me to go a sea voyage—my sister's name is Sophia Hertz—I left the silks in the hands of Hertz—I took the goods by the steam-packet to Plymouth—I went about the 20th of March—it was good weather, not at all tempestuous—we had not at all a rough passage—I took good care of the silks—they were put where nothing could come at them—I had more goods with me; linens, table-cloths and cover cloths, and stockings of every description that I had in the house—I went round Plymouth and Dover, and offered my goods, but could not sell a yard—I went to Mr. Dabb, and he was busy, and asked me to call again—I called with all my goods—he picked out to the amount of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was quite a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now when you went to Plymouth, what account did you give of the silks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I bought them as a job-lot, from a person in London—I was not asked the name of the person—I did not give it—I did not men<lb/>tion whom I bought them of, till I went to my attorney, which was on Wed<lb/>nesday afternoon—I had come to London on Sunday night, very ill indeed, and was not out of bed on Monday—on Tuesday I went in search of La<lb/>zarus—I first mentioned that Lazarus was the person I bought them of, when I had him in custody—I told my attorney, Mr. Yates—I had been told at Plymouth that the goods were suspected to be stolen, the par<lb/>ties there had heard of the robbery—I did not give the account of Lazarus to save myself—I had no idea of saving myself—I knew who I bought them of, and went to London to get my man, and to know whether they were the goods that were stolen—I came to London and asked him for a bill of parcels—I did not tell him what had happened—I told Mr. Dabb that I had exchanged these goods for jewellery—I did give a watch and chain in part payment of the third lot of goods—I told Mr. Dabb so—I swear I told him that, and nothing else—I never used the word jewellery—that is jewellery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not state before the Magistrate that you had offered the goods to Mr. Cohen, of Prescot-street, and to a man who went about, whose name you did not know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was to Moses and Mr. Myers—I told the Magistrate I offered them to Mr. Cohen, and to a man who goes about, but they would not let me go on with the name—I did not say that I did not know the name of the man, and could not tell where he lived—Mr. Jones, the prisoner's attorney, interrupted me at the time, and would not let me speak—he is the same Mr. Jones who taught the porter—the porter was examined before the Magistrate, but he had been taught by Mr. Jones what to say, and all the other things—I found him in Mr. Jones's company, and he knew every thing that had hap<lb/>pened—he said he did not know Lazarus at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mention the name of Myers, was it not at the house of Myers you yourself first left a portion of the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was at Mr. Key's—I did not take any to a pawnbroker's—none were sent there, to my knowledge—I did not authorize any body to take them—all the goods I disposed of at Plymouth were what I offered to Dabb and Co.—I offered them to all the shopkeepers at Plymouth, Devonport, and Stonehouse—I did not give Hertz any to pawn—I heard from Mr. Dabb that he had pawned some, but I knew nothing about it—some of my linen was pawned as well—Hertz is a poor man, and has done so, I understand; but I really do not know any thing at all about it—I left my goods in the care of Hertz, to give them to Dabb—they were in a sort of tea-chest, which was packed full—I did not pack them up as tea on board the vessel—they were in a wrapper and paper, and then in the tea-chest—we do not enter goods in a steam-vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever in your life charge Lazarus with having any know<lb/>ledge of the goods, till you yourself found that you were charged with being in possession of stolen goods, by the gentlemen at Plymouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not, because I did not see him till Wednesday morning—Mr. Dabb did not ask me about it—he told me there was a rider at his house who thought he knew the goods to be stolen from a gentleman in London, and I (considering I had no bill of parcels of them,) thought it best to go to</p>

               <p>London to see about the matter; whether they were honestly come by or not—I bought them on the 26th or 27th of February—I was not able to go about my business for three weeks—I bought them at home—I have no bill of parcels when I buy a job-lot of goods, unless it is at a regular ware-house—I measured them when Lazarus brought them—in the first lot there was a deficiency, but it turned out to be greater—I was by myself when I measured them—there was a gentleman in the room when I paid Lazarus for the second lot—that was Mr. Herschell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not charged with being the receiver of the goods, before Sir Peter Laurie? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—I had no idea that I should be sent to gaol—I was not allowed to produce Herschell as a witness—I was stopped by Mr. Jones—Mr. Adolphus, my counsel, was at the second examination—he did not offer to call Herschell—I do not know what my solicitor has done—I believe I have a counsel here to-day—I did not say before the Alderman that there was no person present when I paid for the goods—when I met the prisoner in Portpool-lane, I was going to give him in charge to the first officer I met, but I could not find one till I called on Collingridge, a refiner, in Wilderness-row, and told him to assist me to get one—I could not find an officer from Wilderness-row to Barbican—I did not see any officer—I might have seen a policeman far off, but I thought the prisoner would slip away before I could call him—if I had sent for a policeman when I had him in the public-house, he would have been sure to have gone away, for he was more acquainted with the landlord than I was, and he would have had assistance and gone away—some of his friends were there—there was a house-full of people who might have done me a mischief.</p>

I recollect being in Levy's house some time near the end of February—when Lazarus came there, I was in the back room, looking at some goods—Levy left me, and opened the door to a knock, and I saw Lazarus come into the back-room—he carried a kind of basket with goods in it—it had some covering—I saw it opened, and it contained silks—I saw them taken out—Levy first took out one piece—they both took them out—a few words passed, like contention, about buying and telling, between Levy and Lazarus—they drew on one side of the room, and I on the other—Levy began to measure some of the silks; and when he had mea<lb/>sured ten or twelve yards, Lazarus said to Levy, "Let me have the money, I have no time, the people are waiting for the money—you may take my word, I will be answerable to you for the measure, that it shall be right"—I saw Levy give him some sovereigns, I cannot say how many exactly, but there were above twenty, and Lazarus then left.</p>

               <p>sevidence is correct—when Livermore described the other man, I went in pur<lb/>suit towards London, and overtook Wheeler, at Bow, about two miles further on—when I got up to him, I asked him where he had come from—he said, "From the other side of Brentwood"—I said, "What way did you come?"—he said, "Through Romford"—I asked if he saw a man leading a horse on the road—he said yes, he did, and the man asked him the road to Lon-don, and he told him to turn round the corner—I asked him how the man was dressed—he said he had got a frock on—I had met a waggon, and asked him if he, had seen that waggon on the road—he said yes, he had, and he knew the waggon by the boy who was with it—I said, "It is clear to me you have not come through Romford, for that waggon came over Woodford Bridge"—I took him back to Livermore, and said to Livermore, "Is this the man?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—Wheeler said, "Well, you might have seen me before"—the same mare was afterwards shown to the prosecutor.</p>

I missed hay at various times, and in consequence of that, I communicated, on the 19th, with War<lb/>den, and gave him instructions—I went with him that evening to the Marshes, and found six trusses of hay bound, in the enclosed fence—War<lb/>den put into the stack three pieces of paper, and into each truss several pieces of paper—on the following morning we found the hay was gone—I went to the prisoner's house, and found the hay there—it was my father's hay, I have not the least doubt of it—the pieces of paper were found in it</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Woolwich police. I went with the prosecutor to the field on the 19th, and saw six trusses of hay in an enclosure, and part of a hay-stack—I took a slip of paper, containing my report-notes, and tore off three or four pieces—I put them into the uncut part of the stack, and put one piece into each truss—I went to the field next morning, about five o'clock—the trusses were gone, also one portion of the uncut—one of my tickets laid on the ground—I went and informed Mr. Strother—I made search in the town, and on Satur<lb/>day morning I went to the field, and from the entrance of the field I traced tracks of hay to the prisoner's house—I called out, "Is Mr. Taylor here?" several times—I saw the stable door open—I opened it more, went in, and said, "Is Mr. Taylor here?"—nobody answered—I found the hay there—the prisoner's daughter came out and spoke to me—I went and told Mr. Strother that there was hay there, but I could not identify it—in the after<lb/>noon he went with me, and I found three of my tickets in it, which I had put in on Thursday night with my own handwriting upon them—the pri<lb/>soner's son was on the premises, and said he had purchased the hay—I took him into custody, and the father came up to me—I said I should take him, and I believe Chittendale took him into custody—I am certain the papers are the same—they are my own handwriting.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ—on the evening of the 13th of March, I marked some trusses of hay—I saw the same trusses safe on the morning of the 14th, which was Saturday—I concealed myself in the stable, and about seven o'clock the prisoner came into the stable, fed his horses, and then sat down on a truss of straw—some time afterwards, a man, whom I could not see, came to the door, and the prisoner said, "Come along, I just want one dram this morning"—he asked, the man if he had a handkerchief—he said he had, and he could have a little bit that morning—he went to the manger, but whether he took any thing or not I cannot say—the prisoner said he had not got much that morning, for his mistress had been peeping through that b—y hole—they then went away—I went for an officer, but could not find one—I went home, and the officer came some minutes after—I said nothing to the prisoner that morning, but he went through his work as usual—in the evening I went to the stable to see that every thing was safe, and missed two trusses of hay; but one of them I had ordered him to take to a cus<lb/>tomer—I went and got a search-warrant—we then went to Mrs. Loft's, where I found the truss of hay I had missed, with a stick in it, which I had put—I had directed him to take a truss to Mrs. Bevis', but not to Mrs. Loft's—it was his duty to sell hay; but when he did, he was to bring me the money for the hay so sold—he sold hay to different people—after he was in custody, he said he had trusted Mrs. Loft for four trusses of hay—I had not had the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Bexley-heath. I went to the Crown and Masons' Arms, at Woolwich, on the 7th of March—I went into the tap-room between three and four o'clock—I remained there till between seven and eight o'clock, but was not drinking all the time—I had a leather purse with me, with a half-crown and three shillings in it, and some papers—I had taken it out to take a shilling out of it, about five o'clock, and I left 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the two prisoners came in while I was there—they sat at the other end of the room, and then stood before the fire, and after that Williams came and sat by the side of me—I cannot say at what time that was—there was no clock in the room—I had a quartern of gin and peppermint—I put my hand to feel for my purse, and could not find it—I think it was then between five and six o'clock—that was about an hour after I had put the purse into my pocket—Charlotte Wheeler had been sitting by me—I was quite sober—the purse has not been found, but the constable found some money.</p>

He escaped from there, by getting over a wall—I went immediately to his lodging, and waited in the passage till he came—I then told him I took him for that wet linen out of Hogg-lane—he said, "Say nothing about it, and I will give you all I have about me"—I said, that was not the way I did my buis<lb/>ness—I went into his room, and found these articles in a box—he wanted me to put them back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in East-lane. On the night of the 26th of March, I was at Berry's house, in Hogg-lane—the prisoner came in there, and said he was going to the other side of the College—after he had been there a little while, he trod on my toes, to make me go out with him—he said there were some handkerchiefs hanging in a court, and he went and took them down—he offered me some, but I would not have them—he then told me to follow him, which I did—he went home, and left them there—he wanted me to sell them, but I would not—we then came down together—he went one way, and I went and told the policeman—I have had no dispute with him—he said, while he was unpinning the things, that he took them for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live at Uxbridge. On the 25th of September, the prisoner Moore came to me at Uxbridge, and said he had been down to my field at Drayton, three miles from ux-bridge, and had seen some bricks there which he thought would suit him—he asked me if they were for sale—I said, yes, and I should be glad to sell them—I asked him if it was to be a ready-money transaction—he said, "No"—I said, as he was an entire stranger to me, I should not think of letting my goods go unless I had good security for them—he said if I would meet him in London, he would take me to his ground-landlord, who would be answerable for the amount of the bricks—ha appointed for me to meet him next day at eleven o'clock, at the Bell, Holborn, to go with him to the ground-landlord—I got there at twelve o'clock—Moore was not there—I left the Bell, and bad a message, which fetched me back—I returned to the Bell, and found Moore there—he had a man with him whom I found afterwards to be named Toovey—he called him his foreman—we agreed on the price of the bricks—I set off with Moore to go to the ground-landlord, in a cab—while riding, I asked him how far it was—he said not far, that it was at the Retreat, at South Lambeth—I asked him his ground-landlord's name—he said, Grobecker, and that he kept a large grammar-school—we at last got to the Retreat—it was a very large house, with a lawn in front, and a garden and two large hot-houaea behind—we got out there—the servant came to the door—I accompanied Moore through the house into the garden—we found Grobecker there—Moore introduced me, and said, "This is Mr. Grainge; I have been down to look at his bricks for the buildings in Sidney-square"—he had told me before that he was going to build Sidney-square, and a street there, and should want about 300,000 bricks—I said, "Mr. Moore has been looking at my bricks, and says you are the ground-landlord, and are going to build Sidney-square, and the street there—will you be the security for the bricks?"—Grobecker said, "Yes, I am—it makes no difference whether I pay you, or Moore—have you bargained for credit?"—I said I had no ob<lb/>jection to give the usual trade credit—upon which Grobecker said, "Per<lb/>haps we shall manage it better than that, when we have got the goods?"</p>

I know nothing of you; I wish you would leave my place"—he said, "My good lady, excuse me, but it is a good offer; the coats are worth fifteen guineas"—he said they would fetch him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a sale, and that he kept a shop at the top of the Kent-road—I said, "Well, I know nothing about it"—he said, "My good lady, I have a wife and ten children; I am a respectable man, and keep a respectable shop"—Magnus had gone out at this time—the prisoner asked if I would buy the coats—I said no, I would not—he said, if I would not buy the coats, would I pay the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would leave me a deposit, that he should return the money in less than half an hour—I said I would have nothing to do with it, for I did not know that the coats were not stolen; and then in came Magnus back again—the prisoner wished then to know if I was going to pay this money—I said so, I would have nothing to do with it—he said he knew that the coats could not be stolen—that he knew where the livery servant lived—that he knew Magnus as a livery servant in the Kent-road—he did not call him Magnus, he said he knew that man to be a livery servant, and to live in the Kent-road—there was no other man there at the time—he said he knew that his master had died—he pressed me to advance the money, finding I would not buy them—I then took four sovereigns out of my pocket, and laid them on the table—I took them up again and put them into my pocket, and said, "No, I will have nothing to do with you; go out of my place"—I then went to go to the door to call Susan, who was then living with me, to get rid of these men—Abrahams caught hold of one of my bands, and violently held me, and pushed me by the stomach as I was calling Susan—I said, "You will please to unloose me, and not hold me," and then he did unloose me, but he would not let me go into my shop—I felt frightened, and thought, somehow or other, if I did not give the money, it would be forcibly taken from me; they haviig asked me before that, if I had got 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked, why they should ask me that.</p>

               <p>—he had a clothes-bag on his shoulder—he was near enough to see Mag<lb/>nus take up the sovereigns—he said, "Pay him, my good lady, pay the man; I will give you a deposit, and will bring you the money in less than half an hour; you are doing a deed of charity"—after Magnus took up the sovereigns, he took the coats up, and laid them on a chair—he said, "Shall I leave them in this handkerchief?"—I said, "I do not know; if you know the man"—he said, "Oh, I will take the handkerchief," Abrahams gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they both went off together, leaving the coats on the chair—neither of them ever returned—they never came to my house again—about a month afterwards, I was walking out; a man, dressed not as a livery servant, came up, and asked me how I did—I turned round, and said, "Why you are the man that had my money"—it was Magnus—he said, "No, my good lady, you are quite mistaken; I keep a respectable tin and brazier's shop in Petticoat-lane"—he showed me a card with a name on it—I said, "I do not want the card; I want my money"—he said, "Will you come and have something to drink?"—I said, "No, you had my money, that is what I want"—I looked for a policeman, but could not see one, and he made his escape—I was walking down the Borough three or four months afterwards with my sister; I had got a little before her; I turned round, and saw Magnus speaking to my sister—I stopped, and asked her what he was saying to her—she said he was asking who I was, what I was, and where I lived—I told her to have nothing to do with him, for he was the man who had my money—he said, "Woman, you have accused me of that before; I am not the man"—he said, "Will you not come and have some drink?" I said, "No, it is my money, and not drink I want"—I could not get a policeman, and he went away—about six or seven weeks ago, I met him again in Fenchurch-street, while the prisoner was in New<lb/>gate for another offence, I was walking with my brother; I said, "Here is that Barnet Magnus"—on which he said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Never mind how I do, I am very ill, but I will do you; Mr. Abrahams is now in Newgate, and I shall <hi rend="italic">intercede</hi> about the money you had of mine"—he called me a fool and an ass; said I was drunk, and a mad wo<lb/>man—he abused me very much—I was not able to give him in charge—I was ill, and was led in the street by my brother—I could not walk alone—it was on a Sunday—he said, "This is the third time you have charged me with this"—I said, "You are the man"—he was not dressed as a livery servant, but I was sure he was the man—I was not able to give him in charge, and he got away—I saw Abrahams after that—I had met him be<lb/>fore that on Holborn-hill, and given him in custody—I am certain he is the man.</p>

In the afternoon of the 18th of March, at five o'clock, I saw the prisoner Dunn with a pocket of hops on his head on a knott—Messrs.

Barlow, Gill, and White's, and if I wished, he would go back with me to the warehouse—I said, he might if he liked—and he took up the hops, and went with me—when we got to Messrs. Barlow's ware-house, he called Lloyd to the door, and Grubb came out with him—Dunn said, "The policeman has stopped me with these hops, are they not all right?"—Lloyd said, "They are all right," and he pulled this piece of paper out of his pocket (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"March 18, 1835. Mr. Butter: Please to receive one po. repack, from T.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Barlow, Gill, and White—we are hop-merchants—our counting-house is near the Town-hall, and our warehouse in the Maze—Lloyd was our foreman, and Dunn one of the porters—I did not know Rutter, but by name—when hops arrived from the country, the side of the pocket is cut open and a quantity of hops are taken out, which are trimmed into a form called a sample, and the hops which are cut away from the sample, constitute a quality which are again put in pockets, and called repacks—this is a custom perfectly well known in the trade—Mr. Thomas Saxby was a customer of ours, and was in the habit of purchasing repacks of us—on the first of February, he purchased eight pockets of repacks, which were numbered according to the custom of our trade, one to eight inclusive; and I gave instructions that Saxby was to have the repacks, and I ordered the man to deliver them to Saxby's order—the pocket of hops in question does not fall within the numbers from one to eight—I am not aware that there is any written order from Saxby for the delivery of these hops—I know that three of the pockets of repacks had been delivered, and that there are five more remaining—Saxby certainly had no authority to sell any of our hops—the pocket in ques<lb/>tion had never been sold to Saxby—I had never given orders to deliver any hops to Rutter—it is not unusual to send hops out on a man's head—a slate is kept in the warehouse to make rough entries on, and then they are entered in the book—the weight of the hops is not put down on the slate—we have regular books for that.</p>
