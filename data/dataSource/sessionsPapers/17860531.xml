               <p>Could you swear to that half guinea as seeing it in your possession that night? - I swear to this halfpenny remarkably, I had it in my hand an hour one night, and it was put into the bason among the half-pence; the bedchamber was on the ground floor, it was a large sash, I found it wide open in the morning, the prisoner had left my house then, the last word I spoke to him was on the Saturday night, I said, John, go to bed, because somebody must be up in the morning; he must get in at the window, otherwise he must be concealed under the bed, one way or the other; there were the marks of feet in the yard, and the mark of a foot on the chair.</p>

               <p>I live in Cold Bath Fields, the prisoner came to me about eight on Saturday morning, I never saw him before in my life, when he first came he asked for Mr. Smith, I went and asked him his business, he said he was informed I wanted to buy a horse (I often buy horses for my business) I told him I wanted to buy several, he said he had one to sell, he came without a horse; then I asked him where the horse was; he said, he was coming with it to take it to the horse-killer's to have him killed, and coming along he had spoke to some coachmaster or coachman, and he had asked him to buy it, and the coachman told him it was a pity to have such a horse killed; and I told him that I wanted to buy one, and asked him where the horse was, he said he had put him up at the Black Horse in the Old Bailey; I desired him to fetch it; he said it was put up there for a shilling, and he could not get it away without the shilling, I lent him a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did not you suspect him? - Not till the horse came, I sent my man with him, and my man and he came together with the horse, I asked him how he came by it, he said it belonged to one Mr. Shaddick of Acton, a farmer, who had sent it by him to be killed, I told him I thought it was a pity the horse should be killed; I asked him what he must have for it; he said he could have 25 s. when it was killed; I told him it was worth more than that, and I begged of him to go to his master, to send a note by him to certify that it was his horse; he left the horse with me and went away, he asked me what I would give for it, and whether it was not worth two guineas.</p>
               <p>Was not it worth more? - I do not think it was worth much more; he then left me to go to Acton for liberty to sell it, I took the letter from him, and tried to read it, but I could not, it was so badly written, I told him that was no satisfaction to me, he then said he would take away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310007"/> the horse, I said no; he then said he would go and fetch his master who was in the Haymarket, and he went away, but instead of bringing his master he brought another letter written much better, I am sure the prisoner is the man that came to me.</p>

               <p>Court to prisoner. What are you? - A labouring man; as I was coming out of the country I came to Turnham-green, it was ten at night, I asked a man to tell me of a place to lay down, and he took me to a barn and shewed me some clean straw to lay down on, and he left me there a considerable time; then he came and took me out, he had this horse, and he told me to sell it.</p>

               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Taylor, I was in the shop; between five and six, the prisoner and another woman came into our shop to buy a pair of leather pumps, I am sure to the prisoner, my master was in the parlour drinking tea, there is a large glass window that looks into the shop, the boots hung on a chair, the prisoner was leaning on the left hand side of the chair where the boots hung, she bid me threepence less than the selling price, after I had fitted her with a pair; my master sent me to tell them they should have them for two shillings and ten-pence, they were two houses off, I did not observe they had any thing particular about them then, and they said they would not have them at all, when I came back my master went into the parlour to drink another cup of tea, and in about three minutes he came out and missed the boots, then he sent me after them, I took both the women in Rosemary-lane, I said nothing to them, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310008"/> were coming towards the street that my master lives in, and the prisoner had the boots under her cloak, I was sure she had them, though her cloak was so very much confined I could perceive the heel under her cloak, I clapped her on the shoulder, says I, where are the boots you stole; she said, I have no boots; then she dropped one, and I picked it up, and brought her into the shop, and we found the other boot under her clothes, which I brought into the shop with her; I am sure this is the woman, those are the boots.</p>
               <p>Have they been in your possession ever since? - Not ever since, I left them upon my master's table last night till this morning, I am sure these are the boots.</p>

               <p>There was a woman with me, and that woman gave me the boots.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner in a situation best calculated to take the boots, or was the other? - I think it was hardly possible the other woman could take them, she had a child on her left arm where the boots hung, and this woman had nothing but a cloak on, and stood as close as possible, and she urged the other woman to go.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these boots? - I valued them at a guinea, the price is twenty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. Are you married or single? - Single, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been sufficiently fortunate in this instance, that of the breaking out of the house, there is not sufficient evidence to affect your life, and to prove that part of the charge that is capital; for if there had, it is very probable that your Sovereign, however gracious his inclinations are, would not have thought you a very proper subject of mercy; for the fact of a servant getting up in the night, and robbing his master's house is so extremely dangerous to every family, and to the peace and good order of society; that no punishment that the law can inflict can be too severe in this: it is my duty, and the duty of the Court to prevent you from the possibility of doing future mischief, and to sentence you</p>

               <p>Gentlemen; this mine is at Chiswick; this is a black lead mine; the only mine of that kind either in England, or in the known world; the property therefore is very considerable; and the lead that comes out of it is of great value; it is opened as the consumption requires, every six, seven, eight, or nine years, and then filled up again with water, so that it is impossible that any person can commit a felony there, besides which, there is an act of parliament made for the very purpose of protecting this mine; when the mine is opened Mr. Banks, who is possessed of one half of it, and the other <rs id="t17860531-15-viclabel92" type="occupation">proprietor</rs>

On the 4th or 5th of March last, a maid servant observed some foot steps on the snow, and some black dust scattered on this white snow; it did not strike her particularly; but on the next evening a gentleman's servant coming from Mr. Lindsey's, who lives in Essex-street, observed a man within the railling, he had something like a firkin, which he threw down and ran away; another man, which he believes to be Oliver, was seen there, he escaped; upon examining the cellar, they found that the lead had been stolen which you have heard mentioned in this indictment, and out of the cellar where the valuable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310018"/> lead was, one firkin was carried off, the others were removed, and only that one which was seen by the servant, was conveyed away from the premises; advertisements were put in the papers, and a reward offered for any one that would discover that firkin, as it brings twenty-five shillings in the pound, and being about eighty pounds, it makes the value about 100 l. one of the persons concerned in the robbery made a discovery. Gentlemen, so strong and secure was the door in which this lead was put, that they were obliged to break down the wall. The accomplice Wilford being examined, gave this account: that on the 2d of March, he and those four men, having had information, that a very great and valuable commodity was kept in this cellar in Essex-street, where they might easily do it, as the phrase was; on the 2d of March they went there with an iron crow, which in their way they call a rook, they found this was not sufficient, they got more made; and on the 4th of March, they went, and with force and violence broke open this place; that the first day, on the Saturday, they took out of the cellar these four boxes, which they afterwards sold; but being informed that there was some better, they broke open that door, and were in the act of taking these firkins out of it, if they had not been disturbed; that he was the person who went off with the first firkin, when he came to St. Clement's church, where he was to wait to take a coach, and convey it to the house of the prisoner Bray; that he heard the cry of stop thief, and that Oliver was the person who endeavoured to make his escape. The advertisement likewise went into the hands of a man of the name of Barew; he said, he was applied to by Bray for the purpose of buying some lead, that he applied to a man of the name of Barnet to go with him to see what it was worth; Barnet, who was a deale in pencils, told him that was the common sort, and for the parcel he only offered four guineas; and one of the prisoners, I do not know which, made use of this odd expression,</p>

               <p>"d - n my blood, here is a fine rigg indeed, four of us to go to the new drop, for four guineas;" they then told him, on Monday, he should have a better parcel, and when the money was paid, all the prisoners were present. On the Monday they came and sent to Bray's house, and Bray with the assistance of the other prisoner's wife Dawson, brought it from underneath the bed; it was then shewn to Mr. Barrew, and Mr. Barnet, and an agreement was made for it; they then lamented, that they should have had a great deal more; but were disturbed; they then told him, they had been breaking the wall for the purpose of getting into that place, and therefore they were only able to carry off one firkin, and left the rest; but Oliver told them, that he had in fact been boned, or bobbled, or something like that, which was understood to be, that he had been taken into custody, and had been stopped, but had made his escape. Gentlemen, I have only opened the outlines of this case, many facts will come out much stronger; but in regard to the mine, there is none in this kingdom or any other that is known of at present, of the species of black lead; the proprietors once a month, and only once a month, dispose of it to the trade for two hours, and when they come for the purpose, and want it to make pencils of, they toss up who shall have the first choice; in this property, therefore, there will be no difficulty, as to the identity; because it will be in evidence to you that there are no other persons but these proprietors that can be entitled to it. Gentlemen, the evidence against the first four, against the principals, will be the evidence of an accomplice, corroborated in many circumstances, by the evidence of Barrew and Barnett, who were present, and by the evidence of the servant, who will tell you of one person going off with a firkin; some of the property will be produced to you; and Barew and Barnet will tell you, that the prisoners were all present at the time it was shewn them. The evidence against Bray, and M'Glew, and Dawson, will be his; Bray was active in selling and purchasing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310019"/> this commodity, Dawson conveyed the property from one house to another, and M'Glew also; and there is no doubt but they will come under the description of that offence, of receiving this lead knowing it to be 
stolen.</p>

               <p>What persons of your name are proprietors of these lead works? - Charles, John, and Mary.</p>
               <p>Have any other persons of your name any share in these works? - No, they have not.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Fox. Do you know the cellars in Essex-street that contained this lead? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what manner was it secured? - The door was secured by two locks, one of the keys is in the custody of Mr. Banks; I keep the other key for myself, and the other proprietors; the 2d of August last, I saw this cellar opened, and locked up again.</p>
               <p>Was it ever opened since to your knowledge, and by your consent? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you speak of any lead being missed out of the cellar, when you was first apprised of this robbery being committed? - I was first apprised of the robbery on Sunday the 5th of March; I came to the place, and saw a vast croud of people, then I went home and got my key, and I found the outer cellar door which opens inwards, forced inwards, the staples were drawn, and the bolts were bent, it appeared to be forced open; the next thing we observed, was the cellar on the left hand was forced open, and three or four boxes missing; the lead I first saw, in the first cellar, was of the best kind, and was brought out of the inner cellar; the door not opening in the same manner that the other did, in order to force the door open, they had been obliged to make a considerable hole in the wall, to get a particular crow in.</p>
               <p>How long was this hole in the wall? - More than a foot, and by the means of that hole they had effected that purchase, which opened the door in the inner cellar; we observed several casks to be moved, we saw the place clear where the casks had stood; I was in the cellar the 2d of August.</p>
               <p>What quantity of lead was lost? - I apprehend one cask, and four boxes of the best was lost; the casks generally run eighty pounds weight, at twenty-five shillings per pound, which is pretty near one hundred pounds; the lead in the boxes were of an inferior quality.</p>
               <p>In what manner is this lead disposed of in your sales? - We have another house in Fetter-lane, where we have a sale once a month, for two hours, it never happens that so large a quantity as a cask sold; I am informed there is none of this sort of lead in England; that house in Fetter-lane is the only one in England in that way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, prisoner's counsel. Do you happen to know Mrs. Snell? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she is at this time married? - No.</p>
               <p>What is she? - She was a widow.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Frederick? - No more than by the name.</p>
               <p>Is she a widow? - She is called spinster.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - She has always been represented to me as such.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether all these gentlemen that are now named are living?</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any evidence to prove the men dead, or the women married? - No.</p>
               <p>At these sales in Fetter-lane, what quantity is generally disposed of; do you sell to the amount of a cask and four boxes at a time? - No, never.</p>

            . I was at the opening of these mines, in May, 1778; I attended it alternately with Mr. Banks's agent; we packed it in butter firkins, and attended it to the Kendal cart, there we delivered it to the London waggons, and took their receipt; I did not attend the delivery, at the waggon in London; when we have taken out the lead, we fill it up with mud, and then let in water, so as to make it impracticable for any one else to work it; then we cover the mouth of the pit with rubbish and stones, and there are locks; besides there is a house over the mouth of the pit, and that is locked up.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at the warehouse in Essex-street, in August, 1785? - I did, I locked the door myself, and I gave one key to Mrs. Fox, as I always do; Mr. Banks's agent takes the other; there are two different locks, and two different keys; I went the next day after it had been broke to see the state of the warehouse; the outer locks were both forced, and the cellar on the left hand side was broke; there were the marks where four or five casks of the best lead had been taken away; there were between three and four casks missing; it is twenty-five shillings a pound; the coarse lead may be worth four or five shillings a pound.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Gregor, No. 28, Carey-street; on Sunday the 25th of March, I went to Mr. Lindsey's house in Essex-street; at the time we were within the house, we heard a noise, I said, I heard a knocking; the maid said, there was a book-binder at the next house; I had no suspicion of any robbery, coming out, I perceived a man going out of the iron gate, which goes into the street, with something on his back like a barrel, or like a butter firkin; when I came down the steps, I saw a man come out of the cellar door, which is on the right hand; as I came down the steps, I enquired of him, what business he had there, he said, he had only been to ease himself; I told him in these words, as near as I can recollect, that he was a d - nd eternal liar; I immediately went and shut the iron gate within side, and kept myself there; he jumped out over the iron gate; I believe him to be Oliver; I ran after him; he fell down, nobody assisted me, and I lost him in St. Clement's church-yard; I returned back immediately to the chapel, and went and examined the cellar, thinking there might be some more in it, but there was not; when I came to the cellar door, there were two of these bars, and on the right hand, there hung two or three bags; I went into the cellar; there was an old lanthorn with a candle burning in it; I had not been long there, before some people came down to know who it was cried stop thief; I ran into the street, and they told me he was taken; it was a little after eight, and a clear night; I really believe him to be the man, to the best of my knowledge; we were but a trifling time scuffling, I was fatigued with travelling; when I was in Bow-street, I went over to the Bear, and picked him out of a great many people; I believe there might be about twenty there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Some of the thief-takers persuaded him? - No, Sir; one of the men asked me if I would go the Brown-Bear, and I did, and I looked at the prisoner, and said he was the man; nobody told me.</p>

             came up with a key in her hand, and said I was not to have the lead for that money; I refused quitting the room; and I desired Bray might come up, and let me know what the difference was; he came up alone, and I agreed to give him four guineas and a half; I gave him two guineas in part; Dawson came as a porter to carry it away; he was not employed by me; he took it away; I put the remainder in two handkerchiefs, and the prisoner Buckey, whose name is Oliver, he came in with a handkerchief to carry it along with me, being Sunday; I then gave Bray two guineas, and one of these two guineas he gave to Oliver; Barnet was there; M'Glew was present, but I do not know whether he received any of the money. On Sunday, Bray asked Barnet the difference between the good and the bad; he said, if this is not the good, which is the good? Barnet said it was larger, and cut fine; Bray then asked if we would call on the Monday, and he would get some other; on the Monday morning I called on Barnet to go and lock at a better sort; they came to Bray's house, when Bray brought two parcels, one in an apron tied, and one in a table-cloth, and shewed it to Barnet and me; this was better lead, but not quite the best; Bray asked ten guineas for that; there was between thirty and forty pounds of that; Bray said, upon my asking whether he had got any more, they had like to have had four or five more casks, but they had only got one cask; they had been a matter of three hours at work, and one of them had like to have been taken, and they had broke through a strong wall; I did not agree for the lead, Barnet advised me not to buy it; on the Tuesday evening following I saw Mr. Bray, and he told me he had sold the lead, and made all the money he asked for it, to one Phillips; on Saturday in the afternoon, between four and five, Mr. Barew came to my house; I went with him; Bray said there was a very great noise, and the people concerned in stealing it would be taken; and he advised me to go out of London, and promised to take care of me, if I went out of London; but I gave information; the lead has been under my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you any relation to a man of the name of Uzziel Barew? - I am not.</p>
               <p>This is not the first time you have been in this Court? - No.</p>
               <p>The situation in which you stand is not the only one in which you have appeared here; have not you stood, for instance, where these men stand now? - I do not know that I have any right to answer that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You must produce the record? - If I have been unfortunate, here is my pardon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then I believe you have stood there? - I admit I did.</p>
               <p>What was it for? - I cannot tell particularly.</p>
               <p>No good act, I dare say? - I do not think I have any right to tell.</p>
               <p>You was convicted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the only time you have appeared here as a criminal? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. I believe I examined you at Lancaster? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no objection to your testimony? - No; I did it for the good of the public.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to abide by this, that that time was the only time you was tried here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you appear against these men, before there was an advertisement of a hundred pounds reward? - No, nor till after, till I found that if I had not appeared against them, they would have appeared against me; I bought the goods on the Sunday, and on the Saturday after I gave the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310024"/>How long after the advertisement? - Four or five days after; I did not give the information particularly for the reward.</p>
               <p>In your examination before the magistrate, did you say any thing of seeing M'Glew in Bray's house? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He never did.</p>
               <p>Court. How comes it, it is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dawson. Did not you pay me for carrying it? - He came to me the Tuesday after, and asked me for payment; I told him I thought he was one of the persons concerned in it; he said he was not, and I gave him half a crown; I told Bray, and he said he had no right to ask me any thing about it, for he was his man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did M'Glew take any part in the disposal of the lead? - I did not observe him take any part in the business.</p>

               <p>I was met by Mr. Barew; he told me he was coming to look for me; he pulled out a little bit of black lead; that was Sunday morning, the 5th of March; he desired me to go with him; he asked me what I thought of it, and he told me if I would go along with him, he would give me half a guinea; we went to a public house, and had a quartern of gin; I said I could not say any thing to so small a sample; I went with him, and waited at the corner of a court in Holborn, and he brought me about half a pound in a paper; I said I should be glad to see it all; I went with him into a public house, and called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Who keeps that house? - I do not know; then he came and called me out, and I went along with him to the house of Mr. Bray; I believe it was his house; and there were all the prisoners, excepting M'Glew, I do not know them by name; there was M'Glew and Dawson I did not see; I am sure all the other prisoners were there, I am quite sure I saw them every one there; when I went from there, I went to a house up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you see Wilford the evidence there? - Yes, he was in the room, walking up and down the room; there lay half the lead in a basket, and half on the floor; Barew asked him what he would have for it; he asked him ten pounds for it, and he offered him four pounds; then Bray went below, and a woman that he calls his wife came up, with a key in her hand, and said the lads would not let him have the lead for any such money; he said she should go down again; he would not come out of the room till he came up again; accordingly, she went down, and Bray came up, and they agreed to give him four guineas and a half for it, and he gave him two guineas in my presence in the room, and when he gave him the money, we all went below.</p>

               <p>Who was below stairs with you? - There was Mr. Barew, me, Mr. Bray, and the evidence, and all the five prisoners; he paid him the other two guineas below, and said he must owe him half a guinea; Barew and Bray went out of Bray's room, and while I was packing it up in handkerchiefs, Wilford said; I believe it was him, or one of them, said, d - n my body! here will be a go, if we are all to be hanged upon the new drop, for the value of four guineas and a half; while I was there, Wilford asked me what kind was the best; I told him it was a fine large sort, and shone like a looking-glass; and they said, d - n it, we will have some of it in the morning for you; in the morning, we called there; I carried part of it home in a basket; when we called the next morning, Bray and his wife were in bed, and we asked him if he had got any of the large, and he shewed us some from under the head of the bed, some in a cloth, and some in an apron, of the good sort, about forty pounds; on Monday I did not see any of the prisoners, but Bray and his wife in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never saw M'Glew at Bray's house? - I never did.</p>

I said nothing that will affect her; she gave me the key; it was all put there on the Saturday night; then we went again on the next night, and found another barrel; we made a hole in the wall to make a purchase to get the door open, we had a light then, we took it with us in a lantern; we had been at work there two hours, or two hours and a half on the Sunday night, and we were obliged to break down the corner of the wall before we could get this purchase; we found nothing but barrels in that place; I took one and got away with it, and I heard an alarm of stop thief, and I went to the New-church, I fetched a coach and took the barrel to Bray's house; Griffiths had apartments there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bray. Was I at home then Wilford? - No, I did not see you when I got there, they were there before me; Oliver said to me, that he had been boned.</p>
               <p>What did he mean by that? - That he was taken; he said, there was a gentleman coming out of the place, and another at the door, and he escaped, and they took him in Essex-street; the others said, they were glad to see I had got away with it; then I saw Bray, he took some of it in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him how you came by it? - No, I went to the publick-house, he went somewhere else, he came back and asked me if I was willing to take five guineas and a half for it, I asked him if it was sold well, he said, he was no judge of it, I told him if he liked; and he gave me one guinea then, and the remainder the next day.</p>
               <p>Was you to have the whole of it to your own benefit? - It was to be divided, Oliver and me being old friends, we kept a guinea apiece, and we divided the remainder between the other men and ourselves.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of M'Glew? - I never saw him at all; I saw him when he went to Petticoat-lane; they did not tell me who it was sold to.</p>

               <p>How long after the robbery was committed? - I was taken a week after the robbery was committed, and the next day I went before the Magistrate, on the Monday, then I came to Bow-street; about three or four days after I was taken for this affair.</p>
               <p>What has happened between you and Oliver? - We were over the water, and Sir Sampson's men were after us, and a girl we call Black Poll, came and told us to make our escape; I said something, and Oliver made a reply d - n your blood do you speak against the girls, and he let fly at me with a horse pistol, and lodged one of the slugs in my head.</p>
               <p>Was Bray at home at the time? - I did not see him.</p>

            'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am not the first unfortunate man whom the machinations of the witnesses who have appeared against me this day, have brought to this bar, and the ignominious situation in which I now stand; and if they have not in this instance, which is far from improbable, been the absolute projectors; they have in too many others, where they have derived the reward they have this day sought, been the first proposers of robberies, of which they have afterwards given circumstantial accounts in this Court, sacrificing the lives of their fellow creatures, either in purchasing the property they had instructed others to procure, or in causing them to be apprehended, which ever best answered their purpose of gain. The evidence

            , was apprehended for the Great Seal of England, and conviction would have followed, had not the woman who first gave the information been bought off. In fact, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, this very evidence Phillipps, and his connections, could give account of most of the robberies which are committed, and the only reason they do not appear where great rewards are offered is, because they have made considerable more by purchasing of it. The witness Barrew is a man of the same description, and has in this Court been the frequent subject of the severest reprehensions, and the object of condign punishment; and had not the mercy of the law been extended towards him, by admitting him an evidence for the Crown, in a mail robbery two years ago, he would not have wanted what he hopes to derive from my conviction, for he must have met that fate he has involved on many unfortunate men. God forbid that your Lordship, or the Gentlemen of the Jury should receive the testimony of such men, as ye would that of those standing before you, actuated by no mercenary view, but inspired with a laudable zeal for the administration of justice, with that benevolent commiseration a good a man will always feel for an unhappy fellow creature; but I humbly trust in the justice and humanity of this honourable Court, that their scheme to injure me will upon this occasion prove abortive; for I humbly hope that where there are no solid proofs to establish my guilt, you will not pronounce it; and that therefore in this, as well as in every other circumstance of surmise or conjecture; it will be deemed as just and charitable to suppose for, as to suppose against a prisoner: and I trust too, that though a man may be unfortunate enough to have a blemished character, this Court will not allow that he shall be made responsible for offences he never committed; or that a surmise or supposition will be sufficient to supply the place of a chair convincing proof. My being in possession of a sample so immediately after the commission of the burglary may superficially appear a proof I knew in what manner it was procured; but, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, when you consider, that it is very natural for men, who have procured property dishonestly, to dispose of it as soon as they can, you will not wonder that so immediate an application was made; I was employed in the business merely to procure a purchaser, and the evidence Barrew can confirm this, for I acquainted him so at our first interview on the Sunday morning: it is true, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I may merit censure for not enquiring how it was procured; but I hope the want of prudence will not justify the charge of criminality. When Barrew called on Sunday morning with his friend,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310028"/> he desired to see the whole quantity, as he could better determine, he said, than from a parcel which might have been partially selected; it was shewn him, and in the true spirit of his profession, he offered four guineas, for what I had been instructed to ask ten; and to this I humbly beg to call the particular attention of your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, as it carries its own comment. Had Barrew, (whatever he may now insinuate) believed, and he has a very great experimental knowledge in that kind of business, that I knew how the lead was procured, he would have treated with me as a principal; but another circumstance my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, which I have to state, will still strengthen, I trust, the solemn assertion I now make, that I did not know how it was procured, and am consequently innocent of the charge of which I now stand indicted; which is, that when the Crown evidence, Wilford, and the prisoner Oliver indicted for the burglary, were informed what Barew offered, they appeared dissatisfied, and went to him, they concluded the bargain; I was not present, and Barrew took away the lead; but had I been an accomplice in the burglary, I should, as I before observed, have treated with Barrew as a principal; I must observe to your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, that Oliver and Wilford slept in a house, rented by a woman, with whom I have some time cohabited.</p>
               <p>On the Monday morning, Wilford acquainted me that he had brought some more lead, and requested, that should Barrew call, I would shew it him, and ask en guineas; Barrew did call, and I complied with Wilford's request; he offered four guineas; I told him, as I had the preceding day, that it was no property of mine, that the price fixed was ten guineas, and I could say nothing to any other proposal; Wilford some little time after took away the lead, and I heard no more of the unfortunate transaction until I was apprehended. The witness who has been considered competent to appear in evidence against one man, will not I humbly trust be rejected, when his testimony may be favourable to another, and I therefore hope your Lordship will seek the corroboration of Wilford, to any part he can confirm.</p>
               <p>I have now to return my thanks for the very indulgent patience with which the Court has heard my defence; a defence which I trust will secure to me that verdict, which my own heart tells me I deserve: for I am persuaded your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, will, when you are considering my case, not forget the characters of those who have appeared against me; and finding their money-interested testimony unsupported by creditable and positive corroboration, not give spirit or encouragement to such nefarious plans, in future, by throwing the reward into their pockets, at the expence of sacrificing an innocent man to the vengeance of the law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I was going to submit to your Lordship that there is nothing to call M'Glew on his defence; at the time when this was deposited, it was deposited in the house where these persons lived.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think I should call on M'Glew for his defence.</p>

               <p>At the time he made this confession to you, did you promise he should not be prosecuted? - No, Sir, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him into it? - No, Sir, it was a free voluntary act of his own mind, and I am sure he was not intimidated, because he very correctly wrote with a pen and ink, every article I have missed, and more than I had missed.</p>
               <p>Did he assign to you any reason why he took these things, or that it was by mistake? - He hoped I would forgive him, he said, it was the first time; I had not a vast deal of conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Had he lived any time in your service? - Three months, or thereabouts; I had no reason to suspect his honesty.</p>

               <p>I am a salesman in Monmouth-street; I bought this coat of the prisoner, and put the seal upon it at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>What did you give the prisoner for it? - Sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry how he came by it? - He came very publicly into the street, at four in the afternoon; he had it over his arm; he offered it to several shops; it hung at the door all the week after, I had no notion of its being stolen; the officer came to me, and I fetched it down immediately; it is small sized, it will not fit the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What would such a coat as that cost at first? - I suppose about three guineas.</p>
               <p>Coachman. The coat never was worn six months.</p>
               <p>Smith. Then, you have worn it night and day; gentlemen's coachmen generally have their left-off clothes; we buy better than this; I saw the coat; says I, it is rather too small for you; says he, it fitted me when it was first made for me; and he being a young man, I thought he might have grown.</p>

               <p>Is it in a strait line, or is there any turning? - There are several turnings.</p>

               <p>You found nothing of your's upon them? - No.</p>

               <p>He told you that coolly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He said he was of the profession of the law? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They said they had no objection to going back? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, when you came up to them a second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310036"/> time, he did not like it so well as the first? - No; in the first place in the shop there is a bit of an iron rail close to the door, this iron rail is to protect the shop from persons who do not come in.</p>
               <p>Is there any iron grating, any wire-work? - Yes, to my sorrow, now too late for me, I have put some up.</p>
               <p>How far did that iron rail extend into the shop? - About a foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Shepherd. If you could refer to Bow-street for the evidence that was given there, you would find great variations; Sir, Mr. Frazer swore, that Mr. Kirby stood next the door, and

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You expressed a surprise at the time you was wrapping up the handkerchiefs, good God! what is become of the India handkerchiefs! were these India handkerchiefs there in the morning? - I saw this parcel of goods in the window, about five or ten minutes before they came in; I saw a heap of goods before they came in, but I cannot say whether they were these India handkerchiefs; it is not a common rule for us to put above one or two pieces of these handkerchiefs in the window, but undoubtedly my wife put them all.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue these people in the direct road that leads to London, or how? - I saw them about a hundred yards off; I saw the pockets bulk out, of the man that I passed.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance of any connection between them and these prisoners? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am wife of my last witness; I remember the prisoners coming to our shop; on Monday the 1st of May, between twelve and one in the morning of that day, as near as I can recollect, came in the two men, Kirby and Shepherd, I had never seen them before; Kirby said, he was recommended by a friend, a neighbour of ours, to buy some silk handkerchiefs, which hung up in the window; I reached them down, they were not the India handkerchiefs; he asked the price, I told him three shillings and ninepence, I said, I would take three shillings and sixpence; he then asked the price of some thread stockings, I asked him two shillings and sixpence per pair; he told me, he would give me five shillings, for a pair of stockings and one of the handkerchiefs, I refused that; then he said, he would come again in the afternoon, and bring his friend, she was a little busy; they then left the shop, and returned in the evening with the woman at the bar; and asked me again to let him look at the silk handkerchiefs which they saw in the morning; I reached them down and called Mr. Frazer down, I told him to go and serve the handkerchiefs, and I would measure the binding, they asked Mr. Frazer the price of the handkerchiefs, he told him three shillings and sixpence; he offered thirty shillings for ten of the handkerchiefs, which he refused;

             was not in the shop in the afternoon, he stood at the door, the shop door was ajarr, and I repeatedly asked him to come in, he declined coming in, and as we could not take the money for the handkerchiefs they all went away; after they left the shop, Mr. Frazer went to gather up the handkerchiefs they had been looking at, he says to me, where are the India pattern handkerchiefs, I turned about and said, here they are, I concluded they were, I looked, and they were gone; after Mr. Frazer came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310037"/> down, I stood very near the window, but I was turning round to serve a boy with some thread and binding, and did not much attend to them during the time.</p>
               <p>Was it possible they should take such a quantity of handkerchief off the bulk that has been described, when you was so near the window without your observation? - I did not see them take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were these pattern India handkerchiefs loose in the window for shew, or were they tied up in a parcel? - They were folded up.</p>
               <p>So that if you had laid hold of them, they would of course come loose, as my handkerchief does now? - They might not.</p>
               <p>How many different pieces are there? - There are some three, some five, in a piece, some whole pieces, they amount in the whole to fifty-seven handkerchiefs; I was standing almost close to the window, between my husband and the window; these things were missed instantly, and they were pursued in about five minutes; he was seeking his hat and folding up the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>It was almost instantaneous was it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I understand you have no grate or wire-work to protect your counter? - Yes, I had a wire to the counter, to protect the handkerchiefs, but where these handkerchiefs lay, there was not, they were at the end of the wire; it took its beginning from the door jamb, and went to the end of the counter, next the door a foot and a half.</p>

               <p>At what distance from the door? - About a yard; my Master was up stairs; Miss Shepherd came in, and said, these are the handkerchiefs you looked at in the morning, and Mr. Shepherd stood at the door, with the door a-jar, with his great coat upon his arm; I went into the parlour; I only saw Mr. Shepherd at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These handkerchiefs were about a yard from the door? - Yes, from the door to the counter there is a little wire-work about a quarter of a yard, then there is a glass case; I was in the parlour; there is a glass door; there was a little boy in the shop, a neighbour's boy who keeps cows, very well known; indeed there was another lady in the parlour, and she said, is that one of your sweethearts?</p>
               <p>So that it seems you and the lady were looking pretty sharp upon this smart young fellow at the door? - Yes, Sir, I did not know what to think of them.</p>

            ; he said there were some goods that belonged to me; when I looked at them, I saw they were mine; I had not missed them before; I went with the Jew to the other side of the New Church, he opened the goods to me; in consequence of the Jew's information, I sent for an officer, and took the prisoner into custody; some of the property had my private mark upon them; I can swear to some, but there is no mark upon the greatest part of the goods; in the stockings we generally sew a little mark, but in these the mark is taken away, but I have no doubt but they are mine, but I cannot be positive; the muslins appear to be different sorts of muslins, cut from different pieces; my house was not broke at all, the prisoner was in my service till the moment he was taken up, the goods were brought back to my house, and there the prisoner acknowledged it; I promised him no favour not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Did he apprehend at the time that he made that confession, that he would be brought to justice? - I had sent for the constable an hour before.</p>
               <p>Had you threatened him or frightened him into confession? - No, I had not; the confession he made was a free act of his own mind; I said very little.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. So large a quantity of goods as are now produced, and were found in the custody of the prisoner, must have been taken at different times? - They must.</p>
               <p>Atkins. He said he used to take them at different times; he said, after they shut up, he took out a bundle, and then made up a box, and took them to this woman's house.</p>
               <p>Court. It is pretty extraordinary to me, that such a quantity of goods as these, should not have been missed by you? - A great part of these goods I had bought only a few days before, and some of them had not been in the house a week; and the next morning after he was taken into custody, I looked round, and the first thing I missed was muslin aprons; these things were kept in my shop; I had not any suspicion of the prisoner before this; I kept him merely almost because I had a very good opinion of his integrity.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow prisoner's counsel. Who gave it you? - I received it from an evidence that is in Court, one Mr. Payne; I know it perfectly well, by its being my cancelling; I am perfectly sure that is the draft I received, the draft was brought to me for payment; I asked the person that brought it, whether he chose to have it in bank or money? he said, half in bank and the rest in money.</p>
               <p>Court. These transactions are no evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He paid that draft part in notes, and part in cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You talk of cancelling it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cancel with two strokes? - The others do; I make four strokes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing so peculiar in your manner of cancelling that you can venture to swear you paid this draft? - I have a copy of the entry taken by myself, an entry of the partners paid in bank notes; it is my province to pay the money, not the bank notes, the person who brought it, first said, he would have it in money, then he would have it in cash and notes; I am very positive this is the note that was given to me.</p>
               <p>Who has had the custody of it ever since? - It has been in the custody of the house ever since; it was delivered to Messrs. Hardcastle and Field, they found it to be a forgery, and we have had it in our custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Was any promise made by the Magistrate or Messrs. Bland, or any person whatever to induce this man to confess? - None that I know of; I saw him sign that; it was read over to him; I saw the Magistrate sign it.</p>

               <p>Have you never heard Macmanus say, that some such thing was intimated to him? - No, Sir, we did not know where the money was till we came to the Justice's.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. If you, as counsel for the prisoner, wish to call Macmanus to that fact, he shall be sent for? - I certainly wish to call him as my witness.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - I deal in butter; I have known Powell five years; on the 3d of May last I met the prisoner on Snow-hill, about four in the afternoon, he asked me how I did, I told him, I was pretty well; he asked me to have a pint of beer; we had two pints of beer, he paid for one, and I for the other, then I was for going, he asked me which way I was going, I said to London-bridge; he said, he was going to Gray's-Inn-lane but would go back with me; in Newgate-street he asked me where I should be on Friday, if in the city or not, I said, I did not know but I should; I was there every day, he made answer that he had a sum of money to receive on Friday next, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310044"/> banker's in Lombard-street, and he did not like to receive it himself, as he had a quarrel with the clerk, and if I would receive it myself, he would do as much for me; I told him I did not know any thing to the contrary, I would receive it to oblige him. The prisoner said, if you will, I will be much obliged to you, and where shall I see you on Friday, about eleven; I told him I would meet him at the Three Tuns in Upper Thames-street at eleven; I went there, and told the landlord that I expected Powell to meet me; he said he knew him very well; I desired a pint of beer, and I waited three quarters of an hours; I went away, he did not come; I went away, and called again about two; when I came, the prisoner was in the tap-room, sitting with his fellow-<rs id="t17860531-27-deflabel162" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I said, is this eleven o'clock! he begged my pardon, and said, if he had not waited out of the rain, he should have been at the time, but he had a good deal of way to come; then we both went out of the house; we came into Lombard-street, we went to the corner of George-yard; he went in there at No. 56, and enquired, and came out, and said it was a few doors lower down; we went to the corner of Birchin-lane; he said, this is the house; he then pulled his book out of his pocket, and gave me a draft for 450 l. 14 s. and I should have it half cash, and half bank; he took a bag out of his pocket to put the cash in; the draft I received from him was the same I paid in to Messrs. Bland and Co. I received two hundred and twenty pounds fourteen shillings in cash, and I received two hundred and thirty pounds in bank; and if the clerk should ask me who I came from, he told me to say a name which I have forgot, and if he asked me where they lived, he told me to say Whitechapel; then he told me he would wait there for me till I came out; I said, very well; I went into the banker's, and put down the draft on the counter; the clerk took it up, and looked at it, and he asked me how I liked to have it; I told him half cash, and half bank, if he pleased; then the bank was brought me in three different notes, and then I had the cash; I weighed some of the cash, and counted it over, and I picked out some that I thought were light, and they changed them for me; I spread the guineas, and weighed some of them, and then put them into this bag that he gave me, and tied it up, and came out; and when I came out, the prisoner was opposite, he came over to me, and asked me if I had got it; I told him, yes; he said, you have been a long while; I said, I have been weighing some of the guineas, and have had them changed; then we went to the Three Tons in Upper Thames-street, and desired a room to ourselves; the landlord's wife went up stairs, and the prisoner followed her, and I followed him into a room up stairs; the prisoner ordered sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and we sat down at the table, and I took out my pocket-book, and gave the prisoner the three bank notes; I pulled out the bag, and turned the cash on the table; the prisoner said, here is somebody coming, cover it over; I put the bag on the cash, and the prisoner took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and put it on likewise; the landlady brought the brandy and water, and went out; the prisoner counted the money, and found it right, he put it into the bag, and put it into his pocket; then he put his hand into his breeches-pocket, and took out a shilling, and laid it on the table; he said, Joe, there is a shilling, I am obliged to you; I said, Mr. Powell, I do not desire any such thing, I will not have it, and the shilling laid on the table a few minutes; I said, why do not you put the shilling in your pocket, and I gave it him, and he put it into his pocket.</p>

My Lord, they told me a great many times, that if I could raise the money any way among my friends, if I had a hundred to apply to, they were come off in such a manner, nobody knew of it; and when we were coming to town on Sunday night, they said, we can lay about twenty miles off, and we shall come to town on Monday morning, and I should go and raise the money; instead of that, we came to Bow-street on Sunday night, and they took me to the Justice's; I was misled by them; I was innocent of the forgery, with respect to the writing, as a child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have witnesses to his character, but I do not see it will be material; every body agrees that he bore an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the confession, they took it down on Sunday night, when I came to town; they gave me a quart bottle of gin, which I drank myself.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Messrs. Richardson and Stevenson, in Bishopsgate-street; they are brandy-merchants; I have seen the prisoner before; I cannot tell how long; he followed me with ten gallons of wine from my master's cellar to our shop; nothing particular passed at that time.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of May, tell us what happened? - I went to dinner about a quarter before two, when I came back, Mr. Richardson ordered me to take five gallons of brandy to Mr. Gurney's in <placeName id="t17860531-28-crimeloc167">Rose-alley Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Had you before he fired this pistol offered to strike him or hurt him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Had any body? - Not to my knowledge; I lived three years with the prosecutor; I had seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not you know he was an excise officer, or a custom house officer? - I had seen him about six months before, in my master's shop; I did not know at that time that he was an <rs id="t17860531-28-deflabel168" type="occupation">excise officer</rs>

               <p>What made you recollect him again? - Because I had seen the man several times in the street since that.</p>
               <p>And did not you know he was an excise officer before this time? - I could not know by any experience, because I never saw his deputation.</p>
               <p>Was the other man dressed in his regimentals? - I was told he was a soldier by several people; I cannot say their names.</p>
               <p>How many? - I cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you received this information before the accident of the pistol going off? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it ten minutes? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Might it be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour? - I cannot tell; I was told by a porter that he was a man that used to go with other people and take people's loads.</p>


               <p>Which man first told you that he came to see what you had about you? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did not that man long before the accident of the pistol, say he was an excise officer? - He did, he said he was an officer; I told him if he had a mind to seize the liquor on my head, he might; it was not my place to take it off; I did not like to give my master's property away.</p>
               <p>Why not submit it to inspection, that would not be giving it away? - I did not chuse to take it off my head for any man.</p>
               <p>You say Gurney never received any of this commodity without a permit? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to carry this without a permit? - The truth is, Mr. Gurney<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310048"/> has casks in the cellar and cocks in, and we take his liquor in the pots, and pour it into his casks.</p>
               <p>A very considerable time passed between you and the officer, he desiring to see this liquor, and you would not let him? - I told him if you have a mind to seize it upon my head, says I, I will not take down for you; I have no permit about me.</p>
               <p>Why would not you satisfy his curiosity? - I know very little of these things.</p>
               <p>Why had you any reluctance at all to shew the officer what you had about you? - I said, I would go back to my master with this liquor.</p>
               <p>When this brandy fell down between you, did not it go the greater part of it over the prisoner? - I cannot tell that it might go over him.</p>
               <p>Did you make no resistance to the officer? - I made so far as this, I took hold of the door, and he collared me, and tore my jacket, and then he gave me a push, and down went the can.</p>
               <p>Did not you attempt to get away? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you say to the prisoner? - Nothing at all, no farther than what I have said before; I had my head down looking at the brandy; when I first saw the pistol; I said, you have done a fine job, have not you? when I heard somebody cry out mind, I turned round and saw the pistol, I dropped down.</p>
               <p>Did the man say nothing to you? - I had no hand upon him to my knowledge, we were very near together.</p>
               <p>He could have hardly missed his mark? - He did miss it.</p>
               <p>But if he had any purpose of shooting you he might? - It was a mercy to me that he did miss it, it was no thanks to him.</p>
               <p>Did not he desire you to take care, for he was armed? - Not to my knowledge, I believe I had some of the brandy upon my shoes.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear pretty lustily upon that occasion? - I did, because some of it went over my shoes; I did swear pretty lustily.</p>
               <p>You did swear pretty lustily? - I do not understand English pretty well.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear pretty lustily when this brandy went over you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Just now you told me you did? - That I did swear!</p>
               <p>Did you bear yourself quiet and peaceable? - I will say again what I have said before, I take my oath here upon what I do say; I do not suppose there is a man that ever heard me swear for some years together.</p>
               <p>Did not you vent some terms of anger against the man? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did it become necessary for this man to stand upon his defence against you? - That I do not know, there were a good many people about us.</p>
               <p>Were the people there who had given you the first intimation about this soldier? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Do you know them? - I cannot say I do; I took it as I was told, that he was an officer.</p>
               <p>But were not these men that told you this, a part of the mob that surrounded you when this accident happened? - They were not.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Not according to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How many people were there? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was there any one there besides the soldier and officer? - I believe there was, I cannot tell how many; I did not come on purpose to number the people.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the house? - I cannot tell how many, there were people in the house.</p>
               <p>How many within a moderate guess? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>I want to know how many people were there? - It is a question that is impossible for me to answer, I cannot tell how many, I would not affront any body.</p>
               <p>Take care you do not affront that oath that you have taken, was there one, two, three, six or a dozen? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen M'Gowan before? - I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310049"/>Upon what occasion? - In company with Mr. Gibbs the excise officer, they made a seizure upon me before and used me pretty ill; but I think this is another matter.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think that is evidence, no violence committed at another time, can have any thing to do on this occasion; can it be evidence to state what this man had done before at another time and to another man?</p>
               <p>To witness. Had you struck this man before he fired the pistol? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Had any body else struck him, or offered any violence? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know Mr. Chapman, he is a surveyor of the excise? - Yes, I think I do.</p>
               <p>Did you ever talk to him about this accident? - Yes, I believe I did, and so far as I can remember, he told me to be as merciful as I could to the poor man; I said, Sir, I must speak the truth, as I spoke before at Guildhall when he was committed, as nigh as I can.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Chapman that you was convinced at the time that the pistol went off by accident? - I will take my oath a thousand times I did not.</p>
               <p>To any body else? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say to any body, that the pistol appeared to you to have gone off by accident? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you at the time, that it had gone off by accident? - It did not.</p>

               <p>I am surveyor of the excise; I have known the prisoner two or three years as an officer of the excise; he has conducted himself in that employ always as a good officer in the discharge of his duty; and particularly by a mild disposition to my knowledge, since I knew him, that character he deserves of me ever since I knew him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Parry who prosecutes in this business? - Yes, I have known Parry for some years; I have held a conversation with him on this subject, I think it was the 6th of May.</p>
               <p>What did he say of the transaction then? - He said so far as this, that he did not see any thing of the pistol till after it was fired; that was the whole purport of what passed between us.</p>
               <p>You have known Parry, you say, sometime? - Yes.</p>

               <p>- GIBBS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an excise officer.</p>
               <p>Do you know Parry who prosecutes this indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to know what sort of a man he is, when he meets with excise officers? - I have reason to know by the usage I have had from him in seizing some liquors, that was about six or seven weeks ago; I made the seizure at the right hand side of Middle-row, Holborn; he was carrying some liquor for his present master, he resisted me very violently. I have known the prisoner these three years.</p>
               <p>In his duty as an officer, how has he conducted himself? - I never saw him any otherwise; he and I have been together many a day; whenever I have been with him, he gave me the preference to do as I thought proper, he never went rashly; I never heard any other of him, than a humane good sort of a man.</p>
               <p>I believe it is very common for you to go armed? - More does, than go without.</p>
               <p>You know M'Gowan? - Yes, he has been employed by the commissioners in the business.</p>

               <p>I was in company with the prisoner when the prosecutor was carrying this brandy on his head, he was coming across the street, the officer followed him in, he got as far as the bar, and he looked under his left hand and saw the officer, and he asked him if he had a permit, he immediately answered, d - n your blood what is that to you? accordingly the officer said, he would be satisfied before he would go out of the place; accordingly the man said, did he know who he was; and the other told him he should know before he went out; the man that had the cann on his head, went towards the back door, that goes through; the officer immediately got with his back to the door, the man came towards the bar again; all this time he would not suffer the officer to look at it, and the officer stood over his head and reached out his rule, and tasted the brandy, and told him not to go out till he was satisfied; all this while he made opposition, and would not suffer the officer to examine; then when the prosecutor said, have it he should not, he would lose his life first; the officer stood at the door, and was trying to keep him from going out; when he could not, he kept hold of the cann with his right hand, and wanted to drag him from the door; in consequence of this the porter gave him a blow, and struck the officer and brought him with his knee to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that he struck the officer? - Yes, I do mean to swear it; the officer fell down upon his knee, he recovered again, and the man struck at him again; the man said, if I cannot get it out from you, I will throw it a-top of you, and he took it and poured it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310051"/> over the excise officer, and it ran down in this manner, and he says to me, what are you about, cannot you assist me in my duty; I went and took the cann off the man's head, and saved about one half of the liquor; then immediately he told him he had fire arms about him, and he caught hold of him, and said if he had not the liquor, he would use him as he pleased; the man made a blow at him, the prisoner stood by, and missed the blow, and the pistol went off at that time.</p>
               <p>Could not the prisoner if he had been determined to shoot at him, have shot him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Parry make use of abusive language to the prisoner? - He did, he d - ned his blood, and said he knew he was an impostor; he told him at first, if he had not a permit, he would seize it for the King; when he found he could do no more, he was determined to spill the liquor; when the liquor was all running over, it was not till then that he produced the pistol; and even then, Parry aimed a blow at him again; he said d - n you, if I cannot get it from you, I will throw it over you; he held it on his head, and fell a tapping it upon his head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then he did not throw the cann down? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he threw the liquor over his head and the cann? - He said, he would keep the liquor on his head, but he kept the cann on his head, the cann was taken off by me, he did not throw it down at all.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Merricke there? - Not till it was all over; I did not see a man there but the waiter, I have since found the man to be the waiter; I only saw one man in the passage, and he was a little way off; the man that was shot, was within two or three yards; upon my oath, I did not see any one to my knowledge, but one.</p>
               <p>Did not you see the man through whose coat the pistol went? - No, not till I went to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Then you mean to swear that he was the only man that was there? - I saw never a man but the waiter, the porter that carried the liquor, and the prisoner; if he had been there, I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Have you given the same account before the Alderman, that you have to day? - I thought it a folly to speak of this before the Alderman, when there were so many people to speak against him; I can give you a very sufficient reason for that.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Alderman, that the pistol was held within three inches of his body? - No, I could not tell him.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Alderman, that Parry would have been shot if he had not bobbed down, did not you say before the Alderman, that you stooped to avoid the ball as well as Parry? - I never stooped at all, nor I never said I stooped.</p>
               <p>Was the pistol within three or four inches of his body? - I told the Alderman, I did not know how near it was.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that Mr. Parry struck the officer? - Yes, Sir, I do, a second time he struck him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then do you mean to say that there was not a number of people in this publick house? - There is a partition goes between the entries, between the taproom, and the partition door; for that reason, I could not see what was in the taproom.</p>

               <p>I was at Gurney's house; I did not see Parry come in with the liquor; I saw him after he was in the passage; I heard some dispute happen when I was in the taproom, I heard some few words, and I came out to see what was the matter, and there was a man standing with a cann on his head, and there was an excise officer asking him what he had got there; there were some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310052"/> few words happened between them, but what they were I cannot say really; I went to the company again, and after I had been in a few minutes, I heard the porter say, I wish you a good day, or something to that purpose; I came in and saw the porter going towards the door to go out with the liquor on his head; the prisoner stood with his back against the door and insisted he should not go out with the liquor, and then the prisoner caught hold of him by the coat, in that struggle the cann fell down on the floor, off his head, I am clear in that.</p>
               <p>You are clear that in that struggle the cann fell off his head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is M'Gowan there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not let him go out of Court, I shall want to ask him some more questions presently.</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot recollect what was said, after the cann fell down, but the porter said something, and in an instant the pistol went off and the porter dropped somehow.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing before the pistol went off? - No, I cannot be certain with respect to that; the pistol went off, and I felt a shock just by my hip bone, I looked down and found the ball had passed through my coat.</p>
               <p>You saw the porter attempt to go out? - The person who received the ball and several others were in the passage.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did the porter strike the officer or not? - I am upon my oath, and I did not see him lift up his hand against him.</p>
               <p>Could he, without your seeing him? - I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did the prisoner draw back, and stand at some distance from him, and did Parry make a blow at him before the pistol went off? - No, Sir, the prisoner could not draw back, because his back was close to the door and therefore he could not draw back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. In the first place you was in the tap-room, and only heard what was going on in the passage? - I could not see the first beginning of it.</p>
               <p>At the time you first went into the passage, they were squabbling together? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>How many people were in the tap-room? - I did not count them.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people in the passage? - Yes; the person that received the ball stood close to me.</p>
               <p>Did he go into the passage before you came out of the tap-room? - I believe he was before me in the passage.</p>
               <p>How came it that you returned into the tap-room again? - I might want to drink some beer; I never was in a Court before; I cannot say any other reason, that might be the reason.</p>
               <p>Then you heard something again, being in the tap-room? - I heard the porter speak the words, to the best of my knowledge, it was good bye.</p>
               <p>Did not you know at that time that the prisoner wanted to examine the contents of the cann the man had on his head? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Was not M'Gowan at that time between you and Parry and the prisoner? - Yes, he was.</p>

               <p>Was not he close up to Parry in the very act of taking the thing off his head? - He was very nigh.</p>
               <p>How came it that you are able to speak so exact? - I have no interest in it, only real facts; I did see the porter attempt to pull the door open; I believe there were some words.</p>
               <p>Was not the prisoner then persisting in seeing what he had on his head? - I did not see the liquor run over him.</p>
               <p>Was he wet at all with the liquor? - I do not think the liquor fell upon him; I was frightened enough at the same time; this was after the ball I thought had wounded me.</p>
               <p>Did not you see that man wet with the liquor? - I saw him so in the tap-room, but I cannot say that the cann fell upon him; I cannot tell you how he came wet.</p>
               <p>Was not M'Gowan close up to Parry, attempting to take this thing off his head? - He was almost close to him; I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310053"/> say he attempted to take it off his head; it came down with the struggle; the prisoner caught him by the coat, as the man was attempting to pull the door open.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you rightly, when the porter was attempting to open the door, the prisoner prevented him, seized him by the collar, and in that period of time the cann fell to the ground, and that was before the pistol went off? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Whether the pistol was wet by the cann falling off, or any other way, you cannot say? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>You was at Mr. Gurney's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us what was the first you saw of this transaction? - I was coming out of the cellar, and the first I saw was this Parry come in with this cann on his head; I saw two men follow him in; I did not know his business, nor any thing of the kind; I heard the prisoner ask him what he had got; Parry said, it was a matter of no consequence to him; the prisoner said, I will soon know, pulling out his gauge; says he, you have spirits; says Parry, I cannot stay to hesitate the matter with you, I must go about my business; he went to go out of the passage; the prisoner followed him, and brought him back again, and told him to set the liquor down; he said he would not; he said they might take it off his head if they wanted it; they staid some little time, I cannot be exact to the time; then he made a second attempt to go out, and the prisoner went under his arm, with the can on his head; the prisoner had his backside against the door, and told him he should not go out; as far as I could see by where I was standing, the man that was with him tried to take the can off his head, and they spilled the liquor between them, but whose fault it was, I cannot tell; as soon as the liquor was spilled, Parry went down to the ground, and said, you have done a pretty job; the cann fell quite to the ground; before the words were out of Parry's mouth, the prisoner put his hand into his breeches pocket, and took out a pistol, and he fired in so short a time, that I could hardly turn my head round; I heard a man say, I am wounded; I made answer, and said, if you are wounded, I have the ball; it went in here, and was extracted from here. (Shews his side.)</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did Parry strike the exciseman at all? - He did not; he could not, without my seeing him; I am sure he did not, upon the oath I have taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How far were you from him? - As nigh as I can guess, about half a dozen yards; it is a narrow passage, and three people jumbled together in this passage seemed to me to occupy the whole breadth; the prisoner stood against the door; Parry stood towards the right-hand wall of our house, and the other man stood against the left-hand wall, and between me and the prisoner I saw M'Gowan close up to the man, attempting to take the thing off his head.</p>

               <p>Before the pistol went off, had he struck the officer at all? - No, he had not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. From the particular circumstances of the case it becomes us as counsel for the prisoner, to offer some idea by which this could have amounted to no higher a crime than manslaughter, if it could have amounted to that, in case death had ensued in consequence of this transaction: My Lord, I take it that the crime of murder is only then compleat; when there is a time for the mind to operate and discover its malignity, amounting to what the law calls malice prepense; the other definition that of manslaughter, is that which arises from sudden provocation, from a natural gust of passion, without any antecedent malignity of the mind; if therefore there be clearly before your Lordship on the evidence a situation where the man is only acting in the discharge of his office, not betraying any of that malignity, but provoked on the sudden, and on that sudden provocation he acts, and death follows his act, then it will amount to the crime of manslaughter; we therefore contend, that if death had ensued, the circumstances of this transaction would not have betrayed any of that deeper malignity, that the circumstance of firing, would have been that energy of the mind arising from a sudden gust of passion: your Lordship has very well said already, that the circumstance of having the pistol about him, does not raise any imputation at all upon him; being therefore proved to have had a reasonable cause for the commencement of this transaction, going on in the execution of his authority, and being resisted, and this liquor being proved to have come over him, a cause arises for that resistance; and that accident might very well provoke a sudden gust of passion; if death had ensued, that sudden gust of passion would have taken out the deeper guilt of murder; if there be an accident in the case, and the pistol had gone off by accident, he will not be guilty even of manslaughter; if the Jury are convinced that it went off by accident, then there will be an end of the charge altogether; but supposing it should happen that more credit is given to the witnesses for the prosecution than to M'Gowan; even in in that case the witnesses on the part of the prosecution cannot have established any other crime than that of manslaughter, supposing that there should ultimately be such contradiction; still there will enough arise out of that evidence to build substantial circumstances upon, that the man was acting in the execution of his duty, that he was resisted, that there was every degree of resistance made to him, namely as to the search, under this resistance, there is a cause for the mind to grow more and more enraged, than if there was no obstruction made to the execution of authority; and there is the other accident in, of this liquor being thrown over him; M'Gowan says, who is the only witness that could know any thing of that transaction, that it seemed to be done on purpose; then that accident would assist the idea, and I should think that the present instance could by no means have been carried further than manslaughter if death had ensued.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow spoke on the same side.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly and decidedly of opinion, that there is nothing in the objection, and I shall give my reasons in my address to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner is indicted for an offence that is made capital by an act of parliament, he is indicted, for maliciously and wilfully shooting at

            , that is the short charge in the indictment, and that is the description of of the offence from which the legislature of this country has thought it proper to take away the benefit of the clergy to any person that shall willfully and maliciously shoot at any person in a dwelling house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310056"/> or in any other place; the offence is wilfully and maliciously shooting, and it is necessary for me to state first to you, what appears to me to be clearly law on this act of parliament; the offence is described in very few and very clear words, and this clause in the act of parliament, is one instance, among many, how much preferable the short, clear, distinct definitions of offences which we meet with in some acts of parliament are, to the very perplex ones you meet with in others; I cannot explain it more clearly than in very few words of the act of parliament itself, it is maliciously shooting at a person; now it is upon the word maliciously, which is the very essence of the charge that I ground the opinion which I have declared, and from which, nothing as yet has induced me to depart; which is, that no shooting under this act of parliament; where death does not ensue, will be a capital offence within the act of parliament which would not have been murder if death had ensued; that I conceive is a principle that clearly follows from the word maliciously rightly understood; an accidental shooting is not within this act of parliament, because it is neither done willfully nor maliciously; a shooting in the heat of passion upon such ground of provocation as the law makes allowance for, is not within this act of parliament, because it is not a malicious shooting.</p>

               <p>Was you drunk or sober at that time? - I was not drunk.</p>

               <p>Are you a married man or a single man? - A single man; I had got about forty yards from the place, and the two prisoners came one on each side; it was a bright night; I had seen the prisoner Green before; they asked me if I would go and drink any more any where, I said, I was going home to bed, I would not go any where; in a minute's time I thought I felt my coat slip on one side, and I was looking first on one side, and then on the other, and I found my purse was gone; they ran away, and then I suspected them; I took out my purse at the Red-lion to pay, it was seen there.</p>
               <p>What was in your purse? - Twenty-eight pounds, as near as I can guess, there were some half guineas, and twenty-two guineas, and thirty shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>There was no violence used to you? - No, nobody else was near me; it was done in a minute; the prisoners were off before I perceived I had lost my purse; but I felt my pocket lightened of it.</p>

               <p>You immediately made a hue and cry about this? - Yes.</p>

My reason for attending here was, I understood that from a particular likeness to some individual, a man of a very notorious character, he might be mistaken; and I meant to identify his person, and say his name is Brown; he has gone by the name of Brown ever since I have known him, and I knew him at that period I have mentioned; I knew so much of him, as to exclude the possibility of his being a notorious bad character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Shemmell. The words were that I was not to be taken from my family.</p>

I never said any such words, Umpage and Nunn were present and heard me; Shemmell said, if I would go with him to his house, he would shew me, and he took me to his house in Gresse-street, and there I saw the things in the indictment; I knew the planks. (Deposed to.) He confessed taking one of the planks, and that the others were mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner Shemmell's counsel.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner, that if he made a confession, the clearer it was, the more lenity he should have? - I said the more free he was in making his discovery, the more lenity he should expect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat, prisoner Grist's counsel. How do you know that mahogany from a great quantity that is in this town? - Because that board has been through my hands several times; it was cut in my shop; I had the whole tree.</p>

Bamber said yes; then I met Andrews with two pieces of beech on his shoulder; I went directly to the prosecutor, and told his servant, and the servant called him up, and I went and shewed him the house where the boards were put, and we went away; I saw the prosecutor the next morning, and we went to this house and searched it; I went the next morning after Bamber was taken, Shemmell was in the yard of the house.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say to Shemmel? - He asked him if he had not got some mahogany; he told Mr. Campbell where it was; Campbell said to him, he should be glad if he could find the wood, and Shemmell said, if he would go along with him, he would shew him the wood; Campbell said to him, he had better be free and open, and he should have all the mercy the law would allow him; we did not find these planks in the house where they went the morning before, but we went with Shemmell to his house, the prosecutor and me, and

It is to be observed, that the foreman Andrews had the whole and sole care of the job, buying the stuff, cutting and converting it as he thought proper; and likewise paid me on a Saturday night; and upon my refusal of his orders, I must have lost the job.

I had all the opportunity in the world of making my escape, but my innocence was my protection; Andrews as I am informed was three months there, I only a fortnight. Having been carried to Bow-street office, I saw a man brought in by the name of Shemmell, on suspicion of receiving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310068"/> mahogany that was stolen from Mr. Campbell, and on his confession before the magistrate in Bow-street, he positively declared that I was innocent, and that I never had any dealings with him whatsoever, he being an utter stranger to me, and I have no doubt but he says so now; the whole of this being strictly true, by the help of God, and the clemency of the worthy Jury, I may hope to be acquitted; I was never before a Magistrate before this time during the whole course of my life, which is fifty-six years; and having a numerous offspring unprovided for.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday week, in the evening, a little after five, I saw two men walking on Hampstead Heath, and I saw one throw a bundle into a gravel-hole, but what it was, I do not know; it was the two prisoners, they were together.</p>
               <p>Were they walking or running? - I saw the prisoner Simpson get into a hole, and the other prisoner stood by the hole till he came out; in about half a minute after Simpson came out of the hole, I saw them walk up the hill both together a quarter of a mile; they were taken in a minute; I went up to them after they were taken; I saw the coachman coming on horseback over the heath, as hard as he could ride; he met me; I said, have you lost a coat? he said, yes; I then said, I know where it is; I shewed him the hole that Simpson came out of, and there was the coat almost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310069"/> covered over with gravel; this is the coat; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was the distance of four or five hundred yards? - Yes; I was digging of gravel; I was looking round me, resting myself; I stood over a pit; I was some yards nearer than the coachman was when he set out first.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 22d of May last, my master lost an inlaid mahogany case, with a dozen table knives and forks, and six desert knives and forks, they were green ivory handles, mounted with silver, the large forks had three prongs; they were in a front parlour, they were lost on Monday se'night.</p>
               <p>- MARTHWAITE sworn.</p>
               <p>About five in the evening, on Monday the 22d of last month, the prisoner brought this case to me, and wanted to pledge it with me for nineteen shillings, he said, he brought it from Mrs. Long, Tottenhem-court-road, No. 35, a lady that he drove; I gave my young man the money to go to Mrs. Long, and see that it was right; he objected to that, and wanted the knives again, I would not let him have them, then he wanted to get away; I sent for a constable, and secured him, I attended him to the Justice, there he gave pretty near the same account, and he wanted to send for her; I went myself to No. 35, and could find no such person, he was committed for further examination.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Brooks. Look at that case? - It is the same, I know it by the grain of the wood going this other way, and the shopmark is there, it was bought in Russell-street, Covent-Garden.</p>

               <p>Jury. What did they give you to let them pass? - They offered nothing; they promised the things were their own many times.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a watchman? - A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>At this time in the morning do you usually take those answers to be satisfactory? - There was nobody else moving or stirring; I could not have taken them if I would; I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, did they give you any money? - No, Sir, they did not, if they had offered me any money I would have stopped them.</p>

               <p>I was going up Dean-street, and there is a little court that goes from Wardour-court to Dean-street, called Milk-alley, and I saw the three prisoners coming up the alley, and I observed the prisoner Hurley opening his breeches, and looking into them as he came up the court; there was nobody with me, and I hid myself under some harness till I jumped out upon them all three; I searched the other two first, and searching Hurley, I found this pocket book in his breeches, and he had that blue apron that is on the other lad over it; when I brought him to the office, it wanted a quarter of one; he said, he found it at the Prince of Wales's scaffolding; I found a letter in it directed to Sir Edward, and I went there; the other prisoners said nothing.</p>

               <p>Court to Sir Edward. Had you been in Pall-Mall that morning? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Is that your pocket book? - Yes, I am certain of it; I had it in my right hand pocket; I paid some attention to that side and walked with my stick by my pocket for fear of losing it.</p>

(Produces a dirty bedgown.) She desired to go into the same room where the man prisoner went, to put on some things, and in that room were some halfpence, which corresponded with the die; I did not see them fitted; a young woman, a visitor, was discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoners counsel. What was her name? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know her name was Jackson? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that the man was there for fear of being arested? - I never heard that.</p>
               <p>Do not you think the woman is his wife? - I have reason to think otherwise; this is a dark cellar; there were no candles burning, but there were two that were warm, as if lately burnt out, but we could not observe the snuffs; they were by the side of the press.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this woman goes by the name of the man? - That is the name she gave in at the office.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to believe she is not his wife? - By what I have been told.</p>

               <p>I went with the other officers, on the 12th of May last, to No. 9, Britannia-row; Armstrong went into the garden first, I surveyed the premises; when we first went into the house, I found in the cellar a press complete for coining, and an halfpenny between the dies that I have here; there was a quantity of halfpence about, some stamped, and some blanks; in the kitchen were boiling a large quantity of halfpence in a net; it was a complete press for stamping, there were candles fixed, the snuffs were out, they were out, but the closeness of the place might make them warm; after they were in custody by the other officers, I went up to the one pair of stairs, the left hand side where Mr. Bridgen was putting on his clothes, there I found a sack with some saw dust in it, and in it a piece of halfpence, that is thirty shillings worth, made up, which corresponds with the die; and in a basket in the same room were some loose, not made up into a piece, corresponding with the dies; I found a very dirty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310087"/> shirt in the room where the prisoner was found; I did not see the woman till they were both in custody.</p>

               <p>Are any of these tower halfpence? - They are not; they are boiled with brimstone to make them black; here appears to be a flaw, that appears to be struck with this die; with respect to this halfpenny found between the die, it has received a blow, but not the impression, it seems as if these halfpence were not struck by this die with the flaw.</p>

               <p>Mrs. BEACH sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 9, Britannia-gardens; I know the two prisoners, they were my lodgers; they had one side of the house, and this cellar was on that side; I never was in the cellar; the prisoners had the parlour, bed room, and a garret; they passed for man and wife; I never knew any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is become of Johnson? - I do not know him, I never saw him but once, after he took the lodging.</p>
               <p>Then it was Johnson that took the lodging? - It was; he said he took it for his sister and her husband; he said, he should be there himself likewise.</p>
               <p>I believe this poor man was afraid of being arrested? - That was what Mr. Johnson told me, that he came there because it was retired.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know the woman prisoner go by the name of Jackson? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion that the woman is entitled under this evidence to the benefit of a married woman.</p>

               <p>I had a writ out against me, and Johnson said, I might go to Hoxton; these gentlemen pulled me down stairs, and dragged me into this room; I did not go there; and they took two shillings and threepence out of my pocket, and all good halfpence; on my first examination they never produced these three or four bad halfpence.</p>

               <p>I am engine keeper of St. Andrew Holborn, and live in Union-court; about half after six, on the 4th of December last, which was on Sunday evening, I had information, and I went to Watkins's; I knocked at the door and went backwards, I heard a hustling, and I looked into the shop, and in the back part of the shop, there is a kind of a little parlour, there I saw the prisoner sitting on the side of Mrs. Watkins, and there was another man; then I saw the prisoner lay hold of these clothes in his hands, and he held them up to Mrs. Watkins, says she, that will do very well, put that down; then he handed up a shirt, she said, that will do very well, put that down.</p>
               <p>Could they see you at the time? - I do not know that they did, I was in the dark, in the shop, and the room was light where they were; Watkins was gone, I do not know where; then I ran into the room; and I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar; says I, and you will do very well; when I got hold of him the other rushed out, he slipped out of my hand; I then underneath the table found these things, I tied them up and gave them to Roberts.</p>


               <p>Mr. Garrow. Well Master Scott, are we to have war or peace with France? - That is neither here nor there.</p>
               <p>They sent you to the compter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watkins opened the door for you? - Yes, in a moment.</p>
               <p>How is this shop parted from the parlour? - Close together, only the window.</p>
               <p>You went there to search for some scarlet cloth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So Mrs. Watkins and the prisoner went on deliberately? - Quite quietly.</p>
               <p>The scarlet cloth was in the house at the time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How many minutes might you be in the shop looking in the parlour? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>How did the prisoner escape? - How do I know, out at the front door, Mr. Graham was behind me, and he knocked Mr. Wilkins aside, who was at the door, and they both got away.</p>
               <p>Why is not Mr. Wilkins here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was he here on the trial of Watkins? - I cannot tell you, I am short of memory at this present time.</p>
               <p>Now I will brush up your memory, do you believe he was not here and examined? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Have the goodness to tell those gentlemen, who are to decide on this man's case, and your oath, why this Wilkins was not here to day? - I do not know, I was subpoened.</p>


               <p>Mr. Hardcastle. I subpoened him because I thought he would not come.</p>
               <p>Scott. I was offered ten pounds to screen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310092"/> up the matter, and not to bring the thing into question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Scott. Do not you know Mr. Wilkins is not here, because he would say that the prisoner at the bar was not the man? - How do I know that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you not heard Wilkins say so? - He was in the street, and it was dark.</p>
               <p>Was you sworn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never heard Watkins say that the prisoner was not the man that was in Watkins's house? - I know nothing at all about it; I cannot say, indeed.</p>
               <p>But you shall say, one way or the other? - I never heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Where did this man live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he lived with his father in Fleet-lane? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe it? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Where did his father live? - I heard, after he was taken up, that he lived in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>Then, do not you know now, that this man lived with his father, next door to Watkins? - I do not know that this man's father lived next door to Watkins, ever since this affair; I do not know it, nor do I believe it, upon my soul; I tell you the truth; it may be so.</p>

               <p>On Sunday night, the 4th of December, I went to Mr. Roberts, and gave information of these things carrying in, of this red cloth to Mr. Watkins's; I did not see the prisoner go in with any thing, as I know of; I told Mr. Scott to come along with me; Scott knock ed at the door, Watkins came to the door himself; I asked, what goods went in there; Watkins said, there was no goods; immediately, Mr. Scott came in; I followed him, and went backwards; there is a little room; the prisoner was sorting out some wearing apparel with Mrs. Watkins; I am sure I saw the prisoner there; there was a candle in the back room; Scott said, this will do; and immediately the prisoner brushed out, and gave Scott a swing round; he turned round, and I saw his face; he run out; Mr. Wilkins ran out, but could not catch him; the things were upon the table when Scott came in, and saw them chucked down.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many minutes did you wait at the door? - About a minute; three or four knocks, and the door was opened; Scott knocked pretty softly, the door was opened, there were two or three bolts undone; I heard Mrs. Watkins saying, that will do; I heard no further, I heard it but once, that was before the things were put under the table; I was close to Scott.</p>
               <p>If she had said any thing else, you would have heard it? - May be not so soon.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say, that will do very well, I will give you three guineas and an half for it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know that young man? - Yes, very well; after we were out, I said that is Barney; in the evening, I said so to Roberts and Mr. Wilkins, and Mr. Scott and Mr. Singleton.</p>
               <p>Was you a witness on the trial of Mrs. Watkins? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did Barney's father live? - I believe, in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>When did you see Mr. Wilkins? - I saw him to day in St. Paul's church-yard; I told him I was coming here, about Barney; he said he was not subpoened, and the children kept him away.</p>

               <p>Had you any talk with Scott about the people that were below stairs? - The first thing that Scott said to me, was, Manby, I charge you to aid and assist, and mind these things.</p>
               <p>What things were those? - They were a coat and waistcoat, and such things as these; accordingly, I did so; then Scott says to me, says he, Manby, do you know any of those parties that were in the house? no, says I; says he, can you describe either of the parties, or tell either of their names?</p>
               <p>What parties was he speaking of at this time? - He did not speak of any parties particularly; it was those people that he found with Mrs. Wilkins; I told him it was out of my power to do any thing of the kind, for I was up two pair of stairs; says he, if you can describe either of the parties, or tell ever a name, by G - d I will give you ten guineas.</p>
               <p>That was Mr. Scott? - Yes; he knows me very well, and has done for many years.</p>

               <p>How near did Barney live to them? - The next door.</p>
               <p>Did Scott know Barney at that time, think you? - Yes, as well as he knows me; I have seen Scott go by him a hundred times; he has soled and heeled shoes for me since.</p>

               <p>You do nothing with respect to this linen, but merely to porter it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you compare the linen with the bill? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310094"/>What livery was the man in? - I saw no livery.</p>
               <p>How was he drest? - I have only this to say, that he is near the matter of the dress that I saw him in at Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>What coloured coat had he on? now, I will tell you what you said there; you said,</p>

               <p>"he had on a livery coat, a handsome</p>
               <p>"light waistcoat, nankeen or buckskin</p>
               <p>"breeches, and a tail wig." - Excuse me, that never was my report; I never did say that word, that he was in a livery, or a white waistcoat, but I said nankeen or buckskin breeches, and a tail wig.</p>
               <p>What waistcoat did you say he had? do not look at the prisoner. (To the prisoner.) Button up your coat. - I said, he had a striped waistcoat, I never said, he had a white waistcoat, to my knowledge, I said, he had a Monmouth-street great coat on, of a crimson colour.</p>
               <p>What coloured cape had it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you never have said? - I never did.</p>
               <p>What were the breeches, buckskin or nankeen? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How soon after you had been sent for this coach did you see the prisoner? - It was the same day, at half past two I lost the property, and I saw Johnson about five.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He was dressed in a different dress; he was in a very genteel brown coat, and a very genteel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Had he buckskin breeches on? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>How long was you with the man at his master's door? - I never stopped a minute.</p>
               <p>Is there any one feature in that man's face, that you dare swear to? - I swear to his whole face.</p>
               <p>Is there any one feature in his whole face that you know him by? - I know only this, that that gentleman, Mr. Johnson, is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Yes, yes, but thank God, Mr. Hall, that is not the evidence by which Juries decide? - He was a thin faced man.</p>
               <p>That will not do neither; why you might swear to me by that description? - He is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>What is there in his countenance remarkable, I ask you, brown or fair? - Every man's complection alters according to the season of the year.</p>
               <p>Thank you, good Master Hall.</p>
               <p>Court. What things did you see put into this bundle? - I saw shirts, sheets, a breakfast cloth, a table cloth, and ten napkins.</p>
               <p>Did you count them? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how can you know? - Because they are all here; I saw no other things.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any conversation between Jones and Johnson? - No.</p>
               <p>Or with Lee? - No, we took the things to the publick house, and looked over them; I saw them examined; I saw some shirts, and some shifts, and some sheets not finished,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310095"/> and some towels, and some dusters; Hall fixed on Johnson directly.</p>

               <p>Were those the words he made use of? - Yes, they were; upon my refusing to accompany him he knocked me down, and took my hat off my head, then I gave the alarm of stop thief, I pursued him very near to the highway, and in turning the corner of Elbow-lane, he returned and knocked me down a second time, and in the second scuffle he dropped the hat; I picked it up; I repeatedly cried out stop thief, and murder, and the watchmen assisted me, he then ran into a house in Elbow-lane; they would not let us in, but Mr. Orange the officer came up, and they let him in; he went into the back yard, and perceived a man's head in the necessary over the next house, he desired to come to him, and he took the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober? - I was.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking that night? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Where had you been at that late hour of the morning? - I was returning home.</p>
               <p>Where had you spent your evening? - In a private house near to this place.</p>
               <p>Had not you been drinking in that house? - No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Had you supped there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did this man take your hat off, or did it fall off in the scuffle? - I will take upon me to say, that he took it, it did not fall off.</p>

               <p>Did he demand any money of you? - I cannot say he did.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt any thing but your hat? - No, Sir, he snatched my hat immediately, and he knocked me down; I hallooed out immediately, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you any watch at this time? - No, Sir, I left it at home.</p>
               <p>Do you usually leave it at home? - Very often.</p>
               <p>When you visit in that neighbourhood? - No, Sir, not particularly on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you had not supped, nor drank that evening? - Perhaps I had my supper.</p>
               <p>Had you supped at this adjacent house? - I had supped there.</p>
               <p>Had you drank nothing at your supper? - I drank some table beer only.</p>
               <p>No other liquors, nor spirits? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you been supping alone, or in company? - I supped alone.</p>
               <p>What time did you sup? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>I do this to try the probability and consistency of your story; now attend, at what time did you sup? - It might be between the hours of eleven and twelve, I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Had you been long in that neighbourhood?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310096"/> - I was returning from the city to that part of the neighbourhood; my house is in the parish of St. George's; I came out of the city between nine and ten; I took a walk after supper.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came up to you was not you talking to a girl at a window? - I was talking to nobody when he came up, there was a girl putting her head out at a window as I passed by.</p>
               <p>Was you talking to her? - I might speak to her.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay talking to her? - I did not stay talking to her any time, that I can minute.</p>
               <p>Now perhaps it was an hour? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was more than ten minutes? - It was not so much, it might be five or six.</p>
               <p>It was in Elbow-lane that you stopped to talk to this young lady, this woman, this nymph, this goddess? - I do not know, I did not see her.</p>
               <p>How many pair of stairs high was she? - I do not know, I was not in the dwelling.</p>
               <p>And you mean gravely to give that answer? - I do.</p>
               <p>You recollect, you are upon your oath? - I do.</p>
               <p>How far had you got from this lady's house before the prisoner came up to you? - About six yards.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not he tell you he was ashamed that a man of your appearance should be talking to such a bunter, was not that the case, Master Jones? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Then what was it? - I told you what it was.</p>
               <p>Then tell it again? - There is no occasion for a repetition.</p>
               <p>Yes, you must repeat it? - He put both his hands to my wrist, and desired me to go to that young woman.</p>
               <p>What that you was talking to? what did you say to him? I will tell you what it was; you said you had no conversation with any such creatures, was not that what you said? - I desired the young man to desist from me, and I had nothing more to say to him.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you, that you was a cox-comical puppy? - He said nothing; but he immediately knocked me down, and took off my hat.</p>
               <p>Was you stunned by the blow? - I was insensible at that time, whether he applied both his hands, or one.</p>
               <p>Who are you, let us just know that? - I am Mr. Jones's son.</p>
               <p>He must be a very lucky man, to have such a son! who may this fortunate man be? - He lives in Ratcliffe-highway; he is a chymist, I am in his business, and live at home.</p>
               <p>Did you go home that night? - Yes, soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>How long after? - Perhaps, it might be between six and seven; I came with Mr. Orange to the office after the robbery, and then I went home; there was a house-breaking committed, and I went with Mr. Orange to see that.</p>
               <p>Court. What house was this that you supped at? - At a person's house in Ratcliffe-highway.</p>
               <p>On a visit? - No.</p>
               <p>What then? - I called there in my way home.</p>
               <p>How came you to sup alone? - Because the person of the house had supped before; I was not alone.</p>
               <p>Who was you in company with? - The gentleman's name is Nightingale; I supped at his house.</p>
               <p>Elbow-lane was not in your way home afterwards? - Yes, Sir, it was.</p>
               <p>How far is Mr. Nightingale's from your father's? - I cannot say the distance.</p>
               <p>About how far may it be? - I cannot clearly say.</p>
               <p>Is it a mile, or an hundred yards? - It might be about an hundred yards from my father's.</p>
               <p>And how far from Elbow-lane? - About twenty yards.</p>

               <p>Does not he keep a bawdy-house? - The person I supped with does not.</p>
               <p>What business is he? - He is not in the profession that you speak of.</p>
               <p>Is that, Sir, an answer to my question? - The person I supped with is a publican.</p>
               <p>What is his sign? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you tell me, just now, that it was a private house you supped at? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>What did the prosecutor charge him with? - Stealing his hat; but he had got his hat when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was he sober? - He seemed so; it was not above a quarter before three; there is Nightingale, a shoemaker, but I do not know Nightingale the publican; and I am pretty confident there is no such person; the prosecutor told me he was standing talking to a woman out of the window, and as he was talking to the woman out of the window, a man came and took him by the wrist, and knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Do you know this Donkin? - He did live in the parish, he kept a bawdy house, but he was disturbed; he was called Donky die; the prosecutor went with me to the watch-house, and then to the White Swan in New Gravel-lane, and then he went with me to Spring-street; when I came to the White Swan, about six in the morning, I found him there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I do desire it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rushforth. These four buckles I produce, had the hall stamps; they are not put on at the hall in the shape they are; they have the marks of the Goldsmith's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310098"/> Company upon them, but not the stamps, as put on at the hall; the two marks on the shoe-buckle; are close together, when we strike them, one on one side, and one on the other; it has been done so for six or eight months; with respect to the knee-buckles, they are put close together; these shoe-buckles appear to me to be marked as knee-buckles; the stamps are both on the same side, and the marks are bottom upwards; I really do think that these buckles were not marked at the assay-office; these buckles are silver.</p>
               <p>Court. Before these last eight months, were the marks on shoe-buckles in a different form? - When the duty first took place, we marked them pretty near together.</p>
               <p>Then, for ought you know, these might be marked then? - I do not apprehend they could; if they had been marked in a finished state, there would have been a sink round the stamp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. One is the King's mark, the other is the assay mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a lion passant? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How came you to recollect so particularly how the prisoner was dressed that day? - Because it is a dress he so usually wears; I never saw him but in three coats since I was there; I never saw him in any other dress all that week.</p>
               <p>How was your mistress's father dressed? - I believe it was a dark brown, or old black coat, and cloth waistcoat and breeches; I do not recollect the colour.</p>

               <p>I conduct a party of the patrol belonging to Bow-street; on Wednesday just as the King passed from the abbey to Bridge-street, I saw the prisoner; I was on this side Bridge-street, I saw a hustle of people at the corner opposite; I had been to Bridge-street, and had seen the prisoner there before; I saw him hustling the gentleman on one side, and three or four men on the other; I am positive the prisoner was one; I knew him before; the prisoner's hands were down towards the prosecutor's thighs; this was in the middle of the hustle; I crossed the way, and before they had left off hustling; when I came the prisoner knows me, and desisted hustling immediately; I asked the prosecutor if he had been robbed; the prisoner was then standing within a yard of him; the prosecutor then said, he had been robbed of a guinea and a half and some silver; the prisoner was inclining on the left side of the prosecutor, one of his hands was down on his right thigh, or near it, one hand was down to one side, and one to the other; he was partly facing of him, but inclining to the left side; the prosecutor coming out of New Palace-yard, and the prisoner pushing against him, as if he wanted to go into New Palace-yard; on the prosecutor charging him, I took the prisoner into custody, he wanted to settle it with the prosecutor very much in going up to the office; the prisoner frequently entreated me to go into some tavern, he offered the prosecutor his money, and me a guinea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you heard the money drop before you asked the prosecutor whether he had been robbed? - I cannot be particular, I rather think I had.</p>
               <p>Had the prosecutor hold of the man at the time you came up? - I really cannot say; when I came up they were close together, he might have hold of him then, but when I asked him if he had been robbed, he had not hold of him then; I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Who gave instructions for the bill of indictment? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who did? - Mr. Johnson put it himself, he was told how the affair happened.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the describing this makes all the difference of forty pounds? - No doubt but the law allows it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know if he was only convicted of common larceny, that the contrary would be the case? - A man must be a fool that does not know that.</p>

               <p>Was Mr. Conner one of the pawnbrokers that you went to when you lost your things, did the prisoner go with you to that shop? - We did not go to that shop, it did not fall in my way; we went from ten o'clock till night.</p>

               <p>At the distance of a month used your clothes to be kept in the same box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Might not it happen very well that a person having got that duplicate intending to restore it to you, might put it into these breeches, supposing them to be yours? - I do not know that.</p>

               <p>What time did he go from his work? - Twelve o'clock; I had no further conversation with him then; in the course of the next week, the prisoner had wrote to his brother-in-law, informing him he had lost his clothes; he had lost his clothes as well as the prosecutor; his brother came to town; I had a trifle to make up, and I asked a man to lend me half a guinea; he said it was not convenient; the prisoner put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out some money; there was gold and silver, I cannot tell how much, and pitched half a guinea into my lap as I was at work.</p>

               <p>Are you in service now? - No, I was down in the country seeing my friends, and when I came up, I took a room with intent of being married to the prisoner; Chambers told me, he came to inform me out of friendship what the prisoner was taken for; that he had taken up the prisoner; he asked me if I was married to him, but I did not answer him, he said, he pittied me; then he told me he always respected me, and was glad for my sake that I was not married to him, he certainly would prosecute the prisoner as far as he could, and for my sake he would not wish to see him hung, but would prosecute him as far as he could, and transport him, if in his power; he said, if I was not married, he was glad, if so he should be sorry; one of the witnesses here, gave him a letter to bring to me; the prisoner had given another person a letter, and the prisoner had desired Dexter to come and tell me, Chambers chose to come with him, and Dexter had not leave to speak.</p>

               <p>What has been his general character as to honesty? - I never heard any thing amiss of his character; on the 28th of April last, from six in the morning or a few minutes after, I saw Mr. Bingham till twelve; he returned to work at one, and continued there till eight; I went out with him from Mr. Fell's at half past eight, and we went across the way to a publick house, then he went on his master's business, and carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310112"/> some clothes to the Rev. Mr. Smith's, by Portland-chapel, and to another place in Oxford-road, and we both returned to the publick house, and supped together, he stopped with me till half past ten, and then went home.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Was it a pattern you kept for sale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You now are a bankrupt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long is it since the commission issued? - The 2d of last month I think.</p>
               <p>Your time for passing your last examination is not expired? - I surrendered the first day of meeting; I have not undergone any examination.</p>
               <p>Was it a friendly commission? - No, I do not suppose it is, at least I hope it will be friendly to me; I have been very much ill used by the world, in consequence of a partnership I had; my partner having left me, my attorney told me that nothing but a commission of bankruptcy would clear me; and ever since that I have been endeavouring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310113"/> to bring this partner forward; it has cost me a great deal of money in law; I suppose I broke for about a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>You kept an auctioneer's and upholsterer's shop in Holborn? - I did.</p>
               <p>May be the bankruptcy came upon you by surprise? - I was out of the way; I was confined.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to be at home on Sunday the 23d of April? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect about that time giving the prisoner any orders to draw any cyder for any body? - No; I will tell you the whole of that.</p>
               <p>Did you on that Sunday 23d of April cause the prisoner to draw any large quantity of cyder? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him to carry a quantity of cyder to Mr. Wordsworth? - I told him to bring it to me; the cyder was very flat; it was seventy-two gallons; it was sent to Mrs. Ayres.</p>
               <p>Did you give this man directions to take sixteen gallons to Mr. Wordsworth on Sunday morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Ayres desire him in your presence? - I do not recollect; but I drink it now every day; there were no orders.</p>
               <p>Did he bring you any champaign? - Not that I know of; the prisoner continued in my service till my bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>From the time of the prisoner's marriage, you began to suspect him? - Upon my word, and my oath, the reason why I did not take him up, was because of my respect to him.</p>
               <p>For what purpose, and under what pretence, did you order the carpets to be sent to Mrs. Wordsworth's? - To cover a debt of Mrs. Parr's, my mother-in-law; she is a poor woman.</p>
               <p>When were these removed? - Much about that time; the order was not given at the time that the order for the cyder was given.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after? - I do not know, I cannot say, I will not say; I can say it was not at the time.</p>
               <p>What might be the amount of Mrs. Parr's debt? - Twenty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>What became of the carpets after they were taken to Mr. Wordsworth's? - Mrs. Parr had them; they were under twenty pounds; there was some carpets and ticking; I understood afterwards that it was not right, and they were returned.</p>
               <p>What was it you understood, that it was wrong to pay your mother in this way? - It was before the first meeting, I mentioned it to the assignees, and they were very sorry it should appear that I had endeavoured to cover one more than another, as I had a partiality for her.</p>
               <p>Who told you this was a wrong thing? - I cannot tell; I did not think it of any consequence to keep in my head; I cannot tell who told me so.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any body else in this way? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not to any body? - I beg your pardon; my Lord, I think this interferes with my last examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I have been very attentively watching his questions, with a view to stop him the moment any thing tended to criminate you; the removal of your effects before bankruptcy, and giving a preference to creditors, though an improper one, is not such as will hurt you, provided you make a full disclosure on your future examination.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I stand here without accounts; Mr. Garrow comes to question me about circumstances; I can go no farther than my recollection; but upon my word and honour, every thing that comes to my recollection, I will bring forward.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Ayres, if you are unintentionally incorrect, from not having your accounts and papers with you, that cannot be imputed to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You cannot fail to recollect to whom you have delivered goods; now, tell me to what other creditors you have delivered goods about that time? - None, as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear, upon your recollection, that you have not delivered any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310114"/> goods whatever to any person? - I will swear that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively that you have not done it? - I will swear that; but goods sent to my warehouse on commission, I have a right to sent back.</p>
               <p>That has been since the commission? - I think it was; an attorney, I forget his name now, in Bartlett's Buildings, sent me some pictures, upon commission; these pictures I was to sell for him on commission, and those not sold, returned; I believe I returned them somewhere about that time, which I am sure I had a right to do; it was before I surrendered myself to the commission; it was while I was at the officer's house, that I gave the orders about the cyder; it was before the docket was struck; the prisoner continued in my service till the commission issued.</p>
               <p>What wages were due to him? - Twenty-eight shillings; he claimed four pounds.</p>
               <p>Where did he apply to you for it? - In Ivy-lane, at Mr. Wordsworth's.</p>
               <p>Did his wife apply to you too? - Yes; it was before the search-warrant; his wife came and behaved impertinently to Mrs. Ayres, and I came and gently put her out of the room.</p>
               <p>What sort of impertinence was it? - She said enough to hurt the feelings of any woman in that situation; and told Mrs. Ayres that now she was but a little better than herself; I could not bear it; I did not mind it to me.</p>
               <p>Was this before the sale of your goods? - Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>And before the search-warrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And three months after your suspicions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner had the impudence to come himself after his wages? - He did, and he was not a little saucy; he said he must have his wages.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not the prisoner threaten at that time that he would disclose your concealments? - No, I do not recollect he did; he did not, I swear positively; when I spoke to him, and told him he must go to the commissioners, he said no more, but went out of the door.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, before the search warrant was obtained, did not the prisoner threaten you that he would disclose your removal of the property in the way you have stated? - He never said any thing of the kind to me upon any occasion.</p>
               <p>Did he to Mrs. Ayres? - I do not recollect; I heard something of it.</p>
               <p>Did not your wife tell you of it? - Upon my oath, I do not recollect it; I have heard it, that is sufficient.</p>
               <p>No, it is not sufficient; upon your oath, did not your wife tell you of it? - I do not recollect she did; I will not swear she did not; there was a deal of conversation.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - I do not believe any thing about it.</p>
               <p>But I will make you say something about your belief? - It is very probable she might.</p>
               <p>Did not she, upon your oath? - I will not say, upon my oath, because I cannot.</p>
               <p>You shall say whether you believe she did? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>What do you believe she said to you about it? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Where do you believe it was that she told you? - I do not recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Ayres tell you that a man threatened to charge you with concealing your effects? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>How long before the search warrant was applied for? - Upon my word, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it a week, or two or three days? - Oh, it was more than that, it was a fortnight; the prisoner came to me some time before the bankruptcy, not a fortnight; he said he wanted his wages; I told him he should be paid; he immediately said to me, very well, I am satisfied, and went away; then he came down a day or two after the bankruptcy, and said he wanted his wages; I told him it was entirely out of my power; then his wife came down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310115"/> and behaved so ill to Mrs. Ayres, I could not bear it.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time that the wife had threatened you with discovering the concealing of your effects? - It might be the same day.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was? - I cannot keep it in my head.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was not? - I do not believe any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Oh, but you must believe one way or the other? - I do not believe it was the same day, and I have no reason to believe the contrary; I do not recollect when it was.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Parr present when your wife told you that? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Within the last two months, what other persons had you delivered your goods to, either as returning them as belonging to them, or as paying off a debt, or any other way? - To no one; I do not recollect any thing of the kind; I am pretty sure, I think I can swear.</p>
               <p>Mrs. AYRES sworn.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow desired Mr. Ayres to remove out of the view of his wife during her examination; he went out of Court.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner was a servant of our's; I never had any suspicion of him, till I saw a neckcloth of mine about his neck; it was one of my habit neckcloths; it was a week or a fortnight before I discharged his wife, and that was about the 1st of March; I think that was about the 10th; the next day, he came in a silk handkerchief, which increased my suspicion; I said, Harry, I should be glad you would ask Ann whether she has mislaid any neckcloth; he took no notice of it; I never learned where he lived from himself, but I enquired, and found it out; and when the search warrant was taken out, I went with the officers, and it was in Angel-street, St. Martin's le Grand, in a two pair of stairs fore room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is it the same street that Mrs. Wordsworth lives in? - It is; I found two China plates, and a Chinabowl; I said, there is some part of my property; he fell down on his knees two or three times, and said, Mrs. Ayres, for God's sake, do not hurt me, I will deliver you up all your property, but do not take me to prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the officer present when he said so? - He was, and likewise the porter who fetched the things, his name is

            ; that part of the property that is found, I know to be mine; there is a mark on one neck handkerchief; I know it perfectly well; and the stockings are marked W. A. Here is the fellow to the handkerchief, they are remarkably fine, I do not think there is such another handkerchief; I did not mark it myself; these other things are all fresh marked with the prisoner's mark; says I, Harry, this is the very handkerchief I have been in search after; says he, Madam, I do not know how I came by it, I believe it is your's.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did he say? - I asked him how he came by that bowl; says he, Madam, I took it; he fell on his knees, and said, I will pray for you as long as I live, if you will not send me to gaol; I said nothing to him, before he fell on his knees.</p>
               <p>How long did the wife of the prisoner continue in your service, after he ceased to be in the house? - I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Was it a considerable time? - He was our servant to the very last; but I really do not know; I cannot give you a full answer, I believe it may be about two or three months; I suspected him from the time he would not tell me where he lived; I had communicated my suspicions to most of my friends, and I mentioned about the handkerchief to every body that knew me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, after your husband became a bankrupt, any application being made by the prisoner and his wife for the wages that were due to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was that before the search warrant? - Why, Mr. Garrow, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310116"/> say; I believe it was about a fortnight before the search warrant.</p>
               <p>The man came first, and then the wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>His wife behaved very rudely to you? - She did.</p>
               <p>She was turned out of the room, I believe? - She was.</p>
               <p>What did they threaten to charge your husband with? - I never heard them say any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>At no time? - At no time.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself, and do not be hasty in answering the question, nor be entrapped by it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am sure, my Lord, I do not wish she should; my question to you, Mrs. Ayres, is, whether at any time they made threats of charging your husband with discovering any concealment of his effects? - I never heard it from either of them.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear of it, till now that I mention it to you? - No, Sir; I never heard of it till the day before yesterday; I never heard of it before the search warrant.</p>
               <p>Then, of course, you are sure you never told Mr. Ayres that they had made such a threat? - I do not think I ever did say so.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure that you never did? - I cannot be sure that I did not say it since, but not prior to it; I was under no fear of any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Had you ever, before the day before yesterday, or before last Thursday, told your husband that you had heard that they had made such a threat? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of it? - I believe I may say I am quite sure of it; I am, till within this week.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any body else tell your husband that such a threat was made? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>So, after waiting March, April, and May, at last, in the latter end of May, a search-warrant was applied for? - After I missed this handkerchief, I asked Harry where he lived, and he refused to tell me; says I, in case you are wanted, it is very odd you do not give me a direction where you are to be sent for; I asked one Waiter that lives at No. 45, and he did not know, and I asked another person, and he did not know; I made several enquiries, and I was told that Nanny had been seen go in at the green stall; I enquired there about a month ago; I said, Harry, I desire I may know where you live; says he, I live up in the Upper Turnstile, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you apply for a search warrant as soon as you knew where he lived? - I certainly did.</p>

               <p>How did you find out where he lived? - It was by mere chance that a gentleman saw him go in with a box; had I been to have acted for myself, I should have been after them at any rate; Mr. Ayres would not suffer me to entertain the idea that they were dishonest.</p>
               <p>Did you ever apply to a Magistrate for a search warrant before? - No.</p>
               <p>About what time was it that your husband was arrested? - About the middle of April.</p>
               <p>He was in custody about a week, and then discharged? - I cannot say whether it was March or April.</p>
               <p>How long before the bankruptcy? - Above a month.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being at your house in Holborn, and giving any directions about cyder, and champaign, and carpets, any time about the 23d of April? -</p>
               <p>Court. The only defence would be, that these identical things were sent.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ask the prisoner where he lived, and he denied telling you? - He would not tell me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect giving any orders for the removal of any of the goods, after your husband had been arrested, and after he had been in the custody of the officer? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect ordering some carpets and some ticking to be carried? - I do not believe I ordered them; there were such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310117"/> things came down to Mr. Wordsworth's; we had an apartment there.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any champain and cyder carried any where? - There was some cyder that was sent me out of the country.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect giving such orders? - I desired him to carry about a couple of dozen to Mrs. Wall, as a present.</p>
               <p>Was none carried to Mr. Wordsworth in Angel-street? - Yes, there was, but not by my orders.</p>
               <p>Without your knowledge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were your orders? - To take about a dozen and an half, or two dozen of the cyder to Mrs. Wall.</p>
               <p>Had he orders to bring down the carpet and the ticking, or did he bring them without orders? - He had orders to bring them down.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when you gave him the orders? - It was, Harry you must take that carpeting down to No. 9, Ivy-lane.</p>
               <p>What had passed between you and him about removing things? - I will be upon my oath he never had any general order; he had no orders; he never brought any thing down to me but these things; he never removed any thing to another place by my order, or Mr. Ayres's to my knowledge; I do not recollect giving him the order about the pictures to Bartlett's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you gave any particular orders to the porter, you thought he was bound to obey them? - As a servant he certainly was.</p>

               <p>Did you send him back upon any occasion? - No, I did not, I was in the court, and Haylock came in to me, and put up his hand, says he, here is a pretty mess we are in, now that bloody rogue Blacketer has sent your apprentice away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I desire you Mr. Burley to stand up and get the trial put off the value of an hour? - He came in at that door; and I stood there; he did desire me to speak to the Judge concerning the matter that the boy was sent away; but he laid it on Blacketer.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Burley; and attended the trial of Kirby and Carr, here the last session; I was out of the way when the trial came on.</p>
               <p>Who sent you out of the way? - Blacketer and the prisoner came both together, and asked which was Burley's boy, I said, there he is; I thought they meant the little boy, they said, no, the apprentice; Blacketer said that; then Haylock told me, that my master was in court, and he had sent out word, that I was to go home for some beef stakes, I am sure it was Haylock that told me so; I was at the Justice's in Litchfield-street, and going to the watch-house, I heard the prisoner say, that Carr ran right plump into his arms; I took Kirby.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Blacketer did not send this boy home to fetch the bag that the meat was in? - They did not speak about the bag at first, they told me it was about beef stakes; I did not mention how many, but that I was to bring enough for them, and they told me, to mind, and be sure to bring the bag along with me; that was the bag that the prisoner Kirby and Carr left in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you bring the bag? - Yes, along with the stakes.</p>
               <p>Was it produced in evidence? - It was not called for, only my master shewed it.</p>
               <p>Was it the bag they sent you for or the beef stakes? - The beef stakes, and then they told me to bring the bag.</p>

               <p>Did you go afterwards to Litchfield-street? - Yes, the next day, and at the watch-house, this prisoner made a bad expression, and said, he ran into his arms.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - B - st my eyes he ran into my arms; I am confident he was running, not walking, and this prisoner told me the night before the trial and several other times, that if I said, I lost sight of him when he turned round the corner; I should have a guinea or two.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - No, only turning the corner, I got sight of him instantly; I gave account at the Justice's in the prisoner's hearing, that I never lost sight of him, and it was after that, that he made me this promise; at the Justice's, he said, he knew both the men, that they were both brothers.</p>

               <p>Did you make him any promise, that if he would disclose all that he knew, that you would not prosecute him? - I was very loth to do it; I rather apprehended that the promise came in this very place; he sent for Mr. Bill, while the examinations were going on, he came back, and said to my Lord Mayor that he had confessed the whole; I had not said anything; I believe Mr. Cole made him a promise, I apprehend so.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He never made a full confession, till I and Mr. Metcalf went to the Compter, and told him he should be perfectly secure and safe, if he declared the whole.</p>
               <p>Had he made any confession of having robbed you himself, before he was assured that nothing would happen to him, if he did confess? - I do not believe he had; I believe he did it to save his life; so far from it, there never was a more obstinate man in this world; he never confessed a single thing, till he thought his life was in danger: I found these things at the prisoner's apartments in drawers; in taking our stock over again, we missed a piece out of the box of

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Had not Rogers a sum of money offered him to confess? - No; I never heard Mr. Bill or any other of my friends say so; Mr. Bill is not here.</p>

               <p>The prisoner sent for you? - Yes, when he was in the compter, I went in consequence; he was chained to the bed, and he said, he was not guilty; I said, you had better confess, I believe you are guilty; he did not make any confession whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd objected to Rogers being sworn; and the Court observed it would be sheltering a felony to let in a misdemeanor, and that the objection lays in admitting an evidence who is a felon to be an evidence against a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester replied to the objection, and the court over-ruled the objection, and reserved the question for the opinion of the Judges.</p>

               <p>I was hired as a porter to Messrs. Acton and Ayre; I went there in November last; about five or six days after I had been at my master's house, I was going out with a load and I pitched it in the Horse-shoe passage; the house is kept by Mr. Price; I turned to the tap-room, and the prisoner and the man named Galland were both in the tap-room, and Galland being my countryman, I spoke to him; he was very well dressed; and he asked me if I was gone to live at a draper's, I said, I was; he said, he had lived at a draper's, but had left it a little time ago; he said, his masther had lost some goods, and thought it was him; he said, his master lived in Gracechurch-street; he began saying, if I had a mind, he could put money into my pocket, and something of that sort; and some few words passed; I asked him how, and he said, if I had got a piece of goods, he would give me money for it; I told him I did nothing of that sort, and I did not know how to do such a thing; and I went away with my load; he asked me if I could come that way at night, I told him, I dare not come out at night, but if I came that way with a load, I should call; he said, he would put me in a way to get rid of the things if there was a hundred pounds worth of them any day, he could get the money for them, I told him, I did no such thing; I met Galland often, but this prisoner I had never spoke to, but at the Horse-shoe; I saw the prisoner there every day after, and sometimes most part of the day, he and Galland were mostly together; and the prisoner and others at different times, many times asked what time I opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310123"/> warehouse, and that they would be coming that way, and if I would get a piece of goods ready they would call for it, as they went past, and nobody would take notice of it; I told him he must not come then, for our apprentice was always up first, and he staid in the warehouse; he said, then if I would take some goods into the private cellar, the small beer cellar, then I might have a pocket like theirs, either a new coat made, or loose pockets put into that; I believe the prisoner recommended that about the coat, and I was going by that or the next day, and they were there, and Jones the taylor was there; says they, that is the man that will either make you a new coat, or put pockets in that which you have on; the prisoner was there then, he was the first man that spoke about it, and Galland was there, and Jones came and spoke to me, and said, he lived at No. 6, in the court, and he would measure me, and I went, and he measured me, and I had a coat with proper pockets that day or the next; and he asked me whether I would have one pocket for a print, and the other for Irish; and he made that coat, he put in very large pockets; I saw the prisoner and Galland after I had the coat made, and they said, the coat was not right, they would have the pockets altered, but they were not altered; whether Galland was there when he told me to bring some goods I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When did you see this prisoner next? - Galland took me to the prisoner's house on Sunday morning, I believe about a fortnight after I was in place, the prisoner went with us from the Bell, he went up stairs, he did not say much then before Galland; there is a bell, and the prisoner told me to ring the bell, and come up stairs, he said the people below would not take any notice; I only opened the door, I did not stop but a very few minutes; that was the shop I was to leave the goods in if Galland was not in the way; the next day, or within a day or two, I saw the prisoner, and he asked me for piece of Irish; he was most mornings at the Horse-shoe, and I believe a day or two, or three after, he had a piece of Irish of me, I took it from out of a box in the cellar, the furthermost box but two in the lower warehouse; I took it to the prisoner at his own house, I think it was in the passage at his own door; I believe he went out and went down to the Bell, he said, he wanted for his brother-in-law to make shirts, I do not know his brother-in-law's name; he gave me a guinea and a half for it; two or three days after he said, lawns were much better things, they were wrapped in blue papers, they are not so long as Irish quite, if I could bring some of them, he could get more money for them; I had never lived with a draper before, I did not know them; and I believe the next he had, was some printed callico, I think it was a patch for a gown, or some muslins; that is one that I gave him, he said, he could not afford to give above a guinea and an half for the Irish; he said, the highest number was the best; I afterwards took him some muslins, that were ribs, he said, he could afford to give more for them, for his wife could sell them at the other end of the town; that patch was some of it I am sure, and he told me he sold this to Mrs. Holmes, that he never paid me for, but he said, he sold it to her for a guinea, and when she paid him he would give me the money; I did not know the Irish, they always cut the marks out as soon as I came there, they always examined them, and undid them directly.</p>
               <p>Here is a bit of paper that was in your pocket when you was taken? - I remember it, it was my memorandum, an account of some part of what I delivered.</p>

               <p>Who made the first proposal to you to discover? - My master, he sent word by other people, by Mr. Bill, and Mr. Sureton, and Mr. Williams of Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Was any money ever offered to you to make this discovery? - Not as I know of, they said there was a reward, and brought a paper to me; I did not understand I was to have it, or think about it.</p>
               <p>Why did they shew the paper to you? - I do not know, I did not think I should have a reward, I never refused, I said did not know any thing at all about it; I did not make any discovery till after I heard of this reward.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you expect to have a reward if these men are convicted? - I do not expect nothing, only about twenty-two pounds which I worked hard for, to be returned to me; I believe I received seventy-three guineas for the things which I took from my master's; they never promised to return me my money if this man was convicted.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Supposing I have done right in admitting the evidence, you have done right in determining from it; whether I have, or no, will be determined by higher authority; if they are of opinion with me, the prisoner must expect pretty nearly as severe a sentence from the Court as their power will enable them to pass.</p>
