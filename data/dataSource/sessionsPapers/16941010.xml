On the next morning Mr. Elliot going up Holbourn, near Rose-Alley he met Elliot with his Shoes on his Feet, whereupon he seiz'd him, and afterwards took Leonard and the woman, viz. Bullen, at the Sign of the Leper in Picadilly. The Evidence against the Woman was, That she sold the Coat to a Broker, which she owned. An Inkhorn was found in Elliot's Pocket, which was Mr. Pearsons. And Pearsons Hat was found upon Leonard, and the Hathand was taken out of his Pocket, which Pearson swore was his; and likewise was positive that they were the men that robbed him. Leonard denied the Fact, and that he accidentally went to drink with the woman when the Constable came to apprehend him. Elliot alledg'd that it was very strange, that Pearson should know their Faces in the dark, and that he was never guilty of any such matter, and called one Mr. Keat to prove that he was in his Quarters the same night, but he could not. Others gave a fair Character of his former Behaviour; and as to the Pistols Elliot said he had them to clean, but could prove nothing.

Says G - I have lost money at a Race at Bamstead Downes, and I am vext, I'le tell you what you shall do; I'll procure you some Clippings, and you may find a hole in the house to put them in.

She reply'd she had none of it; then he told the Prisoner that he had it, and had pawn'd it at the Crown Tavern in Wapping; and that he would have it before he went, or else he would do the Prisoner a mischief. Upon that Mr. R - drew his Sword, and run at Mr. Morrison through the Door-way, then Morrison went into the Room to Mr. R - and fell upon him, having no Weapon but a Cane, and fought with Mr. R - and beat him, till he made him cry out Murther. The Prisoner desired Cole might be asked, Whether he did not see the Deceased to assault the Prisoner in the Room, and throw him on the Couch. The Evidence answer'd, he did. The next Evidence for the King, was a Lad of about 16 years of age, who declared, that the beginning of this Accident was on this manner: Some time since a Gentleman coming to drink in the House, not having money, left a Ring with Mr. Morrison that then was a Drawer in the said House, which Ring Morrison wore on his Finger. Mrs. Mortimer the Bar-keeper seeing him wear it, did ask him for it, and he, in a jesting manner, held out his Finger, and Mrs. Mortimer took it from him, keeping it some time; and afterwards going abroad with Captain G - R - the Priner, she let him have it. Some time after the Gentleman that owned the Ring, went to Morrison the Deceased, and demanded it. Morrison then being gone from the place, and living in another Service, took occasion one day to go to his old Masters for the Ring, where he found Captain R - talking with Mrs. Mortimer the Bar-keeper, whom he asked for the Ring. She told him she had it not, but that Captain R - had it, (and some body there said, that R - had pawn'd it to a Broker for 5 s.) then the Deceased asked R - for it, and he said he had it not, and would not give it him, for he ow'd him nothing. Upon which, rough words arose between them, and R - drew his Sword, which Morrison fended off with his Cane, and immediately Morrison was wounded, as aforesaid, of which Wound the Chyrurgion made Oath that he languished, and within three days died. Then

             the Lad stood up again, and the Court asked him, Whether he saw the Wound given? He answer'd, That Harrison put off the first Passes with his Cane, but afterwards he saw R - stab the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16941010005"/>Deceased with a Sword. Then the Prisoner called Mrs. Mortimer, who gave a very favourable Report of him, yet owning all the matter of the Ring, saying the Captain had it from her. Then Mrs. Baker stood up, saying, That Mrs. Mortimer had no need to give him the Ring, for the Captain had a Wife, and Mrs. Mortimer was but his Mistress. The Captain made a notable Defence, if he could have proved what he alledged. Then he called divers Persons as to his Reputation, some of whom were of good Quality: But the Brother of the Deceased having divers credible Persons to confront them with some former Actions, he desisted, and none were heard as to that matter on either side. So after a long Hearing, his Lordship proceeded to give the Charge, and the Jury brought him in <rs id="t16941010-40-verdict172" type="verdictDescription">
