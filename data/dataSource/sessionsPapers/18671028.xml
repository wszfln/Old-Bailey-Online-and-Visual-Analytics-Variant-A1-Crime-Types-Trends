                  </hi> I am the wife of William Wilkinson, of 23, Port<lb/>land Road, Notting Hill, professor of music—in May last my husband was sued in the County Court by a person named Manton for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—the first instalment, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was paid by my husband on 5th June—I had some conversation with the prisoner about the payment of the second instalment—he called accidentally at my house the day before it ought to be paid into Court—I was ill at the tine, and did not see him—I sent the money down to him by my daughter into the drawing-room—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the prisoner that same evening, or it might have been the next—I asked him if he had paid it in—he said; "Yes, it is paid in and all right"—I then asked him for my receipt—he said he had it at home, and I should have that likewise—I gave him this paper at the time I sent the money down by my daughter—an execution was afterwards put in from the County Court—I saw the prisoner again that evening or the day after on my door steps—I called him to me at the window, "Mr. Boland, a pretty mess you have made of the County Court summons; you have never paid it in; the consequence was that, as we were going to dinner to-day, an officer from the County Court came to put an execution in, and I have had to pay the money over a second time"—he said that it had been paid in, and that it was a mistake of the clerk's, or a mistake of the County Court—I asked him if I could have the receipt—he said yes, it should come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186710280004"/>
               <p>in with other receipts—he afterwards remarked that we were not to inquire at the County Court, as the clerk would get into trouble, perhaps lose his situation—he afterwards brought me this paper, in the same state in which it is now—I paid the amount of the execution—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it is dated 23rd July—when I gave it to the prisoner there was no signature to the second instalment (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"June 4th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., W.

                  </hi> I am a clerk in the Marylebone County Court, Middlesex—this paper is an order for payment by instalments in an action of Munton <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Wilkinson by consent of the parties—the first instalment was paid on 5th June—my signature is to that payment—I signed it when the money was paid—the "W. Bedwell" to the second instalment of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is not mine—it was not written by my authority; it is not the writing of any person in the office—I issued the execution in this matter for the second instalment—this is the receipt of the officer of the County Court for the amount—no extra time could be obtained by payment of 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the order of the Court was to pay the second instalment at the end of twenty-eight days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the date of the second payment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The 13th July; it ought to have been paid on the 3rd—there is no fine for not paying the instalment at the proper time—there appears to be a pencil note in the ledger, "Will pay on 13th July"—some one had called—the, memorandum is in the writing of Mr. Cousens, one of the clerks—I do not know a person of the name of Channing, clerk to the prisoner—Mr. Cousens receives money in my absence; he would not sign my name—any clerk receiving money would sign his own name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>do—I have a slight doubt about the first amount, 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this course of business has been going on for some years—I paid the first instalment myself, in good time—I did not appear in the County Court; judgment went by default—I was going to pay the second instalment, and he said, "Don't do it; I am going by, and I will pay it for you"—some time after this I was in difficulties, and contemplated a composition deed—I can scarcely answer whether the prisoner was one of my largest creditors; I don't know what I owed him—I should not call him a creditor—he did not refuse to sign the deed, he signed it—Mrs. Wilkinson will tell you how he came to sign it—I scarcely understand these things, I am out so much.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you paid all the amounts in that list? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sure about it—I employed the prisoner to get sums of money when we wanted them, and for that purpose he drew and I accepted—I am not sure whether the bills were running at this time—I suppose he paid him<lb/>self for his services—I can't say whether I had received the money upon all these bills; my wife can tell you all about it.</p>

My husband was indebted to the pri<lb/>soner at this time upon certain bills—there were two bills, and likewise at the time of the County Court affair a loan was obtained to meet a bill, for which Mr. Boland drew or signed as security—there were three bills then, but nothing like the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband had received the money upon two of the bills for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, not on the third, the prisoner was at that time trying to get us the loan—I never paid him a sixpence for anything he did—I have often asked him how we were to pay him back, and he has said, "I shall never charge you anything; wait till all is finished and then we shall see"—my husband had two sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the prisoner got nothing out of that to my knowledge—we did not get the whole 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he brought me rather less—if I remember right the bilk were drawn for that amount.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk—I am out of employment at present—I was employed by Mr. Boland for about eighteen months—he is a general agent, and negotiates many transactions for persons who are in want of it—I know a person named Channing who was in his service—he used to serve writs or anything of that sort, or do his business in any shape or form that was required—early in July I remember seeing Channing at the prisoner's—we were there together—I saw the prisoner hand him some money—I can't say exactly the amount, but money passed, with instructions for him to go to the County Court and pay it—I believe Chan<lb/>ning left for that purpose—he absconded some time after that—I don't know where he is—I had known him there between four and five months—I have seen him write—I have no belief about the signature of Bed<lb/>well to the second instalment; I don't know the writing at all—it is very similar to Channing's writing; there is a little alteration from his general writing—he generally joins his initial to his surname, the same as this is—that is the only thing I can recognise in it—the figure 6 bears a strong resemblance to his; he always made a 6 with a long stroke, the same as this.</p>

               <p>not so long as six—it was on 12th July that this money was given to Channing—I remember the date because we were there together at Mr. Boland's office; we were not always there together—Channing was not there long; he was between four and five months in Mr. Boland's service—I could not say exactly the time he came, not the month—he was not constantly going to the County Court to pay money; I don't remember his going many times—I was not before the Magistrate; I was there, but not called—a solicitor appeared for the prisoner—when he gave the money to Channing he said, "Take this money to the County Court and bring me the receipt"—I know what money it was—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, or about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or something like it; I could not say exactly—I know money was paid to him by Mr. Boland; I could not say exactly the amount—I was busy making out papers—it was the Marylebone County Court—there a little similarity in the signature of Bedwell to Channing's writing, not much—I know Channing's genuine signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—that is more like his writing; I believe that to be his—the only similarity in Bed well's signature is the joining of the initial of the Christian name to the surname—I know the prisoner's writing; I see no similarity in it to his.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186710280007"/>
               <p>yes, they would—I saw him again the same time, or within a day or so, and he said he had paid Mr. Stevenson—I said, "Then will you come in and bring me all receipts, the County Court receipt, and Mr. Stevenson's receipt for this 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? "—an evening was arranged when my husband should be in the house at seven o'clock to receive these things—I was resent, and we sat down at the table together—the prisoner first of all handed me these two copies of the writs produced, and said, You had better burn them, Mrs. Wilkinson"—he did not say why—he said, "Don't have them in your possession"—that was all, and from his saying that I rather thought I should like to keep them—he at the same time gave me: this receipt of Mr. Lamb's for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., saying, "There is the receipt for the money"—I said, "Is it all done with? with regard to Mr. Stevenson, is it all paid up?

I first discovered about these writs about a month or six weeks or two months ago—I then sent for the prisoner to see what explanation he had to give for having made use of my name—he said that he had instructed a person to come down to my office with money, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think he mentioned, with a request to me to issue some writs—I there upon called my clerk into my office and asked him if any one had called from Mr. Boland on the day he stated—he referred to the call-book to refresh his memory, and he said no one had called from Mr. Boland, and, furthermore, that he had never seen anybody from Mr. Boland's office—I think the prisoner mentioned the name of Channing—I don't remember whether he said that Channing had robbed him to a considerable amount—I have no recollection of it.</p>

               <p>Tuesday afternoon, 8th October, I was on duty at Clerkenwell about twenty minutes past five; I was dressed in my uniform, as I am now, except that I had no great coat on—I was engaged in handing the female prisoners into the prison van from the cells of the Sessions House; I received them from warder Keeley—I was standing on the pavement, close to the door of the van—a woman named Alice Turner was handed out to me by Keeley—it the moment she was handed to me, the prisoner rushed up from the crowd behind me, put his two hands against the back of my head, and pushed me against the prison van; at the same time my body and legs hit the van violently—at the same moment I received a heavy blow on the right side of the head, I do not know from whom, whether it was the prisoner or not—the prisoner then got in between me and Alice Turner, and, with his left elbow bent, hit me a violent blow in the right side; he then seized hold of Alice Turner round the waist with both hands; her back was turned to him; he drew her back towards the crowd; he made use of some expressions at the time, I cannot tell what they were—I had not got hold of the woman at that time—he had got in between us—Keeley and two police constables got hold of the prisoner and Alice Turner, and gave him into custody and put the woman into the van—I should sup<lb/>pose there were between 200 and 300 people there at the time; they were behaving very badly, five or six in particular; they were noisy and shouting—I could not say that they interfered with me in the execution of my duty; I would not say that they were making a disturbance—Alice Turner was dragged about four or five yards from the police van—the prisoner was very violent when he was taken into custody; the sergeant had to send an extra force to take him to the station.</p>

I then asked her for the rings out of her ears; she gave them to me, and Catherine also gave me hers—I asked Mary Ann where she got them from—she said she bought them on Friday at Mr. Upsall's, in the Whitechapel Road—Catherine said hers were only common ones, and they were given to her by a young man who had gone for a soldier—Mary Ann fell on her knees and said, "Oh, pray Mr. Brydon don't lock mo up"—she then turned round to Gibbons and said, "Oh Tom,</p>

He beckoned me to him, opened his hand, was showed me half a sovereign, and asked me to have something to drink. I liked him where he lived, but he could not tell me. I could not get away from him, and I shoved him, and he, being tipsy, fell down. He held that hold of my coat; I tried to get it out of his hand, and had to pull him up with me. When I got up he fell down again, because he was not able to stand. I did hit him for tearing my coat, but I am innocent of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi> I reside at 21, Lawford Road—in August last the prisoner was in my service as general servant, and had been so for three months and a fortnight—when she had been with me about a month she wig ill one evening, and after she had gone to bed I went up to her, and told her I was afraid she was in trouble, and if she would confide in me I would be a friend to her through it—she assured me it was not so, and said all her family were very peculiar figures in that way—I said this to her inconsequence of what I had observed about her figure—on Tuesday, 13th August, at half-past eleven at night, I heard her coming down stairs, and I went out to ask her what the matter was—she said she had the diarrhoea—about two o'clock the same morning my sister, who slept in the same room, came and made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went out of my room and met the prisoner coming down stairs—I said, "What is the matter? "—she said she was suffering great pain in her chest—she went down stairs—I waited until she came up, and I asked her again what made her ill—she said she had eaten too plentifully of some Orleans plum pudding that we had had for dinner—she seemed much about the same at that time—I went to her about a quarter of an hour afterwards to ask her how she was—she said she was very much better, and that she should not require me to order anything for her then—about three o'clock I heard her go down stairs again, and I went down and saw her coming out of the scullery—I then noticed that her hands and arms and the front of her dress were covered with blood—I again asked her what the matter was—she said she had been violently sick, and had brought up the blood—I then told her to go up and lie down on the bed, and I went out of the house to look for a policeman—about half an hour afterwards I sent for Dr. Woolley—he came about half-past four.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. On 14th August I was sent for to 21, Law<lb/>ford Road, Kentish Town, about a quarter-past four in the morning—I went there and saw the prisoner in the first-floor back room—she was called of from the kitchen—I asked her if she had been ill—she said she had, she had been suffering from diarrhoea and sickness, and had suffered great pain—I ordered her to be put to bed—I then examined her, and was convinced that she had been recently delivered of a child—I said to her, "You hare had a child, have you not? "—she said, "Yes"—I asked where it was—she said, "In the coal-cellar"—I asked her if it cried—she said, "No"—I then went into the coal-cellar and found a baby in the corner, covered up with coal-dust—it was an ordinary coal-cellar, about ten feet square, under the area steps—after cleaning away the coal-dust I examined the body of the child—I judged that it had been dead a few hours, possibly two or three hours—I have no doubt but it had breathed—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the same evening—there was no bruise or anything tobe seen externally; on the left side of the neck was a large wound extending through the skin, the muscles, and the blood vessels; it cut through all the parts except a little skin and muscle on the right side—the body weighed six pounds and five ounces, and measured twenty and a half inches, is length—the umbilical cord was torn about five inches from the body, not tied—the body had not been washed—I made an internal examination, and found a bruise on the top of the head, and below the scalp a portion of effused blood—the general appearance of the head and the whole body ill healthy—in my opinion the wound in the neck was the cause of death—it would produce immediate death by the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there much coal in the cellar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, a very small quantity—the body was covered over with coal-dust, perhaps a few hatfuls, such a quantity as might be raised in a shovel, a hatful, Mt perhaps more—I believe the child had breathed—I have every reason to believe it was born alive; the lungs were inflated—it is quite possible that a child may breathe before it is separated from the body of the mother; that would account for the inflation of the lungs, but when wholly separated from the mother it might not have been alive—if the gash on the throat was inflicted immediately after death I suppose blood would still flow, although I have no experience in such cases—the blood would not flow a. the same way from a dead child as from a living one; if it was dead only a few moments, the blood would flow quite differently—I have had a good deal of experience in these matters—I believe this was the prisoner's first child, but I do not know—women do not always calculate the time they are about to be delivered, and when the pains come on they sometimes mistake them for a desire to go to the closet—I have read of cases of delivery in the watercloset—I have not bad such a case, but I have had cases where ladies have been delivered in the room while standing, and the child has fallen to the ground; sometimes the head of the child might be slightly damaged—if the child fell in that way the cord would usually be torn—cannot imagine that this wound on the neck was one cut—the head was nearly severed from the body—my impression of the prisoner was that she was of weak intellect—it is within my experience that coincident with the pains of labour there is certain mental disturbance—in the case of</p>

                  </hi> I am the prisoner's wife; on Friday morning, the 13th September, between two and three o'clock, I was in my bedroom—my husband went up stairs before me—he had come home before me—I went up stairs with the baby in my arms, and found him sitting on the side of the bed, taking his boots off as I thought—my sister-in-law came into the room—I afterwards bid her "good night, "and she went down stairs—I was going to put the baby into the bed and then undress myself—my husband was sitting on the side of the bed at the time—there was a light b the room—I did not say anything to him that I recollect—I did not see him raise his hand at all—the first thing I felt was something come across my throat—I had not laid down, I was sideways on the bed like—the light was still burning on the wash hand basin near the foot of the bed—I was quite awake, when I felt something across my throat—I did not see any<lb/>thing at that time—I could not see for a moment, and when I did see I saw the blood trickling down—I only felt what I have described; once I took my baby in my arms and pressed it up to my neck, and went to the window and cried "Murder! "—the baby is just on eight months old—it was dressed in short clothes—I saw my husband go down stairs—I flew down stairs quickly, and went to my mother-in-law's house—I carried the child all the way in my arms as I have described—the blood dropped on the baby all the way—I was in my mother-in-law's house about twenty minutes before I went to the hospital—I left the hospital three weeks yesterday—I am quite well now, and I hope you will have mercy upon him—this is his knife, sometimes his and sometimes mine—I go out with cats' meat and use it for the purpose of cutting the skewers—my husband had it that night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 148 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>). In consequence of information I went to the Bunhill Row post-office at a quarter-past ten on the morning of the 2nd October—I stopped behind the counter near a side door till about eleven o'clock, when Oldacre came in with some papers in his hand—I heard him say, "It is an order, but you had not found the advice when a person called before; I brought it from 25 1/2, Gee Street, Brick Lane"—I let myself out of the side door and went into the shop—I said to King, "What is that? "—he said. "This order"—I asked the prisoner where he got it from—he said, "From a man he knew well; I don't know his name or where he lives"—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody, and go to Old Street Police-station with me"—I took him out<lb/>side about ten yards and said, "Which is the public-house the man was at?—he said, "The corner of Bath Street; take me there and I will point him out"—I said, "No, I can't do that"—I then took him back to the post-office and left him with a carpenter in a little room, and King and 1 went to the public-house and found no one there—I then took him to the station—on the way he took this letter from his pocket and said, "Here is tho letter belonging to the order "—I afterwards took Gillett—he said that the man he had it of was named "<hi rend="italic">Cris</hi>"—that was after the examination, when he was going to the cells.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 21, Crown Street, Old Street Road—I have known Oldacre three or four years—I saw him on the 2nd October, about a quarter to eleven, at the corner of Pitfield Street—a man named Leonard Wallace was with me—I saw Oldacre in a public-house to ask him to change an order which Wallace had given me about five minutes before—I don't know where he got it from—he had it in his hand with the letter—I did not see any envelope—he asked me if I could change it, and I went and called Oldacre out of the public-house—he knew Wallace as well as I did—I knew him by working at the top of the market—I gave him the order and asked him to change it—to go to the post-office—I did not say who it was from—I gave him the letter as well, and he walked down Old Street reading it—I did not read the letter—I can't read writing—I don't think Wallace can read—Oldacre walked down Old Street, and we went to a public-house near the post-office, and had some rum together—I told him some one had been with it before to the post-office—I heard that from Wallace—Oldacre did not say anything to that—we waited at the corner of Bath Street—there were two or three other persons about, but I did not know them—I do not know Teddy Main—Wallace was with some others when I first saw him, and he left them and came with me—there was not a quantity of men.</p>

                  </hi> I am manager for Mr. Flight—I was present when the agreement was made—prisoner read all the rules and regulations referred to in it—his salary was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week and commission—it was afterwards increased to 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the commission was not altered—he was paid weekly—he was expected to attend in the office, and was not allowed to work for any one else—if I had known of such a thing I should have discharged him—it was his duty to pay over to Mr. Yarrow, the cashier, what he received.</p>

"—he said, "Yes"—I cannot say which letter it was, as I had them all in my hand together—they are the same bill heads, and had the same heading—he said, "I was introduced by a baker, named Clunkert, to a man named Capma, a general merchant; he sold the wine for me, but the money was paid to me by Mr. Wilson, the Custom House agent; I gave the baker 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Capma 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for commission"—I found this receipt in Kockmann's box for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I unlocked the box with a key which I found in his pocket—he added, "And the money you found is all that I; have left"—he said that he received 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the wine, and that he had given some money to his friends and bought some furniture—he again im<lb/>plored me to have mercy on his wife and children, as he did not care for himself, but for them—on the road to London by railway he repeated sub<lb/>stantially the same—I told him I found three letters in Oster's box—he said, "I know, I wrote them"—I took him to London and locked him up, and next morning he thanked me for the kindness I had shown his wife in giving her the money—on 16th October I took Oster at 1, Elfin Villas, Forest Hill; when I knocked he opened the door; I read the warrant to him and said, "Do you understand it?

                  </hi> I am an India-rubber manufacturer, of 89, Southampton Row—in 1849 I patented an article called an accu<lb/>mulator, which was exhibited in the Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862, and also at the Paris Exhibition of 1855—one application of it was applied to door-springs, which I called "R. E. Hodges' patent accumulator ABC door-springs"—that was on all the wrappers I had printed and put round the accumulators when I sent them out—I know the defendant—he pur<lb/>chased door-springs of me for eleven years, ending in 1866; then I refuted, for some reason or other, to supply him—he then said that he should be left to his own resources, or thrown on his own resources—these door springs are not my manufacture—they are in pattern the same, but the workmanship is inferior, and they are not marked as mine are on the rubber with my name—this is one of mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not authorise the printing of this wrapper by Bell—I never authorised the prisoner or any one else to make a wrapper for me, or to sell goods made by other persons as mine—the printing of the two wrappers corresponds exactly, except that my address is at the bottom of one, and Bell, the printer's name, is at the bottom of the other—they wore in Class 28 at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and in class 10 at the Paris Exhibition of 1855—when I sold them to the defendant I sold them in the same wrappers—he was perfectly familiar with my wrappers.</p>

On the morning of 21st September I was with constables Obey, Witney, and Green—we left the city soon after seven, and got to Tottenham Court Road a little after eight—we there saw Shaw, James Dyer, and Norrington, about half-past nine, with another man not in custody—I first saw them at the corner of Stephen Street and:</p>

               <p>Tottenham Court Road—I was in plain clothes—they remained together about half an hour, and then I saw James Dyer and Shaw go up Tottenham Court Road, and the others went in a different direction—I lost sight of them then—I next saw Norrington coming from the direction of Percy Street—(I was with the other officers, and had continued with them nearly all the time)—I saw him at the top of Percy Street, coming from the direction of Stephen Street—he was carrying this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), marked No. I—I stopped him and asked him what he had there—he said, "Linen, why? "—Green and Obey then came up, and I said I should charge him with being concerned in entering Nos. 1 and 2, Falcon Street, City, and stealing a large quantity of chintz and other articles, about the 16th—he said, "It is a bad job"—I put him in a cab, conveyed him to Moor Lane station, and charged him—I found on him a pocket-book and some memoranda, a sketch, and an assay paper with Shaw's name on it, and these two pieces of wood—they are used by burglars in fitting locks, to judge the keyholes; by putting them in the hole they get the depth of the key, they then make a sketch and fit the key afterwards—he refused his address—at the station I opened the parcel and found these two pieces of chintz and eleven pieces of ribbon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards received from Obey some skeleton keys, and on 26th September I went to the warehouse in Falcon Street, and found one of the keys opened the front door easily—this is the key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant H</hi> 11). On 28th August from information, I went to the Commercial Docks—I saw a waggon of Messrs. Tyndal and Jacobs, laden with cases of salmon—the prisoners Paster and Owen were with the van—I saw them come out of the dock after the van was loaded—they stopped at a public-house just outside for a few minutes—they then drove on to the China beer-shop, where they stopped again; they then drove on to a third beer-shop, where they stopped again—from there they went on to the Queen Charlotte public-house—there saw Panter take out one of the little tins, put it under his jacket, and go into the public-house—I saw Owen come out of the public-house, get on the van, and take another one, and go inside the public-house with it—he came out a second time and took a tin and went in again—I afterwards saw them both come out—I did not see that they had anything with them—they got on the van and drove on to the Young Prince beer-shop, in Blue Anchor Road—they stopped there some little time and then went on into Alfred Street, Bermondsey, where they stopped, and I saw Panter holding up a nosebag, and Owen put in several of the little tins—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the tins—they are tins of preserved salmon—Panter got off the van, and Owen handed the nosebag to him, and he went into No. 18, Alfred Street—in a minute or two he came out again, chucked the empty nosebag on the van, got on the top, and then they drove away to another beer-shop in the Grange Road—I saw them go in there shortly afterwards—Owen came out, got on the van, and took another tin out of a box in the fore part of the van, and went into the beer-shop—I then got out of the cab in which I had been following them, and went into the beer<lb/>shop—Owen had got the tin in his hand—I said, "What are you going to do with this? "(he was about to pass it to another man, who was standing there)—he said, "Oh! it is no value much; I was going to give it to my mate"—I said, "Well, you had no right to take it; you had better come outside"—he said, "Oh! Mr. Dunaway, you don't mean to lock us up for that? "—I said, "That will be for Mr. Jacobs; you will have to go to the station"—Panter said to him, "Oh! why did you touch them? I would rather give anything than you should have touched them; you know you had no right to have touched them"—I told Mr. Jacobs's foreman, who was along with me, to go on with the van, and I said, "You two get into the cab along with me"—Owen dropped the tin that he had in his hand in the road, and I picked it up—I drove on till I met a man in uniform—I called him to my assistance—I then told them what they would be charged with, and what I had seen them do—Panter said, "Is it likely that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186710280074"/>
               <p>should do anything of the kind, when the gate-keeper pointed out this old man and said, 'He is along with the police, and they are after you, or on to you? '"—I then went on to the station in Bermondsey Street, left the two prisoners there, and went outside and examined the cases on the van found two cases had been broken open; one was more than half empty—I think only twenty tins were left in that case—I afterwards went with H 88 to 18, Alfred Street, where Pearce lived; I saw the landlady, and went up stairs, and there found twenty-three tins of salmon, some of which are here—some were afterwards given up to the prosecutor—they were standing on a table on the landing up against Pearce's room door—they were not concealed in any way—I left 88 H there and went to the beer<lb/>shop in Blue Anchor Road, where I received eight tins from the witness Drage—I afterwards saw Pearce at Bermondsey Street police-station—I said, "I have been to 18, Alfred Street, where you say you live, and I got these twenty-three tins of salmon; what have you to say about them? "—he said, "Yes, I bought them; I met the two men in Eastcheap to-day (they were present); they asked me if I would buy any, and I said yes, I would"—I said, "You, as a carman, ought to know very well that they bad got nothing of the kind to sell, and you will consider yourself in custody for receiving these, well knowing they were stolen"—he said he did not know they were stolen—in the front part of the van, where the cases had been broken open, I found this crowbar, which would be very handy for opening them.</p>

                  </hi> I am manager of William Gallett, of 4, Perseverance Place—on 28th August I saw the prisoners come in a van to the Young Prince—I was standing outside—Panter got down off the van and said to me, "I think I have some goods here that are likely to suit you"—I said, "What are they? "—he said, "They are tins of potted salmon"—I said, "I don't think they will suit this neighbourhood, but I think I have seen your face before"—he said, "Yes, I used to drive for Smith and Nolley"—I said, "What are they? "—he said, "They are old ships stores, and I have bought one or two cases from the mate of the vessel"—I said, "I have no buying on my own account here; I will go in and ask what the <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> says"—I went inside; I did not buy any—he said, "Well, I have no money in my pocket; for old acquaintance sake, will you stand a pot of beer? "—I said, "Yes"—we went into the Young Prince and called for a pot—they were talking there about the salmon, and I said to the publican, Mr. Skinner, "They have some fish here; you, being a Plymouth man, may be fond of them"—he said, "What are they? "—Panter said, "Old ships' stores, that I bought from the mate of a vessel; I want to sell them cheap"—he was asked the price, and he said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen by taking the case, or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen if they broke the case"—Skinner said, "It is like buying a pig in a poke"—I said, "Perhaps you have a sample; will you bring one in? "—Panter I believe went and got one; it was opened in front of the bar, and several persons round the bar tasted it and said they should like to buy one each—Owen, I think, said, "No, we will not sell one, but if any person here likes to buy any and sell them to you we will sell them to that person"—Owen then said to me, "You had better have half-a-dozen on your own account"—I said, "They are no use to me; I can't do anything with them"—he said, "Perhaps you can sell them to your friends round, the bar"—I then agreed to take half-a-dozen for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to sell them round the bar at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece profit, which should be spent among the company for a quart</p>

                  </hi> I am a retired police inspector, and am employed by the Mint for the purpose of detecting offences—on the night of the 27th September I went with Sergeant Ham and some other officers to the Newcastle Arms beer-house, Lambeth, about half-past nine, and saw the prisoner standing at the door in his shirt-sleeves—he was seized by Morton and Ham—there were other policemen, of the L division, and a sergeant of the P division—they endeavoured to get him up stairs—he struggled very violently—they got him to the first-floor landing, and asked him whether he lived in the first-floor back room—he made no reply, but put his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket—Morton said,</p>

                  </hi> I keep the Rose public-house, New Cross—on the evening of 14th October, about nine o'clock, I served the prisoner with a glass of six ale—he gave me a bad florin—I said, "Have you any more like this? "—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of copper and silver—I said, "Why do you want to change this, when you have smaller money? "—he made no answer—I sent for a policeman and I set my assistant to watch the prisoner in the tap-room—as the policeman came in Wood, another of my servants, came out of the tap-room and brought me a small parcel, which I gave to the constable, who opened it—I also gave him the florin, and he marked it.</p>
