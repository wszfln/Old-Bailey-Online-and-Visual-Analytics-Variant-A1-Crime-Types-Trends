On Thursday, the 24th of November, I was directed to take a truck, containing a half-hundred weight of coffee to Mrs. Tipples, in King-street, Brick-lane—on my way I went to Mr. Owen, in Montague-street, and left a box of candles—Mrs. Owen gave four sovereigns to Hagen, her boy, and told him and me to go to public-house to get change for one of them—we went to the Black Lion in that street, and got one of them changed, and the boy paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the box of candles—I had left the truck at Mrs. Owen's door while I went for the change—after Hagen paid me I took out another bill for Tipples, and showed it to him, and said I was going to Mrs. Tipples with the coffee—the prisoner was present, and left the tap-room directly—and went out, and two or three minutes after we went out I saw him take the coffee off the truck, put it on the rail of the truck, then put it on his shoulder and walk off with it—it was twelve or sixteen yards from the public-house—I ran after him, and caught him turning the corner into Brick-lane—I pulled it off his back, and told him it was mine—he said a man in a surtout coat and white apron gave him sixpence to carry it to Mrs. Tipples—I took the coffee</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 4th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road, and received information that a coat had been stolen from a gig—in less than a quarter of an hour I met the prisoner coming down Tottenham-court-road, with this coat on his shoulder—I stopped him, and asked what it was—he said it was his own—I asked where he got it—he said he had bought it, about six weeks ago, of a gentleman's servant in Lisson grove—I took him back to where the gig stood, and it proved not to be the coat that was stolen from there—I however took him to the station-house, and on the way he said he had bought the coat with a blue one, which he had sold to another man—I asked if he could tell me who the man was he sold it to—he said he could not—I asked him what he had been doing himself—he said driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he could not tell me who for, nor refer me to any one who had seen him with the coat—I cut a button off the coat, and found out the button-maker, who told me whose crest was on it, and the footman came afterwards to identify it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Coast Guard Office in the Custom House, and live in Warwick-square. On Monday the 5th of this month, I went to Drury-lane theatre, at half-price—I waisted there for half-price to commence—there were a number of people waiting as well as me—I had a silk handkerchief on my neck, which I took off—I dropped it with my gloves—the prisoner picked them up and offered them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120024"/>
               <p>back to me—he made a half bow and said, "Shall I hold them for you?" while I was tying my neckcloth and putting my collar to rights—I do not know that I answered him, but I made a kind of bow of assent, and went on adjusting my black handkerchief and collar—I then turned round to receive my handkerchief and gloves, but the prisoner was gone—I went after him, and found him in about half an hour, under the piazza of Covent-garden—he said he had been looking for me, and he said, "You will think it odd, "or "think me odd, but I caught a glimpse of a friend, and at the impulse of the moment I rushed after him, quite forgetting that I had your things, but could not find him"—I said I was very glad we had met, and asked him for my handkerchief—he looked at himself and said, "I have just been to change my coat, and having given up the idea of seeing you again this evening, I have left the gloves and handkerchief in the coat, "but he said if I was walking his way we would go and fetch them—he then took hold of my arm, and asked me to go into a public-house opposite, first, to see if his friend was there—we went in, but there was no one there that looked likely to be his friend—I observed to him that there seemed to be nobody there who knew him, and was proposing to go—he then asked me whether I would not have any thing to drink—I said I really did not want anything—I appeared rather vexed, and proposed going—when we got out of the house he said I might any morning find him at a large shop in St. Paul's churchyard—he again took hold of my arm, and said we would go to his rooms—we walked up to a house in Brownlow-street, and when we came to a kind of public entrance to several rooms, the door was open—he stopped me and said, "I will run up and fetch your handkerchief and gloves, I won't trouble you to come up"—this staircase seemed to have a thoroughfare at the foot of it, out behind into a yard, or some other street—I fancied he wanted to escape with my property, and I told him it would not be the least trouble, and I had rather accompany him up and fetch them—there was a woman on the staircase with a light, which she gave to the prisoner—he went up to his room, opened the door, and walked in, I following him—the room struck me as rather an odd one, not at all according with the person's ap<lb/>pearance, it was very shabby—and on my turning round the prisoner had slipped back and shut the door, and was taking the key out of the lock and putting it into his pocket—I was very much alarmed, and thought I had fallen into a snare of some kind, but I tried to look as calm and collected as possible, and I civilly asked him for my handkerchief—he said "Ah, we will talk of that presently, let us have something to drink," at the same time holding out his hand to me to supply it, and I wishing to keep on terms with him, and being in fear, gave him a shilling: when be immediately said, "Come, I know you have a sovereign about you"—I assured him I had not one—he again said he was quite sure I had; it was all nonsense, and on my saying I really had not any thing more about me, he stepped forward, or rather rushed forward, and seized my cloak from off the chair which was standing by me—it was half on the chair—I had it on my arm when I came in—he said, "I must keep this till you bring me one"—it was lying on the front of the chair—whether part of it was on my arm, or sleeve, or not, I cannot say—it had slipped off, and I think the sleeve might be on my arm—I had never thrown it from me, but in feeling for the shilling it had slipped off—I was touching it—my knee was against it—I then remonstrated with him, and he retorted, "I did not ask you to come up"—I said it might have been as well if we had brought a third person—he asked what I meant—I muttered something</p>

               <p>about the police, when he said, "Ah, a pretty figure you would appear in the papers before all your friends as a d----d s—d"—I did not reply to that, and he said, throwing the cloak on the bed, "Well, we will say nothing more of that; if you will bring me the sovereign you shall have the cloak, but you must let me have something more to keep till you bring me the sovereign; "and upon my again assuring him that I really had nothing more about me, and in feeling my waistcoat-pockets at the same time, my under-coat flew open, or I opened it myself, and he spied two shirt-studs which I had, and also a ring which I had on my finger—he immediately demanded them—but I stood out for those, and said, "No<lb/>thing shall induce me to part with these"—he said, "Well, well, I do not wish to be hard upon you; you will bring me the sovereign I am sure, won't you?"—I said, "I will, but I am sure I will not bring it to this place"—he then asked me whether I would bring it to the Piazza, where we had met in the evening—I said I would—he asked me whether I would come on Thursday, and I, thinking it was then Tuesday evening instead of Monday, (and wishing to gain time if I took any advice,) said I should be out on Thursday, but would come on Friday—he then came round in a more familiar manner (he had been walking about)—he stirred the fire and patted or touched me on the shoulder, saying, "I am sure I can depend on your coming, my good fellow"—he then said we would go and get something to drink, and he unlocked the door, but did not put on his hat—he accompanied me down stairs, and again reminded me of the appointment on Friday evening, and we parted—next morning I went to a friend, who was an attorney, on my way to the Custom House, but he had not come to his office—I went to the Custom House, and got away a little earlier than usual, and went to a friend, a barrister in Gray's Inn, for ad<lb/>vice, and I went immediately to Marlborough-street police-office—the Magis<lb/>trates had separated, and I went to the house of the senior Magistrate, Mr. Dyer, who told me to come to the office next morning, and he there granted me a warrant against the prisoner, and introduced me to Schofield the officer, who went with me down to the neighbourhood of the theatres—Schofield directed me to walk before him—after walking some time, I fancied I saw the prisoner at some distance before me in a M'Intosh cloak—Schofield gave me directions how to act, and in another street, close by there, I purposely brushed up against him, and came in contact with him—on our recognising each other, he said, "Yes, here I am, and in your cloak, too"—I made signs to Schofield, and he came up and took the prisoner—he then denied ever having seen me before, and said the cloak was his own—I can positively swear to the cloak he had on being mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sub-sorter of letters in the twopenny post-office. The male prisoner was an inspector of letter-carriers in the twopenny post department—he inspected the carriers of the principal office, which embraces the city, also the south and east part—he was, generally speaking, inspector of twopenny post carriers—letters are frequently mis<lb/>sorted from the inland to the twopenny post-office—that sometimes happens with letters franked by Members of Parliament—there are several Bath-streets in the twopenny post delivery—if a letter got into the twopenny post-office by mistake, it ought to be sent back to the inland office by putting it into a box which stands before us, and the stamper takes it out into the inland office—if we discovered it in sorting, it would be returned through the tunnel, but if it went further, it would be sent in a box; if we misread the direction for London, it would be sent out in the hands of the letter-carrier; and if he took it out, it would be his duty to return it the next time he came—it would come into the office again in time for the mail at night, to go to Leamington—on the evening of the 31st of October the prisoner was one of the inspectors on duty, until about a quarter to seven o'clock; from ten o'clock in the morning, and on the following day also—during that time he had constant access to the sorting office—if a letter had been brought back, having been wrongly sent, it would be delivered to him if it was after ten o'clock—the letter-carrier would bring it—some letters come in before ten o'clock—they are delivered to the senior inspectors, Mr. Burt and Mr. Till.</p>

I was on duty there on the 31st of October, from seven o'clock in the morning till eight o'clock at night—a letter put in on the 31st, and sent to the twopenny post that evening, would not come under my observation at all—the mistake would not be communicated to me that evening, if it was dis<lb/>covered—I have heard the prisoner direct the letter-carriers how to indorse their bank-notes, when there was any going to be paid into the Treasury through the charge-takers—there is a direction by the receiver-general about their being indorsed across the middle of the notes—it is those instruc<lb/>tions I have heard the prisoner give—if a letter is discovered by the sorter to be mis-sorted into the twopenny post-office, it would be sent to the in<lb/>land office—but if it came out being read London, and it got into the letter-carrier's hands, to be delivered, he would not bring it to the office till ten or eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Allen Mason, and Mr. Longman, wharfingers, in Upper Thames-street. Last Monday week we had thirty-three bags of linen rags on the premises, and about a little before six o'clock that evening the private watchman missed a bag—I had seen it a few minutes before four o'clock myself—I went to a place near Queenhithe, and saw the prisoner Brooks and another person, and was induced to go to Blofield's shop, which is about three minutes' walk form our premises—I saw him there with a boy, and asked him if he had bought a bag of rags, describing what rags they were—he said, no, he had not—I told him I knew he had, and then he said he had—I asked him to let me see them—he would not—I then called the patrol in, who was outside, and we went down stairs—I picked out a bag of rags there, and told him that was my master's property—he said, "That is the bag I have bought"—I asked him what sort of a man brought them—he gave me a description which agreed with that given by our private watchman—I went and took Brooks into custody, and took him in to Blofield, who said, "That is the man who brought the bag to my shop, and the man I paid the money to"—a woman who I suppose was his wife said, "That is the man who brought the rags, but you paid the money to a taller man."—he said, "Let me alone, I know what I am about"—Brooks said "It is false, Mr. Blofield, I have not been in your shop to-day"—they were then taken into custody—Nash was taken up last Saturday—he is a Porter, and so is Brooks—I have employed Brooks occasionally for my master—I have not the least doubt of the bag or rags being my employer's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and live in Wardour-street, Soho; the prisoner was my porter for three years. On the 2nd of Decem<lb/>ber I sent him down for a shilling's-worth of wood—he took the basket from the shop, and went below, he brought the basket of wood into the shop, and put it in front of the counter—while I was making out the bill of this wood and some other articles, I told him to go to the top of War<lb/>dour-street with a bottle of ketchup—while he was gone I examined the basket, and found in it 12lbs. of candles, and 2lbs. of gum—they had been be<lb/>low stairs, so that he could take them, and the wood was at the top of them—when he came back I desired him to go and take the wood to Poland-street, but not to mind taking the bill—as soon as he got out I called him back, and told him he had been robbing me—he begged for forgiveness, and hoped I should not prosecute him—I gave him in charge—this is the property.</p>

I proceeded to Captain Agar's house at Woodstock, and there saw the prisoner, and told him I was sent down by his Lordship to take him into custody, on a charge of robbery—I searched his boxes, and found these books, and the keys, and several other things—he did not give any account of them—I brought him to London—on the way to the watch-house he stated that he had given two papers of tobacco to a female—the next morning he stated he had taken the books of his Lordship, and the keys, but he had made no use of the keys.</p>

No. 83, Houndsditch, on the evening of the 12th of December, about five minutes before five o'clock, and saw the four prisoner following a cart with the tail-board—they were on the pavement—they passed close by me—I immediately followed the cart and went to the watch-house for assistance—I then went to Wormwood-street after the cart—I overtook it, and found one of the chests gone, and the prisoners still following it, but I missed Chivers—before I came to the cart a second time I saw them all turn the corner of the street together—I had seen Chivers not half a minute before—they were so following it, that the act of one must have been seen by the other three—I seized Mahoney first and gave him to Darlington, and then I seized Cook—Fuller was on the other side—I said to a gentleman, "There is another one, stop him, Sir, if you please, "—he up with his umbrella and tried to stop him, but he ran and got as far as Houndsditch before he was stopped—I was not present when he was taken.</p>

On the 9th of November I was at Blackfriars-bridge, between one and two o'clock, and perceived a crowed pushing me—I heard some one say, "Push him up," or <hi rend="italic">"Shove</hi> him up"—I turned and saw the prisoner, and two other men, more respectably dressed than himself, were close to me—I looked at then very hard, and they at me—I shifted about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards—again was looking through the balustrades at the procession, and I felt some persons pushing on me, and I heard some one say, "Have you got it?"—another said, "You"—a third voice said, "Hand it over to me"—I felt my pocket, and my purse was gone—it contained 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—they were all sovereigns—I immediately turned round, and saw the same three men close to me again—the prisoner was one, and I am sure he was one of those I had seen before—I looked at them very hard, and they at me—they seemed as if they were in conversation, but seeing me look at them they dispersed—two went one way, and the prisoner the other—I followed close to his heels for a distance, expecting to see an officer, but not seeing one, I collared him, and accused him of picking my pocket—he said he had not, but finding I held him, he said, "Loose me, go with me, and you shall be all right, I have money in my pocket"—I told him I should not loose him till I had my money, I should either have him or my money—a struggle then ensued, and he threw himself out of any hands, but I immediately got hold of him again—at that time an officer came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JENNER</hi>. I left town on the afternoon of the 21st of July, and went to Mr. Dyke's at Chiselhurst—on the following morning I heard that a person had called at Mr. Dyke's house, and in consequence of what was told me I went to the Queen's-head at Chiselhurst, and found the prisoner there—I do not think he mentioned his name to me at the time—I was shown into the room, and I said, "Mr. Black I believe?"—he bowed—I told him I was in want of money, as he would perceive by my letter—he asked me what sum—I replied 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one twelve month—I told him I had no security to offer him, except my own personal security—he replied, that he knew, of course, Sir Herbert Jenner, and inquired of me how I should be able to repay it—I told him my income was such as to allow of my paying the sum at the end of the year—I believe I mentioned to him pretty nearly what my income was—he then told me I could have the money, and appointed to meet me the following morning at twelve o'clock at my father's house in Chesterfield-street—it was arranged that I was to have the use of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your letter states that you wished to raise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will ex<lb/>plain that—at the time I wrote the letter, I mentioned it as a nominal sum, that I might know what the expense would be, not having made up my mind exactly at the time I wrote, what sum exactly I should wish—I came to town the next day, which was Saturday, the 23rd, to Chesterfield-street, to my father's house—the prisoner came there a few minutes after the time appointed—I was coming down stairs at the time he arrived, and I showed him into a room—there was nobody present but ourselves—after a little conversation about the weather, or some trivial thing of that kind, I asked him whether he had brought the money—I do not think he made any answer to that, but he pulled out a pocket-book, and took from thence a stamped piece of paper—he wrote something on it—he was sitting at the table, and there were writing materials there—I could not distinguish what it was he wrote at that time—he wrote it at the upper left-hand corner of the paper as I was looking at it, above the stamp on the left-hand—he then handed it to me, and requested me to write on it, "accepted," and my name—I did so—this is the stamped paper, and the acceptance I then wrote on it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) I also wrote the words" At Bank of England"—I had no ac<lb/>count at the Bank of England at that time, but the prisoner requested me to make it payable there—I did not notice what he had written in the corner of the paper when I wrote the acceptance—I do not remember whether I noticed any thing there—while I was writing the acceptance the prisoner was filling up what appeared to me a Bank of England cheque—an engraved form of cheque of the Bank of England—I could only distinguish one word accurately, which he wrote on it, which was, "Blake"—he then told me it was necessary his brother should also put his name to the cheque, and that he would leave me for the purpose of obtaining his brother's signature to it—I took up my acceptance off the table, saying, "Of course, then, yes will leave this with me till you return"—he replied that that was unneces<lb/>sary, and said, "To show you that there can be nothing wrong, here are the figures denoting 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. written in the corner"—at that time I had the ac<lb/>ceptance in my hand—I then looked at the corner, and observed "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and I think two O's written for shillings and pence, I believe so—they were figures clearly denoting 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had observed the prisoner writing on the stamp—that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must have been written before I wrote my acceptance—it was then agreed he should meet me at the Bank Coffee-house in half an hour, and I permitted him to go with the Bill of Exchange—I went to the Bank Coffee-house, but the prisoner did not appear according to appoint<lb/>ment—I saw no more of him for some time—I attended at Bow-street when this matter was inquired into, and saw a person named Edwards there, who was examined as a witness—I never gave Edwards any description of the person who obtained the bill from me, before I got to Bow-street, I had never seen Edwards before I saw him there.</p>

               <p>a bill payable there gave it additional credit—I would have made it payable any where the prisoner desired me—I do not know that I should have made it payable at the house of a private individual—my letter ex<lb/>pressed a desire for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when we met in Chesterfield-street he gave me a blank stamp, on which I wrote the acceptance—at that time I do not re<lb/>collect that I observed any figures at the corner—I laid it on the table after I accepted it, and he took it up, the paper was in my hand when he said, "You may see it is right by the figures in the corner." and I then closely inspected it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you meant to accept only for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., why did you not write "Ac<lb/>cepted for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner gave me the form of my acceptance—I have accepted a bill before—I was not totally ignorant of the mode of accepting—I never accepted a blank piece of paper in this way before, and have only accepted one bill before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Fairlawn-house, Hammersmith. I know the prisoner—I knew him before the month of August last—I met him in the early part of August, accidentally, in Compton-street—he told me he had an acceptance of Mr. Jenner's for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he wished me to buy—he did not tell me who Mr. Jenner was at that time—I declined buying the bill then—I met him on other occasions afterwards on the same subject, and I ultimately agreed to purchase the bill for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I think I first saw the acceptance on the 12th of August, the day I agreed to purchase it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) it was then perfectly blank except the acceptance "Accepted C. H. Jenner, at the Bank of England"—there was a stamp on it—I noticed that the left hand upper corner, near the stamp, appeared to he stained, and asked him how it came to be stained in that manner—he told me it was as he had received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you agreed to give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for it, what was to be done to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was to be drawn and indorsed by the prisoner for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me Elliott had received the bill from Mr. Jenner—I told him I had heard he had offered the bill to others—he told me he had only offered it to Cook—I think this must have been on the 12th of August—I had been in the habit of meeting the prisoner at a public-house at the cor<lb/>ner of a court leading from Jermyn-street to Piccadilly—I met him there next day, the 13th, by appointment, and he there produced the acceptance in the same blank state in which I had seen it before, and on that occa<lb/>sion I paid him a £50 Bank note and two cheques, for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—I at that time kept an account at the London and Westminster Bank, and at Charles King and Co's., 24, Bolton-street—these are the two cheques I gave him—one is dated the 15th, and the other the 17th—I dated them forwards—(<hi rend="italic">the cheques being read, were one for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the London and Westminster Bank, dated the 15th of August, and the other August 17th on King and Co. for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I was to give the prisoner 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more if the bill was paid on maturity, or in the event of my getting fresh security—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was to be paid for the contingency, and if it was honoured I was to give more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if paid you would gain 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not suppose that probable—the prisoner then delivered me the blank acceptance—I kept it, I</p>

               <p>suppose about ten days—at the end of that time I met the prisoner again, and I gave him back the blank acceptance to have it drawn and indorsed—met him again next day at the same public-house; he then produced the blank acceptance, with the signature of "C. Taylor" on it, as drawer and indorser—that was all the addition that was made—"C. Taylor" is in the right-hand corner—I asked him who C. Taylor was—he told me he was a man living with him, and that he had given him a sovereign for signing the bill—I requested him to draw the body of the bill, and he did so—he drew it, "London, August 20, 1836. Two Months after date, pay to my order, Five Hundred Pounds, value received: To the Rev. C. H. Jenner, No. 1, Chesterfield-street, May-fair, "—he did that in my presence—he produced this note to me, I think, * on that occasion—I had made some question as to the bill being for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked him to satisfy me that it was for that sum—I had observed the stain in the corner, and did not know what it might allude to—he then produced this letter—I cannot exactly say the conversation which passed, but he produced the letter as corroborating that it was to be for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said so, and he delivered the letter to me and left it with me—I have since delivered it to the attorney for the prosecution—the address of Mr. Jenner is affixed to the left-hand corner of the bill, (where I observed the stain) with wafers—the bill was drawn by Hart at two months after date—I saw him again the day it became due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came that piece of paper to be affixed to the left-hand corner of the bill with wafers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner went from me to No. 1, Chester<lb/>field-street, to inquire the address of Mr. Jenner—I did not go with him—he went away, as for the address, and when he returned he produced this piece of paper, on which is written, "Rev. C. H. Jenner, Rectory, near Cardiff."—it was written very illegibly, with very pale ink, and I passed my pen over it to make it plainer—the prisoner affixed it to the corner of the bill—the bill was then in the state in which it is at present, with the exception of the two following indorsements—I know a person named Atkinson—this indorsement of "George Atkinson," is his writing—it was done at my request—the other indorsement is my own—the object in doing that was to give a greater currency to it—I afterwards applied to Mr. Jenner for payment of the bill, and learnt the circumstances under which it had been obtained; in consequence of which I attended before the Magistrate at Bow-street, and delivered the bill up to the attorney for the prosecution.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or it <hi rend="italic">was to be</hi> for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was <hi rend="italic">to be</hi> for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no amount on it at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of his Majesty's mint. I frequently have to examine, with great minuteness, different instruments and coins—since I have been in Court, at the request of the prosecutors, I have examined this bill of exchange—I perceive, in the corner of it, an appearance of a stain—to the best of my judgment, it is such a stain as might be produced by the use of an acid—by looking at it with a magnifying glass, it appears to me that the first figure, which now forms a 5, has been altered—I see the stain perfectly—I do not perceive any mark where the stain is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does examining coin give you any knowledge of paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. No, I do not mean to say it does—I have looked at the paper with a magnifying glass—I cannot see any marks above the figures, where the great portion of the stain is, but it appears to me there is a different coloured ink forming the portion of the 5—some colour forming one part of it, and some colour another—and I think that what is now the figure 5, originally formed part of another figure.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been many years a practical chemist. The stain at the corner of this piece of paper is from an experiment I made, to ascer<lb/>tain if an said had been applied there—there was some mark on it, I be<lb/>lieve,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120058"/>
               <p>before I made the experiment—the red mark is in consequence of my experiment—there was a stain on it when I first examined it, but no red stain—I am positive an acid has been applied to that corner of the paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The stain now actually on the paper was made by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In consequence of applying test-paper that very small red mark remains—if a drop of vinegar is put into a wine-glass of water, and you dip this paper into, it will come out red—the least atom of an acid is indicated by this paper—I am confident acid has been applied to that spot—I did not try the paper in my other part, but to that mere portion of the corner where you observe a small red mark left—the smallest portion of acid will affect this paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that many paper-makers use acid in the pulp to make their papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They use the oxymuriatic acid, which is very differ<lb/>ent from all others, and will not show the same colour—besides, it does not remain in the paper after manufacture—having bleached the rags, there is no more acid remaining—it is used merely in bleaching the rags.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although that is the proper course, do you not know that many of them also use the diluted vitriolic acid, by way of speedy bleaching? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to remain in the paper, it would rot it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CURWOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a visible stain before you applied the test? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly there was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the acid you imagine has been used, would it have the effect of effacing ink marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly it would.</p>

On Wednesday, the 30th of November, I was on duty about half past eleven o'clock in the morning at a place called Whitehall, in St. Giles's. I went through a passage through a house into a paved yard, at the end of which was a ladder, which led to a sort of landing—I went up to the top, opened the door, went into the room, and saw the four prisoners there—the door was just ajar—when I opened it, I bolted it—when I went in Loveland was standing by the fire, and Seymour was sitting in a chair opposite the fire, without any shoes, stockings, or coat on, close against the fire—Green was sitting in a chair at a table, with his back towards the fire, mending a shoe, which he put on afterward—Spencer was standing against the window with his face towards the fire, about ten or eleven feet from it—the fire was on one side, and the window on the other—the room was about twelve feet by eleven—when I went into the room Loveland began to stir the fire—I ran up to him, caught hold of him, and said, "Halloo, what are you doing here?"—I was</p>

               <p>in my uniform—I pulled him away, and he dropped this piece of white metal on the floor, and put his foot on it—I did not see it till it dropped—I pushed him on one side, and picked it up—it was quite hot—I was ob<lb/>liged to put it out of one hand into the other—I put it into my pocket, and then looked on the mantelpiece, where I saw this mould, and alongside it, this piece of metal, which appears to have been coloured—the mould was wrapped in a rag—I then looked round the room, and picked up four more pieces of metal in different parts of the room, on the floor, near the fire-place—Green was sitting in a chair within about two feet of one of the pieces—I then turned down the bed, and in it found a clean shirt—I said, "Who does this belong to?"—Seymour (who I knew by the name of Dodman) said "It is mine"—while he was putting it on I went to the table where Green was sitting at work, and found these two pieces of metal, and two pieces of blue stone—I searched Spencer, but found nothing on him—I asked him where he lived—he said in Cleveland-street—I asked what brought him there—he said he had come with a message from Green's brother—I found on Loveland a pennypiece, four halfpence, and one sixpence, all good money; a shilling on Green, and nothing on Seymour—I then picked up the old shirt which Seymour had pulled of, and out of it dropped this cloth and five pieces of metal, imitating penny<lb/>pieces, and one piece of metal separate—he had the opportunity of wrap<lb/>ping them up in the shirt while I was searching the other prisoners—I said, "Well, Mr. Dodman, how do you account for this?"—he said, "Why, I am not obliged to say any thing that will hurt myself"—I said, "No, cer<lb/>tainly not; what you have to say you had better say to the Magistrate'—I said, "Now, my lads, you must all get ready, and go with me to Marylebone"—Dodman said, "Why, you are not going to take us all yourself, are you?"—I said "No, I have plenty more below waiting for you"—before this I had said to Green, "You seem to live here, perhaps you can account for these things being here?"—he said, "I shall say they were brought here"—I then tied them together with their own handker-chiefs, and took them to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to his Majesty's mint, and have been so many years. The first article produced is a piece of lead which has been cast in the mould I hold in my hand, which piece is intended to represent a current penny—it is not coloured, but it is cast in this plaster of Paris mould, and bears the impression of the two sides of a penny<lb/>piece—I have no doubt it has been used, from the appearance of it: and these five impressions have all been cast in it, by the spray—the mould has been broken, and the imperfection in the mould is visible in the cast—here is one, which appears to have had some attempt at colouring made on it, but very badly—this blue stone is sulphate of copper—I am not aware that it would give a coppery appearance to the lead—it would produce a copper colour on iron, but not on lead that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>(The Jury, upon applying the blue stone on the lead, found it did give the lead a coppery appearance—The Court ruled that this offence was not within the Statute; copper coin in a state of preparation not being men<lb/>tioned.)</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 22nd of November, about six o'clock, I saw Rosser, who lodges where I do, with a very large dark-looking bag on his back—it would hold a bushel or a bushed and a half—he took it down from his shoulder and put it into a cupboard—I asked what he had got there—he said he had got some wood—I told him it was no such thing as I saw it was not that—I considered it was poultry—I told him to take it out and take it away altogether—I saw him take it out of the house—I asked whether he worked by night instead of day—I afterwards examined the bag, and found it contained a very large and dark turkey, almost black—I should imagine that was about two miles from Miss Mayow's—Rosser was not in bed when I came home that bight at half-past nine o'clock—he came in in an hour and a half after.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the constable of Lewisham. I received in<lb/>formation of the twelve turkeys being taken—I apprehended Rosser at Bromley on Monday evening, the 28th of November—I told him I wanted him for stealing Miss Mayow's turkeys—he said he had not stolen them, or words to that effect—I took him to the cage—on the following morning I went to take him before the Magistrate, and he said he wished to say some<lb/>thing to me—I told him not to say any thing that would criminate himself, it might be used against him—he said it was a bad job, he should not have done it if he had not been drunk—he said that him and Cowper, and a man named <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> (he did not know his other name) had been drinking at Brom<lb/>ley</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120073"/>
               <p>and they went to one of the beer-shops at Bell-green, Sydenham—he did not know which—that they went from there, (he did not know the hour,) over the fields to the back of Miss Mayow's premises, and found the turkeys there, and they took them; but he said they went to Cowper's house first, and got a bag and a smock-frock—they took the turkeys to Southend, and put one bag in a field at the back of the houses, and the other bag, with six turkeys, he took home—he left them in the field first, and then went and brought them in; and Sealey challenged him about having that property, and told him if he did not take the things out of the house imme<lb/>diately he would send for a constable—then about eight o'clock he took the six turkeys, with the bag, up the road; but I should say, prior to his taking it out he saw a brewer's drayman, and told him he was in a good deal of trouble, and wanted him to take the bag; that he fetched it out, and put it on the shafts, and told the drayman to take it away and do what he liked with it, and the other six he waited till after dark, and took them to Lewisham Bridge, and threw them into the water—I had the prisoners in separate cages, and on the Friday morning I went to Lee cage to fetch Cowper out to take him before the Magistrate, and when I went to fetch him, and the other man who was with him, Cowper wished to speak to me, I told him out to say any thing to me, as I did not want to hear him say any thing to criminate himself—he said he understood that Rosser had told all about it, and it was useless for him to deny it—he said it was a bad job, and he should not have done it if he had not been drunk—we were talking about the turkeys then, I said, "How could you be such a fool as to get into such a mess?"—he said, "Rosser told me he had got a market for them, or otherwise I should not have gone there."</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Lambeth Water-works Company. I was present on the 7th when the money was marked, and on Tuesday the 8th, I saw the marks, and put them into the cash-box—this sovereign and half-sovereign part are of it—there were nine sovereign and three half-sovereigns marked and put into it—I gave the key to my clerk, Thomas Casey—the box was put into Casey's desk, the lock of which was imperfect and wanted repairing, and it was not locked—Casey came about nine o'clock next morning—I told him to get the box and put it on my desk, which he did—he gave me the key, and I opened it, I be<lb/>lieve, and a sovereign and a half were deficient from the marked money—I saw the prisoner in the office about one o'clock that day—I believe nobody was present but the policeman and himself, but the clerk and others case in two or three minutes—I told him to lay all the money he had in his pockets on the table before the policeman—he did so, and there were, I think, two sovereigns, besides this sovereign and a half-sovereign, and some silver—I examined it, and found this sovereign and half-sovereign were those I had marked—I desired the policeman to take him into an inner room, and examined him, and in about five minutes he came out of the room, and produced a key, which he tried, and it opened the cash<lb/>box instantly, much easier than the right key—the prisoner has been in the service of the company five years and three quarters—he has been my house-servant as well, and knew the house perfectly well—the box was always kept under lock and key by Mr. Casey—it was purchased for the exclusive use of the company's money, for the balance left there at night—all the sovereigns and half-sovereigns were similarly marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Leuid Goose, and live in Caroline-buildings, Lambeth. On the night of the 10th of December, I went with him to the Marsh-gate public-house, inn the Westminster-road between eleven and twelve o'clock—the prisoner and several other per<lb/>sons were there—I knew him by sight before—the prisoner said to my husband "Will you stand some gin?"—my husband said "No"—I counted my money out into a bit of paper, at the same time, because I was going to put it separate from 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I was going to spend in tea and sugar that evening—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when my husband refused to give any gin, the prisoner said, "You b—I will serve you out for it"—I then went out, and my husband followed me—when he came out he was struck by the prisoner several times—I could not perceive that the pri<lb/>soner was intoxicated—he struck my husband in the head and in the face mostly—a great many persons had followed us out of the public-house, and the prisoner was one—when we got to the Marsh-gate, my husband was hit again and stunned—he staggered, he had no sense in him—he was perfectly sober—a man, who is not in custody, said, "Now then, the left"—that man had hit my husband before, and knocked him down seve<lb/>ral times—the prisoner then seized my hand directly, and snatched the money away from it, saying, "Let go, you b----" he wrenched open the the hand, and run away immediately—I lost my boa at the time, but I do not charge the prisoner with that—the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing me counting my money at the public-house—I saw him look at me at the time. I am certain he saw me counting it, but I do not know that he knew the amount—he stood right before me, looking at me—my hus<lb/>band was greatly ill-used—they fractured his jaw—he lost nothing—I am certain what I have said is correct—he took from my hand 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was wrapped in a bit of newspaper.</p>

               <p>between eleven and twelve o'clock, with my wife—there were several men and woman there—the prisoner knew me before—he asked me to give him some gin—I did not answer him at first—he asked me again, and I said I should not—he then asked me again whether I would not stand a quarter—I said I should not; I did not see why I should stand gin for him—he then began to have words, and I told my wife we had better go out—she was putting some money into a piece of newspaper which was open in her hand—my wife went out first, and when I got to the door I received two violent blows in my mouth from the prisoner—they were fol<lb/>lowed up close—I was afterwards struck by several more persons when I go out—I was hit to a stand still, and my mouth was all in a gore of blood—a number of persons gathered round me—the prisoner followed with them—he walked alongside of me, and said if I had stood the gin the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> would not have happened—I had then got about a hundred yards from the public-house, towards my home—I was knocked down several times—I was then very near a hundred yards from the Marsh-gate—the Marsh-gate is nearly two hundred yards from the public-house, and I was about half-way from each—they wanted to drag me down a dark lane there—they said, "Bring the b----down here, and murder the b----down the lane"—they said that once I had them in my power, but I could not help myself—(I once belonged to the police)—with that somebody came up behind me and struck me with his fist, or something else, and fractured my jaw with the blow—I could not see what the blow was inflicted with—as soon as I could recover myself I was obliged to make my escape, for the mob was so strong on me—I did not fall from the blow—I went all <hi rend="italic">ajaw</hi> into the road—I went down through the gate—I was not knocked down—I gathered myself up—my hands were grazed—after I received the blow in the face I fell sprawling into the road, off the foot-path, on both my hands—I gathered up my hat and ran away, and the mob after me—I went home and stripped myself, for I was smothered in blood and mud—I changed my coat and hat, and then came back to look after my wife at the Marsh-gate—I was absent about an hour—I found her with a policeman at the Marsh—gate turnpike—she had no boa on then—she had had one when we left the public-house—I had given her the money on the Saturday evening, and saw the silver in her hand at the public-house—I have known the prisoner a long while while I was in the police—he never interfered with me, and I never had a word with him—I have since ascertained he was in liquor, or else I do not think he would have done it—he was always civil, and since I have been out I have been in the habit of seeing him every day—I com<lb/>plained directly to the police—my wife mentioned the prisoner, I believe, to the police, the same night, but not in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the only son of Hannah Owen, deceased, she lived in Arlington-street, Lambeth.

               <p>ask whether the will may be considered legal—I do it from a point of conscience, but the will has never been proved—I had been absent from my mother nearly seven weeks before her death, and very probably there might be such a thing as that my mother might give the prisoner some things—my conscience between God and my soul, is every thing—the bar of man is nothing but the bar of God is all in all—I have see the gowns, brushes, and other things—I have great reason to believe they were my mother's—I saw my mother seven weeks previous to her death—she died the last day of November—I had not been near the house but once for three or four months—I have reason to believe she was not right in her mind—she would order one thing to be done, and then in two or three minutes she would contradict it, and such a person could not be right in her senses—all I can do is to swear to the property—I cannot say whether my mother gave her liberty to pawn them—she was in distress at times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and in the general line, and live in Amelia-street, Walworth-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On Thursday evening, the 1st of December, I missed a trunk from my bed-room, containing plate and money, there were 10 sovereigns, and upwards of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, twenty-one spoons, three watches, one gold, one silver, and one metal, some papers, and a pocket-book—I stated the amount as upwards of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as I did not know—Francis Shearman is my nephew, he had access to my house, but had not been there upwards of a fortnight—he had before that—he knew the situation of my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the nephew of Thomas Shearman, and am thirteen years old—I had been in the habit of being at my uncle's house—I remember meeting the two prisoners about three weeks ago—I knew them by sight a little—they asked me if I knew any of my friends whom I thought that they could rob—after some persuasion, I told them about my uncle—this took place in a house in St. Giles's-street—Noble and Dubes took me there—Noble said I had better go to my uncle's on Wed<lb/>nesday—I agreed to do so—I slept in their place that night—I went to my uncle's on Wednesday—Dubes said at first I had better go on Saturday, but Noble said on Wednesday—I went about half-past five o'clock to a public-house in the next street to my uncle's—we remained there about five minutes—when they came out Noble stood at the top of the street, and Dubes came and stood opposite to my uncle's door, and he told me to go up and get the box (I had told them that there was something in a box—the door was on the jar, and) I went in, and went up and got the box, and brought it down, and Dubes took it from me—I got it from the side of the bed in my uncle's room—Noble was at the top of the street, within sight—Dubes carried the box as far as Blackfriars-bridge, and then, Noble carried it—while Dubes carried it, Noble and I walked on the other side of the way—Noble said they had better not go through the City with it, they might be known and stopped—we were going to take it to Moore's house—we took it to St. Giles's, where we had slept, and Dubes broke it open with a piece of iron that they use for a poker—there were two girls in the room at the time—there were some spoons, I believe, wrapped up in a paper, but Dubes put them into his pocket, and the milk-pot too, and Noble put the gold into his pocket—he took it up so quick that I could not see what it was—there were sovereigns—I saw nothing else—there were three watches, a gold one, a silver one, and a metal one, and we had one a-piece—I had the gold one and Noble the silver one—after that they told the girls to burn the paper and the box, and we went down and took a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and rode a little below Leather-lane, and we got out, Noble and Dubes went into Mr. Alexander's, which is one the right-hand side down Field-lane, with the plate—I stood opposite the door, and Mr. Alexander stood at the door—and then a woman came and looked our—and then Mr. Alexander came and looked out, and then he went into</p>
