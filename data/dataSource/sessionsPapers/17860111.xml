               <p>(The case opened by Mr. Garrow.)</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury: It becomes my duty to state to you as shortly as possible, the circumstances of this case. Gentlemen, you have collected from the indictment, which has been distinctly read to you, that the charge against the prisoner is that of a murder, committed by a violence almost unexampled; this unfortunate young woman was <rs id="t17860111-1-viclabel5" type="occupation">servant</rs>

                        targets="t17860111-1-victim50 t17860111-1-viclabel5"/> to Mr. Orrell, an attorney, by whose activity and ability which is very singular, the prisoner is now brought before you; the prisoner was a porter to Mr. Chapman, a cabinet maker; in April last he had occasion in that capacity, to go to the house of Mr. Orrell with chairs; it appears since from the conversation of the deceased, that the prisoner asked her for something to drink, for some water or small beer, this was the first conversation he had with her, she then good naturedly gave him some, he thanked her, and told her he would bring her a ribbon, he accordingly brought her one, and he apologised that it was not quite so good as he wished, but that on some other day he would bring her a better; this caused a degree of intimacy, and in short it appears, that upon every Sunday from that time, to the time of the poor woman's death, this man constantly watched an opportunity of visiting this unfortunate servant in the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Orrell: on the Sunday of the death, Mr. and Mrs. Orrell having dined at home, they afterwards went out to take a walk in the fields, they were not gone very long, not quite an hour, they left the young woman at home, apparently in very good health and spirits, she had done part of the business of the day, and was left at home to go on with the remainder; when they returned they knocked at the door, nobody answered; they knocked again repeatedly, and loudly, but still nobody answering they went to church, when they came back they could not get in then, and they were quite astonished, as the girl was a careful honest sober person; however, Mr. Orrell went to the next door, and asked them to let him get in over the leads, he then came and let in Mrs. Orrell, and she had the misfortune first to go down into the kitchen, and there a spectacle, as dreadful as ever presented itself to the human eye, appeared before her: this young woman was sitting on the floor, reclining on the two corner walls of the kitchen; Mrs. Orrell was much affrighted, and instantly ran to inform her husband; on his going down he will describe the miserable object he beheld; this unfortunate young woman had her throat cut from ear to ear, her breast cut in many places, one of her arms broke, and one of her fingers broke, and a dreadful fracture upon her scull; in short, the most miserable object that can be conceived: Gentlemen, the first suspicion was that this poor woman must have destroyed herself, however that could not possibly consist with all the circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110004"/> I have now stated to you, and they found in the house a house broom, which appeared to be bloody, it was sprinkled with blood, they concluded that from that the fracture of the head had come; they found on the next day the blade of a razor which had been thrown on the fire, and in a tub in the kitchen they found one of the silver spoons, which the person who had committed the murder had stolen, but had left it there, having washed his hands. The poor woman was not dead, she appeared to have some remains of sense; but indeed if her sense had enabled her to make any representation, my Lord will tell you, you would not much rely upon it, in the state in which her mind was: Mr. Orrell immediately insisted on an enquiry how this could possibly happen, and then he was for the first time acquainted with those visits, and it was discovered that a man of the complexion of the prisoner at the bar, had been seen in the street about the time of Mr. Orrell's leaving his house, he had been laying about in the street, and a milkman will describe to you some very particular observations that he made upon him; but I must draw your attention to one: Gentlemen, in circumstantial cases very often, very small and trifling events, as they seem when they stand alone, become a vast body of evidence when connected with others; the milkman observed that this black fellow had a large nosegay composed of cabbage roses, and in the kitchen where this poor woman was found murdered was such a nosegay: Gentlemen, the prisoner on this and some other circumstances, was apprehended, he was examined before a magistrate, and he was discharged; he afterwards came to this bar to be tried for a felony, and he was sentenced to be transported; and Mr. Orrell, whose attention has been awake from the moment of the murder to this time, he examined the Sessions Paper, and he found that the evidence against him, was that of a pawnbroker, who received some of the goods that he had stolen; he went to that pawnbroker, and in his custody he found a cloak of Mrs. Orrell's, that had been stolen at the time of the murder, which these people had received from a woman on the Monday morning after the robbery and murder, who lived with the prisoner at the bar, of course that woman was applied to, and the story she told, was that she received that cloak from the prisoner on the morning after the murder, he took it from under the bed, and told her he had bought it, and was to pay for it by weekly payments; she likewise said that when he came home on the Sunday evening, after having just been out the space of time sufficient to have committed the murder, he desired her to get him a kettle of water, for he wanted to wash his coat, it was bloody, he told her he had been fighting, and she washed it; when he was first apprehended there was some marks of blood on his waistcoat, the fingers of his right hand were cut: when he was before the magistrate, as it was suspected that this poor woman had made a very strong resistance, and this man's fingers had been cut with a razor; he was asked how his fingers came to be so cut, and he said it was done by a knife in the trimming of chairs; now it turns out that the knife with which they trim the chairs must of necessity be blunt, for it is only to take off the glue; but Mr. Orrell, whose ingenuity upon the occasion cannot be too much applauded, gave him a knife out of his pocket, and desired him to shew him how it happened; the man took the knife in his right hand, he being a right handed man, and could not therefore cut his hand in that way, he said he had had these wounds a fortnight, but upon the examination of the surgeon, it was found that these wounds bled afresh, and had been very lately received: Gentlemen, these are a part of the circumstances, and a part only to bring the guilt of this murder home to the prisoner at the bar: I have stated these things to you, because as there is a confession to be proved to you, by a person who knowing of the murder afterwards, had concealed it for some time, it is necessary that she should be confirmed by other circumstances; if she is believed, there can be no question of the guilt of the prisoner: Gentlemen, to this woman the prisoner has confessed the murder, she has lost some degree of credit most certainly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110005"/> but she will be restored, if you find her confirmed by other witnesses of credit and reputation. The circumstances that will be proved before you are these; to shew that this man was acquainted with the deceased, and visited her for a considerable length of time, in the absence of the family, and on that very Sunday, he was seen in this neighbourhood; on the very day after, in the morning, the cloak stolen by the person committing the murder, together with other things, was pledged by a hand carrying it from the prisoner: These are some of the circumstances of the case; but I had rather you should hear the whole case from the witnesses; and if you are satisfied with the evidence, it is your duty, without passion and without prejudice, to find the prisoner guilty; but unless you are satisfied he committed the murder, however atrocious, however shocking it was, it certainly ought not to be charged to him; if, on the other hand, you are convinced that he is guilty, it will be very fortunate that society should be rid of a man so perfectly destitute of all humanity, and whose conduct has been the most barbarous that ever came before a Court of Justice for their enquiry.</p>

               <p>Mr. ORRELL sworn.</p>

               <p>The unfortunate deceased woman was my servant, she behaved very well, and there was nothing to impeach her character: on the 26th day of April last, being Sunday, I dined at home with Mrs. Orrell, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; after dinner, about three, we walked out in the fields, near to Charlotte-street; we left the deceased to dine, and to do the business of the house, in good health and spirits, we left her, as we supposed, alone; we walked for about an hour, and then returned; on our return, which was about four o'clock, we knocked at the door several times, and nobody answered; I looked from the area across the front kitchen, but could see nobody; we left the door, after remaining there for about ten minutes, and we walked towards the bottom of the street, and then returned, perhaps, in the space of six or eight minutes, knocking again at the door, and not getting admission, we supposed that the servant was gone out, or that she was fallen asleep, as she had received instructions from her mistress to put clean linen on the bed; we sauntered about near the house for a few minutes longer, and then went to church, to Fitzroy chapel, the service begins there about five in the afternoon, we were in the church, I think about half an hour before the service began; on our return home from church, I again knocked loudly at the door, that was a little before seven; knocking loudly at the door, and not getting admission, I was alarmed; I went to Mr. Stephenson's, the adjoining house, I went through their house, and got over the wall to my house, and so opened the door, and let in Mrs. Orrell.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were both these doors in their usual state? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Unbroken? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. How did you open your back door? - It was on the latch, it was not bolted, Mrs. Orrell came in, and said to me in the passage, I will go into the kitchen, and see what is become of the girl, she went down stairs, and shrieked out immediately on getting to the bottom of the stairs, and she ran up again, her expression was, O dear! something very bad has happened in the middle kitchen, I am afraid the poor girl is dead: I ran down immediately into the middle kitchen, which is at the foot of the stairs, but the floor was covered over with blood; the deceased was sitting in the further corner reclined against the two walls, a most shocking spectacle she appeared indeed; her head dress was laying on the floor, appearing to have been torn off her head, her gown was likewise on the floor, and it appeared as if it had been rolled in blood, the woman appeared to me then to be most exceedingly cut and mangled, and my conclusion was, that she had cut her own throat.</p>

               <p>Court. Did not those parts of her dress being torn and separated about, cause you to suppose something else? - Not then, my Lord; I saw she was alive, and I said to her, good God! Nanny, what is it you have been doing? Finding she could not articulate, though she attempted it, I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110006"/> ran up stairs, and beckoned to an opposite neighbour, who was sitting at an opposite window of their house, Mr. Oliver, who is not here, and is indisposed; I ran immediately for a surgeon, a Mr. Pooley, a gentleman who lives at the top of the street, and in five minutes, I brought him to my house, he looked at her, and said, she certainly cannot survive, she is most exceedingly mangled, but the kitchen being dark, we could scarcely see in what state she was; Mr. Pooley then took hold of the deceased, and I believe I gave him assistance to remove her to the middle of the kitchen, to give a better light, we then saw she had her throat cut very much in several places, the throat and neck were cut very much, and a wound on the head over her left eye; Mr. Pooley then advised me immediately to get her to the Middlesex hospital, by reason that there we should have more assistance to save her life, if possible; I had her removed to the hospital, and I suppose in twenty-five minutes from the finding, I had her placed in a bed at the hospital; on being examined by the surgeons and Mr. Pooley, we found a large fracture on the scull over the left eye, the eye was swelled and stood out in a manner that was shocking, the bones of the face and the cheek bone were broke, and several deep cuts on the left side of the neck, the throat and windpipe were cut in several places, several gashes or stabs were on the breast, particularly a large circular cut under the breast; the cheek and chin had several deep cuts, the left arm was broke, a compound fracture, above and below, the elbow shattered to pieces, the right arm was cut, and the right hand very much cut on the back of the fingers, as we then supposed by guarding her throat; the fourth finger on the right hand appeared to me to be broken, but the surgeon said it was not, but it was a leader had started; upon finding that the woman was cut and abused in this manner, which appeared to be done with a sharp instrument, or with a razor, it was immediately concluded she could not do it herself, we then supposed some person had been in the house, and that she was murdered by such person: there is a little circumstance I have omitted, Mr. Pooley took up from the middle of the floor, the handle of a razor, I saw him pick it up, it was broke, and appeared to be broke by violence, as if laid hold on by another hand, and twisted off.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were the inside of the girl's hands cut? - They were both inside and outside cut on the right hand; finding this part of the handle of the razor, we examined to find a blade to it, but did not then; I immediately returned with Mr. Pooley to the house, and upon coming to the house, I searched to see what was lost, and the first thing that I missed was a silk mode cloak of Mrs. Orrell's, and which I knew she hung on the back parlour door; upon further search, I missed eight silver spoons, a large table cloth that had gone down at dinner time, and other articles that I did not miss at first: Mr. Pooley with myself searched the house, and examined all the chimnies, under the beds, and every room and closet in the house, supposing we might meet with the murderer concealed, we did not meet with any person; there were some suspicions raised in my mind of a mulatto man, from what I had gathered, and I immediately applied to Sir Sampson

             the same evening, and communicated to him my suspicions, and we immediately went and distributed a printed handbill, which I have a copy of, this was on the Sunday night, a few minutes after nine; I was told of some suspicions of the prisoner, who was a porter to Mr. Chapman, and I went to Mr. Chapman, he is a chair maker in Peter-street, Saffron-hill, from whose warehouse I had purchased some chairs.</p>

             came to your service? - They were.</p>



               <p>Court. Do you know whether these chairs were brought home by the prisoner? - I do not know, I endeavoured to apprehend that man that night, but I could not, but we took three housebreakers that night; on the Tuesday morning the prisoner was apprehended, and brought to the house where I then was, which was at Mr. Hodgson's in Charles-street.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110007"/>Mr. Garrow. Now tell us what you observed? - Upon the man being brought to me, I looked earnestly at him, I did not recollect him, but upon the right side of his waistcoat I observed two or three spots of blood, there were a few other marks upon the waistcoat, which appeared to me to have been done with stain from chairs, they were red, but it was easy to distinguish between these red stain marks, and the marks of blood; I likewise then observed that an upper surtout coat which he had on, had been washed recently, as if it had been dirtied a day or two before; I then took the man in the coach up to Charlotte-street, that those who had said they had seen him, might recognize him.</p>

               <p>Court. Now before we leave this part of the case, will you examine the impressions of your own mind, whether you recollect the observation of the coat at the time, arose from what you observed then, or from what has occurred to your recollection since? - It instantly struck me at the first sight of him, at the moment I saw him it struck me.</p>

               <p>Court. You understand the distinction? - I do, it was at that time that it struck me, and I mentioned it even then to the people that were about me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the coat appear to be partially washed, or wholly so? - Wholly washed, but the sleeves appeared lighter, but whether it was from further wear, or whether it had been more washed I cannot tell; I then took him down to Bow-street, I took one of the officers with me into the Borough, to enquire out from intelligence that I had, where this man's lodgings were, and with some difficulty I found out his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you at a subsequent time found him in those lodgings? - Yes, at a subsequent time, I took him out of bed with one Pugh a witness; when I reapprehended him, the officer and myself scrambled up to the window, got into his room and examined it, he was in the room, nothing of my property was found; not finding any thing, I returned to Bow-street; we had a long examination of the man, and could make nothing out, and were under the necessity of discharging him the next day for want of evidence; I took him up to the body, to see if that would have any effect upon him; that was on the Tuesday evening, the 28th of June, the day but one following the murder, the woman was dead then, she died about one o'clock on Monday morning, I saw her dead myself; on the Tuesday evening I took him up to the body, and put many questions to him, to some of which he gave answers that were very well, and some that shewed confusion; I requested him to put his hand upon her breast, he put his hand on, and shewed less sense of horror than I should suppose any innocent man could; there was one of the officers of the police there, and he burst into tears, and could not stay in the room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the prisoner use any expressions which shewed his acquaintance with the deceased? - He looked at her, and said, my dear I do know you very well, I never did you any harm in my life; I said what do you mean by knowing her very well, he said I do know her very well, I do remember her; I then asked him whether he recollected that before the magistrate, he had said that he never saw her but two times, when he came up with two parcels of chairs, he hesitated a little, and then answered yes, but I do remember her; I then observed in the prisoner's hearing, it was astonishing a man that had only been twice with chairs, and stopped a moment at the door, should know her in the state that she was then in, so bruised and so lacerated, that had I not seen her placed on a bed at the hospital myself, I should not have known her; he made very little answer to me then, and he gave me to understand, that as there was no magistrate there, he considered our questions as impertinent.</p>

               <p>How did he give you to understand that? - In this manner; he said I do not know that I am to answer, I speak before the magistrate; one of the gentlemen present said, let me look into your hands, as I had observed cuts in his hands before, at the publick office the morning after the murder, this I observed on the examination, after I returned from the Borough.</p>

               <p>Court. Tell me your first observation in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110008"/> the morning about the cuts? - Nothing more, than that there were cuts in the inside of his fingers, particularly on the second finger on his right hand, when the gentlemen desired to look in his hands, he was asked by myself, and by one or two of the surgeons that attended, how long these cuts had been on his hands, and by what they were caused, his answer was, that they had been ten days or a fortnight, and it had been done with a knife or a chissel; one of the surgeons upon that opened one of the wounds, which appeared to be the larger wound, and which appeared to be quite a green wound, and the blood would have dropped if he had opened it further; the surgeon then declared that it was quite a new wound, and not of the standing the prisoner declared it to be; other questions were asked him, how long he had been married to this woman who he cohabited with as his wife, and is now here; he said he was married, and he was not married, that he had lived with her a year and a half, but could not tell her name.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ask him where he lodged? - He said near the Borough market, I asked him the name of the street, he said he did not know, he had never heard the name of the street, I then questioned him how long he had lodged in that place, he answered six months; I then remarked to him it was very strange, that he should live with a woman a year and an half and not know her name, and lodge six months in a street, and not know the name of the street, he made no answer whatever, he did not then know that I had found out his lodgings; after his examination the day following, he was discharged by the magistrate for want of evidence, I was dissatisfied with the man's discharge, and I applied to Sir Sampson Wright, I told him I was not easy with this man's discharge; Major Gilbert said, then he would grant me another warrant, and he did so, Major Gilbert granted me a warrant, Sir Sampson backed it; I took three of the officers belonging to Bow-street with me into the Borough, and we broke into the man's room, and I took him, and the person who lived with him as his wife, they were in bed, and I likewise took another woman of the house, whom I suspected to know something more than what she was willing to declare; I carried them to Bow-street, we had an examination before Mr. Gilbert, and I produced some fresh evidence; the man had then declared himself to be a Portugueze, (I find he has since passed himself off for a Lascar) a native of Madeira; Mr. Gilbert's observation to me in the presence of the prisoner was, Mr. Orrell, this man is a Portugueze, to be sure we have not evidence, what can we do, we must discharge him, you can take him at any time; I omitted a little circumstance; at the first examination on the waistcoat, where there was the largest spot of blood upon the breast, it was as if it had been nipped out, so as to take out a great deal of it, but to shew that there was some left; he then denied having done anything to it, and that it was in the same state as when I first saw it; after the examination of the morning he was sent to the watch-house, to be brought up in the evening, after which examination I took him to the body as I have mentioned: on the second examination I took him to the body; he said his coat was dirty, it was washed between ten and eleven o'clock on the Sunday morning, and by the account of one

            's contradicting him as to the time? - He made no reply to me.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing in the kitchen? - On the Sunday evening we did not find any thing more than the handle of that razor, on the Monday morning I went into the kitchen to see if I could find anything there, I had stirred the fire in the front kitchen to light a candle to search the house the Sunday evening, and on the Monday morning the blade of a razor I took up from under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110009"/> the front kitchen grate, (the razor produced) and it appeared to me to have the stain of blood upon it, notwithstanding it had been thrown in the fire; in the afternoon there had been a good fire which had cooked the dinner in the front kitchen, and it was into that that it had been thrown: a hair broom in the same kitchen was sprinkled with blood, and upon the handle were the marks of bloody fingers, which still remain, though it has been in constant use since; in the back kitchen there was a cistern with eight or ten gallons of water in it, I poured it out, it was stained with blood, and at the bottom of it was one of the meat spoons that I had missed.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing else that appears since to have been material? - Nothing material.</p>

               <p>Recollect a little? - At the latter end of December, I had information from three or four different quarters that the man was in Newgate.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect to have found any thing in the house, that you have since learned to be material? - As to the nosegay, I did not find it myself; when I apprehended him the second time, I desired the prisoner, and the witness Pugh that was in bed with him to dress; I endeavoured to keep them asunder, that they might not speak to each other; the prisoner had shoes, and there was one circumstance which will be spoke to by a witness; I asked him where his shoes were, I looked and found none that had been recently worn, excepting that pair, he said they were the shoes he had on, on Sunday, and had worn them ever since; I looked at the bottom of them, which appeared to have been in water, they were so wet that no marks could be discovered; I was very careful that he should put on the same shoes: an observation was made by the magistrate, in the presence of the prisoner, that one of the shoes was torn from the strap to the welt, and it immediately struck me, he declaring these were the same shoes he wore on Sunday, that that was the shoe that had been described to me.</p>

               <p>Court. Then the shoes he declared he had on, on the Sunday, you made him put on? - Yes, and I found no other shoes that had been recently worn.</p>

               <p>Court. What was there on that shoe to your own sight? - It was torn from the strap to the welt, it was torn two or three ways, but there was a circumstance that I observed to him, says I, have these shoes been mended John since you wore them on Sunday, no, says he, I mended them on Sunday morning as I sat on the bed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. After his discharge, from reading the Sessions Papers you was induced to suspect him afresh? - Yes, I was informed he was in Newgate; I examined the newspapers, and from them, and some information I had had from the Sessions Paper, I was induced to go to Mrs. Broome's.</p>

               <p>What did you find there? - At Mrs. Broome's they produced a black silk mode cloak, which was Mrs. Orrell's property, I had not a doubt of it, but Mrs. Orrell was along with me, she immediately knew it, and I likewise; that cloak was lost on the Sunday, the day the murder was committed; the prisoner was at that time in custody, under sentence of transportation, and he has not had any further examinations; I then took up the woman, and she gave an account, and she is here now, this is all I know of the matter.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to point out any questions to me, that you wish to have asked of Mr. Orrell the witness? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What shall I ask him? - Ask him what you please.</p>

               <p>No, he has been already fully examined by me and the counsel.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please your honor, I wants to know, that I never was in that gentleman's house but twice.</p>

               <p>Court. He has said that you have said so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Orrell. On the second examination on the Saturday, I searched under his bed, and there I found a shirt, I asked him if that was the shirt he had on on the Sunday, his answer was yes it was, he had only one shirt he said, and an old one he had on, then he said it belonged to somebody else; looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110010"/> on the outside of the wristband it appeared a little bloody, as if by friction against the sleeve of a coat.</p>

               <p>I think you say he acknowledged this to be the shirt he had on on Sunday? - Yes, and said it was the only one he had, except an old one which he had on, I questioned him how it came marked in that manner, after hesitation, in two or three minutes he said it was by killing vermin, at the same time it struck me he must have a great number of them; I took this shirt with me to the office: on his first being brought up and examined, he said he had the itch, and the consequence of that was, that the magistrates started off, and he was ordered to stand a little further; the surgeons at the hospital were particular in examining his hands; I have got the itch gentlemen said he, and I tell you of it; they were not much in fear of the itch, having the means of curing themselves in their own hands, and they examined his hands; the Major insisted upon his stripping, come says he, John, strip.</p>

               <p>Court. Had he in fact got the itch? - I apprehend he had not, he had a cutaneous complaint, but he had not the itch.</p>

               <p>Court. He might suppose that to be the itch? - I have nothing further to say.</p>

               <p>I am a milkman, I serve Mr. Orrell with milk; on the Sunday of this murder, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110011"/> twenty-five minutes after two, when I came to Mr. Orrell's door with some milk, I called milk, and the maid came to the area door, and told me no milk; with that I took my kettles in my hand, and came along on the same side of the street where Mr. Orrell lives, about three doors nearer to the town, there lay a mulatto man on his left side, with his body on the steps, with his legs extended out on the footpath; I had a large kettle in one hand, and I lifted up my foot with intent to give him a trip; I looked at him, and I could see the upper leather of his shoe was torn by the welt, it is what you call wax leather, it was torn in this manner from the welt along the welt, and he had a nosegay of cabbage roses in his bosom, and he had a drab coloured coat on, much inferior to this, it is what is generally called Bath coating; I took no further notice till the next morning, when I heard of the murder, two or three days after, I took no notice but I mentioned the circumstance to the last witness, Mrs. Bruce, soon after, I was examined on the Saturday before the magistrate, the prisoner was there, I told this circumstance, I could not positively swear it was him, he had on just such a coat; and the shoe that I saw at the Magistrate's taken of this man's foot, appeared to me in my mind at that time, to be the shoe, though I could not swear positively to it, but the coat the prisoner had on at the Justice's appeared like the coat that the man had on that I saw on the Sunday afternoon in the street.</p>

               <p>Was that shoe at the Justice's a wax leather shoe? - Yes, it was; I could not say whether he was the man.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you say whether the man you saw at the baker's door was a different sized man? - No, I cannot say positively to his person one way or the other, the man I saw had his hair tied, queued, and laid with his head in a doleful situation, I saw his side face.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Orrell. It seems extraordinary, that this nosegay spoken of by the witness Bruce, should not be found before Wednesday, because Mr. Pooley and you examined the house. - The kitchen is a back kitchen, not very light; we looked for some weapon, which we supposed might occasion her death; there was blood in several places, and large cakes of blood, we did not put our hands into it, and this was found in one of those cakes, for I did not think it proper to have the place cleaned till the coroner's inquest had been taken.</p>

               <p>Now, Sir, of what nature were these cuts? - The cuts appeared on the fourth finger, and the others were just here, whereabouts the grasp is, it appeared to me as if it had been done by some instrument that he had made use of.</p>

               <p>Did they appear old or fresh cuts? - The larger cut appeared to be a recent wound.</p>

               <p>I presume a wound of ten days or a fortnight standing, would be healed before that time? - Yes. I heard Mr. Orrell's description of the state of this poor woman, it was perfectly right; I have no doubt of this producing her death.</p>

               <p>(The cloak deposed to by Mr. Orrell.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Orrell. I know it by the general wear, Mrs. Orrell wore it for twelve months, I am convinced by my general view of it that it is hers.</p>

               <p>Mrs. ORRELL sworn.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you take the trouble to look at that cloak? - I know the cloak to be mine by the lace and the making, as well as I should know any other thing I had worn the time, I have worn it twelve months; at the time of the murder it was hanging up on the back parlour door, and a bonnet upon it, when I returned it was gone, and the bonnet that hung upon it was thrown upon the ground; I had seen it on that Sunday, I have not a doubt, I knew it as soon as I saw it in the pawnbroker's shop, before it was open.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you bought it ready made, or did you make it yourself? - I did not make it myself, but I bought the lace and the mode, it was made in Fleet-street.</p>

               <p>Is there any thing particular that will enable you to distinguish it from another cloak that had been worn twelve months by any body else? - I am sure this is my cloak.</p>

               <p>You will understand me, I am not asking you these questions from the smallest doubt of the truth of what you say to your belief, but it is necessary the Jury should know the grounds on which your persuasion is founded, now you may be conscientiously persuaded that this is your cloak, but I want to know by what you know it from another cloak of the same sort and size, that has been worn exactly the same time? - I should have known the cloak from a thousand cloaks, I know the make of it in particular.</p>

               <p>There is no particular place torn or worn, or any particular observation made on the cloak? - There was a tear which I recollected immediately when I saw it again; after examining the cloak very minutely, I knew the cloak perfectly, and I recollected the tear as soon as I saw it again.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Bruce. Mrs. Orrell was out one evening, and lost her dog, and the dog was so glad to see her, that he dirtied her cloak, and I cleaned it with spirits, and there remain some marks of the feet on now.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Orrell. I remember the dog leaping up against me, and it was cleaned by Mrs. Bruce.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Bruce. I am positive this is the cloak I cleaned.</p>

               <p>Shew us the part where you apprehend the marks are? - At the front on each side.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Orrell. From the appearance of the front of the cloak could you observe that it had been cleaned at all by any thing? - It is cleaned so trifling, and done with a little gin, which does not make any difference at all in the mode.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Bruce. I knew the cloak from the first day it ever came home from the maker's.</p>

               <p>Court. Here are marks that are perfectly visible to me who have not a very good sight; but they appear to me to be fresher, and of a whiter colour than would arise from street dirt? - The dirt was taken off, it is my cloak, I have not a doubt, I am positive of it.</p>

               <p>Court. In the first place I must ask you, if you are not the wife of the prisoner? - No Sir.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - About two years.</p>

               <p>Have you lived with him all that time? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>How long? - Sixteen months before he was taken up, and at that time.</p>

               <p>Where was he on Sunday the 26th of June? - He dined about one, after dinner I went and laid down on the bed, he was sitting in a chair, about two he went out, he said, he was going to take a walk, I did on the bed till he returned which was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110013"/> pretty nigh five, between four and five, I cannot positively say which, he startled me by opening the door, I said nothing at all to him, a little while after Mrs. Jackson came into the room, and asked me if I would wash a shirt for her, that was on Sunday evening after his return.</p>

               <p>How was the prisoner dressed on that Sunday? - With his coat that he usually wore at his work, a whitish surtout coat, a sort of a drab, rather a Bath drab; when the woman asked me to wash a shirt, I said to him, John, blow the fire, he accordingly pulled off his great coat, it was warm weather, he threw it on the back of a chair where he sat to blow the fire; I went on and washed the shirt, while I was washing, he said to me, I wish you would let me wash out this elbow, which had been greased three weeks before, by working for Mr. Chapman, I said, why do you want to wash it to day, let it alone till another day, and I will wash it all over, it will look very odd to see the elbow clean and no other part, with that he put the sleeve quite into the water, and had the brush and brushed upon the elbow, then I thought he was brushing the grease out, and I said, your brushing will not get the grease out, without warm water; then I turned round and saw him brushing at the wrist, I asked him the reason, he said, he had some stain of blood, that he had been fighting, and with that he took and threw it all into the water, and I took and did it all out into the suds, as they happened to be good, and I washed the coat all over, not knowing anything of the transaction.</p>

               <p>Did you perceive any blood upon it? - Yes, upon the wrist I did, but on no other part.</p>

               <p>On which arm was it? - I cannot recollect, I look upon it to be the right arm, but I am not sure.</p>

               <p>Did any thing more pass that evening? - No more at all till the next morning, the next morning he got up to go to his work as usual, and he went in a blue jacket and his waistcoat sleeves, he did not go in his coat, because it was not dry; on the Monday morning he pulled a cloak from underneath the bed, and said he had bought it for me, and that I was to pay for it at so much a week.</p>

               <p>What sort of a cloak was it? - A black mode cloak.</p>

               <p>What did you do with it? - I said to him, what did you buy a cloak for, I am not necessitated for one, I want money to pay my rent more than a cloak, and I must make money for it, it is of no use to me; so that morning I went, and pledged it with Mrs. Broome, in Park-street, where I frequently use; after this I heard the prisoner was taken up, I went out on the Tuesday morning from the Borough, and I met the landlord of the house, says he, Mrs. Hogan, something has been the matter; and the landlord went with me, and enquired for him, and we found him at Bow-street, he was acquitted that time, and taken up again as Mr. Orrell has said, he was again discharged, and soon after he was discharged the second time; he has been very uneasy at times, I frequently asked him what made him uneasy, he said, it was for want of employ, for he did use to work, and I thought he had lost his bread though innocently; I said, what is the reason you are so uneasy, he said, he could not rest; why says I, I hope you are not guilty; this might be a month or five weeks after the murder; I said, I hope you have not been guilty of the murder, he said he was very unhappy, for he had done that fact, and he was guilty of that he had been accused of.</p>

               <p>What fact? - Of the murder of this woman, he did not describe any thing about it, he never told me any more than what the newspapers expressed, I read it one morning to him, before I knew he was guilty; I said it was advertized, and I hope they will come to justice that did it, I told him I would go and tell of it, he said, if I did, I should be hanged, which deterred me from making a discovery, he is at the bar, now, and you may ask him; I could not get rid of him, he has staid out four or five nights together, and I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110014"/> saw a farthing nor a halfpenny; I went away from my own apartment on the Monday; I told him, says I, there was some plate missing, which the paper expressed besides the cloak, and he told me he had thrown the spoons over London-bridge; I asked him how he could commit such a thing, and he said he had no intention of doing any such a thing, but that he wanted to be great with her, and she resisted.</p>

               <p>When he told you, you would be hanged, did he tell you where he got the cloak? - He said, if you tell of me, you will be hanged, he did not explain why.</p>

               <p>Did you ever go to see him in prison after he was cast for transportation? - There was a young body, an acquaintance of mine, went to see him; he sent for me, I went to him, and he said he was going abroad, I said, I hope you will not return again, if you do, you will be hanged for returning before your time; but says I, there is that that troubles me, I never shall rest till it is divulged, O says he, that will not come to light; I left my own home, on the Monday before he was taken to Newgate, because I could not get rid of him.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to ask this witness any questions? - Yes, please your Lordship, ask her, Sir, if she ever saw me throw any spoons over London-bridge?</p>

               <p>She does not say, that she saw you do it, but she says, you told her that you had done it? - I told her no, please your honour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have done.</p>

               <p>Court. Now, prisoner, you have heard the charge that has been made against you and the evidence that has been given, have you anything to say?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Yes, please your honour, I am innocent of it, and whoever takes my life away, I will never forgive them.</p>

               <p>Have you any witnesses? - I have plenty on the other side of the water, here is Mr. Howes I see.</p>

               <p>Do you wish to call any witnesses either to fact or to character? - Here are two gentlemen that can give me a character.</p>

               <p>- HOWES sworn.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say about the prisoner concerning this affair, that can be of any service to him, the woman took a room of me, they behaved very honestly.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, before I state the evidence to you, it is proper to take some notice of the circumstances of this case, and the prisoner that stands before you, because it is at all times necessary to justice, that the Court and Jury should proceed to the consideration of the evidence, that necessarily and immediately affects the life of the prisoner at the bar, with coolness and deliberation, and divested of every prejudice that from any circumstance may have been raised in their minds: the crime in itself is of a horrid nature, and this crime in particular has been attended with circumstances of unusual violence, cruelty, and brutality; but you should proceed to the consideration of this evidence with your minds perfectly indifferent as to the question, whether the prisoner has any relation with the crime or not, for the indignation that human nature necessarily is impressed with, against a crime of such magnitude, should never be transferred to the person that is accused of it, till a cool deliberation has satisfied you, that he is clearly guilty; you ought therefore to divest yourselves, as this is a matter that has been publickly talked off, of every thing that you may have heard or read out of Court, before the prisoner was brought to the bar on this charge; you ought also to divest yourselves of any circumstance in which the prisoner stands not extremely favourable to his character, his being accused of a crime of a far different nature, is far from being proof that he is guilty of one of this magnitude, and above all, I am sure you will suffer yourselves to have no impression from the difference of complection or country, but that you will try this man that stands at the bar, just as you would a man of your own country and complection and whose character before this stood unimpeached; it is with that impression upon your minds, that you ought to proceed to the consideration of the evidence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110015"/> and in proportion to the magnitude of the crime, ought to be the strength of the evidence, upon which that accusation is supported: I will, therefore, proceed to state to you, the evidence that has been given, and then to point out some observations upon it: first, considered as independent of the principal witness,

            , and in the next place, as connected with her testimony; for with respect to her, she certainly stands before you under circumstances of some discredit; for if this charge against the prisoner is true, and founded in fact, she stands in the situation of having long cohabited with this man, the badness of whose disposition and character, she cannot be supposed to have been wholly a stranger to, though she might not be at all privy to the particular fact, and also was possessed of a knowledge of this fact a considerable time before she made any discovery, and the discovery when made is not perfectly voluntary on her part, but brought about by a circumstance which immediately connects herself with the accusation; she therefore does not stand in the light of a witness in full credit, and intitled to implicit confidence to what she shall say on oath, and therefore, as far as her evidence is unsupported, it certainly ought to be received with some degree of caution, though she does not stand in the light of an accomplice, and though her evidence is admissable, as it is of such a nature that it may be received even where it is unsupported, for she by no means stands charged as an accomplice in this fact, or as having any previous knowledge whatever with the commission of it, but she stands not in a degree of perfect credit from the circumstances I have pointed out to you: the first witness is Mr. Orrell, &amp;c. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added) The circumstance of the cloak arises whoby out of the evidence of

            : let us see what the circumstances are independent of her evidence, they are these; that the prisoner had a knowledge of the house of Mr. Orrell, that he had also a knowledge of the servant maid, that he affirmed that knowledge to have arisen only from being sent there twice in the course of his business by Mr. Chapman; but that upon the view of the body of the deceased, he expressed a degree of knowledge of her, more than could be accounted for on his going twice to the house, on that business; and that a man of the same complection was seen near the house of Mr. Orrell, laying in that street, a very short time before this fact was committed by some person or other, that he was dressed in the same coloured coat that the prisoner appeared afterwards to have on, and had a shoe on torn in the same manner, and which the witness swears he believed was the same shoe the man that he saw had on; then the prisoner, when taken up, has marks of blood on his waistcoat, and cuts on his hands, of which cuts he assigns a reason that appears by the evidence of the surgeon, not to be a true one; that the coat he had on also had the appearance of being recently washed, and he ackno wledges it had been recently washed. but says it was washed on the Sunday morning, in which he is flatly contradicted by a witness produced by himself. Gentlemen, these are the circumstances which apply directly to the person of the prisoner, and the circumstances of the cuts appear in this manner, when compared with the situation in which the deceased was found, because from the razor being broken, the handle twisted off, and the extreme marks of violence found on the body of the unfortunate woman, it appears extremely clear, she made a considerable resistance, and therefore there was a probability that the murderer might be cut: Gentlemen, if you believe the application of the evidence of the milkman, that lets in another strong circumstance; for if, from the circumstance of the shoe and the great coat, you are clearly satisfied, that the prisoner was the man that was laying at the baker's door, there is then another circumstance, that that man had a nosegay in his bosom, and that nosegay was found in the place where this horrid fact had been committed, but that circumstance of the nosegay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110016"/> does not apply to the prisoner, unless you are satisfied, that the man that lay at the baker's steps, was the prisoner: now you are to proceed to the consideration of the additional evidence of

            , you are to consider how far this witness is either confirmed or contradicted by the other witnesses; she had a cloak in her possession, her story is this, that the prisoner went out about an hour before this fact, by the evidence of Mr. Orrell, appears to have been committed, for he states, it must have been committed between the hours of three and four, for he went out about three, and he returned, for the first time, about four;

             states, that the prisoner returned home about five o'clock; now the distance is considerable from the Borough to Charlotte-street, Portland-place; but it certainly is not more than the time would very easily permit to perform it in, it is not above an hour's walk there; first she speaks of the blood on the sleeve of his coat, and of her washing it; she says, the morning after his return, he produced this cloak, and afterwards she speaks of his confession, that he threw away the spoons that were missing: it is shewn, that a person answering the description of the prisoner, was in this street a little before the hour of three, it does not exactly tally with that, in point of time, because he was seen by the milkman, about, or very near half past two, which is a short time, supposing the witness to be accurate, as to the time he came from the Borough; and the circumstance of his coat being washed, was agreed on all hands, that it had been recently washed, and washed by this woman, which he himself confessed, only he differed as to the time. Gentlemen, the effect of the circumstances upon your minds, independent of the evidence of Pugh, and the degree of credit you pay to her testimony, rest clearly with you, it is my duty to point it out to you, you are to decide upon it free from any passions, but what arise from a full consideration of the evidence itself, if you think there has been any reason, under all the circumstances, to disbelieve the evidence of Pugh, then you will consider the case, under all the circumstances, and judge if they are sufficient to convict the prisoner without her evidence; or if you can find in the whole case, any reasonable ground of doubt, though you are not to go to conjectures and probabilities, to let a man escape justice, yet unquestionably, if you find any reasonable ground of doubt, you ought to acquit the prisoner.</p>

            , you now stand in the most wretched situation, which human nature can possibly be reduced to; for you have been convicted upon evidence which excludes all doubt, of a crime of such enormity, and attended with such circumstances, that human nature shrinks back with horror, at the relation of the facts that have attended it. The crime of murder does not depend on the laws or policy of this or that country, it is equally an offence in all, it is a direct offence against that God who is the creator alike of all mankind, and alike the governor of all nations upon earth: it is the laws of that God, and not of this particular country alone that you have violated, the voice of nature, of reason, and of all mankind has at all times cried out, that whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; a crime so enormous in itself, receives in your case, the most dreadful aggravations, from the circumstances of horror with which this fact has been attended; the violence and cruelty of the act, to whatever motive it is to be ascribed, argues a disposition savage in the extreme, whether it arose from avarice and the desire of plunder, or whether from that motive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110017"/> which you yourself assigned for it, it is almost equally guilty, but if it can receive any aggravation, it must be upon the latter supposition; for, to butcher, in that savage and inhuman manner, the unhappy object, who had been but a few minutes before the object of your brutal desires and appetites, argues a degree of savage inhumanity and ferocity, unknown to the nature of the fiercest beasts, reserved for man alone, and thank God, only for such as you! Loaded with such a degree of guilt on your mind, you have shewn a hardness of heart, that has enabled you to view the unhappy victim of your cruelty without emotion, a spectacle so shocking, that it melted into tears, even those whose situation and profession has necessarily made them acquainted with the greatest scenes of horror, whilst you, the guilty object, was the only person that could refrain from sorrow at the sight of such a spectacle; the only circumstance therefore, under such accumulated horrors, that leaves the smallest room for hope for you, for that mercy hereafter, that the laws of the country deny you here, is that trouble and uneasiness of mind, that in some part of the evidence you appear at times to have laboured under; happy will it be for you, if that trouble and uneasiness is, in the short time you have to live, increased to the utmost degree of horror and remorse; for it is the utmost degree of horror and remorse alone, that can wipe from the guilty conscience the stains of innocent blood, and obtain that mercy from your offended God, which you cannot expect from man: it remains therefore for me, after earnestly exhorting you to reflect on the malignity of your crime, and the horror of your situation, and praying that that reflection may produce some effect upon your guilty soul, to pronounce on you the dreadful sentence of the law, which is, that you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence be carried on Monday next, to the place of execution, there to be <rs id="t17860111-1-punish8" type="punishmentDescription">

            , as follows:</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship and you gentlemen of the Jury, I am councel also on the part of this prosecution, against the unfortunate prisoners now at this bar, who stand there for a crime which it is impossible for any words or any imagination, in my opinion, to aggravate; its heinousness and the pernicious consequences of it, are of such a nature, that every man of common understanding must observe them; this matter has been of very long expectation, it is not impossible, it is more indeed than probable, that many reports, many sayings, many paragraphs in news-papers, may have come to the ears and sight of almost every man; I am clear if it was possible that any prepossessions in point of opinion (I do not say prejudices) should find their way into your minds, you, on this occasion, would naturally dismiss them, because you must know that on this question you, as men, must attend to the feelings of men, and with that attention which, while the lives of you fellow-subjects are in danger, is required from you; at the same time you must know it is your duty to yourselves, your families, your country, and posterity; to prevent the effects which must arise from a subversion of those invaluable rights, which the subjects of this country enjoy, for disposing of their property<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110022"/> freely, and absolutely without any controul on the part of the crown, or any interposition on the part of their fellow-subjects. The free disposition of property will be totally prevented if sche mes and manoeuvres of the kind that will be laid before you should obtain to gain credit before a Jury: Gentlemen, I am aware of the difficulty there will be, as well from the pain that every feeling man must entertain, on such a subject as this, as from the vast variety of matter this cause has passed through, and the number of sheets in which it is contained, particularly in Doctors Commons, I say I am aware it will be extremely difficult so to arrange the matter as to make it completely comprehensive on the first state of the case; I will endeavour, however, so to separate the circumstances attending this matter, as to make them as clear as I can to my own understanding, which is the best way of conveying them to yours, and in doing that I shall try likewise to bring several circumstances together, so as to shew you the view in which they appear to me, in order that it may be better understood both by my Lord and by you. The evidence must in its nature take up a considerable length of time, it must consist, as I said before, of a great variety of matter, and it may possibly be so laid before you, and so put together, that it may be comprehended notwithstanding the extent of the matter and the variety of it: Gentlemen, you all of you know, and must feel, that there are a thousand cases in which the actual fact of forgery, and the fabrication of it cannot be proved; there are others, where that impossibility is taken away, sometimes by the admission of accomplices themselves; and, Gentlemen, give me leave now to observe, with respect to accomplices, that they come, as, my Lord will tell you, always under circumstances of suspicion, and are witnesses, of whom juries always are, and always ought to be, very jealous; I mean those accomplices whose confessions arise either from motives of personal fear in themselves, or hopes of rewards from others, or of revenge or malice towards those persons with whom they were themselves concerned; but, at the same time, you very well know that there is a necessity, which the policy of the laws of this country has admitted, of receiving their evidence in some cases, and that where that necessity arises, accomplices have been admitted; they are what the law calls competent witnesses, and their testimony is to be heard; but the weight it is to have, the credit that is to be given to it is, as one of the greatest blessings of this land, left to the consideration of twelve men on their oaths, to the consideration of twelve men of credit, of reputation, and of property: It will be necessary therefore, by circumstances (and I will add too, in favour of the prisoners, strong circumstances) to lay a foundation for corroborating the testimony of such an accomplice as we shall produce, one who had himself so far lost the character and the duty of a subject of this country, as to be concerned in the transaction itself. The circumstances have, in the opinion of some of the learned Judges, always been thought most proper to precede the testimony of the accomplice, I know one in particular, I mean Mr. Justice Gould.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. That is my practice.</p>

            . I have also, my Lord's authority to say it is his, though I have not the honour to know it in practice; but although Mr. Justice Gould, from his great experience and his great attention to every point of the law in that situation, which he has filled so ably, has also adopted that practice, yet, at the same time, it is not constant and invariable, you will see reasons why it cannot be invariable, the story is sometimes of such a nature that it must precede the circumstances that are to corroborate it, it will be my duty, therefore to submit to my Lord, for I shall be extremely willing to adopt any conduct he thinks right in this prosecution, having no wish, no desire on this subject, but to do my duty to the public. Gentlemen, there are a vast variety of circumstances that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110023"/> will very often weigh more with sensible minds than the most positive testimony of witnesses; and of that we have had too many fatal instances to doubt, much less to deny; there have been cases where the three witnesses to a will, as required by the law of this country, which is to pass real property, as distinguished from personal; I say there have been cases where all those three witnesses have denied the execution of the real will, where the circumstances have still established that will, and all those witnesses have been punished for their testimony; I mean the case of Mr. Joliff, which I am sure his Lordship must have heard of, where all the three witnesses to his will one after another absolutely contradicted the circumstances that proved it to be a true one, and they were all punished for their false testimony; there have been cases likewise, once or twice in my experience, where all the three witnesses have supported the will, and swore to it with such strength that would hardly leave a doubt in one's mind, yet it has been proved to be totally false, as in the case of Sir

            ; then, gentlemen, you will do in this and every such case that which is natural and probable; you will attend to that, before any testimony of external circumstances, before any saying, or things that are supposed to have passed at different times inconsistent with that probability: I shall, therefore, begin by stating to you the conduct of Mr. Sawtell, the testator in the real will that I shall lay before you, the supposed testator in this supposed will that has already been laid before you in the indictment, and then you will judge from that man, from his way of thinking, and from his constant habitual way of practice, what was his intention and design; he was a very industrious man in the trade of a tallow chandler, he had invented the spermaceti candle, he had taken so much merit to himself on that occasion, that he had a seal with the impression, I think, of a candle in a candlestick, and the words Sperma Ceti wrote round it; he, for a considerable time being in business, had accumulated wealth, arising from his own industry, that had been added to, by accession from his brother, more particularly than any other relation, which was some time about the year 1777 or 1778: In the disposition of this acquired property he had made wills in an early period, and after the acquisition from his brother of the property that is mentioned to you, he had likewise been in the habit of making his disposition by will, and he had employed some attorney in whom he had confidence, and to that attorney he always imparted his wishes whenever he wanted to alter or re-execute his will, which, in point of law, in truth, is a new will; more additions or codicils to it may be executed as additions, but whenever it is executed over again, it is a new will to all intents and purposes, in law as well as in common sense. Some time about the year 1780, his attorney, of the name of Falkner, died, on his death he employed a gentleman of undoubted ability and credit in his profession, Mr. Mumford: in 1780, he employed Mr. Mumford to make his will, in which, as well as in the former ones, for in order to look back to former wills, and to collect the intention of the testator, it was necessary to turn back to such as had been made in Mr. Falkner's life, which was done by this Mr. Mumford, in the year 1780, therefore, a will was made, the same executor, the same residuary legatee, in that will of 1780, that had been in the former will in the life time of Mr. Falkner: in the beginning of the year 1782, in February, Mr. Sawtell again wished to alter his will, or, in other words, to make a new will, and to have his will new executed; in February, 1782, he made a will, the same residuary legatee, the same sole executor, that was Mr.

Gentlemen, the story that is told in support of this pretended, and this false will, is, that it was necessary that the execution of it should be a profound secret, it was to be transacted therefore with the most profound secrecy, at night, in the stillness and the dead of night, about twelve the witnesses were to attend, to be let in by

Gentlemen, after this transaction, it will be proper to tell you the story of Underwood. This Underwood, one of the witnesses to the will, and the writer of the will, tells a story, I think from the 18th of December, 1784; in December twelvemonth at the Public Office, in Bow-street, before Sir Sampson Wright, upon an affidavit there made, his story is, that having been concerned for a Mrs. Reeve, sometime antecedent to the year, 1782; because the transactions I am going to speak of, happened in 1781; he had been concerned for her as a woman in poor circumstances, and having a Chancery suit, he was not a man of circumstances, and could not afford to advance, nor had he credit for the expences of that suit; the consequence was, that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110027"/> was an acquaintance of Mrs.

            , she applied to her, and the story was told to Mr. Sawtell, concerning this suit and the poor woman's right, and I think he was induced in 1782 to contribute five guineas towards it on the story that Underwood told, that, he says, is the only time that he ever saw Mr. Sawtell to know him; he will tell you that at the execution of the will there was somebody in the bed, whether it was Mr. Sawtell or not, he did not know; that having so far a knowledge of

            , they were let in, they made researches, Nathaniel got the bunch of keys, and tried an escrutore, and the bureau, and these keys opened it, but the key of the iron chest happened to be in Price's custody, and he being in his room, Nathaniel could not go into that room without waking Price; the truth therefore, as related by Underwood, is that they did not get at it at this time; this disconcerted the plan considerably, therefore nothing could be done till this will was got at, that was to be the guide, that was to be the sort of proceeding by which Underwood was to steer; accordingly they waited some time, and in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110028"/> first week in January, Nathaniel said he had got the key, and they got the chest open, the will is found, it is read, there is a pen, ink, and paper for a will, and Underwood sat down and copied that will, and the copy of that will is still existing, the copy of the will of the 4th of November; he next proceeded to take instructions from Nathaniel, how he would wish to vary it; now this, you will observe, is said to be by the date of the 14th of December, and they did not get at it by this story till the first week in January; about the 20th of January, or somewhere thereabouts, the first opportunity they had to meet after, it was agreed that Underwood should go to Nathaniel's work-shop, where he had a little sort of compting-house; they went there, and this you will see, when I come to state the confirmation of the story, was upon the 21st, which is as near the time as can possibly be guessed: upon the 21st he copied about one sheet then, Nathaniel was with him afterwards; the next night he came again, Nathaniel was with him, and he copied the other sheet; the other part of this will was performed, if this story is true, on the 22d of January: on the 23d of January every thing was ripe for execution, and you will see on the 23d of January, (the will that they exhibit is not the will of the 23d of January, I will tell you the reason by and by) this will of the 23d of January they all of them attend, Goodridge sits up, they are let in upon a signal, they go up into the testator's room, pulling their shoes off that they might not disturb the servants, who did not know the faces of any of them except Nathaniel; Nathaniel being close to the testator, who was in bed, and the others of them at the foot of the bed; Nathaniel put a pen into the hand of this Sawtell, who was then in one of the states he usually was in, or in sleep, and made a mark to this will, they then went down into the parlour, and subscribed their names to it, and the business was thought to be done: however the next day, or the day after that, within one or two days after it, before the 26th of January, which I think was on a Sunday, they met and had a consultation at this Underwood's, and Nathaniel did not like this date of the 23d of January, for so that will attempted to be executed on this day was dated; why, says he, Slack may be able to prove him incapable on that day, it may be too late: the question then was, what date to give it, and they gave it the date of the 14th of December, that being a time before he was so confined, as to be incapable of executing wills, that being the first time that Nathaniel had sat up with him; the consequence of which was, the seal, and I believe the name, that is the mark, was taken off by way of cancelling this will of the 23d of January, and a pen drawn through the 23d of January, and the 14th of December put, and then it was fixed that Underwood should come on Sunday, the 26th of January, and dine at the house of Nathaniel, and then he should write the will, and that will should be then prepared; and that will of the 26th of January is the real one, exhibited here as the will of the 14th of December: when this was done, the three witnesses signed their names there; they did not meet after that 26th of January, they had not the impudence and folly, as well as the wickedness of going to the house; but Nathaniel said, as to the mark of the name, leave that to me; and the will now produced, with the supposed mark of the testator; when that mark was put there nobody but Nathaniel himself knows, nor how it came there; it will be for your observation, and it is pretty apparent on the face of this instrument, of the false will, that that mark was not put at the same time of the subscribing the names as witnesses, but at a different time, being written with a different ink, blacker; that is a very strong mark of the truth of this story. It had been in contemplation to apply to a Mr. Assiotti, who is supposed to be an ingenious man at that sort of imitation, and he was to be shewn pieces of paper where the name of

             produces this out of his pocket, Mr. Slack never dreamt of such a thing; he went home, in the presence of his partner Mr. Atkinson opened this cover, and there he found the two sheets of blank paper: Mr. Mumford being a man of experience and ability, he was too inquisitive for this kind of business; he wanted the instructions of this will and the draught, this was a pinching part of the business, however they told him they were in Underwood's hands, and would be produced in proper time; without that, I take it for granted, Mr. Gregory would have had nothing to do with the business; upon this occasion, the day after Mr. Sawtell's death there was another consultation, then it was concerted that Underwood should draw up pretended instructions, and copies should be made and shewn to Mr. Gregory, and it was so, and they imposed, as naturally they would, upon Mr. Gregory; these instructions were written at his own house the 16th of February, the actual date when these instructions were written, that was the Sunday following the will; instructions for a will of a man who died on the 9th; in fact they were really, and in truth wrote the 16th, so this man tells the story; and you will see, when I come shortly to open the corroborating circumstances, that they appear to be true: when they came to shew the instructions, and the copies to Mr. Gregory, as he wrote the originals, as will be shewn to you in an incorrect way, and in a loose way, as supposed to be taken before the man himself, in order to imitate that which would be the natural effect of instructions so taken; he wrote them in that way, he likewise made a copy of the real will of the 14th of November, when he had got this, the draught of the true will of the 14th of November, he gave it to his wife to keep, she put them into her pocket; it happened very unfortunately that she being very big with child, was brought to bed suddenly, and the papers were all so extremely dirtied, that they were obliged to be put into a tub of water, and that draught of the 23d of January, seems to me to have been burnt, for this reason, that it was so defaced that it was of no possible use, the other two will be shewn to you; then they wanted a date to these instructions; then Mr. N. Goodridge set his wits to work, let me see, says he, Mr. Sawtell was at my house, the 4th of November, I went with him the 9th, being Lord Mayor's day, to tallow-chandler's hall, therefore the 6th of November will be a proper day, you can say you met him at my house, and he brought the will to you; that he suffered you to copy that will on the 6th of November, and on the 9th, he gave you more perfect instructions how he would have it altered, therefore these are the two supposed times; then on the 9th of November were these instructions to be dated: now gentlemen, with respect to the circumstances confirming this story of the man, I shall call to you one witness, who will prove to you, the consultations about the wife of this man getting Assiotti to write the name; I shall prove to you that when that failed by the journeyman of Mr. Goodridge himself, who was in the shop at the time that he came, on the 21st of January, with Underwood, and they were there four or five hours, Underwood writing, and the other looking over, I suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110030"/> dictating, the man taking no notice, but going about his work, making some rail work that wanted to be finished, and which obliged him to work later than usual; this man seeing a part of the writing hang out, after Underwood and Nathaniel were gone, he had the curiosity to see what this Underwood had been writing, and there he read the name of Sawtell, and saw two or three legacies; he likewise was at work on the 22d of January, when he was writing a further part of this will: I shall call to you a witness, that will prove to you, that Evans, one of the prisoners, applied to a gentleman of the name of Hudson, a pewterer, a gentleman of character, as I am informed, to be a witness, supposing that Mr. Goodridge could not be there, however he was there. Hudson did not chuse to have any thing to do with it, and had nothing to do with it; that is a decisive circumstance, to go no further, that there was no true will on the 14th of December, it is of itself decisive; therefore, if that witness is believed, there is an end to be sure, of this matter. Gentlemen, I will confirm it further, on that 26th of January, I will shew, Underwood was writing on the 26th of January, when he was making the will that is now produced, that he was a considerable time, on the 26th of January, a writing, at

Gentlemen, I shall also prove to you, that Mr. Underwood applied to Mr. Todd, a person who dealt in spiritous liquors, to advance him money, which Mr. Todd could not or did not chuse to do, when he would have pledged this receipt for the bond, as a sort of security for the money, and this long before any discovery had been made: now, you see all these transactions passed in the year 1783, and confirms his story, they being antecedent to the 18th of December 1784, when he went before Sir Sampson Wright, and made this voluntary confession, from some motive that I cannot state to you, no matter what; whatever therefore his character may be, he is certainly such an accomplice in this iniquity, that tho' he could prove it extremely strong, you would not attend much I am sure to his story, but coupled with these antecedent circumstances, you will learn what the real transaction was, and this circumstance as well as the others you will not forget, namely, the application for a witness on the 23d of January, and the application to Eames on the 26th;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110032"/> all clearly shew that these things had not existed in the testator's mind; for Slack was the only person he had the least idea of as is represented: I conclude, therefore, gentlemen, with saying that long as this narration has been, I shall not mind my own trouble at all, if the case is made plain to you, you will therefore judge where the probability is, that this man so circumstanced, and in the situation I have stated him, should ever make that will on the 14th of December: that is for you to try; if he had made it the 23d of January, and dated it the 14th of December; it would be equally a forgery, though the testator himself might have executed it on the 23d of January, and for this plain reason, the antedating it, and executing it when a man might be incapable; that would therefore have been, without all controversy, as much a fabrication and forgery, as the present. Gentlemen, I will call these witnesses before you, beginning with Mr. Mumford, the former attorney; as it seems to be my Lord's wish and directions, that it should be so, to bring the circumstances before the story of Underwood; and it will be all so connected, and so supported, that there can be no doubt in any man's mind of the truth of Underwood's story, and it can hardly then be said, that a man in the situation of Underwood would come in this last stage and give this account, if it was not the force of truth that extorted it from him: the whole will be left to you, it will be made as short as can be; if I was to call the whole train of witnesses, it would lengthen this trial much more, for I know not how many score there are, but I told you before, I paid little or no regard to declarations, but to the acts of a man; we will, therefore, in as short a manner as possible, consistent with justice, lay this extraordinary case before you.</p>

            , on Saffron-hill, in the year 1780, I was recommended to him on the death of Mr. Falkner, his late attorney, he sent to me to alter his will, that was in November 1780, I did alter his will, which was executed in due form of law.</p>

               <p>Did he ever employ you afterwards? - He did.</p>

               <p>How often? - With respect to making his will twice; in February 1782, I prepared another will for him, and another on the 4th of November, 1782, that was the last will, the first was destroyed, that was the will of November, 1780, and the one in February, they were destroyed in my presence.</p>

               <p>Have you the instructions for that will in the year 1782? - Certainly not, they were very immaterial.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. You are an attorney? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you take instructions from the testator for the alterations of his will? - I certainly did, but I do not know where they are.</p>

               <p>Did you make any draught? - Yes, that will be produced.</p>

               <p>With respect to November, 1780, did you make no draught of that? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you take down no instructions in writing? - I cannot remember.</p>

               <p>You must tell me one way or the other, whether in November, 1780, when you made this gentleman's will, you took any instructions in writing? - They were merely trifling.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that you never had any instructions or any thing in writing of the will of November, 1780? - Certainly not.</p>

               <p>You never had? - Not to the best of my remembrance, I had not.</p>

               <p>Have you searched for if? - A considerable time ago.</p>

               <p>Have you made a recent search to attend this trial? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, it seems to me rather strange that you cannot swear you have none subsequent? - I do not recollect I had any instructions in writing, about the will of 1780.</p>

               <p>I ask you, if you ever had any instructions in writing from the testator? - I verily believe I had not them in writing.</p>

               <p>If you verily believe that, you must have believed it when it was still more recent; did you search for it, Sir? - I do not say I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110033"/> searched for it; I searched for all papers generally.</p>

               <p>Then you mean to say you have not any such paper that you can prove to the Court, concerning November, 1780? - No, Sir, none.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Now tell us concerning that will of 1780. - Mr.

               <p>The second will was in January, 1782? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you the instructions for that will? - No, I had not, I

             a draught of that will, I believe it is in the Commons.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. This you consider now as a draught of the will itself, for the instructions are lost you say; in February, 1782, there was a draught of the will, which was taken from some preceding instructions? - Yes, from his former will.</p>

               <p>Then when you came to make another will, in November, 1782, that very draught was altered? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then that which is now in the Commons, and which is now called for, is, in fact now, the draught of the will in November, 1782? - Yes, but I believe there may be some little inaccuracy, which I can explain.</p>

               <p>Let me understand you; the draught of the will of February, 1782, when you came to make another will in November, 1782; you made it by altering the will of February, 1782? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then that paper in February becomes the draught of November, 1782, though it was originally the draught of February, 1782? - Certainly it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I object to this being read, either as the draught of February or of November.</p>

            . The draught of February, 1782, when you made the will in November, 1782, was, as I understand you, the draught upon which the alterations were made? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was that will read to the testator? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are the alterations for November, 1782, now visible on the face of that draught? - I do not know that they are.</p>

               <p>Then look and point them out? - I do not think that I can do so, but I can very near describe them.</p>

               <p>Was the draught, as it now stands, read over to the testator, prior to his making the will in 1782?</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Sir Thomas, I must beg your pardon, I must really interfere.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Was any draught read to the testator, prior to his making the will in November, 1782? - Yes, I believe there was.</p>

               <p>Was that draught read to the testator, before he made the will of November, 1782? - I cannot answer that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. That would not alter my objection in the least.</p>

               <p>Court. The objection is this, that this being altered, and he not being able to distinguish the alterations that stood originally, he cannot now read it as the draught in February; now you may see how far you can read it as the draught of November.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Was any draught read to the testator before he executed the will of November, 1782? - If any draught was read, it was that; but no doubt he was made acquainted with the contents.</p>

               <p>Do you believe any draught was read to him, in November, 1782? - I do not know whether the draught was, but the original will was, from which that is copied? -</p>

               <p>Then is this a copy of the original will? - Most certainly it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I submit this cannot be given, as evidence of a draught either in February or November.</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly not, you cannot produce the draught before you shew that the original is destroyed.</p>

               <p>No part of it? - No.</p>

               <p>You have entered into no private agreement about it? - I never mentioned it to any body.</p>

               <p>That will not do for me? - My expectations may be upon my brother, but never while he lives as I know of, my brother has no children, and there is no relation but me.</p>

               <p>Have you no expectation of receiving from your brother, or from any other person on his behalf, any part of that legacy? - No, Sir; are you satisfied now.</p>

               <p>Now Sir, observe, have you entered into no stipulation with any person about it? - I never mentioned it to any person, but what I said was, I had given one thousand pounds away; the proctor mentioned it to me, and I said, I would do it immediately.</p>

               <p>You made no stipulation at all? - Not the least.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. This is a very uncommon examination after a release.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. In answering one of my questions, you used the word expectation from your brother? - My expectations are from him as next of kin and heir at law.</p>

               <p>Court. Heir at law is no objection, that does not disqualify, an heir at law may be a witness, but a remainder man cannot.</p>

             does not appear at present to be the executor of that will, for there is no probate granted, the usual way of doing business will certainly have some weight, nobody yet ever saw such a release without the legacy being released specifically, he released something which did not exist, it depends on executors having effects, it depends on the executor's assent; the only thing in the release is simply, that he chooses to call himself a legatee, he does not call his brother Daniel executor.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord as counsel in this case, in the situation in which I stand, I certainly might spare myself the trouble of arguing this point, because it seems to me to be too clear to argue; but as there is such a great phalanx on the other side, I shall throw in my mite upon this question; and I beg leave to observe, how does this man release his brother? not even in the character of executor; but if he did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110035"/> it is a character that does not belong to him, he is not executor, there is a litigation in the Commons, in the result of which we say it will not prove that he is so: My Lord, suppose the executor may renounce, the execution will then be committed to the next of kin, he is not in a situation to accept of that release; and your Lordship knows there must be somebody in esse, capable of accepting and assenting to the release; now, my Lord, is Mr. Slack such a person? is he the executor of that will of Mr. Sawtell's? there is no such will known to any body, which the Commons have assented to as a true will, and there is no probate of any such will: suppose the next of kin should, upon the renunciation of this gentleman, Mr. Slack, have the probate, would this be a bar as against the next of kin, why he would say, though I will not bring an action against my brother, yet when it is committed to other persons, I will bring an action; would this be a bar to that action? now observe what does he release? he releases all debts and claims now actually due, all claims and rights of action now vested in him, he releases nothing which he at present possesses, and this cannot be a bar to any future interest he may acquire.</p>

               <p>Court. There is nothing in this objection, it is said this would not be a good release in equity, the person states himself to be a legatee, the general words are sufficient, all suits in equity, quarrels, &amp;c. My Lord Coke says quarrels are the same as querula, the most comprehensive word whatever.</p>

               <p>Where did you get the key from then? - My brother opened it himself, he had the key by two powers of attorney to transact his business, I understood they were given the beginning of November.</p>

               <p>Court. You may always shew the testator's kindness to particular persons. - A few months before the 4th of November, before the execution of that will, Mr. Sawtell assigned over some houses with a strange attorney.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. Was you present at this, Sir? - I will tell you presently.</p>

               <p>No, you must tell me first? - I was present at the assignment of a policy at the Insurance office.</p>

               <p>For what, and to whom? - It was an assignment in the Fire Office.</p>

               <p>Court. Did the testator declare his reason? - He did.</p>

               <p>You must not say what you imagine to be his reason however well-founded that may be, but what the testator declared to be his reason? - He assigned over these houses because one man never paid his rent and the other

             might as well have taken my word, for I may have signed something that might have been a will; says he, what does he bring so many papers to me to sign for, probably I may have signed something I should not, I will alter my will, says he, if it be only to alter the date; I saw him sign the assignment of the policy.</p>

               <p>Did he write his name to the instrument? - Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>At what time was this? - That was about two months or six weeks before the 4th of November, I cannot speak to the time, it might be later or sooner, he made the declaration about the 1st of November, and he desired me to bring Mr. Mumford, and bring the will out of the iron chest, Mr. Mumford read the will over to him, and he said, it might be just as it was, and to bring it to him in a day or two.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know that Mr. Sawtell made a mark instead of signing his name? - Never, Sir, he always said, Bob, where must I write it? and then he put his name directly, I never knew him a put mark.</p>

            .</p>

               <p>How soon was it that you had seen him write before his death? - I never saw him write after the 4th of November, I cannot be positive.</p>

               <p>(The two powers of attorney banded to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>When did Mr. Sawtell chuse to do his business? - He was very impatient to do his business, if it was very particular, by ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>I believe either from infirmity or habit, he was incapable of doing business after dinner? - He never chose it, he was not incapable, but he liked to have his pint of porter after dinner.</p>

               <p>The intimacy subsisted between your brother and him to his death? - I saw him on Saturday night preceding his death about eight, I had no conversation with him about that, the-last conversation I had with him, was very little for a week or so before his death, only shaking hands with him, and sitting with him a little.</p>

               <p>Do you believe from the state of Mr. Sawtell's body, that he himself could have got into this iron chest, without the assistance of yourself or some other person? - For three months before his death, he was not able to lift the lid of the iron chest up, nor for twelve months before his death; on the 15th of December I went to his house, and enquired for him, he was not at home, I went there because I had no idea he was capable of going out, on the 15th of December I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Do you know how the will on the 4th of November was inclosed? - It was wrapped up, and sealed with his seal, a candle in a candlestick, and a circle, in which spermaceti was wrote.</p>

               <p>Describe the cover? - I think it was put up corner ways, I put it into the iron chest myself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. Mr. Slack, did I understand you to say that the day before this poor man's death, your brother took the will out of his iron chest? - The day before the death of Mr. Sawtell, I saw it in the iron chest, at least I thought it was there, I saw the cover, and had it in my hand.</p>

               <p>Did you go to the chest with your brother? - My brother was at the chest then, I went to it and took up the paper.</p>

               <p>Did you take that paper? - I understood so.</p>

               <p>The day before you was at the chest, and saw that paper? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You understood afterwards your brother took it out? - I did.</p>

               <p>Who did you understand it from? - I never saw my brother till the next morning, then my brother told me that he had taken out the covers, and there was only two blank sheets of paper.</p>

               <p>Now, that cover which you supposed to contain the last will of the testator, your brother told you he had taken out of the chest, did not your brother tell you distinctly, that he took out that cover the day before the man died? - I think he did, I do not know whether he took it out the day before or that same morning.</p>

               <p>Your brother went with you to the chest the day before his death? - Yes.</p>

               <p>For what purpose did he go? - He had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110040"/> a power of attorney to do business, I did not ask him.</p>

               <p>You do not know what he went for? - I do not think he went for the purpose of taking out the will at that time, he did not tell me, I was with him, there is a little closet close by the parlour.</p>

               <p>What were you both doing there? - I cannot recollect what he was doing.</p>

               <p>What did you go to the chest for? - Accidentally, talking to him I went to the chest, and I saw it lay, and I took it up, and laid it down again.</p>

               <p>Were not you present at

            's examination before the Magistrates? - No, I was not, I was at Manchester, I never saw his examination, I never was present at any examination of his concerning that paper.</p>

               <p>You have told us that for two or three months before the death of Sawtell, he was not able to lift the lid of that chest up? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>It was very large? - Yes.</p>

               <p>It required some strength to lift it, did not it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had not Sawtell the key? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was there no method by which he could get at any thing in that chest? - I do not know, except it could come through the key-hole.</p>

               <p>Why it is very easy for me to give the key to another person, then it does not jump through the key-hole you know; I may perhaps get at something that is in the chest, without its getting through the key-hole to me? - Certainly, Sir.</p>

               <p>You have been examined in the Commons, and there you have given an account of the conversation that passed before Sawtell, relative to the supposed will of the 14th of November, you have stated that the testator declared to you, that he had signed papers, and that he might have signed a will, and that therefore he would make another will? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, I have had the curiosity to turn to your examination, and I will read it to you that I may not misquote it, that the leonent (whom I take to be

               <p>Do I read right or not? - I do not know what my deposition was entirely.</p>

               <p>Do you fancy it is to be got rid of in that way; when I am stating this, that to day you have said here upon your oath, that the tastator in declaring his reasons for making a will, told you, that he might have signed a will brought him by

               <p>All I want to fix is this, that so far from this man having declared that as a reason to you, you yourself was the first person that suggested it? - It certainly was the reason.</p>

               <p>Now, then having sworn in these two different ways, whether the suggestion of his having made a will did not proceed from you, and not from the testator Sawtell? - I do not know, we were talking of it a long while at the King's Arms, in Holborn.</p>

               <p>I say upon your oath, Sir, who began the conversation first? - He said probably he might have brought a will.</p>

               <p>But I want to know who first suggested that circumstance? - Then I say, I posibly might; we had a conversation of an hour and half, and who suggested it at first, I cannot say, but I know that was the reason.</p>

            ) thereupon remarking; now, I ask you as an honest man in the face of this audience, whether you did not first suggest to Mr. Sawtell, that they might have brought him a will; now, answer that as you please? - The conversation began about the Goodridges bringing so many papers, but whether it might or not, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you believe that you did? - Probably I might.</p>

               <p>Do you rather believe you did? - I might.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110041"/>You said something about a strange attorney who was with Sawtell, when he executed those deeds you have mentioned; be so good as to tell me who that strange attorney was? - I do not know; the attorney at the execution of the assignment of the policy, I believe was Mr. Gregory.</p>

               <p>You was a witness to it? - I think I was.</p>

               <p>Look at that paper, you are a witness to it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you take that to be a will? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>You saw Mr. Sawtell execute this? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was it executed when it bore date? - I think it was.</p>

               <p>Was it read over to him by Mr. Gregory? - I think it it was.</p>

               <p>Did not you know perfectly well, that Mr. Gregory was the attorney for the Goodridge's? - I never knew Mr. Gregory, not never saw him till then, I never heard his name mentioned.</p>

               <p>Who recommended Mr. Mumford? - I did, after Mr. Falkner's death.</p>

               <p>You say Mrs. Goodridge was a niece to the wife of Mr. Sawtell? - She was.</p>

               <p>You say Mr. Sawtell said he was very glad to get rid of a plague? - Yes.</p>

               <p>That year, in August 1782, he was giving them houses? - I understood he was not giving them at all, he was to receive the rents before the leases were out, that is what he understood I am sure.</p>

               <p>Did you ever happen to hear that Mrs. Goodridge was the natural daughter of Mr. Sawtell? - I never heard that.</p>

               <p>Never by accident? - No.</p>

               <p>Perhaps it is an invention of mine just now occurred? - I never heard it.</p>

               <p>You and your brother kept a pretty constant watch on Sawtell? - We were pretty constantly with him, if I was not with him he was very angry with me, probably once a week I might spend an evening with him.</p>

               <p>Because in your original examination, you said, you and your brother were constantly with him? - I generally called upon him every day.</p>

               <p>Now, as far as you could make it consistent to your respective conveniences, you did look sharp after this man? - My brother was there generally every day.</p>

               <p>May be your brother is a pretty near relation to Mr. Sawtell? - Not that I heard of.</p>

               <p>May be you are a relation to him? - I never understood that either my brother or me were relations to him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. The cover that you took out of the box with your brother the day before his death, was that the cover you put into the chest on the 4th of November? - It was.</p>

               <p>Had it a sufficient mark about it, according to the best of your opinion, so as to enable you to say it was the same? - It certainly was.</p>

               <p>Now, as to the conversation that took place between you and Mr. Sawtell, does your memory serve you sufficiently to say, whether you was the man that first suggested that a will might come among the papers, or he to you? - Upon my word, the conversation lasted so long, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Who was it that was there upon that occasion? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Was he the attorney employed by Sawtell? - No, Sir, I heard that he did Mr. Goodridge's business.</p>

               <p>What did Sawtell say about the houses? - He said they were assigned over to 
               <persName id="t17860111-2-person248">

            , for the purpose of his having them after Sawtell's lease was out, there was but a few years to come, the quarter day after Sawtell went on purpose to recommend Mr. Goodridge to have them,</p>

               <p>What was the value of this assignment? - I do not know, I have heard it was upwards of forty pounds a year, it was not communicated to me till I saw Mr.

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I apprehend it is premature upon an indictment for forgery to read the very instrument, upon which the indictment proceeds, unless they can establish some fact or other, which fixes the prisoner with it.</p>

               <p>Court. Last night we did it, we called a man who received a bill from the prisoner, then you may call a man to say it is not his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. This is the very will that is charged as the forgery on this indictment I apprehend that before you can read this will, you must shew by some sort of evidence fit to go to the Jury, that they are the forgers of the will.</p>

               <p>Court. No, their producing the will, lays the burthen upon them to shew it is not a forgery; suppose it does not bear the resemblance of the testator's hand writing, how can it be seen unless it is read.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I submit, my Lord, that you are not to taint the minds of the Jury with hearing the instrument read, unless you shew that the thing is in fact forged, no matter by whom; my objection is, you should not read this till you have given proper cause to the Jury and the Court, to believe this is a forged instrument.</p>

               <p>Court. How does the reading it convey a prejudice that it is forged, it conveys a contrary idea; they admit upon the face of it, it is a good will, then they avoid it by saying, though it does appear to you upon the face of it, yet we take take upon ourselves to prove it is a bad will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Suppose an action was brought on any instrument, the authority of it must be proved before it is read, the jit of this indictment is the point of authority.</p>

               <p>Court. Here is an instrument coming from the hands of one of the prisoners, it is read to shew, not that it is not the will, but I shall take it as it appears to be, till it is shewn to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Then we have no objection.</p>

               <p>(The will read as in the indictment, and examined by the record.)</p>

             used to be there often.</p>

               <p>Did he set up at nights with the prisoner after you and your fellow servant went to bed? - Yes, Sir, many nights.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to remember the first? - the 14th of December, 1782.</p>

               <p>Was your late master at home or did he go out on the 15th of December? - The next day he went to Newgate-street and dined there.</p>

               <p>Did you go with him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>At that time was he able to write? - That I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>But by his state of health I mean? - I suppose he could, he could handle a knife and fork.</p>

               <p>On this 14th of December, do you happen to remember what time he went to bed? - I put him to bed, but I cannot tell the time.</p>

               <p>I do not ask you as to a quarter of an hour or half an hour? - He generally used to go to bed, at that time, about nine, sometimes sooner, sometimes later.</p>

               <p>Did you that night see anybody or hear anybody in the house? - No, nobody but what I left, I left Mr. Goodridge to set up with him.</p>

               <p>You remember an iron chest that your master had? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember what keys there were to it? - The key of the iron chest wasby itself.</p>

               <p>Was there more than one key do you know? - There were two, Mr. Slack of Newgate-street had the one, and the other was in my master's pocket.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to remember where that key that was at home was on the 14th of December? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where was it then? - On the 14th of December, before anybody came into the house, I took care of all the keys out of my master's pocket, and put them in my own pockets, and I put my breeches under my head all that night; the next morning Mr. Slack came, and I desired him to take care that every thing was clear, for I had done with every thing, I told him Mr. Goodridge had set up the night before and then I had nothing to do but to take care of my master.</p>

               <p>Then during his illness and at any time before his death, do you remember his saying any thing to you if he was taken ill, worse than ordinary, what you was to do? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was that? - When anything rendered him ill, or incapable of his own business, I was to go to Mr. Slack, of Newgate-street, for he was the man that took care of his property.</p>

               <p>Now in what stage of his illness had you received these instructions from him? - I had these instructions for eight or nine years, ever since Mr. Slack was executor always, I do not recollect that he gave me any orders to fetch Mr. Slack in any part of his illness.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any particular day or night that he so sent or ordered you? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any thing that he said about Mr. Slack or about yourself? - He always told me Mr. Slack was to pay me my legacy.</p>

               <p>Now, do you remember any time before his death that he said any thing particular to you? - Yes, I remember three days before he died, I went to him, and he opened his eyes and looked at me, and asked me how I did, and I made him answer very well, I hoped he was the same, or I wished he was better, or something of that kind, and he desired me to pray for him for he was not for this world, and he hoped Mr. Slack would pay me what he had left me; that was all he said, it was the last sensible word he spoke to me, that was on Thursday, the 6th of February, he died on the Sunday after that.</p>

               <p>Now, during the time that you lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110044"/> there, do you remember who had access to his money and all the valuables that were in this iron chest besides himself? - Nobody besides himself, but Mr. Slack, or somebody by his directions.</p>

               <p>Could he himself open that iron chest within a month or two of his death? - I do not think he could open it since the iron chest was in his possession.</p>

               <p>How long had he had it? - The brother died in 1777, then directly after that the iron chest came into his house.</p>

               <p>Now, when he did go to it he took people always to assist him? - When he went to the iron chest he always called one of the men to help him, I have helped him many times.</p>

               <p>Was it wrote on the other side? - No, Sir, I think there was none on the other side, but to the best of my remembrance, it was three parts of the way down, I think it was about a fortnight before Mr. Sawtell's death, I am not certain to a day or two.</p>

               <p>Which way was it written? - Down ways of the paper.</p>

               <p>Was there one or two sheets at that time? - I think, to the best of my knowledge, there was but one.</p>

               <p>Where did you see him? - In the same place, he was there when I left work, and he might have been there for an hour or two before I left work.</p>

               <p>Now, what secret was it? - When I saw this will of Mr. Sawtell's I thought it was an improper place to make a will in.</p>

               <p>"I received some few lines from a friend of yours, and I wish I had it in my power to help you in your distress, but you have called on me so often, that I have distressed myself, and I am astonished at you to send to me now, and because I have not trouble enough of my own, I must be teazed with Mr. Underwood's affairs; and as to promises, you, I believe, and Mr. V. thinks but very little about, when you have got your turn served; for remember last time, that when your turn was served, it was all well, but as to the promises, was all forgot.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Fielding.)</p>



               <p>I knew the deceased Mr. Sawtell, ten or eleven years before his death and up to his death.</p>

               <p>Did you know of any intimacies subsisting between him and Mr. Slack? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Of what nature were they? - Every day Mr. Sawtell went to Mr. Slack's house, almost.</p>

               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Which of them? - Two of them.</p>

               <p>Did Evans ever make any application, and when, relative to the will of Mr. Sawtell? - Mr. Evans in January, 1783, came to my house in the afternoon, and asked me if I was engaged for the evening, I told him no, he then asked me if I would come to his house that night, about eleven, or between eleven and twelve; there would be an attorney at his house, with some few friends, that would go with me from thence to Mr. Sawtell's house in Brook-street, to be witness to his will.</p>

               <p>This you say was in January? - In January.</p>

               <p>Do you know what part of January? - About the 23d, I asked him in whose favor the will was made, he said in Mr. Goodridge's.</p>

               <p>Which of the Goodridges? - He did not mention any christian name.</p>

               <p>Did you know the Goodridges before? - I knew Nathaniel; then I asked him if it would come to the ears of Mr. Slack, in Newgate-street, if I was to be a witness to the will; and he said, he believed in course of time it would, and I was to have a suit of cloaths or a ring, if I would go, and be witness to the will; when I found it was not in favor of Mr. Slack, I told him I hoped he would excuse me, he left me in the afternoon, about three, four, or five, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110048"/> cannot particularly speak to the hour, but it was after dinner.</p>

               <p>Did you see Evans at any time afterwards, and resume the conversation? - I met him a few days afterwards, and asked him if he had got a witness, and he said, yes, the business was done, nothing else passed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. You are a friend of Mr. Slack's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I believe Mr. Evans knew perfectly well, you were a friend of Mr. Slack's? - No doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Evans did not wish that Mr. Slack should know any thing about this will making, as he said it must come to his ears in time; did you gather from that, that this was to be secret business, and that Evans did not wish Mr. Slack should know it? - I took it to be so.</p>

               <p>And therefore he came to you, who was a friend of Slack's, about a thing that Slack was not to know; is not that a very odd thing, that a man, out of five or six hundred thousand people, should six upon you, who he might be sure would go and tell him? - Evans desired me to keep it a secret; I was as much a friend to Evans as to Slack.</p>

               <p>So your evidence appears to day; had Mr. Evans no friends, think you, that were not friends to Slack? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I ask you this plain question, if you wanted to do a thing you meant to keep a secret from me, would you go and pitch upon a particular friend of mine, above all others, to tell it to in preference to any strangers; would you now? - I do not know whether I should or not.</p>

               <p>Look at the Jury, and tell me whether, as a man of sense, and a man who has not lost his reason, would you, if you wanted to injure me in any such a way, that I should not be able to correct it, would you pitch upon a particular friend of mine, upon one of these gentlemen here; would you be guilty of such an absurdity? - No, not at all, there is no absurdity in it.</p>

               <p>Would you do so, would you conduct yourself in that way? - I cannot tell you any more.</p>

               <p>But I will make you; would you do so, as a man that is not in bedlam; is Mr. Evans a fool; was Mr. Evans in his right senses; is he a prudent, discreet man? - I suppose so.</p>

               <p>Why should you think he is a greater fool than you? - I do not know; I am very happy I acted in the manner I did in the business.</p>

               <p>When might it first occur to you, that this was a material circumstance; did not you go to Mr. Slack directly, and say to him, I would have you be on your guard, things are not going on well here, I have refused a suit of cloaths and a ring; did you tell Slack that? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Then you are not so good a friend to him as you described: when might it first occur to you, to tell any body that you was interested about it? - It was some months before Mr. Slack knew that I knew any thing about it.</p>

               <p>When you was sworn in the commons, you said, you lived with him on the most friendly and intimate footing imaginable? - What kept this in my breast, was the intimacy with the prisoner; he is a relation of my wife's.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you met him in the street afterwards? - I cannot speak to the time in this business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Had you any greater degree of friendship or intimacy with Mr. Slack than you had with Evans? - No.</p>

               <p>The 23d of January was but a short time before Mr. Sawtell's death? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you know in what condition Mr. Sawtell happened to be in at the time of this application? - I cannot say, I never was at the house, any more than what I have heard, Mr.

             came to my house, about ten in the morning, he had a shilling's worth of candles; I asked him how Mr. Sawtell did, and he said he had been sitting up that night with him, and he was much as usual; that he had been making all over to him that night by promises, that he was disposed to alter his will in his favour, and desired him to get his attorney for that purpose; but it must be done privately, as Mr. Slack and Atkinson were frequently backwards and forwards; he said he did not know any body that had a greater influence with Ned and Betty than I had, they were the servants of Mr. Sawtell, and begged I would go for that purpose, and speak to them, if they could be entrusted with it, there was opportunity enough, I informed him that I was going to Greenwich that day, and should not see them, he pressed me once or twice, I told him I should be sorry if I should be the instrument of depriving Ned and Betty of what I knew Mr. Sawtell had designed for them, as Mr. Sawtell had frequently informed me that he had left them something handsome, he said whatever their legacy was, it should be doubled, and I should have something handsome, I said d - n their money I will have nothing to do with it: whether I asked him to drink, or whether he asked me to drink, I cannot say, but upon that we went to the house of

            , and then had a pint of purl in the bar, and nearly the same conversation was repeated in the presence of me, Goodridge, and Evans, and on Goodridge saying, that Sawtell was disposed to to alter his will, Evans said, get it done, get it done.</p>

               <p>Upon that occasion did any thing more pass, or did you part? - I made answer that if Mr. Sawtell was in his senses, and disposed to alter his will, he might do it without the assistance of Ned, Betty, or me; I left them and went to Greenwich; on the Tuesday following, Mrs. Goodridge, Nathaniel's wife, met about, fifty doors from my own house.</p>

               <p>Court. That is no evidence, the prisoner was not there? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you know Underwood at that time? - No, I never saw him till I saw him at Hicks's Hall, a year ago.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know Mr. Sawtell in any part of his life time, make a mark instead of writing his name? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. Mr. Eames, I take this to be the third time that you have given an account upon oath of these transactions? - It is.</p>

               <p>You were first examined in the Commons on the 26th of April 1784? - I was.</p>

               <p>You were examined on the behalf of the Slack's? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>You were examined for the second time on the 9th of August 1785, sixteen months afterwards, is that true? - I believe it is, I cannot recollect the dates.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know that Mr. Underwood gave his information, and was committed upon it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was Underwood in custody when you was first examined in April 1784? - No.</p>

               <p>Was not you present at Underwood's examination? - No.</p>

               <p>You heard when he was committed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was it after you were first examined? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was you or was you not in Bow-street, when Underwood was examined? - No.</p>

               <p>Now Mr. Eames, this conversation which you have proved to day, namely between Mr. Goodridge and you, did you on the first examination in the Commons, say one word about that conversation? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Is there one word of what you have sworn to day in your first examination? - No.</p>

               <p>Not one word? - No.</p>

               <p>Were you sworn, Mr. Eames, to swear the whole truth? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Are not they examined to interrogatories there?</p>

               <p>Sir Thomas. That is the whole.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. The second time you was examined was after Underwood was in custody? - I believe it was.</p>

               <p>When did you for the first time disclose all this you have been telling to day? - I disclosed it at Doctors Commons, and to other people the day it was spoken.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110050"/>Who subpoened you to come into the Commons? - Mr. Slack.</p>

               <p>Did nobody ask you what you could prove? - I never was asked, to my knowledge, one word by the parties concerned.</p>

               <p>Now, observe, you stand here in a public Court of Justice, before a great number of your fellow subjects; how do you reconcile to the character and conduct of an honest man, to have known that transaction, and not discovered it? - It was a matter that hung much upon my spirits, and as such I could not form a resolution to declare it; the examiner at Doctors Commons did not ask me a word about it, it was a matter that I thought would lead to a criminal business, and I was afraid to utter it at first, but when there was a criminal business about it, I knew it must come forward, and I discovered it to Mr. Boucher, of Spital-fields.</p>

               <p>Why must it come forward if you did not disclose it? - I had disclosed it to Mr. Boucher; give me leave to inform you, that is with reluctance that I now stand here, and if I had not been subpoened, I should not have stood here.</p>

               <p>Between the two examinations, did you tell any person, no matter whom, that you had disclosed all you knew, upon your oath? - No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Pray, do you know any man of the name of Lawrence Green? - Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Now, you never happened to tell him what I say? - He must know that I told him all that I knew after the death of Mr. Sawtell, within a few days after the death of Mr. Sawtell, I did tell Mr. Green the very thing.</p>

               <p>Did you never say to Mr. Green, I have been examined at the Commons, and there I disclosed all I knew of the matter? - No.</p>

               <p>You never did? - I do not know to my knowledge that I did.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that you did not, look at the Jury, and either affirm or deny as you chuse? - I never told Lawrence Green; I had said all I knew in Doctors Commons.</p>

               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Pollard? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Slack is a friend of yours? - No, he is a great enemy,</p>

               <p>Did you ever say to Pollard, that you wished for Mr. Slack to get the day? - I never did.</p>

               <p>You never said that if Mr. Slack got the day, you should get an hundred pounds? - I never did, Mr. Slack is no friend of mine, nor ever was.</p>

               <p>You do not deal together? - Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>What, considerably? - Not very considerably, I deal with him for cotton.</p>

               <p>How does it happen, that in this great City of London, you chuse to deal with a man that is your enemy? - You may make as much of that as you please.</p>

               <p>This is one of the new phenomena of this cause, I want to have it understood, you say,

               <p>You never happened to have any conversation by accident (for if you converse with an enemy, you know it can only be by accident) about this hundred? - No, never, no never, spoke to him on the subject; nor to Pollard nor any one man in the world on that account.</p>

               <p>Your box was searched, I believe, you did not leave the family with any other reason, but because your mistress was dead? - No.</p>

               <p>When did your mistress die? - In May.</p>

               <p>How came you to go to Mr. Dodson? - I meant to live in that part, I had no place then; I left the family in July, about a fortnight after Dobson left the family, I had lived in that part of the country, and I went down to see an acquaintance.</p>

               <p>Your box was searched? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I believe you was a little angry about it? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Did you mention it to any body? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who did you mention it to afterwards? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>Do you remember mentioning it to Mr. Dobson? - Yes, after I went down.</p>

               <p>Did you ever say to any body that you would certainly be revenged on your master for it? - No, Sir, never.</p>

               <p>What did Dobson say when you told him of your box being searched? - He did not say any thing, only it was a very wrong thing.</p>

               <p>Did not he say that he was very angry, that he would be up with Mr. Goodridge for it, that he would be revenged for it? - That was all he said, that I recollect, he never said any thing about being revenged.</p>

               <p>Did he say what he would have done, if he had known it before? - No, Sir, not that I recollect.</p>

               <p>Did he say to you that he would have divulged their secret, if he had known they would have used you so ill? - He did not say any thing to me then of it.</p>

               <p>How long do you think it was before you went into service? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>How long do you think? - I had no place to go to, or else I should have gone sooner, I w ent to Walton to see an acquaintance, I lived at Weybridge, I went to see an acquaintance of mine in Surry.</p>

               <p>How came you to go to Wilton at all? - On purpose to see them, I went to see a fellow servant.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath was there any body at Walton besides Dodson that you went to see? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Now, did not you live under his protection when you was at Walton? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did not you lodge at the same house with him? - No, not where he lodged, I lodged at a public house there six weeks as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Where were your friends? - My acquaintance I had was a fellow servant of mine, that I lived with at Chertsey.</p>

               <p>Where was you between the time that you quitted Mr. Goodridge, and went into service again? - I was at Chertsey.</p>

               <p>What was the name of the house that you lodged at, at Walton? - At one Mr. Clarke's I lodged when I first went down at Chertsey, Dodson came to me at Chertsey, I sent nobody to him to tell him I was there.</p>

               <p>How came he to guess? - He knew I was coming to that part to see my fellow servant I told him I should go down in that part.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110052"/>How was it you did not go into place, are you married? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long have you been married? - I cannot say to the day.</p>

               <p>About what time was it, and where? - I have no right to answer you to that.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no harm in your answering to that.</p>

               <p>Now, upon your oath, where were you married to Dodson, in what church? - I have no right to tell you that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. His Lordship has just told you must? - No, Sir, I shall not.</p>

               <p>Now after you have been telling that story, do you refuse answering that question before the Jury, and do you expect credit if you do.</p>

               <p>Court. You must answer that, where was you married? - I did not come upon that subject.</p>

               <p>That does not signify, you must answer that question?</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let Dodson go out of Court till she has answered that question? -</p>

               <p>Court. You must answer? - No, Sir, I have no right to answer.</p>

               <p>Yes, you must, you are under the obligation to answer? - Not to that subject.</p>

               <p>Yes, you are.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you mean to stand to it that you are married? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then you must answer it, there can be no harm in answering, if you do not answer, the consequence is, I must commit you to prison? - That is not what I came upon.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord tells you that you must answer, if you are not married confess it.</p>

               <p>Court. You must say when you was married and where.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. If it is not true that you are married, the sooner you retract it the better.</p>

               <p>Court. Were you married in a church? - I shall not answer to that, for I did not come upon that subject.</p>

               <p>Are you apprehensive of bringing upon yourself any penalty or punishment by answering? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Then there can be no reason for your not answering, if you do not answer I shall commit you presently, if you are not married and you have hastily said that which is not true, you are at liberty to retract it again; are you married? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Then I am sure I will not ask you another question.</p>

               <p>You still know that he used you very ill? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Who applied to you to be examined in the Commons? - Mr. Slack sent some young man with his compliments and would be very glad I would attend there.</p>

               <p>Who applied to you to know if you could prove Evans's hand-writing? - The very same person.</p>

               <p>Did you see him sign this receipt for rent that you have been talking about? - Yes, I never saw this will till I was examined in the Commons.</p>

               <p>You knew at that time that Evans was in custody as having been concerned in forgery? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You knew that this piece of paper was to be produced in evidence against him? - Yes, when it came there, not before.</p>

               <p>You thought it was material to go there? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then how comes it you swore this in the Commons that you did not know or was not aware that the paper you then proved would materially affect him? - I did not know till then, I swore to the best of my knowledge, I should suppose it was his handwriting, I should suppose within myself, by the manner of the writing, it was his.</p>

               <p>When you knew it was to be used against him in a criminal prosecution, how came you to dare to swear that you was not aware it would materially injure him; did you read the receipt that was given to you? - I only looked at the name.</p>

               <p>I know Evans.</p>

               <p>Is that his hand-writing? - So far as the letter I, and the E, and the scrawl at the bottom, I know no further, he has signed bills for me for fires, when fires happened about the neighbourhood, I am engine keeper of St. Andrews.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you believe the whole or do you disbelieve it? - I will not take upon myself to say the whole of it; I believe it is as far as the I and the E, and the scrawl.</p>

               <p>What do you mean to say that one half of it is his writing and the other half not? - If I had his hand-writing in my possession I would not swear to it.</p>

               <p>What is your belief? - My belief, if I was to go so far as to speak the truth is, that it is his.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Mr. Scott, if I understand you right, you say this, that you have not acquaintance enough with this person's hand-writing to take upon you to swear in such a case as this, that that is his handwriting, and though it may look like it, you have not a firm belief in his hand-writing? - God forbid.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, in the most trumpery civil action in the Court of King's Bench, this would not do.</p>

               <p>Court. How often have you seen him write? - I have seen him write very often.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - No further than what I see here, I verily believe that to be his hand-writing, but I will not swear it.</p>

               <p>You have seen him write? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you, by seeing him write, acquainted with his hand-writing? - Yes, I perfectly believe it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I never yet in my life, in a capital case, heard a man permitted to say that he has a firm belief of his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Do you think this a capital case, and do you know you are examining upon your oath, and will you take upon yourself, in the presence of God and your country, to say you believe that is his hand-writing? - I really believe it is.</p>

               <p>Then how came you to distinguish between the letters I and E and all the rest of the letters? - I see they are all joined together.</p>

               <p>You said that as far as the letters I and E you thought they looked like it? - In regard to the letter E, he always made the head of the E larger than the bottom.</p>

               <p>How long is it since you saw him write? - Eight years ago.</p>

               <p>You have not seen this writing which I hold in my hand now since you said you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110054"/> could not take upon you to say it was the hand-writing, but that the I and the E were, and that you partly believed it; now since you made use of that expression you never have seen the paper, for I have had it in my hand ever since, how came you to swear to the contrary now? - There is the top of the letter I, he always used to make it smaller, I do partly believe it, and I do believe it from my soul; if my child was gone to sea for twenty-eight years I should know him again.</p>

               <p>What are you, Sir; I believe you are the man that declared war with the King of France? - That is not the question.</p>

               <p>Are you the man? - I am.</p>

               <p>How long did you stay in Newgate on that business? - Not at all.</p>

               <p>What gaol was it then? - I was two days in the Compter but very well maintained.</p>

               <p>You are a thief-taker, are not you, Sir? - Aye, if I saw any man pick your pocket I would take him.</p>

               <p>You are so much a thief-taker, that you seem to have caught yourself to day? - No, I think not.</p>

            ? - I do.</p>

               <p>Look at the receipt and tell us whether you ever saw it in the hands of Underwood.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. I object to this, because it is a transaction between the witness and Underwood, neither of the prisoners being present or a party.</p>

               <p>Court. The objection to this evidence is merely to lay a foundation to introduce Underwood, first of all it has been proved to you that Underwood wrote this.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, this evidence cannot at all be received, I say the Court will not do that which is palpably, grossly wrong on the face of it, if they cannot examine into what he has said, can they examine into what he does? he is so bad a witness, he is so little to be credited, that no act of his, no conversation of his, no testimony of his, even on his oath, can be so received as to go to the Jury, they bring this man to shew that this paper was at one time in the hands of Underwood; it would be good evidence if he was to be tried, suppose in a burglary, if any of the prisoners pledge any thing, it is evidence against them: Though there is no doubt about his guilt, the only question is, whether he singly is guilty, or whether he with other persons is guilty, and not the prisoners: he is a man who cannot be received unless most strongly confirmed; if such a witness were permitted to lay his head together with any other person with whom he might advise, to have these things and shew them all about the town, so as to get rid of his own examination, there would be an end of the boasted liberties of the country; I never recollect any such evidence has been received yet.</p>

               <p>Court. It has been proved by other witnesses that this is the hand-writing of Evans, the only question is whether this may be received, now I think it is admissible evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. I am most clearly of opinion with the learned Judge that this evidence is admissible, the objection is not pointed to the witness, the evidence is this, a paper has been produced in Court, which, by some evidence admissible, no doubt but upon the credit of which the Jury are hereafter to decide; is proved to be in the handwriting of one of the prisoners, then the other evidence is to shew that the paper was at such a time in such a place, and that is to be shewn by the evidence of a witness standing unimpeached.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time, and when, see that paper in the hands of Underwood? - I saw the paper in Underwood's hands at the time he was committed to the Fleet, I saw this in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110055"/> the possession of Mrs. Underwood and him together, in September, 1784.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. How happened it that Underwood was in the Fleet Prison? - I do not know what for, but he was committed by my Lord Chancellor.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear Underwood say what it was for? - I cannot say, I dare say he would not open his mind to me on the occasion.</p>

               <p>Was not it about perjury? - I never meddle with any thing that does not immediately concern me, I do not know.</p>

               <p>You recollect you have seen a paper in the hands of Mr. Underwood, the paper subscribed by the name of Evans? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did you read it? - I did, and to the best of my knowledge it is the same paper, I do not speak positively.</p>

               <p>In your examination in the Commons you said thus,</p>

               <p>"This deponent did not then peruse the whole of the said writing, but to the best of his present recollection did observe the name of Evans thereto subscribed." I have asked whether you read the whole of that paper purporting to be a receipt from Evans to Underwood, and you say you did; now I say that previous to this, you were examined in the Commons, and you said, that the deponent did not then peruse the whole of the said writing, but to the best of his present recollection did observe the name of Evans thereto subscribed, but did not observe what his christian name was to it; now observe, you first deny positively that you perused the whole, then you add that to the best of your recollection you saw the name of Evans thereto subscribed, but did not observe what his christian name was; is it true what I have been reading, is your evidence in the Commons? - It is.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Did you or did you not read enough of it, so as to be sure it is the same? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. What do you happen to know of this Mr. Underwood? - Some years ago a person of the name of Evans turned swindler in India, and gave my brother a draught drawn on one

            , I found him to be the son of Dr. Underwood of the Borough, a man of the most unblemished character; I saw the young man at that time in very low circumstances, when I urged him to use his industry to get my money, which he did on the swindler's coming to London, this led me to a little kind of respect for him.</p>

               <p>But what I want to know is the general character of this Mr Underwood? - I think it very indifferent, very indifferent indeed.</p>

               <p>You do not happen to know how he got into the Fleet? - Not absolutely, but I heard it was by the commitment of the Lord Chancellor.</p>

             sworn on the Voire Dire.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Erskine.</p>

               <p>Mr. Underwood, I shall trouble you with a very few questions before your examination; first, I shall be obliged to you if you will tell me whether that is your handwriting or no? (shews him the instructions he produced to Mr. Gregory.) - This is my hand-writing.</p>

               <p>You are a subscribing witness to this will which you now come to invalidate.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. That is no question on the Voire Dire, on the Voire Dire the only question is, whether he has such an interest as totally rejects his evidence.</p>

               <p>Court. You may attack a witness two different ways.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I conceive the rule of Voire Dire is this, that before a witness is examined in chief, he shall be asked such questions as the Court shall think proper, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110056"/> am bound to take every thing that he says to be true under the Voire Dire, I am entitled to ask that man any one question which I think fit, to which he shall think fit to answer, and when I have got all these answers, I say, that upon these facts disclosed by the witness himself, and taking them to be true, he is not by the law of England a competent witness.</p>

               <p>Court. Go on.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I ask you whether you are not a subscribing witness to the authenticity and truth of that will? - I am subscribing witness to the authenticity, but not to the truth.</p>

               <p>Jury. Then you come to tell us a lye?</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. It is vastly beyond my conception to understand you, whether or no you did not mean to attest that that was such a will? - I cannot say that I did as an attorney.</p>

               <p>Did you sign this will,</p>

               <p>"Signed, sealed, published, and declared by the within-named testator, as and for his last will and testament, in the presence of us who in his presence, and in the presence of each other, and at his request, have signed our names as witnesses hereto? - Before it was signed or sealed I subscribed my name.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, you thought proper to subscribe your name as a witness before the will was sealed and before it was executed? - When the truth of the business comes out, you will know the whole of it.</p>

               <p>When shall we know that truth comes from you? - When the whole of the business is related.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Gregory? - I am.</p>

               <p>As there are so many persons present, I may venture to trust you with a bit of paper, though I shall want it back again; perhaps that is your hand-writing? - It is.</p>

               <p>Then I think you delivered this paper which I am now about to read to you, to Mr. Gregory. (Reads.)</p>

               <p>"On or about August, 1781, I first saw Mr. Sawtell, I was sent for to Mr. Sawtell's several times, to the house of Mr. Goodridge, about Mrs. Reeves, and on my informing him of the hardship of the case, Mr. Sawtell advanced five guineas. On the 6th of November, 1782, I accidentally called at Mr. Goodridge's, and there I saw Mr. Sawtell, and, after some time, he asked if I was not the attorney who had Mrs. Reeve's cause, which being answered in the affirmative, he, after some time, said he had made his will, but was very unhappy or dissatisfied, or words to that effect, and then applied to me for that purpose, but said it must be done with secresy, and seemed determined, and desired they would leave the room, they accordingly did, he then produced a will he had made two days before, and desired I would immediately copy it, which I did, I returned the same to him again, and then took his instructions, when I had done, he desired I would meet him again on the Lord Mayor's day, and after making some immaterial alterations, Mr. Goodridge and he went, I think to Tallow-Chandler's Hall, but first desiring I would not bring the will to his house till he sent to me, but on the 14th of December Mr. Goodridge came to me, and desired me to attend him at Mr. Sawtell's house, at a quarter after ten at night, we all went up stairs into Mr. Sawtell's bed-room, who was awake, and said I am glad you are come; I accordingly proceeded to read the will, with which he seemed perfectly satisfied, and said it would be very troublesome in the situation he was to write his name, I told him his mark would do as well; then he executed the will, and, applying himself to Mr. Goodridge, said, God bless you, take care of what I have done for you, or words to that purpose; we all went away." This which I have been reading to the Court and Jury, you have acknowledged to be your hand-writing and delivered as such solemnly to Mr. Gregory? - I did.</p>

               <p>The will was contested in the Commons? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You gave him this account under your own hand? - I did, I believe, before the will was proved.</p>

               <p>Did not you at a subsequent time give that paper to Mr. Gregory? - I did.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110057"/>Now, look Sir further at this paper, and tell me upon your oath (if that makes any difference) whether you did not give that as a copy of the instructions which you took down from Mr. Sawtell's mouth to make his will? - I did.</p>

               <p>Reads,</p>

               <p>"As far as concerning the rest of my estate and effects of what nature or kind soever, I leave to the said

            , &amp;c. for ever."</p>

               <p>You told Mr. Gregory, I believe, that there was some alterations which the deceased Mr. Sawtell had suggested to you at the time of taking the instructions; this is a whimsical situation I am in, to be obliged to take what you say for truth; this you gave as a copy of the instructions which you took down from old Sawtell for his will? - I did.</p>

               <p>You was afterwards examined in Doctors Commons, and you gave a very long and circumstantial account of that business, upon your oath; you positively swore, you was then solemnly sworn upon the gospel to speak the truth? - Not a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Reads,</p>

               <p>"And is so assured in his conscience, and firmly believes that there was not the least force, fraud, imposition, persuasion, artifice, device or contrivance, used or practised by any person whatever, to prevail upon or induce the deceased to make that will, but the deceased appeared to the deponent to be in his perfect senses, and capable of knowing what he did, the witness never saw him after the execution of the will, and knows nothing of his manner of living." Here then you did declare that this was a true valid will made by yourself, and that you saw it executed, did you swear that or did you not? - I did swear it.</p>

               <p>I believe you was cross examined on forty five cross-interrogatories in that Court? - I was.</p>

               <p>Persisted to give this full account of it? - I did.</p>

               <p>And Mr. Underwood, are you come here in the character of a witness, to tell my Lord and the Jury that every thing you deposed to before, was absolutely false, and without any foundation? - I came here as a criminal.</p>

               <p>That is no answer to my question, you do not come so, I wish you was at the other end of the Court? - I certainly have entered into a base combination with the prisoners, I can only say this, I have done a wrong thing, and that I am sorry for it.</p>

               <p>How are we to know that you are not doing a wrong thing to day, then you come here to falsity your attention to Mr. Gregory? - I am a criminal in the business, and I come here to make all the reparation I can.</p>

               <p>Are you come here to falsify, upon your oath, that which you swore in the Commons, and that which you delivered to Mr. Gregory? - A man that does wrong, has a right to do right.</p>

               <p>Do you, aye or no? - I am come to do right.</p>

               <p>Do you come to falsify every thing you have heretofore sworn? - Not a doubt of it but I am.</p>

               <p>All of it! - Yes, all that I have done on account of this will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I feel myself in a situation so perfectly new, not because I am inexperienced in the history of judicatures, not because I am inexperienced in the history of civilized society; but because I am unacquainted with any case like this, and therefore, if I should not be able to give all the assistance to my clients, which in humanity and justice I owe them, I hope I shall stand excused; I am so astonished at what I hear and see, as not to be able to recollect the language in which I address your Lordship; I must make three objections to the competency of this witness, and I make them after cross-examination, on the Voire Dire, that I may have an opportunity of taking them collectively, and not separately: the three objections I make to his evidence, are these: first, that he appears on his own confession, and upon the statement of the counsel for the prosecution with respect to him, to be an accomplice in this crime, with which the prisoners are charged; and I mean to contend before your Lordship, that there is not a sufficient foundation laid in evidence, such as would induce your Lordship to leave the guilt or innocence of the persons to be decided by the evidence of such a witness; and that your Lordship cannot consistent with your conduct, receive this witness after the foundation you have laid down: I think that if even Mr. Underwood stood under none of the circumstances which are stated, that simply he is an accomplice: my second objection, which I beg to be added to the other, is, that he is a subscribing witness, which is one of the most solemn and deliberate acts, that any man can do to society; he is, upon his own confession, a subscribing witness to that will; that he says under that attestation, he saw the testator execute, and he has confirmed the truth of that attestation to Mr. Gregory in the most solemn manner, that no fraud, imposition, or device whatever was used in obtaining that will, and now in order that the prisoners may be taken away from the face of the earth, this man is to contradict the whole of his former evidence; there is a third character in which he stands, he has attested upon his oath in the Commons, as to his subscribing of this will, he stands as an informer, he stands convicted of perjury, on his own confession, and there is no judgment of record required against him; you have previously said, as a guide to the rules that we are to govern ourselves by at the bar, that you expect an antecedent foundation to be laid before an accomplice is admitted; the meaning of that is evidently this, an accomplice shall not be called before the foundation is laid for his evidence, for first, it operates as a snare to the Jury; secondly, it wastes the time of a Court of Justice, and no Judge would say to a Jury, you are to pay no respect to this man, unless he is corroborated by other circumstances: the crimes with which the prisoners at the bar are charged, are simply these; that they have forged or caused to be forged, the will in question; it is not for the uttering and publishing, but for the act of forging; and I beg leave to say no evidence has been yet given to impute that crime to the prisoners: it appears that Mr. Slack was not connected with the testator, Mr. Sawtell, in blood; and by every witness it appears that Mrs. Goodridge was his wife's niece, and it appears that he was extremely intimate with him, and he assigned him lease-hold premises<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110060"/> and dined with him: my Lord, presumptions do not weigh in criminal cases, those which are of great avail in civil cases, are of no avail in criminal; but, says a very experienced lawyer, there is such a superior presumption in christian charity, that the presumption is much stronger in the innocence of prisoners than any presumption that can arise of their guilt, until the contrary is proved; if I am to examine the evidence, what does it amount to, that Mr. Slack is a stranger, and that Mrs. Goodridge is a relation, that Mr. Slack is a friend, and Goodridge another; now, suppose they had got at the residuum, and that the legacies did not swallow up the whole, God forbid probabilities are to put men on their defence, charged with the perpetration of a criminal offence, but that is not the case: as to Mr. Price in his evidence he has laid no antecedent foundation for the evidence of an accomplice; Mr. Price has proved nothing, and Price says this, that for some time before his death, this

             had set up with the testator, and attended him in his sickness; it seems to me the strongest reason in the world, why a man is not to be neglected by the sick man in his will, for there is no object that can operate on the heart of a good and benevolent man, like the man who chuses to sit in a dark loathsome chamber with a sick man, rather than go out into the open air, and a man must have a great friendship for another, when he chuses to trust him in an office like that of sitting up all night with him, so that Price states things that may lead your Lordship to believe that he was the person who by his own choice he took to; and Price also says, that he remembers his going once or twice to the iron chest.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. I know some of the first criminal lawyers receive the evidence of the accomplice first, that is no ways contrary to law, it is a matter of discretion; but I conceive the principle of law is, that accomplices in all cases are admissible witnesses, but witnesses so discredited that unless there are some circumstances proved by witnesses deserving of credit, to confirm their testimony, it shall not even be left to the Jury, whether they will or will not believe them: with respect to this man, I must say, that from what has come out from the Voire Dire, he stands by no means in the light of a common accomplice, the objection to him is an objection to credit, a man's coming to unswear what he has sworn before, if he were not an accomplice it would be a much greater objection to his credit, and no Court or Jury can rely at all on his testimony, beyond what is proved by other witnesses.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, this man stands in a situation so very different from a common accomplice, so contaminated with guilt, that I venture to say he cannot be believed; why is he to be believed? The only reason why a witness can be competent, and is to be received, is, that the Jury are to suppose, that the man comes under the sanctions and solemnities of religion, that he is influenced, not only by the fear of that punishment which the law can inflict upon him here, but stands much more in awe of that greater punishment, which it is in the power of the Supreme Being to inflict upon him in a future state: Why cannot a man convicted of perjury be examined as a witness? Because he has shewn that he pays no regard to the solemnities of religion, and though liars may often speak the truth, the life, the same, and the property of any individual must not depend on the testimony of any man that is not fit to be believed; and though to be sure it would not be once in a hundred times, that you could get a gentleman of so steady a countenance, as Mr. Underwood, to tell you all this is false, because he is the first man alive that ever did so; I cannot bring such another instance, there were many instances on the restoration of King

             the Second, of persons who had been found guilty of perjury, and the evidence came viva voce to prove their perjury, the Judges said, if they could get the best evidence they would.</p>

               <p>Court. What cases were those.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I did not bring down my books with me, but in our day a witness never can be permitted to say one thing upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110061"/> his oath, and then be permitted to tell a Court and Jury that the whole of that was perjury, because there is no degree of competency due to him; does your Lordship wish to have such a witness examined? can you tell the Jury that such a man is to be believed? Why he might be indicted upon his own examination; for if a man swears to two contrary propositions which are not true, you may indict him upon that; and would it not be a hard thing, that those three men at the bar should suffer death on the evidence of such a witness as Mr. Underwood: I cannot conceive any thing more distressing to your Lordship sitting as a Judge, than that such a man as this should be examined, that the time should be consumed, and that a snare should be laid for the consciences of the Jury, only that you should let them loose on that snare; but I am sure that the Jury have too much good sense, too much humanity, and too much christian charity to condemn any man upon such evidence: If I have offered any thing that does not meet with the opinion of the Court, I am sorry, I am sure I stand in a case perfectly new, it is no wonder I do not know better in such a case.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. My Lord, if the situation in which your Lordship now stands, was a situation in which a Judge ever before found himself, I think I should have discretion enough not to repeat any thing that Mr. Erskine has said; but I think that from the first moment that jurisprudence has been known, and from the first crime in the world down to this time, there never was such a cause as this in a Court of Justice; there never was a witness offered to a Court under such circumstances, and therefore, I do assure your Lordship, that with the utmost respect to the decision of your Lordship, I speak of the accomplice Underwood. It is of great importance to every citizen in the world, I do not say of this free country only, but I say on the face of the earth, that, that witness should be rejected as incompetent; for if he was to be received, unless God Almighty was to make a new revelation of his will, I protest I do not see how any man's property can be safe, if a witness comes into a Court of Justice, uttering the first word, he says, I did, (not in some other time, not in some other case, not in some other period, I did) commit perjury, but upon this very subject, upon this subject whether this was a valid will or not, I delivered the copy of the draught to the attorney, and after all I deposed deliberately making my solemn appeal to God for what I said, and I stood a cross examination of forty-five interrogatories, which were calculated to draw forth what I now call the truth of the case; but all I deposed was false. My Lord, there is no crime so great as high treason, yet if there existed persons base and wicked enough to conspire against that life, precious as it is in the eye of the law, and a witness had been called who could prove that crime of high treason, if that witness at any other time had been convicted of perjury, though he should have committed it in the earliest period of his life, though he should have lived half the life of man in the course of amendment and repentance, though he should be received in all societies with respect, yet he cannot be received as a witness; why? because he has once shewn, that in one instance, he has disregarded the sanction of a solemn appeal to God! if that man,

            , whom it is this moment my misfortune to see, had perjured himself a hundred thousand times over upon all the subjects on which he had ever deposed in a Court of Justice, would he stand (I ask any man in conscience, and in reason, and in common sense) would he then stand in such a predicament as he does in this very case; he says, in that way I did depose, now the very first word he utters is, it is all false! Now, my Lord, upon what principle is it that a perjured man is unworthy of credit? why, because he has sworn falsely, not upon the subject that relates to this question, but upon any subject whatever; he has once sworn falsely, and what has once happened may happen again: consider, my Lord, the predicament in which this man stands, he is one of the three witnesses to this will, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110062"/> has also been called upon by process, therefore I am sure it is a case totally new, for if any of your Lordships are of opinion that any thing like this has been decided upon any principle that reaches it, then I am perfectly content to say that my time has been mispent; this case is perfectly new, and I humbly submit it would be, of all situations, the most singular for the Jury, and singular for your Lordship to tell the Jury, to receive that man's testimony; but God forbid that such testimony should be received, if it should, I am sure that any twelve men picked out of the cells of Newgate would not sentence three of their fellow creatures to death upon the evidence of such a man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, I shall confine myself entirely to this question, whether Mr. Underwood can be a competent witness, and, my Lord, the evidence by which competent or not competent is to be tried, is this, whether it is possible that any man, on any occasion, can give any credit to the witness that is to be sworn; that I take to be the distinction between competence and credit: if there is any thing which can lead the Jury to hesitate whether they shall believe him or no, then it becomes a question of credit; but if every body would cry out it is impossible to believe his evidence, it then strikes me it is as impossible to take his evidence, as if there was a record of perjury: When a man is convicted of perjury, no man can give credit to him however probable the story he tells may be, however, confirmed otherwise, still the man himself, in that situation, deserves not the smallest degree of credit; now can any man who has heard Underwood confessing that he first attested to this will, and afterwards upon mature deliberation he deposed in the most solemn way that the whole was true; and now he comes here into Court and admits he has perjured himself; can any man who has heard all this doubt whether he can be convicted of this perjury or no? he stands to all the world a perjured man; does not he stand as infamous as if he was upon record? If there was the smallest circumstance in his situation which could induce a Jury to doubt whether he was perjured or not, it might go to the Jury; but he is not competent, as, upon his credit, not the smallest discretion can be exercised.</p>

            , who comes here to swear that he has been perjured though whole volumes of depositions? My Lord, permit me to say, where there is a verdict only for the crime of perjury there may be a doubt; a late case, which made a considerable noise and was attended with very powerful arguments, seemed to falsify some persons that those who had penned certain affidavits, had not employed all the correctness they might, and it is still in some men's minds a doubt whether that man was fairly and strictly convicted: Is it so here? Have you any doubt whether he was guilty? have you any doubt whether he was corrupt, have you any doubt whether he was wilfully perjured? when he states now that he did that on the most mature deliberation, and added new forgery to forgery, and on the most mature deliberation sat down to make new minutes of instructions, as if they were old ones, and thus adding guilt upon guilt; Mr. Underwood, it is said, cannot be convicted of perjury by confronting his two depositions, I am very sorry to hear it, I am bound to believe it, the danger to society becomes infinitely stronger, because Mr. Underwood having heard that, and knowing the tendency of his deposition to day, is to go all the length of it; he is not like a witness coming into Court swearing as the woman did this day, first that she was married and then that she was not; I say he comes here tonight to perjure himself, I can demonstrate that; I assume that this will, which is now the subject matter of this indictment is a true will, that it was executed under the circumstances described in the Commons, I am supposing (and I beg pardon again for the supposition, which is an insult to your Lordship) how can there be any evidence offered to the Jury to confirm that testimony which was given in the Commons, to contradict that which he should give to night? there may be cases of persons being bought off by wicked persons: the argument was pressed by my friends that preceded me with all the ability that can be, and I contest that, in this case, Mr. Underwood cannot be received as a witness: I wish I could ask the Jury if they have nothing before them, it is a sheer question of competency, and it no longer can be pretended to be a question of credit; the question of credit can no be supported against a man who stands here, I repeat, it as a monster of human deformity.</p>



               <p>Court. I think there is sufficient ground to admit the accomplice generally, when the attesting witnesses are called, they are constantly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110064"/> cross-examined; it is admitted that in cases of wills attesting witnesses may speak to the sanity of the testator: put the case of duress, suppose a man makes a bond, a subscribing witness is called, suppose a man puts a pistol to his breast and to the witness's breast, should it be said that that matter should not be unravelled? as to the other case, whether the witness is competent to be received, or whether his swearing differently in the Commons to what he has done, is an objection to his credit, I have always understood that the incompetency of a witness is founded on a disability of law which can only go to the record, the other only goes to his credit.</p>

However painful it may be to be obliged to hear the evidence of a man standing in the situation of Underwood, I cannot help entirely concurring in the opinion of the learned Judge as to his competency; this matter has been ably and ingeniously argued, and it would tend very much to confound the distinctions between credit and competency, if those distinctions were not maintained: can any man say that a man confessing himself guilty of every enormity that can disgrace human nature, is intitled to any degree of credit? and yet I am clearly of opinion that such a man would be competent; the question of credit is a question that always rests with the Jury, that of competency always rests with the Court; the objections to credit are infinite, as infinite as reason, philosophy and the workings of human nature can suggest; the objections to competency are few, and clearly defined by law, they are absolute disability of the person to give evidence, that he is a person convicted of perjury; I conceive it has been mistaken that the testimony of that witness is rejected, because when he is examined the Jury ought not to believe him, that is not the reason; the reason is, that he has been convicted of a crime to which the law affixes a disability to give evidence, therefore the man who is convicted of perjury, or any other crime to which disabilities are anexed, though many of them if examined would deserve the protection, and the credit of the Jury, for instance, a man convicted of a rape under particular circumstances, might be entitled to belief upon his oath, if it were not for such conviction; the perjured man is not rejected because he cannot be believed, but from his situation: now, no relationship however near and dear, disqualifies a person from giving evidence, except that of husband and wife alone, and that arises from their being in consideration of law one and the same person, they are not either of them permitted to give evidence for or against the other, but father for a child, or child for a parent, may give evidence; you cannot weigh the degree of interest, but any interest however small, disqualifies the party from being examined as a witness at all; because men should not be exposed to the temptation of giving evidence: the objections to credit and competence are perfectly distinct in their nature, the objection in this case is an objection to credit merely, and the Court may be bound by the rule of law to hear such a witness, though they may not believe him, for he may be under circumstances in which no man alive ought to give the smallest belief to his oath, that is for the Jury to consider; but I am of opinion he is a competent witness if offered to the Court.</p>

I carried on the prosecution in Chancery for a twelve month, at length Mr. Goodridge was dissatisfied with my proceeding in Chancery, and he employed a Mr. Lucas, an attorney of New Inn, to superintend the business, and I gave him up all the papers; I never heard any further of Mr. Goodridge, till sometime in the latter end of October 1782, when Mrs. Reeve came over to my house, informing Mrs. Underwood that Mrs. Goodridge had some gowns to dispose of, Mrs. Underwood attended, and purchased these silk gowns for five guineas; about the latter end of November of the beginning of December, Mrs. Reeve came to my house, and desired me to attend Mr. Goodridge, on Saffron-hill, and I attended in consequence thereof; and I met him at Mr. Evans's house, and Mr. Evans and Mr. Goodridge took me into a parlour in that house, and after some conversation of the business of Mrs. Reeves, Mr. Evans opened his mind in the following manner.</p>

               <p>"You know old Mr. Sawtell, who advanced you the money on that business, he is ill, he has made his will, but has not mentioned either Goodridge or his family in it, and he has made a will, and has left it all to those d - d rascals he Slacks, who are no relations to him, and it is a pity so much money should be lost:" Evans said,</p>

            ; Mr. Goodridge told me I must go to Mr. Gregory, for he was the party concerned, and we agreed among ourselves how we should make up a case to speak to Mr. Gregory thereon: and I went to Mr. Gregory's house, and told him the whole of the case as agreed between us: Mr. Gregory desired I would bring over the papers, and make a memorandum of all I had told him in writing; and, agreeable to several meetings we had had, I drew pretended instructions for the will of Mr. Sawtell, at my own house, and we examined the instructions with the draught to see that it was all fairly transcribed, I then left these supposed instructions and the draught of the will with Mr. Gregory, these are they: Mr. Gregory also desired him to bring him a copy of the real will, of the 4th of November, of Mr. Sawtell's, and afterwards I went to Doctors Commons, where I gave this unfortunate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110068"/> testimony; about the 2d or 3d of April, Mr. Evans came to the public-house in Queen-street, in my neighbourhood, and sent for me, I lived then in America-street, he said to me, I think, Underwood, it is very proper we should be secured for this business; says I, what do you think of it Mr. Evans, says he, I think we cannot have less than one thousand pounds, and we ought to have security; I said we must have a bond if we have any security at all, we can have no other; he told me to come over to Mr. Goodridge's, and he would back it; I came to Mr. Evans's, and Mr. Goodridge was sent for, I opened the business, at length Mr. Goodridge agreed we should have each a bond for four hundred pounds; accordingly on the 7th of April, I went over with two blank bonds to Mr. Evans's house, which I filled up for four hundred pounds each, and they were executed, I witnessed Evans's, and Evans mine; after they were so executed, Goodridge said he should not like to have his bonds exposed, and proposed for Evans to keep both, and proposed that they should be sealed up till the probate of the will was obtained; and as a security to myself I wrote a memorandum or undertaking, whereby Mr. Evans undertook to deliver me up a bond as soon as the probate was signed; this is the receipt Mr. Evans gave me for my bond, after which we had several meetings, I had at least, and Mr. Gregory once or twice, at the house of Mr. Jenner, and I gave the evidence that has been stated in the Commons in support of that will.</p>

               <p>What became of all these papers afterwards? - Those papers that were executed on the 7th of April, the receipt for the bond and the undertaking I gave to Mrs. Underwood as soon as I brought them home, to put by, and she unfortunately put them in her pocket, and she kept them in her pocket till she was brought to bed, and they were spoiled as they appear now; the receipt I gave to her on the 7th of April, the moment I came home, and I never had it in my custody till November was twelvemonth, then I gave it up.</p>

               <p>Are these the two sheets that were in the cover? - They are, there are two pencil marks, under the seals, this is the cover that contained the true will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. After what I have said of you, Sir, and more especially of what you have said of yourself, you may be very sure that I shall not waste many words upon you, and I hope it will be the last time I shall ever speak to you; you know very well these unfortunate gentlemen at the bar have no opportunity of contradicting this business; how comes it you swore to the truth of this will before? - It is an unfortunate circumstance that ever I became acquainted with the prisoners at the bar.</p>

               <p>How do you think, as you did not swear the truth then, that the Jury can tell whether you swear the truth now? - That is to be left to the opinion of the Jury.</p>

               <p>I believe you was in very great distress about the time this new light began to shine upon your mind? - I was in distress; I have a large family.</p>

               <p>That is an excuse that some other people have made in this country you know, you applied to Mr. Goodridge? - I did.</p>



               <p>You wanted money? - I did.</p>

               <p>But as for Mr. Slack, you never had any promises of money from him? - No, never.</p>

               <p>Nor any expectation? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Then you have some expectation? - I had no expectation at all at the time I laid the information, the expectations which I had from Mr. Slack, were, they promised me they would go to my father and see what they could do for me.</p>

               <p>Why you had an expectation of an advantage? - They told me if I would come along and tell the truth, they would do all they could with my father to serve me.</p>

               <p>Nothing at all said about money? - No, nor I never said so to any body.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know a person by the name of Jacques? - I never heard of such a man.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110069"/>Perhaps there is no such man living, you shall know presently? - With all my heart.</p>

               <p>You never said that Slack offered you a thousand pounds? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>And that God knew that you had not a shilling, and you hoped he would direct you for the best? - I never said so, as to God directing me for the best, I wrote a letter to Mr.

               <p>Might you be at Mr. Goodridge's house about the 24th of November? - I was.</p>

               <p>Do not you know that Mr. Jacques lived in that house of

               <p>Was there not a promise from Mr. Slack and several other gentlemen that they would go to your father and get things set right if you would come in and swear this? - No, if I would do the thing that was right.</p>

               <p>What was that? - To let the right owner have the property.</p>

               <p>What conversation had you with Mr. Slack and other gentlemen? - No promises of pecuniary assistance whatever, they promised if I would come forward and do what was right, they would speak to my father.</p>

               <p>I think you say that this receipt for the bond you first wrote over on the 6th of April, when Mr. Goodridge was sent for and came, what time of the day was it? - I believe it was in the afternoon, it was the day before the bonds were executed, and the bonds were executed on the 7th of April.</p>

               <p>Goodridge came over to Evans's house on the 6th of April, and you saw Evans and Goodridge at Evans's house, was it in the afternoon or forenoon? - I cannot say which.</p>

               <p>What time was the bond executed? - It was as soon as the candles were lighted.</p>

               <p>Now suppose it should turn out that it should be utterly impossible that a syllable of this should be true? - I cannot think that.</p>

               <p>Now here is a third deposition that contradicts both these, here is your affidavit before Dr. Ducarell has no reference to either, you have been pleased to say to night that the old will was copied at Sawtell's? - Yes, that I positively swear.</p>

               <p>Did you always swear that now, even when you got into the right path, and was to do what was right under those promises? - I am perfectly aware of what you have got in your hand.</p>

               <p>But I am not perfectly aware of what you have got in your head; you have said just now to the Jury, you positively swore that you are positively sure that the old will was copied at Sawtell's, now this was when you began to be a good boy; mind, your affidavit runs thus,</p>

             some papers on the table, I set by him while he wrote the instructions which he was to carry to Mr. Gregory; Mr. Underwood wrote some instructions on a sheet of paper, I should know them.</p>

               <p>Are these they? - (looks at them.) These are the instructions, a copy of these were taken soon after the latter end of February.</p>

               <p>Was that paper the paper that was carried to Mr. Gregory? - That remained with me, there was left in my custody, by Mr. Underwood, a receipt for the bond, and the copies of two wills.</p>

               <p>This is one, what became of the other? - The other was burnt because it was so much spoiled, I had these papers the 7th of April, at night, 1783, the first time I had it.</p>

               <p>Did you happen to see Evans whilst you had that paper or that receipt, did any thing pass? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You did, you knew from the beginning to the end, that there was a wicked contrivance to defraud Mr. Slack, and you was quite happy and contented at all this? - Not very contented, I was affraid to divulge it; on Sunday the 16th, Mr. Underwood wrote the instructions on a sheet of paper.</p>

               <p>You think yourself bound to obey your husband more than you are to obey God or any other man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then perhaps that operates a little upon your mind to day? - Yes.</p>

               <p>It would not have been very pleasing to your husband if you was to give the lie to every thing he said, you would have a battle at night? - No, I do not think that, I wish always to go with my husband, and would not tell an untruth.</p>

               <p>How came you not to tell about this forged will? - I was not asked.</p>

               <p>What was the greasing of your cart wheels, did not your husband at the time he gave information about this will, say, whether he was not reduced to the very lowest distress in the world? - He wanted money to carry on his business.</p>

               <p>Was not he reduced to extreme poverty, almost in great distress, it surprises me that you should be so glib about the dates of these wills, the 23d of December, and the 14th of November, had not you these circumstances from your husband? - No, Sir, they are circumstances that I was intimate with, I knew the 23d of January from other circumstances.</p>

             on Sunday the 9th day of February, and I went to his house a little before two, and we dined at half after two, and I drank tea, and staid there till past ten o'clock; I do not know that he ever was out of my company.</p>

               <p>Can you take upon you to say, that he remained at his own house during the time that you was there? - He never was out of the house, I dare say, I can take upon myself to say he never was in his yard, I cannot say, but he never was in the street.</p>

               <p>Who dined there besides? - There was one Mr. Collier, Mrs. Collier, and Mr. Collier's wife sister.</p>

               <p>Then you are sure of the day? - Yes, I am sure, I have a book in my pocket that will give you a good satisfaction about it.</p>

               <p>When was the entry made? - The next morning, I have made entries for twenty years.</p>

               <p>Let us see what you have got in it (Reads) dined at Goodridges? - I positively do say it, that on Sunday the 9th of February, I dined at Mr. Goodridge's, with Mr. and Mrs. Collier, and I do not think he was out once.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect going on the 6th of April any where? - Yes, I do, very well.</p>

               <p>Where did you go on the 6th of April? - I went to Barnet, beyond the twelve mile stone, Mr. Evans the prisoner went with me, I breakfasted at Mr. Evans's house, about eight on Sunday morning the 6th of April, as I went with him to Barnet, we went to Hendon, and dined by Finchley church, and slept at the Mitre, at Barnet; I was employed to measure a piece of ground, and tell the value of it, for him to make a purchase off.</p>

               <p>At what time did you set out to return to London? - We dined on Finchley-common, and we came to London between ten and eleven at night.</p>

               <p>You are sure you did not get to town till that time? - Yes, we went to his house, we walked all the way, and I staid till near twelve at night on the 7th.</p>

               <p>Now, I will tell you a thing that will surprise you a little; it has been said here to day that Mr. Evans executed a bond on that day at his own house? - I can say nothing to that, I know he was along with me from Sunday morning eight o'clock, till Monday night twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Have you any more doubt about what you have been telling the Jury, than you have of your own existence? - No, Sir, it is as true as I stand here.</p>

               <p>Jury. Have you that in your diary? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, Mr. Pollard, where was this ground you was measuring? - The ground belongs to Mr. Emmery, I am positive sure I was in company with Mr. Evans from eight o'clock on Sunday morning, till near twelve on Monday night.</p>

               <p>Did you meet any body coming to town or see any body? - No, not that I knew, but there was a man overtook us somewhere on this side Finchley-common, he was a stranger to me, but the man spoke to Mr. Evans, and he came along with us.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. As you are so very regular, can you tell the day you committed the first act of bankruptcy? - I cannot tell you, I never was a bankrupt in my days.</p>

               <p>No commission? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Never any taken out? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the day your creditors met in order to make a composition? - I suppose I may.</p>

               <p>When was the day you made a composition with your creditors? - I never made a composition with my creditors in my life.</p>

               <p>Did you ever meet them? - Yes, it was in the year 1781, I suppose.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110076"/>In what month in 1781? - It might be somewhere in November or December; I was arrested several times, and I called my creditors together, and great part of them are paid, and all the money I owe in England, is not above eighty or ninety pounds.</p>

               <p>Will you be correct to the month you met your creditors to compound with them? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Have you no memorandum of that? - I suppose I may at home.</p>

               <p>Have you or have you not, have you your books for 1781? - Yes, I will shew you something about it; on the 13th day of December 1781, I was arrested by a Dr. Bull, for eighteen pounds seven shillings, and this Doctor I gave him some money, I paid him the remainder since, I I have no entry of the compounding, for the lawyers run away with all the cash.</p>

               <p>Will you shew me in this book any entry of your dining at any other place besides this time? - I do not know that I can, but you may see by the complection of my countenance that I am not to be brow beat; I am a man that do not dine very often at a private house.</p>

               <p>Now I will give you the whole year of 1781 to find me another entry except that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. You made that entry about the 6th or 7th of April, on the spot? - I made it in the field on the spot.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. It was very material to enter this dinner, you can tell exactly what you had for dinner at Goodridge's? - We had a haunch of mutton, and boiled beef, and there was a pye, I believe it was a damson pye, I am not sure.</p>

               <p>How many minutes walk is it from that place to Underwood's house? - I do not know where Underwood lived, it is in the Borough, it would take an hour and a half to walk there and back.</p>

               <p>When was you first called upon, and did first disclose this matter? - I suppose it may be four or five months ago.</p>

               <p>Who applied to you? -

             asked if I could tell the time that I dined at his house, he did not tell me the time, I told him by eight or nine o'clock I was merry.</p>

               <p>Have you been frequently in the prison to see them? - I suppose I have been there forty times, I am intimate with them all, and if you was there I would go to see you.</p>

               <p>Why did you enter that dinner? - My reason is this, I had some business to do with Goodridge, I have no entry about any other dinner, there is another entry in that book of dining with him on Tuesday the 7th of January.</p>

               <p>Had not something passed on the 7th of January about a will? - I never heard any conversation about any thing being done about a will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I observe, on the 7th of January you lost a shilling at cards, and on the 9th of February, you gave a shilling to the servant.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect when you came to London? - I was not in London till November 1783, I was at work at Mrs. Closes's, in Gutter-lane, I was making some stairs; I quitted Mr. Cox of Islington, to go to Mr. Goodridge's.</p>

               <p>Did you go immediately there? - I did this job for Mrs. Close, in Gutter-lane, in the month of November, 1783.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. When did you begin to make memorandums? - I set that down.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that Dodson worked there in 1783? - Yes, Fisher Dodson and me both worked together at Mrs. Close's.</p>

               <p>Have you any memorandum of the time? - Here is a memorandum I made as far as this, I had been at work at Mr. Jaques, and drew up a memorandum.</p>

               <p>How will that prove that you was at work at Mrs. Closes's? - It was within the six or eight weeks that I worked for him.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect a maid servant by the name of Nicklin? - I heard of her, and may have seen her, I never spoke to her that I know of.</p>

               <p>Do not you remember an attorney in the back shop? - There was, I remember now, we came out of the shop together, and went and drank together, that was about November 1783.</p>

               <p>I suppose you told Mr. Goodridge what you knew, when you heard of this? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not you declare that you kept out of the way for fear of being met by the prosecutor? - No, Sir, I never was affraid of meeting any person.</p>

               <p>Did you ever say you kept out of the way? - No,</p>

               <p>Was not you applied to by the prosecutor to come here? - I had a subpoenea to come here.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110078"/>Was not you applied to by the prosecutor to come here? - I was no further applied to than being supoened, I never declared to anybody that I kept out of the way for fear of being brought here on the part of the prosecution.</p>

               <p>How came you to come here to prove this was on November, and not in January? - I cannot prove it any otherwise than in November, because it was in November.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Had you ever been in Goodridge's service before you went to Coxe's? - No; I never was in his shop, the beginning of 1783, I did not know my way to the shop.</p>

               <p>When you saw this man writing in the shop, it was in November 1783, and Sawtell had been dead nine months then? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect at what time that was? - In November 1783.</p>

               <p>You are perfectly sure it was in November 1783? - Quite sure.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was not in January 1783? - No, Sir, it was in November, I recollect the time, I expected a gentleman out of the country, that was going to America, and he was to be with me a month; about the 18th of November, on a Saturday evening, they were finished; Mr. Goodridge and both his men worked till twelve at night.</p>

               <p>Who were both these men? - Hill and Fisher.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Are you sure it was in November? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, was it not in the year 1782? - No, 1783, I will shew the bill.</p>

               <p>How came you here to day? - I was subpoened three days ago.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Was that the first time you was ever spoke to about it? - I was told some time ago, I might be called on, it may be six months, it may be seven months.</p>

               <p>HARRIOTT CLOSE sworn.</p>

               <p>I am daughter to the last witness, I recollect Mr. Goodridge being employed to do some business for my mother perfectly well, making a set of cellar stairs, altering a bedstead, and some other work, as near as I can recollect, it was about the middle of November 1783.</p>

               <p>Can you possibly have made such a mistake as that it might have been in January 1783? - No, Sir, I am very sure of that, I recollect that the work was finished on the Saturday night, the lottery beginning to be drawn on the Monday, I know the stairs were made, because we expected a gentleman out of the country about that time, who was going to America, he did not come, he altered his plan; I have no doubt at all about the time.</p>

               <p>Who did the work? - Hill was one and Dodson the other, Mr. Goodridge and his two men all attended together to finish the work.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. How long had Hill been with Goodridge? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Had these men worked for you any time? - Yes, that was in the December before, both Dodson and Hill, particularly Dodson, I remember him, and I remember Hill too.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110079"/>Mr. Garrow. You are sure that the business of the stairs was done in November 1783? - I am perfectly sure of that.</p>

               <p>- GREGORY sworn.</p>

               <p>Have you been in Court to day while Mr. Underwood was examined? - I have.</p>

               <p>Have you attended his examination? - I did.</p>

               <p>You attended particularly to his evidence, where he says, he held in his hand a draught with the seal torn off? - If it had been as he represented it, I must most certainly have seen it, any clerk to an attorney that had not been six months with him, must have made the observation; I want to see if that which Mr. Underwood brought into the Commons is the draught, (looks at it) I verily believe this is the draught he shewed me, and not the draught he spoke off, the draught he spoke off, he told me he had torn off the seal and the name, is it possible that that could have escaped my observation.</p>



               <p>You think it could not? - It could not upon my oath, I verily believe he did not shew me such a paper as he mentions, on the contrary, I believe this to be the draught that he shewed me, for this reason, he pointed out to me that when he attended Mr. Sawtell with this draught, Sawtell made mention to him that he had made a mistake in two or three of the legacies, particularly that he had altered them with pencils, and that he had inserted maintenance and clothing, and struck out education, in my office he pointed out that to me; says he, here Sir, I have done it with a pencil.</p>

               <p>Then Mr. Gregory, how can it be true that he shewed you a cancelled will, with the name and seals torn off? - I do not believe it.</p>

               <p>At the time that Underwood came to you, to give you an account of what he had done, did he give you a clear account? One of the clearest accounts that ever was given by man.</p>

               <p>Could you have had the least idea from his declaration, that it was not a fair and just will? - No man could have had a shadow of doubt.</p>

               <p>And he gave you this paper which he acknowledged to? - He gave me a copy of instructions, which he told me he took himself from the testator's own mouth at

             any draught; he told me he did, I asked him whether he read over the draught, he told me he did on the 9th of November, being Lord Mayor's day, that then the testator himself made the alterations which are in pencil and appear here; his account of the forged will, with the two seals torn off, I believe to be totally false on my oath.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. You was, I believe, originally the attorney to the Goodridge's? - I was for Nathaniel.</p>

               <p>In short you did all his business as an attorney? - For the two brothers, for some years.</p>

               <p>When was the last time you did any business for them before this will was made? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Did not it strike you as very odd that they should employ Underwood to make a will? - The very reverse, Sir, I understood it was Mr. Sawtell himself that employed Underwood, and not Goodridge, for the very moment Sawtell was dead, Nathaniel sent to me, to come to his house on the morning he died, which was the morning of the 9th of February as represented to me, and sent a parcel by Fisher Dodson, it was this will of the 14th of December 1782, I cast my eye over it, and he desired me to come to Mr. Sawtell's I stepped there directly,

               <p>On having the copy of them in your hand, it was examined by the original will he had in his hand? - No, Sir, the copy against the genuine instructions, not the instructions against the will, if he had held that in his hand I must have seen it, I had no suspicion at the time, I believed it to be as fair a transaction as any in the world, I supposed Mr. Sawtell was in possession of it; another circumstance, I saw Mr. Underwood many times upon this business, and when it was given out that

            , she went away, and used to confiscate and take some things belonging to Mr. Goodridge, I acquainted him of it, and he gave her a months wages and sent her off in a fortnight; Dodson and she were very well acquainted, Dodson had left Goodridge's service some time before Nicklin.</p>

               <p>Have you met Fisher Dodson at any time since Nicklin was turned away? - I have.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. When did Betty go away? - The latter end of June or the beginning of July, 1784.</p>

               <p>Now he had gone away a week before that? - I do not recollect the particular time.</p>

               <p>Was not it in 1783? - No, it was in 1784, I recollect it very well, it was soon after Mrs. Goodridge died, and I recollect her going away then, there was such a piece of work about it; Mrs. Goodridge died, it might be in February, 1784, I cannot properly say the time.</p>

               <p>What reason have you to recollect that this happened in 1783, and not in 1784? - I have no particular reasons, but I recollect it perfectly well, I recollect I was there at the time, and that it was 1784.</p>

               <p>Have you put it down at all? - No, I cannot particularly recollect the time Mr. Sawtell died, I lodged at the house when Sawtell died, I cannot recollect properly when it was.</p>

               <p>Was Hill there? - Yes, he worked with Dodson, I did not work with him.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the time you went to lodge at Goodridge's? - It must be about the beginning of the year 1782, I remember they did work together, but not at the the time of Sawtell's death.</p>

               <p>When was this? - I rather think it was about the month of September, 1781.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner by seeing him at Bow-street, I was robbed the 14th of December, on Wednesday, a little on the other side of <placeName id="t17860111-6-crimeloc28">Hounslow</placeName>

               <p>Was you robbed by a single person? - By a single person; I was sitting with my face to the horses, and I saw a man riding up in front of the coach, with a pistol in his hand, I was in the Reading post-coach, the man that robbed me was on horse back.</p>

               <p>Was he any ways disguised? - Not at all, but having a flapped hat on, and a large great coat; some conversation passed between him and the coachman, which I did not hear, and the coach drove by him, he turned his horses heads about, and the prisoner then came up to the coach, and the coachman stopped, and the prisoner said, speaking to the coachman, if you do not stop, I will fire into the coach; there is always a degree of confusion in those cases, and I cannot say exactly what he said, I think he said, your purses and your watches, or I will fire into the coach.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he said your purses? - No, I will not be sure of it.</p>

               <p>You do not know then that he asked for any thing? - I think he said your purses or I will fire into the coach; upon that I gave him my purse, but I will not swear to any words; I saw his pistol, there were two guineas in my purse and some shillings, more than twelve, I did not give him my watch.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street? - I went on to Basseldon that evening, and the coachman came over to me on the Friday, I think it was, and I returned to town with him on the Monday following, and went directly to Bow-street with him.</p>

               <p>From your recollection of the man, are you positive that is the man that robbed you? - No, my Lord, I am not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Councel. You have no recollection at all of the person that robbed you? - I do not swear to the person.</p>

               <p>What happened on that occasion? - Just the other side of the ten mile stone from London, on Hounslow-heath, a man came up and stopped us with a pistol in his hand, which is the prisoner at the bar; upon which he said, coachman stop; I told him to get about his business for I would not be robbed, I told him the gentleman in the coach had a blunderbuss, and would blow his brains out if he did not keep off; he said, he did not care for the blunderbuss, watches and money he would have, or else he would shoot into the coach; I told him I would not be robbed, I kept on and did not stop the coach at all, but a lady in the coach was frightened, and held her purse out to him, and one Mr.

             a clergyman, who lives at Chelsea, was in the coach, and jumped out, and ran back to Hounslow; when the highwayman saw him, he rode after him, Mr. Luard was in the coach at the same time, and Mr. Eyre jumped over a bank, and said, you villain I will not give you a halfpenny; then he said, Williams, take off your horses, and let us pursue the rascal, that frightened him, and he rode off; I run my coach after him three hundred yards, I thought of running the poll into him, I was within a few yards of him, I saw the lady give the purse out of the coach.</p>

               <p>What did he do to Mr. Luard? - I did not see him give him his purse.</p>

               <p>Do you know who that highwayman was that committed this robbery? - This is the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am very sure, because I took one of my horses from the coach and caught him, and brought him back again in less than half an hour, I took his pistol out of his right hand, and hit him over the head first, and took his pistol from him, then I gave him two more knocks of his head, and hit him off his horse, then I searched him and found another pistol in his pocket, I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>How far off did you take him? - I dare say it was four miles and a half, I do not know the place, I did not keep him in sight, I suppose I rode two miles and a half before I saw him, after I took the horse off, I could ride a mile in three minutes at furthest on that little horse, there was one Jones, he said, he hit him.</p>

               <p>I had been at my fields, and coming along the road to dinner, I saw a man come full gallop past me, I turned round to look at him, he said nothing to me nor I to him, about five or six hundred yards further off, the corner of Mr. Child's park, I saw a young servant and his master, and he called out a highwayman! I turned after him, and when I came to the cross roads, I could just perceive the top of his head, which way he went, I pursued him as hard as I could, and when I came within five or six yards, he pulled out a pistol, I had only this switch in my hand, and I did not like it, I stopped my horse and turned back, I suppose twenty yards, and I met the gentleman's servant there again, and I said, give me your stick, so he did and I pursued him again; I had some men at work in t he fields, I called to them, and they did not come; then I rode after him, he had a pistol in his hand, he said something, I bid him shoot, I told him if he did not shoot me, I would knock him off his horse, with that he turned round, and I hit him on the side of the temple, which I look upon it stunned him, I hit him then, and he dropped his hands though he did not drop the pistol, and instantly came up the young man, and the coachman and several more, six or seven after he had turned round and come back a little way, the coachman says to him, give that purse you robbed the lady of, says he, it is a red purse, with half a guinea in it; this is the purse, this is a green purse, the coachman gave it to me, and it has been in my possession ever since, there was half a guinea, and five shillings in silver, and three halfpence; the coachman said, to the best of my remembrance, give me the red purse.</p>

               <p>Court to Williams. What did you say to the prisoner about the purse? - I told Wilkinson, first; says I, stop your horse, I saw the highwayman take a green purse from the lady, I said nothing to Jones at all, I said to the prisoner, give me the green purse which you took from the lady.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, I leave it to my council.</p>

               <p>Nobody was at home when the house was broke open but an old woman of seventy-five in the garret, and she could hear nothing, my wife and me went out together and my niece, a little after six, it was dark, it was Tuesday the 27th of December; my wife is not here; I received information of my door being broke open, and I returned before eight, the bell was ringing eight, we all returned together, I found both doors wide open, we left them locked and fastened, the door had a staple which was screwed out by a hammer or a crow, or something of that sort, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, the two dollars, two crown pieces, and a shilling, were in the bag, I saw the spoons on Christmas day, and the dollars I felt in the bag but I did not open it, I only found one shirt, that was dropped at the door; I knew both the prisoners many years, they have been at my house, and one often, that is Showell, they have had nothing to do some time, they are labouring men when they can get a job, I believe they are no trade, I suspected them by their keeping bad company, I had no other particular reason.</p>

               <p>Did he tell the colour of the lining? - I do not remember whether that was asked or not, I did not see the prosecutor that night, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Was this said so that the prisoner could hear it? - Yes, it was quite a small room.</p>

               <p>Does it bear much similitude to his hand writing? - I do not think it does.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Does he make B. like that at all? - I do not think it does.</p>

               <p>Court to Rogers. Look at that bill? - I recollect this perfectly well, this is the draught the prisoner presented to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not make any mark upon it? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>But you passed it over to Mr. Lubbock? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is there remarkable in it? - Mr. Branscomb's name upon it, I think I should know it.</p>

               <p>Can you venture to say that this is not the same signature to another note? - I do not think it is.</p>

               <p>But I apprehend you do not mean to say as a conscientious man, that it is not the same signature; some person might have imposed upon you? - No, I do not think it would, unless the paper had corresponded also.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow objected to the note being read, as it was signed J. Branscomb, and he said it was equivocal whether John or James; and he also objected that the Banking-house was not properly described, there being no such firm as Sir

               <p>Are you sure it is the same man that you saw drop the saddle in the passage? I am quite clear of it, as soon as ever he got by me he ran; the saddle belongs to Mr. Rodham, there is no mark upon it, it was left there in the master's name along with his horses, I had the care of it.</p>

               <p>(The saddle produced and deposed to.)</p>

I did not see the saddle in the passage, I pursued and took him in the passage, not a hundred yards off; he run through the public house, he made a resistance and said I had no business to stop him, the man carried the saddle back again, he has had the care of it ever since it was stolen, I can swear it is the same.</p>

             both said, that she should have some money from a gentleman whom she had had a child by, in a short time, and Mr. Riley and Mrs. Montague were upon the receipt of that to go over to Ireland; I told the husband of that on the Saturday before, the Sunday he came home and burst his wife's door open, he struck the door several times; I met him in the street once, and he told me the child was crying, and asked where he might find his wife; I said probably at Riley's, that was the Sunday night, three or four weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Court. You was very intimate with Mrs. Montague? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts did she live? - At a hairdresser's, I forget the street.</p>

               <p>What house was this? - It was in a court that turns up by the pastry-cook's, opposite St. Martin's church, I frequently saw her go to the house and call him.</p>

               <p>Court to Flinn. Do you remember any woman's coming to Riley's? - Not to my knowledge, I have seen Mrs. Montague several times since her husband has been in confinement.</p>

               <p>Riley. This woman and the other man's wife, came and called me out of the court, and I went to the public-house, and saw her that night, I never was in company with her before last Sunday night.</p>

               <p>This was near a pastry-cook's shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Rasten. Ask your brother how far off he was when he saw him give the watch to another? - He shews me a very little way, but I cannot take upon me to say how near.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, I saw the prisoner go through the gate this night with two bags thrown upon his shoulders.</p>

               <p>Court. Do not you think this was a great neglect of duty? - I think it was one of the carpenter's men.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Are you sure it was me that came through at that time of night? - Yes, I will take my oath of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you know him before? - I took notice of the colour of his dress, his hat, and trowsers, and every thing.</p>

               <p>Not from the features of his face, did you see any body in company with him? - Nobody at all.</p>

               <p>Court. It is impossible to prove that these are the things that were stolen, having put no mark upon them.</p>

               <p>Fryer. My Lord, his confession was taken in writing.</p>

               <p>Court. But it is not here, you cannot give evidence of that.</p>

               <p>Fryer. I can swear to this screw-driver which was made out of a hanger, which I took out of Wallis's lodging by the confession of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Wallis. I know this screw-driver, I saw the prisoner put it in the ceiling, the next morning he said he would get it sharpened and go on the highway.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. How could I get out of the gate when the watchman was there, I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>Did she walk or run? - She only walked, I saw her go into a public house, I came in immediately, and missed one of the cottons; the other woman went off without the table cloths, she did not like the price of them; when I went into the shop, she was standing at the door, I was not above a yard from her, when I missed the piece of cotton; it contained ten yards and a half, it was the property of my master,

               <p>How many pieces might you shew her altogether? - About seven or eight, I left them on the counter all the time.</p>

               <p>When you shewed her the things, was you on one side, and the woman on the other? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did she touch any of the things, when she examined them? - Yes, the piece I missed was loose when I left it, she doubled it up, and laid it on one side, and said she did not like it.</p>

               <p>Was there any opportunity at this time, for the woman to have taken this? - Not, at that time, I conceive she took it while I was shewing her the cottons, while I turned my back to take the other cottons down; I saw her go into a public house over the way, and I pursued her; it is a thoroughfare, and as I went in at one door, she went out at the other; I lost sight of her, I saw her on the other side of the way.</p>

               <p>I am one of the moniers of the Mint, there are ten more; the bullion comes to the office from the Bank, we are the moniers employed by Government, to convert bullion into specie; we have missed a quantity of gold for a considerable time, and in consequence of an information these men were apprehended.</p>

               <p>In whose custody is this gold? - In the custody of the moniers.</p>

               <p>Who is answerable for it? - We are.</p>

               <p>What are these prisoners? - Labourers, employed by us.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. In what way are the moniers appointed? - By serving an apprenticeship.</p>

               <p>Are they appointed by any written appointment?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110131"/> - I cannot speak as to that, we are registered in the office as moniers, having served seven years.</p>

               <p>Does that instantly constitute you a monier, or have you an appointment? - That instantly constitutes us; I have been a monier four years.</p>

               <p>Are you answerable for the bullion that is brought into your individual hands, or in partnership? - In partnership.</p>

               <p>From whence does this money of which you suppose you have lost some, come to you? - It comes to us in bars from the Mint-office, before it comes to us, it is in the custody of the principal officers, they are not moniers, nor are they the Bank of England; it is delivered to us by weight.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is delivered to you in bars, and the siftings, you are answerable for? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember buying any gold dust in December last? - Some grains I did, not dust.</p>

               <p>Who off? - I bought it of the prisoner Knight; there was another man came into the shop with him, and another stood at the door, whom they called in, but I cannot speak to their persons, Knight was the acting man, and received the money; here is part of it, and part the assay master had.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you much occa- to melt much gold yourself? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Have you at all been employed in that trade? - Never.</p>

               <p>Do the siftings of a common jeweller's shop, and the breaking of their crucibles have the appearance of these? - They would have quite the appearance, if the gold was the same quality.</p>

               <p>The present external appearance does not describe the quality of gold? - No.</p>

               <p>Judging only from the external appearance, other gold would appear the same? - Yes, I delivered the rest of the gold to Mr. Alcock.</p>

               <p>- ALCOCK sworn.</p>

               <p>I am assay-master in the Mint, I received this gold from Mr. Prior; I found it to be about three per cent worse than the standard of guineas.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do they make use of gold in the process described? - Never so fine, I believe, as what we make use of at the Bank; but I must own at the same time, I think it is possible that such grains might be collected, if they should melt gold of that standard.</p>

               <p>Which is not absolutely impossible? - No.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the prisoner, I was alarmed by the patrols that somebody was in the house, that was about nine, it was in the parlour, the patrols found the door open and came into the house, the door was shut about half an hour before, I fastened it with the lock myself, my parlour was about twelve yards from the door, there is another door into Fetter-lane, I do not know whether that was shut or no; when the patrols alarmed me I went out, and they were standing with the prisoner, they asked me if I knew the young man, and I said no.</p>

               <p>R. WOOLLET sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol, on the 5th of January my partner and me were going our rounds, we saw the prosecutors door was not shut, and the prisoner was coming out, we asked him if he belonged to the house, he said he did not, he went in to buy a book, and it not being a booksellers shop we alarmed the people.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time of the robbery, I am apprentice to Mr. Stock, on Sunday the 24th of December, between five and six in the evening, a customer came into the shop and I waited upon her, and another came in after this, immediately after this man came in, the other two was in the shop; the prisoner enquired if Mr. James lived there, I replied no, and immediately turned round to ring the bell to give my master notice there was another customer in the shop, in the mean time the goods were missing, I turned round as soon as I had rung and he was gone out of the shop, and missing things off the compter I immediately called after him, I missed nineteen callico gown pieces, five yards and a quarter in each, they had been laying in one bundle, they had been taken out of the window, I cannot say I saw him have the things, because he was in such a position I could not see him have them, I went to the door and a number of people came round the door, and some said he went one way and some another, he got off, and he was taken on the Monday morning, I have never seen him before to my knowledge, he was not five minutes in the shop.</p>

               <p>Did he do any more than ask if Mr. James lived there? - I did not see him do any thing, he just came into the shop and touched his hat, and asked if Mr. James lived there, then I turned round to ring the bell, and I turned round again and he was going out of the shop.</p>

               <p>Can you undertake from the glimpse you had of this man to swear he was the same person? - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Were the things ever found again? - No.</p>

               <p>Can you undertake to swear positively? - I have no doubt at all, I am very apt to look at a person, it is very foolish of me to do so, I did not see him take the piece, but I saw him removing something away, and going out, I have no doubt but he is the same person.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was taken up on Monday, nothing was found upon him, I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment, I saw them three minutes before.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Sandiford, I drive the casual coach to Kew Bridge, or Turnham Green, or Hammersmith, or any where, where I can get passengers, I know the prisoner Hill, I know nothing of the other.</p>

               <p>Do you remember at any time taking Hill in your coach? - No, he never was in my coach, but he rode on the box with me.</p>

               <p>When was that? - The 8th of October, between eight and nine on Saturday, he came to me in the road, I drove him to the corner of Half-moon street, I take my passengers to the farther Pack Horse at Turnham Green, and coming back the prisoner asked me if I was going to town, I said I was not, the prisoner said we will give you five shillings, he said he would give seven shillings, I said I will not, but I will drive you down to my master, and if he and you can agree for a fresh pair of horses, I have no objection, with that I staid a little and let another person in, I cannot tell who that person was, it was a very dark night, this was at Turnham Green, after that he got on the box with me, he had rather ride outside, he said he had two men to pick up and they were rather tired, and would wish to ride, with that I drove up, and three got in instead of two, and brought a bag and threw into the coach, I then drove down to Chiswick, the three that got into the coach came from the corner of a field that comes from Chiswick, that comes to Turnham Green, there is a path-way from Chiswick to Turnham Green, and it is all railed along, this was Saturday night, the 8th of October, between eight and nine, as nigh as I can think the time may be, with that the man that rode on the box with me said, how far is it, I said not a great way off, says he, I never was at Chiswick before, with that I got off the box, and my master was in the bar, and the prisoner said he would give seven shillings, says my master, it ought to be nine shillings, then my master came out, and Hill was close to me, and my master said it should be half-a-guinea, and he would not let the coach go under nine shillings, so Hill made answer and said, how much will that be a piece, and somebody that was on the inside said, how much will that be a piece, it will be my whack; then my master said, Caesar, drive into the yard, Hill went into the stable and helped me to harness the horses, because he said he was in a hurry, then I drove to Kensington and gave my horses a littl e water, then I drove to the corner of Half-moon-street, and I drove up the off-side, and they got into a hackney coach, I did not see them take the bag out of my coach and put it in the hackney coach; Hill that was on the box with me got on the box of the hackney coach, for he said, riding withinside made him sick.</p>

               <p>What became of the bag? - I do not know, I saw them open the coach door and get in, but what bag they had I did not know, I am sure I saw them put the bag into my coach.</p>

               <p>Who paid the money? - My master received the money, I cannot say who paid it.</p>

               <p>Did you drive back the same evening from Piccadilly? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you take up any body in the course of your return? - Not a soul within side, only a poor man outside that gave me a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>When you came back to Chiswick did you find anything in the coach? - No, Sir, I did not, but the next morning hearing the church was broke open, I went and looked into the coach, and found this instrument, a large chissel, at the back of the seat, quite under the seat.</p>

               <p>When? - It was two or three days after, I cannot be positive, the crow was given to me by my master, Mr. Hall, a carpenter.</p>

               <p>Did that instrument which you applied appear to fit the door? - It answered to every impression that was made in the door, and likewise in the door case.</p>

               <p>Which end of the crow? - Both ends, they fitted both ends in different places, it was impossible any thing could fit it more exactly.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish the mark of another crow that was nearly the same size as this? - It fitted so nearly, I think it was impossible for the hands of man to make another to sit so near.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Could you have distinguished it from the mark that was made by a plaisterer's hammer? - No, I could not.</p>

               <p>If I was guilty of doing any fact, I should not do it where I was known to every body, I fell down, and in consequence of the pistol being cocked it went off, but I made no attempt to fire at him.</p>

               <p>Court to the other witnesses. Was he in liquor? - He did not appear to be so.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the only question for your consideration seems to be whether you are satisfied under the circumstances that he fired the pistol, which was loaded, at the prosecutor, with a felonious intention of killing or wounding him.</p>

               <p>Jury to Watts. Was the prosecutor sober when he came to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>

             sworn on the Voire Dire.</p>

               <p>Mr. Griffin, you gave this draught to Mr. Jaques, dated the 25th of November, as you say? - Yes.</p>

               <p>It was paid by your banker? - It was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jaques afterwards gave you the money, which was so paid by your banker, did not he? - Yes, Sir, he did, he advanced me money, but it was upon condition that I would bring, from my bankers, bills that were there, that were not yet due, one of which I can remember.</p>

               <p>Did he or did he not give you money to repay your banker for this draught? - He did not give me money, he lent me money.</p>

               <p>Have you ever repaid him that sum of money? - Yes, Sir, I have.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, Sir, I paid him by the notes he brought back.</p>

               <p>Then if I understand you right, the money which was so given on that day, was not given for this draught? - I do not understand you.</p>

               <p>I want to know this, whether you mean to say, that Mr. Jaques did give you money to reimburse your banker for the money that was drawn out of your bankers n, or on any other account? - He gave it me conditionally, that I would bring back all the notes and bills that were then laying at my bankers, that were not yet due, which I have evidence in Court to prove.</p>

               <p>Then he did not give it you in consideration of this draught? - No.</p>

               <p>Has not an action of trespass been brought against you by a Mr. Williams? - Not that I know off.</p>

               <p>Has not a notice been sent you that it will? - No.</p>

               <p>Are not you promised that in case you succeed in this trial, no action should be brought.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Does that go to his competency.</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly it does.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. If that is to be objected to witnesses, every third person may deprive the King of his witnesses.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. A man who is brought here as an accomplice, comes with a firm hope and expectation, that he will have the greatest benefit that a man can have, the King's mercy, here some third person a friend to Mr. Griffin, says, why, if you do not hang Mr. Jaques, we will bring an action against you; how is that to affect the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Court. It must arise from the transaction itself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It seems to me it is impossible that this question or any answer to it, can go to the competency of Mr. Griffin, it is not for any dread of the answer, because I know what it will be, but for the sake of justice, I take it now in the strongest way against myself; suppose he says a person of the name of Williams has threatened to bring an action against him and has promised him that if Jaques I convicted, that action shall be put an ed to, let us see a little how that goes to the competency of Mr. Griffin; that it go to his credit, I am perfectly free to anit; but surely we have not forgot what passed here yesterday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110148"/> morning, when we were talking of Underwood, he stood under circumstances of the most gross discredit, and yet the King had a right to call him; would not it go to the cutting up of the public administration of the justice of the country, if my learned friend's objection should prevail; I am intitled to assume this is a fair prosecution, and in any other fair prosecution, a friend of the defendant shall go to the prosecutor, and shall superadd an inducement, he shall tell him if you will do it, I will give you ten guineas, I will give you five guineas, I will give you five halfpence, it is an interest, it would go to his competency; would it be suffered; that such a sort of negociation should go to the competency of a witness, and so destroy the full effect of the prosecution?</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I really think it is my duty to take every objection which I can when I stand as counsel for any man that is upon trial for his life, therefore I answer thus, Mr. Garrow has stated a case which must be in all our memories; but I do not put this case as a similar one to Underwood's by any means, but what dropped from your Lordship appears to me to be an authority to found my objection upon; you there determined that the question as to competency, is not whether a man may be believed after he has told a story, but whether there is any legal bar to his being heard: Mr. Garrow has said where any man goes to a witness, and deprives the King of his witness; not in every case, but I do think, I should have got from Mr. Griffin's mouth, if the materiality of his answer had not been suggested to him by the objection, that he has an expectation, and if the witness states on his oath that he expects something will be done, it is an interest: in the case of Mrs. Rudd, I have heard that when Mrs. Perreau came to the bar, to be examined as a witness, she was asked on the Voire Dire, whether she did not expect that if Mrs. Rudd was convicted, her husband would be pardoned; I will put another case, which appears to me to be in point on this occasion, soon after the act of parliament was passed, which gave reward to thieftakers, objections were taken to those men so intitled to rewards being witnesses, the only answer of the Court was that that act of parliament did not mean to exclude their testimony; I am sure I recollect that the Court said, that was meant to further the conviction of offenders, and it was the case in which persons interested were the only persons who could convict the offenders: Mr. Griffin if he had answered my question, and told your Lordship that Mr. Williams or anybody else had told him if he convicted Mr. Jaques, they would forbear to bring an action against him, which he had in contemplation, I do submit that would have given him a direct interest, arising in consequence of this case, which would have destroyed his competency: I think it is laid down in Serjeant Hawkins, that an interest whether mediate or immediate, if to arise in consequence of the event of a trial, in such as to disqualify a witness, and the only exception that I believe has been held to that rule, is the case of men intitled under an act of parliament to rewards; and then the Court gave a further reason for it, that these rewards were intended for the conviction of offenders; I submit if he answers in that way, that would be an objection to his evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Mrs. Perreau was withdrawn.</p>

               <p>Mr. M'Nally. I recollect it perfectly; the Court did give an opinion that the objection went to her competency.</p>

               <p>Court. I shall permit you to put the question to Mr. Griffin, and decide on his competence when I know the circumstances under which he stands.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. An execution went into Mr. William's house, have you never been told, and has not Williams or his attorney told you that an action of trespass would be brought against you, for bringing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110149"/> execution into his house? - I hope your Lordship will allow me to make an answer, and he will not stop me.</p>

               <p>Your answer must go to the question? - No, Sir, to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Did they never tell you so? - It was not told me by the Jansons, but it was suggested to me.</p>

               <p>You have been told you say to the contrary? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, I ask you upon your oath, whether when you was told to the contrary, you was not told that the action should not be brought if you convicted Mr. Jaques? - No, Sir, they did not, nor any thing to that effect.</p>

               <p>Did you in the month of September give him any draught on your banker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What day? - On the 10th of September, I think it was on a Saturday, for thirty pounds, payable to - Maddocks, Esq; or bearer.</p>

               <p>Look at it and shew it us? - This is the draught.</p>

               <p>What date did this draught bear at the time you gave it to Mr. Jaques? - The 25th of November 1785.</p>

               <p>How soon after did you see that draught again? - I did not see it till the 20th of September, at my banker's, Sir James Esdaile and Co. I found it there, as a draught that had been paid.</p>

               <p>What date did it hear then? - It bore then, September the 15th.</p>

               <p>Was it in the state in which you now pe? - It was exactly.</p>

               <p>Has it been in your custody ever since? - It has.</p>

               <p>How soon after this did you communicate to Mr. Jaques, that you had seen it? - As soon as a coach could carry me, when I found out that the draught had been paid and altered, I repaired to Mr. Jaques's house in East-street, Red-Lion-square; he was not at home; at a quarter or half an hour after three, I found him at home.</p>

               <p>Now tell us the conversation that passed as nearly as you can? - I mentioned the circumstance with a great deal of uneasiness; I told him by giving him a draught dated forwards the 25th of November, that that very draught had been paid into my bankers, with the date and month altered to the 15th of September, I told him also that I thought it was a very cruel thing, I had been taking every step to serve him, and he was going to ruin me; that my banker was then over drawn, looked black, and expected his money should be paid by sunset; I told him I felt myself exceedingly hurt, and that I was very uneasy, for that my bankers, unless the money was paid in by sun-set, seemed as if they would fix me with it; Mr. Jaques said, it was impossible, good God! this is a forgery, I thought this had been at Bury, in Suffolk, for I tell you in confidence, I paid this draught to my brother.</p>

               <p>Court to Caesar, who was now brought in by an officer. You are protected by the Court, nobody can presume to molest you, and if you depart the Court without leave, you will be liable not only to be called upon your subpoena, but also so such other punishment as the Court may think proper to inflict.</p>

               <p>J. Griffin. He then asked me if he could assist me respecting the money at my bankers, and I said, I was so much distressed, I had a great deal of business that day, and I could not apply to any other friend to reimburse it on that day, he then told me he would give me the money to reimburse my banker, provided I would bring him the notes and bills that were then laying at my bankers, and not due.</p>

               <p>Did you do so? - I did.</p>

               <p>To what amount were these securities? - The bills that I brought back, Sir,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110150"/> was one of fifty pounds, and there was another for sixty-four pounds, the bills that I gave him amounted to one hundred and fourteen pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>What money did he advance to you? - Seventy pounds.</p>

               <p>Had you any further conversation with him at this time? - I do not remember any thing particular, only he desired me to keep in confidence, for that it would ruin his brother.</p>

               <p>Had you any subsequent conversation with him upon the subject? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Upon what occasion was it that afterwards you had this conversation with him, where was it, and who was present, and what passed? - I had some conversation with the prisoner in the presence of Caesar, I think so.</p>

               <p>Whet her at any time after this 20th of September, you had any conversation with Mr. Jaques relative to this alteration of the draught? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was Mr. Caesar present? - Yes, he was,</p>

               <p>What passed? - Nothing particular passed, only I mentioned the circumstance.</p>

               <p>What circumstance was that? - I mentioned to him how very extraordinary it was, that the draught should be altered, he made no answer, but waved the conversation; I afterwards had some conversation with him in the presence of Mr.

               <p>Mr. Jaques. I have unfortunately not subpoened Messrs. Hankey's the bankers, and they will be very material witnesses, will your Lordship permit me to send for them, they sent me word they could not come.</p>

               <p>Court. Then send a subpoenea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. We are situated here without a solicitor.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am afraid we must object to Mr. Hescot being in Court, but he has a partner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Griffin. Jaques had some words with me and my partner, in my partner's house, and Mr. Andre came in, and I told Mr. Andre in his presence, that Mr. Jaques was angry because I had mentioned this forgery to some person.</p>

               <p>In point of fact, had he been angry and expressed some anger? - He was so loud that it was the occasion of Mr. Andre's coming in.</p>

               <p>What had passed? - He said that he would go to Sir Sampson Wright's with me; and made a very great noise indeed.</p>

               <p>State what he said to you? - He had a large stick which he lifted up, and said, you take me up for a forgery, says he, I will go with you directly, says he, I defy you.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you at that time threatened to take him up for a forgery? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>

               <p>Then what was this in reply to? - It was in reply to our quarrel, what I had communicated to some friends had come to Mr. Jaques's knowledge.</p>

               <p>Had you threatened to take him up for forgery? - No, Sir, I had not at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You having communicated the secret, it had come round to him? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Court. But had you threatened to any body that your would take him up? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then the purpose of his coming to you was your having communicated it to some person? - Yes, then Mr. Andre came in, and I told him that the reason of Mr. Jaques's hectoring and bellowing at me, was because I had mentioned the alteration of that draught that I had communicated to him, Mr. Andre said, he might soften his tone, for if he was taken before a Magistrate, he would not be in his situation for ten thousand guineas; Mr. Jaques in reply to that, said, he was very sorry that I had been hurt at my bankers, and that he hoped as he had paid me the money directly, no ill consequences would happen there, and that Mr. Andre would not think much of the draught.</p>

               <p>Did he at that time deny that such an alteration had been made? - No, he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110151"/> not, he said, that admitting the draught had been altered, as I had had the money to pay into my bankers, he hoped my credit would not be hurt there; Mr. Andre my partner seemed satisfied with this, and the conversation dropped, but on his going out, he desired Mr. Andre would not say any thing about the business.</p>

               <p>Have you had any other conversation with Mr. Jaques about this at any other time? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Court. I wish you to be a little more particular, he said admitting the draught had been altered, do you mean by that, to say that he admitted the draught had been altered? - I only mention what he said, and I wish to put the best constructions upon it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told us on the 20th of September, you found you had over drawn your banker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had other draughts been prematurely presented? - They had.</p>

               <p>Look at them.</p>

               <p>Court. That may make an impression, and cause a suspicion.</p>



               <p>Court to Jury. The inspection of the draught itself when you come hereafter to consider the evidence, will be very material for you.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Griffin. When you parted with that draught, out of your hands, had you at all erased the date or written the draught on any erasure? - No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Were any other persons in company when you wrote that draught? - Yes, Mr. Caesar was in company.</p>

               <p>Jury. When did you write that draught? - On the 10th of September.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the reason of your giving the draught in that manner? - I could not be certain I could have money at my bankers earlier than that time.</p>

               <p>If you had been desired to give it, dated the 15th of September, would you have given it dated that day, so as it might have been carried in then? - No, Sir, I could not, because I could not be sure of money at my bankers.</p>

               <p>Did you explain that reason to the prisoner at the time you gave it? - Yes, I did so the prisoner knows very well.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, may I be permitted to look at the draught? - Certainly; officer hold the draught in your hand, and shew it to Mr. Jaques.</p>

               <p>(Looks at it.)</p>

               <p>Court to Griffin. Was that your only reason for dating the draught so far forward, and did you communicate it to Mr. Jaques? - That was my only reason, I assure you.</p>

               <p>Was it your intention it should have been paid at the time it bore date? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Do you recollect, or do you know from your own recollection, what date this draught originally bore, or from the relation of some other person? - I know it from myself.</p>

               <p>Then you mean now to swear, that you recollect this draught to have been dated on the 25th day of November, from you own recollection? - From my own recollection, that is the only reason I have to recollect it.</p>

               <p>Did you make any memorandum at the time you gave it? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Have you never said that the only reason you had to think it was dated on the 25th of November, was because somebody told you so? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Have you never said so? - I do not remember saying so.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that you did not swear that was the reason when you was before the Magistrate? - I do not remember swearing so.</p>

               <p>Did you never swear before the Magistrate, or say that the reason why you recollected it to be the 25th of November,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110152"/> was because Mr. Reeves told you so? - I do not remember saying so.</p>

               <p>When you gave this note, was not the consideration of it for a bill Mr. Jaques lent you? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did not he lend you a bill drawn on Mr. Planner, for which you gave him as a counter security this draught? - I do not remember he did.</p>

               <p>Why if your memory can recollect the date of this note, you can recollect the transaction at the time? - I do not remember I did.</p>

               <p>You mean to swear that he did not? - I mean to swear that I do not remember, I swear to the best of my memory, I will not swear that he gave me a bill on Mr. Planner.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath was it not the same time that draught was given to you? - No, Sir, it was not.</p>

               <p>Did you give him no other draught at that time, nor a bill on Mr. Addis? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Did you never give him a bill on Mr. Addis? - Yes, Sir, I did, but that bill of Mr. Addis's I drew out of my own bankers, at the same time I found out this erasement to the best of my remembrance, this thirty pound draught was not for payment or a security for that bill.</p>

               <p>When you come to Mr. Jaques's, you say you told him, you had no other friend you could apply to, in respect to money at that time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jaques. When did he receive that bill on Mr. Planner? - Upon my word, I cannot tell exactly, I believe it was ten days, or some days before, I cannot swear positively.</p>

               <p>How came you then to recollect so accurately the date of this draught? - I not only remember that I gave it for the 25th of November, but when I came to look at the draught, my eyes told me so by seeing the erasure, and another thing that refreshed my memory likewise, a day or two, or three, or four, I cannot say exactly, I went to Mr. Reeves.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reeves told you what day it had been dated? - He told me a draught had been offered to him.</p>

               <p>Your memory was refreshed as to the date, by something which somebody told you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. You must not ask what that something was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Then I do not put the question.</p>

               <p>You say that when you came to see the draught, that something made you recollect what date it originally was? - It did.</p>

               <p>Look at that draught, and tell me how any thing appearing upon that draught makes you recollect what was originally on that draught? - I remember giving this draught.</p>

               <p>Court. You have been asked why you could swear so exactly to the very day of the date of this draught, your answer was this, I not only remember it as I gave it for the 25th of November, but when I came to look at the draught my eyes told me so by seeing the erasure? - Remembering myself by this, that I had given a draught for the 25th of November, and this being altered I can remember this was the draught.</p>

               <p>Court. What is there then in your eye sight that leads you to ascertain the day, the day on which it was originally dated? - The first stroke of my N in November is in this manner, the next stroke of the N the top is scratched off, the bottom of that is left to make the E for September, the R is made out of O.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say, that that appears upon the inspection of that draught? - It does.</p>

               <p>(The draught handed to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Upon this discovery of your being over drawn, you went to Mr. Jaques's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I believe previous to that you had a bill of Mr. Jaques's for sixty-four pounds, drawn by him or upon him? - I had a bill at my bankers that was not due, for which I gave him the money.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110153"/>That bill you had carried to your bankers? - I did.</p>

               <p>Your banker entered it short? - He did.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, was not it because your banker entered it short, was not that the reason you was over drawn at that time? - No, it was not.</p>

               <p>When you carried that to your bankers, did not you desire them to discount it? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Did not you carry it there to be entered as cash in your book? - No, I did not, I carried it as security, to be carried to the place where it was due, and then it would be entered as cash when paid.</p>

               <p>You mean to swear that? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you swear that was not one of the reasons why you was over drawn? - I do.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did he not declare to Mr. Esdaile, at the time he went there, that the reason of his being over drawn was because that bill was entered short? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did you never say that to any body? - I never said it to any body in my life.</p>

               <p>Will you venture to swear you never said so? - Yes, I will.</p>

               <p>When you came to Mr. Jaques's and told him of this alteration, you say he lent you some money to reimburse you? - He did.</p>

               <p>He lent you money to take up these bills that were at the bankers? - No, upon condition that I would bring them back in order that the prisoner might get them discounted.</p>

               <p>It was not then on account of this bill that he gave you the seventy pounds? - That was one reason why it was given to help to pay that bill at my bankers.</p>

               <p>Why you positively swore on the Voire Dire that money was given that you might bring back this bill, and that this was not any part of the condition of his giving you any part of this money? - No, more it was.</p>

               <p>You said that he lent you this money on condition that you would bring back these bills that were lodged at the bankers? - That was the reason, and to make up the deficiency at the bankers.</p>

               <p>Now, what do you mean by saying that Mr. Jaques said, as you had been paid that money, it would be of no consequence? - He said, as the money had been paid in at my bankers I should suffer no discredit; what I have to pay now will amount to three or four hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>To what amount have you had money transactions with Mr. Jaques, exchanging bills since the discovery of what you are pleased now to call a forgery? - I cannot tell exactly.</p>

               <p>How much do you think since that transaction? - I believe that our money transactions have been to the amount of three hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>Since the discovery of this forgery? - Not since the full discovery, but since I shewed it to Mr. Jaques, I have had transactions with him since that time for several hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>A little time before Mr. Jaques was first charged with this, did not you apply to him for money to take up some bills? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not you apply to him for money on any account? - No.</p>

               <p>Then you never applied to Mr. Jaques either to lend you money or to take up any bill before he was taken up himself for this forgery? - I do not remember I did.</p>

               <p>Will you swear you did not after the trial of the action in the Common Pleas, did you not after that time, and before he was taken up, apply to him? - I applied to Mr. Jaques for thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Now that was refused? It was.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say, if he did not give you that you would charge him with the forgery? - No, I did not that I know off.</p>

               <p>(The question repeated.) - Never, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect an indictment being drawn against Mr. Williams for perjury? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect applying to Mr. Jaques to desire he would not go on with the prosecution<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110154"/> against Mr. Williams for perjury? - No.</p>

               <p>You do not recollect that indictment being drawn? - I cannot recollect a thing I never saw; the prisoner met me, and told me there was a prosecution.</p>

               <p>You do remember that prosecution being on foot? - I remember having heard say so.</p>

               <p>Now, then did you not say if that prosecution was carried on, you yourself should be indicted for perjury, and therefore desired Mr. Jaques to drop it? - I do not remember any such thing, it does not occur to me, and I cannot positively say that I did not.</p>

               <p>Was you never threatened by Williams or his attorneys, or by some persons for him, was you never threatened with an indictment for perjury? - I never was.</p>

               <p>Do you remember that trial in the Common Pleas? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being examined as to the existence of any note? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you remember positively swearing that you had not a note existing between you and Mr. Jaques? - Where did I swear it?</p>

               <p>Did you say it? - I said to my Lord Loughborough, he sent for me up and asked me if I had these notes for the warrant of attorney, I told him I had not, and he thought it was very strange that I should not have preserved these notes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being sent home by Lord Loughborough to find the notes? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did not you say when you came back again in the hearing of Lord Loughborough and the Jury that you had destroyed the notes? - I do not remember saying any such thing, because it is impossible I should.</p>

               <p>Did not you say that you had destroyed the checques as well as the notes? - I did not, my Lord Loughborough asked me if I had any notes or checques, alluding to the warrant of attorney, and I told him I had destroyed them.</p>

               <p>Did he make use of any expression as alluding to the warrant of attorney, or did he ask it generally? - I understood it so.</p>

               <p>Do you remember producing some scraps of paper? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did not you say these were all the papers relative to the transaction between you and Mr. Jaques? - No, I did not, I said they were all I could find.</p>

               <p>Did not you say it was customary with you to burn every one of your checques? - I never said so concerning my checques, I only said so with respect to my notes.</p>

               <p>Were not you called upon for checques as well as notes? - I only looked upon it that I was called upon for notes.</p>

               <p>Have you never since seen, or had in your possession, any of the checques that were given as consideration for that warrant of attorney? - I have, I have seen one of them, I produced papers after I came back, but not to my Lord Loughborough, I produced all I could find.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never had any notice of an action of trespass being brought against you? - Never.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. I'anson never give you any notice? - Never to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Did he or his clerk never give you notice of an action of trespass being brought against you for that execution? - Never; that I mean to swear.</p>

               <p>I think you say you know Mr. Reeves? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did you never declare to that same Mr. Reeves, that if Mr. Jaques did not pay a draught of fifteen pounds that Reeves had, you would take Jaques up for forgery? - I do not remember saying any such thing.</p>

               <p>Do you remember an action that was brought, I think the name of it was Caesar against Spencer? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect you went down to Maidstone as a witness? - I do, I was subpoened.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect having any conversation with Reeves on that action? - I never did it, I do not know that I ever mentioned a syllable.</p>

               <p>Did not you say that you went down to Maidstone to prove a man's writing whom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110155"/> you knew nothing off? - No, as God is in heaven, I never said so, nor as I am upon my oath I never said so; to my remembrance I never said, that if Jaques did not take up a draught for fifteen pounds, that he would be indicted for forgery.</p>

               <p>Was not your reason for making this charge because Jaques would not accommodate you with money? - No, it was not. I might not approve of the prisoner's conduct, but I do not remember ever saying so.</p>

               <p>Was not you threatened with a prosecution for perjury by Williams or I'anson? - I do not remember that I said so.</p>

               <p>Is not one of the inducements for making this charge, that you should not be prosecuted for perjury by them? - No, it is not, I never said so, I never was told so to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Was you ever told that you should be prosecuted if you did not make the charge? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not I'anson tell you that that action of trespass should not be brought if you would go on with this charge? - He never told me so, nor any body for him that I know off, I never conversed with Williams since that action.</p>

               <p>Was not you at the London Coffee-house with Mr. Williams within these three days? - I have never met them at the London Coffee-house or any other place that I know of, not to my knowledge ever since, and I can swear it.</p>

               <p>You mean still to have the Jury understand you, that it is from perceiving that same altered note that you recollected it to be the same that was dated on the 25th of November? - From recollecting giving the note, and seeing this, I verily believe that to be the note.</p>

               <p>Is it upon the face of that note that you collect what the thing originally was? - Most certainly the memory and the eyesight help one another, it does so in this instance.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did I understand you right, that from recol lecting the manner in which you wrote the date on the 25th of November, 1785, and observing the strokes of the date you knew it was altered? - Yes.</p>

               <p>That is not obvious to other people? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever make an affidavit in a cause against Caesar, to set aside an execution? - I did.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the purpose of it? - Not exactly.</p>

               <p>Court. You cannot impeach the witness's character by specific facts, unconnected with this business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was subpoened to go down to Maidstone to prove a hand-writing? - Mr. Jaques and Mr. Caesar both took me up to the Blue Boar inn, Holborn, and a man was there whom they told me was 
               <persName id="t17860111-62-person937">
                  Richard

            , I went there in consequence of what I heard, and there was no such person; Mr. Jaques seemed much hurt, and told me in a day or two I should be brought into company with him who would shew me his hand-writing, and tell me it was his hand-writing; I saw a man there who was introduced by Jaques.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask Mr. Griffin if he has received these draughts from me since the 20th of September, and for what; they are draughts from my bankers, and all since that transaction, he will see his name upon the backs of some of them.</p>

               <p>Court. Is your name on the back?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You need not hesitate about them, Mr. Griffin.</p>

               <p>Here are only three that my name appears on, two have not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The draught of sixty pounds that has not your name, did you receive that from me, and for what? - I remember receiving a draught for sixty pounds, but whether this is the draught or not I cannot say, I think I can tell by looking at my bankers book.</p>

               <p>Court. Look at it? - I remember very well going to the prisoner's bankers, and receiving this sixty pounds myself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. And that fifty pounds made payable to yourself, I believe it is? - Yes, that likewise.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110156"/>What did you receive that for? - Here is one I do not remember any thing about, I do not remember any thing of that, I do not remember this, there are four that I do remember that have been through my hands, and two that have not.</p>

               <p>Court. Now with respect to these two, do you mean to say that they were not positively given to you by Mr. Jaques? - By not going through my bankers hands, I cannot say positively one way or the other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Those two which he says he did not receive, are both marked by his banker.</p>

               <p>Court to Griffin. Look at the draughts again? - I cannot tell my bankers mark, it is impossible for me to tell by the draught itself, (looks at them again) I do not remember these two draughts upon my word.</p>

               <p>Court. Look in your bankers book at the first of December? - I do not see any.</p>

               <p>Court. Now these four draughts that you admit you have received, for what purpose did you receive them? - Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>One of them is the draught you received on the 20th of September? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then the three others were all dated in the month of November? - I believe I can recollect the sixty pounds draught, I received it myself in Bond-street in lieu of a note of my own acceptance.</p>

               <p>When was that? - I cannot say, the note became due about ten days ago, that is the note I was arrested upon on the Saturday morning, and for which that draught was given.</p>

               <p>At whose suit was you arrested? - I cannot recollect, I never was arrested before, and when the officer came I took his word, I made no doubt but I was arrested, he shewed me a piece of paper; I had my brother-in-law with me, who was bail for me, and he let me go directly.</p>

               <p>The sixty pounds, I think you say, which bears date on the 4th of November, was given you in exchange for a note of equal value of your own? - Yes.</p>



               <p>Which note was due a few days ago, and on which you was arrested? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember for what the draught of the 18th of November, for eighteen guineas, was given? - Upon my word I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect for what purpose that on the 22d of November, for twenty guineas was given? - No.</p>

               <p>The two other draughts you say you do not know any thing about?</p>

               <p>Court. September the 26th, thirty pounds payable to Mr. Griffin, and December the 1st, twenty pounds, are the dates of the two notes that the witness does not remember.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I beg to ask the witness how this draught in question came to be made payable to Maddocks? - Upon my word I cannot recollect justly how it could be; I should rather suppose that it was at my own desire, and for that reason because I did not like to put in Mr. Jaques's name.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you declare before the magistrate that the reason was, that the forgery was found out at your bankers, and you did not like to make it payable to me? - It might be so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. You say your reason was because you did not like Mr. Jaques's name should be put in? - Yes.</p>

               <p>But the other draughts are in Mr. Jaques's name? - Yes, he drew them himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know of him whether he did not disclose before the magistrate that the reason the draughts were made payable to another person was, because that forgery was found out at his bankers; I wish to ask whether I am debtor to Mr. Griffin or he to me? - I look upon Mr. Jaques to be the debtor.</p>

               <p>In what way, and to what amount? - I cannot positively say to the whole amount altogether, but I should suppose Mr. Jaques is considerably indebted to me.</p>

               <p>Can you say all near what amount? - Above a hundred pounds, that I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Since this transaction I believe you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110157"/> sworn to a debt of a hundred pounds, have you not? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You have attempted likewise to make me a bankrupt I believe? - I have.</p>

               <p>Since I have been in prison? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He has sealed a commission, but they did not think proper to proceed upon it.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you a positive recollection with respect to the date of the draught on which the forgery is assigned, as connected with the name of Maddocks? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>What then you have a distinct recollection, at this time, that the draught which you gave, payable to Maddocks or bearer, was dated originally on the 15th of September? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you ever give Mr. Jaques any draught whatever, bearing date the 25th of November? - I believe I did.</p>

               <p>For what sum? - For the sum of thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Do you remember who that was payable to? - That was payable, I think, in the name of Clement.</p>

               <p>How can you be positive in two draughts for thirty pounds, one in the name of Maddocks and one in the name of Clement, which of them was dated the 15th of September, and which the 25th of November, what serves to guide your remembrance? - That the draught dated forward to the 25th of November was carried to Mr. Reeves, of Holborn-bridge, to get cash for.</p>

               <p>Your recollection leads you to believe that the other draught dated the 15th of September, was in the name of Clement? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is your recollection equally clear with respect to one draught as the other? - It is.</p>

               <p>Do you think you are as liable to be mistaken in one as in the other? - No, I do not think so.</p>

               <p>Why not? - Because I remember the name of Clement being down in my bankers book.</p>

               <p>Then your recollection is more certain as to that than the other, suppose you are mistaken as to that draught to Clement? - I do not think I am.</p>

               <p>If you are not now you were before, for you swore before the magistrate that the draught dated the 15th of September was payable to

               <p>How comes that, when I asked you whether there was any draught dated on the 15th of September, you told me there was one, and that one was payable in the name of Clement; now you tell me it was another draught, why did not you tell me at first there were two; I ask you the general question, whether there was any draught given on the 15th of September, to which that paper in November answers, it now appears to be that there were two? - I cannot say that there were two, because one of them which I gave for the 15th has since been altered to the 13th.</p>

               <p>But were there two originally given, bearing date the 15th? - It is more than I can trust my memory to; as to the dates, I remember giving a draught to

               <p>Then you only think now that that was dated originally the 15th? - I think so.</p>

               <p>Can you swear positively that it was so? - No, I will not venture to swear it was.</p>

               <p>You and Mr. Jaques at the time of that cause were in the same interest, endeavouring to charge Mr. Williams with payment of two hundred pounds? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How soon after the unsuccessful event of that cause did you take up Mr. Jaques? - The day after.</p>

               <p>Then between the trial of that cause and the day after, or upon the trial of that cause, did any thing happen to you to induce you to change your opinion of Mr. Jaques? - My opinion of Mr. Jaques was changed long before that.</p>

               <p>Have you made any new discovery since the trial of that cause? - My bankers have informed me that the bank note which they delivered for that draught which was paid on the 15th of September, that that note had come into the bank.</p>

               <p>When did you hear that from your bankers? - I have heard it from my banker within these three days.</p>

               <p>Did you hear it before the 22d of December? - No, but they informed me of the number, and that it might take place, and by and by that they should see the bank note come into the bank.</p>

               <p>Now I will ask you this question, between the 6th of December, the day of the trial in which Mr. Jaques and you were joint plaintiffs, and the 26th of December, when he was taken up, was any new discovery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110160"/> very made by you whatever respecting this fact? - The discovery of the number of the bank note was made to me.</p>

               <p>But how did that apply to Mr. Jaques? - I thought some time or other it would come out.</p>

               <p>Upon what did you take him up, because something would come out in future? - I thought my suspicions were very strong at the time I took him up.</p>

               <p>Were they not equally strong on the 6th of December? - I think they were.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, upon your oath, should you ever have commenced this prosecution against Mr. Jaques, if that action had been successful? - Upon my oath I should.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, it was his motion, and he called upon me to join with him in an affidavit, which was the 10th or 12th of November, he called upon me to make an affidavit in support of his cause.</p>

               <p>Whether the witness was not intimate with me till within a day of his apprehending me? whether he has not declared, during the dependance of that motion in the presence of Mr. Reeves, that he would swear to any thing to convict Mr. I'anson of perjury? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Whether he has not often declared that he looked upon an oath as a matter of form, and would swear to any thing to answer his purpose, I have witnesses, my Lord, to prove it? - Never, my Lord, never.</p>

               <p>Have not you said, before more people than one, that if he would give you the value of this piece of gold coin, you would not find the bill against him? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Had not you an information against you two or three years ago, for smuggling? - Yes, I was not in trade, I was then sick in bed.</p>

               <p>Have not you said to Mrs. Harris, that you believed Jonas was the man that gave the information, and you would punish him for it? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner's sister, Mrs. Barlin, did you never say before her, that if the prisoner would pay you the money, you would not find the bill against him? - I never said so, to her, but I wished I had had nothing to do with the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Did you never tell this gentleman here, or any other person, that if he would execute a mutual release, that there should be no prosecution against you for smuggling, you would not carry on this prosecution? - O dear, Sir, there was a proposal made, but I said I would go to the Court.</p>

               <p>My husband is a tobacconist, I called on the prosecutor about this business two or three days after Lazarus Jonas was taken up, to know the reason; he then told me that he came into his shop for some tea and sugar, and he shewed him a piece of gold, and he asked him what it was, and he asked him to drink something, and he went backwards, and Lazarus went out; and that he met him on Friday morning, and said, Jonas, why do not you bring me the gold, or the value of it; and Jonas then called him a smuggler, and an infamous fellow, and told him he left the gold on the counter; he then said, he advised with his wife, who said, he had better take out a warrant, for he had very ill used him, and now he would be even with him for something; Lazarus Jonas had ill used him, and now it would be a recompence to him; he then said, now I will be even with him; I begged of him to consider that the prisoner had a wife and children, and I did not hear that he had been guilty of any thing before, and that he should take the value, and not find the bill; he said, he would not, and he told me, some years ago he had five hundred weight of coffee in the house, and Jonas gave information against him, he said, he was pretty sure it was him, for nobody else knew of it; Mrs. Harris says she was obliged to swear herself a whore to Harris, though his lawful wife; and Harris then said, hush my dear; I then intreated him again not to consider all this, for very likely it was not Jonas, he then said, if I chose to pay the expences, and the piece of gold, and give him an indemnification, that Jonas never would inform against him, he would not find a bill against him.</p>

               <p>Did he say how long it was after, before he took out the warrant? - He said three days after.</p>

               <p>Court to Harris. You have heard what the witness has said? - I have.</p>

               <p>Is that true? - Not a word of it, I have a certificate of my marriage.</p>

               <p>Had you any conversation? - She came in once or twice, to beg for Lazarus, I never saw her before.</p>

               <p>Did you call on Mr. Harris, and what passed? - Jonas formerly used to brush my clothes and go of errands, he staid away five or six days, and did not come as usual; last Friday I wanted him, and was informed he was in Newgate; as I had frequently entrusted him with forty or fifty pounds, I was rather surprised, I called on Harris at his shop, there was a woman present which I afterwards understood to be the wife of Harris; I asked Harris to inform me, what was the reason for taking up Jonas, he told me the same story as Mr. Barlin has related, namely, that he had given him a foreign piece of gold to look at, and ascertain the value of, and to know if he would purchase it or not, the prisoner asked him for a glass of gin, he went to fetch the bottle, and desired the shopman to get the glass, and while they went they found the prisoner Jonas gone out of the shop; he met him the Friday morning, this I understand was three or four days previous to his missing him. or two days, I cannot be positive to the day, he asked him what he meant by taking money from him, without returning it to him, or giving him the value for it, and that the prisoner had told him that he had not taken a piece of gold out of his shop, that he had left it with him in his shop, and gave him abusive language, which was the means of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110163"/> inducing him to take out a warrant for him, he said he should not have taken him for this trifling cause, having known him for a number of years, had not it been for his ill treatment some years since; I asked him what ill treatment it was, he told me about three or four years past, he had laid an information against him, as he had a quantity of raw coffee, in his house; I asked him which way he knew the prisoner had done it, and the reason he gave for it was, that he, a day or two before the officers entered his house, offered to sell this Jonas four hundred pounds weight of raw coffee, but they could not agree for price; the wife who is present in Court, and by my advice has been subpoened, for I am disinterested in the affair, she said, that she was obliged to swear herself a common whore in the Court, to prevent Harris being ruined.</p>



               <p>What character has the prisoner borne so far as you know? - I have known him several years, he behaved to me very honest, never heard any thing else of him, or else I should not have trusted him.</p>

               <p>Court to Harris. You have heard what this witness has said, is it true? - Not a word about the coffee is true, I never spoke a word about it not a word passed or ever thought about it.</p>

               <p>Ivory. I saw him with it in his hand, when he went out of the door.</p>

               <p>Was not it dark? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long did you remain on the ground? - They left me on the ground, and as soon as they left me, I arose from the ground, and by the light of the lamps I saw them pass, and I followed them, I never lost sight of them, till they went into a house, it was a private house, in Virginia-street; they went into a door which was marked with chalk, I went and told a gentleman at the next door the case, and he got a constable immediately, and he went up stairs and took them; I was with him, they were sitting in a chair doing nothing; I gave charge of them, they said; they were not the men, the man that keeps the house, was in the house, but no other man that I saw; the officer searched their pockets, they owned they came across the hill.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you got a constable? - As far as I can tell about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Do you know their persons? - Yes, I am sure of the men by the light of the lamps, and the candles of the pastry-cook's shop, I took observation upon them.</p>

               <p>Now, remember the lives of these two men depend upon what you say, can you take upon yourself to swear to these two men by that light? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Counsel to Jones. Were you quite sober at that time? - Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>The night very dark? - Yes, it was dark.</p>

               <p>You went to the Justice's the same evening? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How happened you to mistake one of the Justice's men for the constable you took with you? - O! Sir, no such thing, I knew the constable.</p>

               <p>You was knocked down? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Stunned by the blow? - Yes, for a small space of time.</p>

               <p>No light near you when you were knocked down? - No more than the lamps.</p>

               <p>Do not you know when these men were searched, there was nothing found upon them? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not they say, they were ready to go with you any where, that they were not the men? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who admitted you into the house? - The door was chained, and when I knocked, the door was opened by Mr. Hinde, and the prosecutor said, these are the two men that robbed me; the men were sitting in a chair in the room next the fire place, in the second floor.</p>

               <p>Were they drinking? - No, nothing at all, they came from on board a ship, they said, for some linen to be washed, I searched their pockets, and found no property upon them, I took them to the Justice, and the prosecutor swore to the men.</p>

               <p>Was the prosecutor drunk or sober? - Upon my word, I am not able to say, he might be in liquor, or he might not; he said he never lost sight of them, the men behaved very civil, and were willing to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110165"/> to the Justice's, they said they were not the men.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. When you went to the Justice's did Jones know you? - Yes, Sir, he knew me, but however some people say he was in liquor, and that he did not know me from one of the runners; I had a coat on, and a handkerchief about my neck, like one of the runners; that was the opinion of the people that stood about, I did not observe myself.</p>

               <p>From what place did they come? - From a brig that was at Horsely-down-stairs, the other side of the water, I have known both the prisoners since they have been now in the river, one of them is my brother in law, I have known him for years, he bears as good a character as any man in the world; I did not expect them that night, Brewer often comes to our house, my wife washes for him and his sister, and the other man came along with him.</p>

               <p>Court. Is the direct way from Horsely-down-stairs, to Virginia-street, over Tower-hill? - Yes, they came over the bridge, they had not money to bring them over the water, so they came to save expences across the bridge.</p>

            ? - I do not know till I look, I have not looked at the papers; I produce two wills from the Prerogative-office, I received them from the records of the office.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. So all that you know, is that these are two papers that you have produced from the Prerogative-office? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a Proctor in the Commons, I know Mr. Bevan, he does business in the office I am in.</p>

               <p>Look at that will? - I have.</p>

               <p>What do you know of it? - I see nothing upon the face of it, to induce me to know it to be the will, I believe it to be so, and I have no doubt about it; in general wills have a jurata, this has not, it has been out of my custody several months, and therefore it is impossible I can speak of it with certainty, I have seen the will in the registry, but I do not know that is the very will that was put originally there, in the course of the prosecution in Doctor's Commons, the will was put into the registry; but whether that is the will, is impossible for me to say.</p>

               <p>When was it carried in, and by whom? - I judge by the indorsement, by one

            , clerk in the office, and I have no doubt, but that at the time it appears to be brought in, it was; but there is not any thing on the face of the will, that can induce me to say that this is the will that was tendered to the office by Mr. Bevan.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Hawkins. Are there any other wills of that name? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Jones. What time was the will that was delivered to you by Mr. Bevan so delivered? - I will swear that the will left by Mr. Bevan was in my custody previous to the 7th of May, 1784, which constituted the prosecution, for it appears to me that the citation citing Mrs. Stuport to bring in her probate, is dated the 14th of May 1784.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I need not go on with some more enquiries that I have, till it can be proved.</p>

               <p>Court. How comes it there is no jurata? - It was known there had been a probate granted to Mrs. Stupert, as the executor of her will, therefore the application was for a citation to bring in the probate.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>Look at the will? - I have.</p>

               <p>What do you know of it? - I know that on or about the 7th of May 1784, this will, or I believe a will, was left at my office, and upon searching the registry, probate had been granted for a former will, in consequence of that, I see by my memorandum, because I took general instructions for a citation, to shew cause why it should not be declared null and void, and the probate revoked.</p>

               <p>Was this the identical will that was produced? - It is impossible for me to say, there is another gentleman in Court of the same profession, and he cannot say; I believe it to be the same will, I propounded in the cause on the part of Mr. Bevan.</p>

               <p>Who produced it to you? - To the best of my recollection, Mr. Jones brought it from hackney where he has a house, and Mr. Bevan is I believe his neighbour, Mr. Jones left it with me as I best recollect.</p>

               <p>Did you receive any will from the prisoner? - Upon my word I cannot say, Mr. Bevan came several times to me on this business, and consulted me, I told him what was necessary, and I know his application was in May 1784, whether he delievered it to me, and I delivered it to Mr. Jones, or whether he delivered it to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110167"/> Jones, and he took it to the office for instructions for the citation, I cannot positively say how I came by the will, I see I have as a matter of course taken instructions.</p>

               <p>From whose mouth? - That I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who did you receive the instructions from? - I cannot positively say, I do not recollect, but very possibly from Mr. Bevan himself, I could not take the instructions from Mr. Jones, though the will might be left to me for that purpose, I see I have taken these instructions with my own hand writing, which are generally taken by a clerk.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time see Mr. Bevan upon this subject? - I have seen him frequently upon the business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What past upon that occasion?</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. No, no, he does not know that that is the paper upon which the conversation passed?</p>

               <p>Court. You may ask whether he had any conversation about a will, but then the question supposes it to be that paper, which you are not entitled to do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you ever shew that paper to Mr. Bevan? - I do not recollect that I ever did shew it to Mr. Bevan, while it was in my office, it was brought into the public office for the inspection of Mr. Bevan or any other gentleman, but I do not recollect that I went with Mr. Bevan to shew it him; looking further into the memorandum, I see I have taken the date of the will, which I took the 6th of March, 1779, which is the date of this paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones. The will that I took the instruction for the citation from was dated the 6th of March, 1779.</p>

               <p>Does it appear by your minute from whom you took the instructions? - No, it does not.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any means by which you can indentify that particular paper now produced?</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. No, my Lord, I do not know that there are any particular means.</p>

               <p>Court to Jones. What means do you take in the Prorogative-office to authenticate papers, to prevent a substitution of one paper for another; for instance, now suppose one person should substitute another paper for the original will? - When wills are brought to the proctor's for the purpose of being proved, they lay there to be taken into the registry, the registry is searched to see that no former grant has passed, if it has, it is usual to take the original will back, then you take out a citation against the party who is in possession of that probate to bring it in, and some months after it is before you to bring it in, which is generally by affidavit of scripts, and the will is annexed; this will I find was brought into the registry, and there it remained in the custody of the register, the usual practice has been pursued in this cause.</p>

               <p>Court. No, it has not. - This is a seaman's business, and every expence is saved; the procto r also takes in the affidavit of scripts with the original will, it is of very little consequence whether he takes it in annexed to the affidavit or not.</p>

               <p>In this case it has not that? - The paper is identified to the register, he marks them in what they call an assignation book, takes down the date only.</p>

               <p>Court. The will you state does not identify that piece of paper, the date is no mark of the piece of paper? - The minute would be Bevan against Stupart, on such a day, Stupart brought into the registry the will, that is not marked at all.</p>

               <p>Court. The evidence is, that this is not the hand-writing of the party, now for ought it appears this may be a copy of that which Mr. Bevan brought, if there were circumstances which shewed this will produced could not be a genuine one, I certainly should not let the trial proceed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. I am sure if your Lordship was to hear Mr. Bevan's witnesses, neither you nor any other person would have a moment's doubt of the innocence of the gentleman at the bar; and the parties on the side of the prosecution have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110168"/> putting him to all this pain and trouble without the least shadow of foundation.</p>

               <p>Court. All that we can say at present is, that there is no evidence laid before us to doubt of this gentleman's innocence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I have such a volume of witnesses in my brief, that if they were gone through would raise the astonishment and indignation of every person that heard of this prosecution.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, Mr. Woollstoncroft attends here to tell your Lordship that Mr. Bevan first applied to him, who was attorney to Mrs. Stupart, to desire his directions, that he was told Mrs. Stupart claimed a debt of ninety or a hundred pounds, and he asked Mr. Bevan what was willed, and Mr. Bevan telling him a few hundreds, he advised Mr. Bevan to pay her; said he, you had better make her an offer to pay her her debt, and get a discharge, rather than call in the will made to her, as the expences in law would be as much or more; this is what the prosecutrix now calls a compromise.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones. It is becoming every man in this Court to say what he can; I mentioned two circumstances, the one is that the citation is dated the 14th of May, 1784, publication passed the 28th of July, and this indictment was not set on foot till the 14th of September last, after publication passed.</p>

               <p>Court. Then you cannot carry this any further.</p>

               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevan. My Lord, may I crave the favour of this Court to grant me a copy of the indictment, I have been exceedingly injured, my life as well as my property has been injured, and we can sufficiently prove that there has been a combination to extort money from me; a warrant was obtained, I suppose, more for that purpose than bringing me to this bar, but happily I escaped the villains that came to take me, and I came and voluntarily surrendered myself; my Lord, every thing that malice, that devilish malice could have done, has been done; therefore I hope I shall have a copy of my indictment, that I may be able to bring the prosecutors to justice, and I hope your Lordship will do it for the sake of public justice.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Bevan, the matter has certainly not proceeded in this case far enough to entitle me to comply with your request, for this reason, though it appears to the Court there is no ground for the charge, yet it does not appear to the Court, nor can it, whether the will produced in the Commons was a genuine will or not; the supposition of it's not being a genuine will may be perfectly consistent with your compleat innocence, for if this will was delivered to you by the brother, who claims the interest, it by no means follows, if it was not genuine, that you had any knowledge of it; but I cannot call this a malicious prosecution, until I have proof before me that it is a malicious prosecution.</p>



               <p>Mr. Bevan. My Lord, the not going into the evidence hinders this proof.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is my duty to stop a prosecution in its first stage, where a defect is found, but it does not seem to me to be of any importance to have a copy of the indictment; if you can trace out the offenders you may obtain satisfaction.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevan. But when the sentence is passed in the Commons may not that be obtained.</p>

               <p>Court. The power of the Court will pass away with the Sessions, but I conceive it to be a mistaken idea that there must be a copy of the indictment, for, an action of conspiracy or for a malicious prosecution may be maintained without a copy of the indictment, granted by order of the Court.</p>

               <p>From the sight you had of that man, was it the prisoner? - It was rather dark, it was about four, the man was dressed in a light-coloured coat, I believe that man was not the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr Garrow I confess my Lord I begin to fancy my self almost an Ideot if not a dumb man my Objection is that there is no way in which you can possibly communicate with a deaf and dumb man.</p>
               <p>Court, You assume that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow  I assume it on the authority of my Lord Hale who lays it down that a man who is Sudus et Mutus &amp;c. is in presumption &amp; Ideot.
Court upon what Authority</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Upon the Authority of my Ld. Hale</p>
               <p>Court Every body knows that there are certain signs.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow the Argument is this that you have <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110108"/>no way of communicating with a deaf &amp; dumb man but by signs which convey total Ideas.</p>
               <p>Court You must not interrupt your objection is premature.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. My Lord I was not objecting I was going on with my Examination &amp; your Lordship did me the honor to Interrupt me.</p>
               <p>Court You will examine your Witness with some degree of decency your Conduct &amp; behaviour are very improper what you do here is by permission of the Court in a Criminal Case.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow My Lord I Object to the Witness being examined &amp; I take the liberty to state my objection to the Court.</p>
               <p>Court You must examine you Witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow I have a right to my Objection.</p>
               <p>Court If you do not examine your Witness you shall sit down</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow My Lord I shall not sit down.</p>
               <p>Court Then I shall Commit you</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow So your Lordship may</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110109"/>Court Then I certainly will commit you</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow There is a point of Law to be argued.</p>
               <p>Court there is no point of Law and if there was you are to be assigned to the Court but you are to behave with Decency</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow  So I do my Lord I have not been used to be interrupted I am here to argue points of Law for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court You have no right till you are Assigned</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow If you tell me so my Lord I sit down</p>
               <p>Court I tell you so.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow I sit down</p>
               <p>Mr Scott I am Councel for the Prisoner on the same side with Mr Garrow</p>
               <p>Court to Witness (Q) Now how is it that you wod. communicate the question you wod. ask to your brother are they signs that you make or are they expressive of any particular words or are they expressive of letters or Syllables?</p>
               <p>(A) Not letters or Syllables but by motion of words.</p>
               <p>Court can you express this Idea to your brother? <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110110"/>whether or no he knows the nature of an Oath?</p>
               <p>(A) So far as a short motion he has been taught that by others not by me.</p>
               <p>Court can you make him sensible of the meaning of this question?</p>
               <p>(A) Yes he has a very great sence of Scripture, tho' he cannot express it.</p>
               <p>(Q) Is he acquainted with the principles of the Christian Religion?</p>
               <p>(A) He is very well Acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>(Q) Has proper pains been taken to Instruct him in it? (A) they have.</p>
               <p>(Q)Have you any doubt at all whether you can convey the meaning of this question whether he has any Idea of the Nature of an Oath?</p>
               <p>(A) I have no doubt but he understands it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow (Q) Do you examine your Witness?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110111"/> Mr. Garrow I must repeat I have not been disposed to behave indecently I never was disposed &amp; I never intend such behaviour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Witness (Q) you have no doubt but you can Communicate to him the nature of an Oath?</p>
               <p>(A) I have not.</p>
               <p>(Q) Could you venture to say you are sure that he understands you?</p>
               <p>(A) I cannot pretend to swear to his thoughts but as far as motion.</p>
               <p>(Q) How shall you be able to communicate to him that if he was to tell a falsity upon his Oath he will be put in the Pillory for Perjury?</p>
               <p>(A) Oh Sir he is very well convinced of that.</p>
               <p>(Q) Does he read?</p>
               <p>(A) He does not understand reading but he will look over &amp; we explain to him.</p>
               <p>(Q) can he write?</p>
               <p>(A) Not to correspond.</p>
               <p>(Q) Then you guess that he understands you &amp; <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110112"/>you guess at the responses he gives you?</p>
               <p>(A) Yes.</p>
               <p>(Q) Suppose you was to tell him that Mr Lunardi had arisen into the Air in a Balloon, how sho'd you communicate that Idea?</p>
               <p>(A) Oh very well.</p>
               <p>(Q) Do you think he would understand that without seeing it?</p>
               <p>(A) I am sure by his motion in return.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Now my Lord I take the liberty of troubling your Lordship with my objection - I do admit this young woman having conversed with him if we may so call it from the time of his Nativity does believe that there is a certain degree of rationality about him, therefore he does understand some simple Ideas; but the evidence does not prove that he has any Idea of Complex Ideas; this young Woman tells you that he has an Idea of the Christian System now it is impossible my Lord that he has more Ideas of that Complex System than that which a Common Savage has who has a <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110113"/>notion of a God, he is taught that there is a religion to which he ought to be obedient &amp; that there is a state of rewards &amp; punishments so far they may communicate to him on the score of natural religion but that they can communicate to this man who can receive no Ideas but thro' the Organs of vision, or that this man who can receive no Ideas but thro' these mere Organs should have taken in the vast complicated system of religion that he should have imbibed the notion of all the happiness &amp; all the Punishments that belongs to its votaries is not to be credited: that this young woman believes what she says I have no doubt: but let us see whether this Witness can possibly be examined on that score  Take an Infidel &amp; bring him here, take somebody who does not believe in a God, wod. your Lordship examine him? By what sanction temporal or eternal could you bind him?  Now suppose this poor creature to be aware of all the eternal sanctions that awaite on falsehood or, [final line cut off] <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110114"/>can be conveyed to his understanding? How can they be represented? Why this a complex Idea?  the Idea of mans stealing my Watch out of my pocket and conveying away to somebody else is a Complex Idea which requires rationality about it first to perceive and afterwards to describe; I said my Lord what idea of temporal punishment can be conveyed to his understandings &amp; now let me address myself to your Lordship as a great Lawyer which you certainly are &amp; I presume to ask of your Lordship in what possible way this Man is to be punished if he is guilty of Perjury to right I presume my Lord to ask how he could possibly be punished?  Could he be Indicted in a Capital Case, he is first to be presented to the grand Jury he is then to be called to that bar he he is asked whether he is guilty or not guilty of the perjury imputed to him by the Indictment he he make no answer he cannot answer Why your Lordship know that in this day According to the [final line cut off] <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110115"/>and not pleading to the Indictment an Inquest must be sworn to enquire if he is Dumby by the visitation of God, that Inquest must in his case return that he was Dumb the Visitation of God -  Would the Law of England punish the Man to conviction  Would the Law of England say that because the Man would not plead when he could not plead that he should be adjudged guilty of the Crime of Perjury: he is brought to that bar he is Indicted for perjury, the Indictment is read over to him, it is to be explained to him, this Woman is to explain it to him, how is she to explain it to him?  Is she to tell him that your Lordship and Sir Wm. Henry Ashurst &amp; the Recorder of London &amp; the Aldermen &amp; Gentlemen named in the Commission met here to deliver the Goal of Newgate on this day that this Prisr.  Wm. Bartlett was Indicted for a Grand Larceny, that the question came on to be tried &amp; that on that trial he did not commit wilfull &amp; corrupt Perjury <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110116"/> How is all that to be Interpreted to him on his Arraignment?  But that is not all, when this Indictment is read to him by the Assistance of the Interpretress thro' the medium of the Clerk of the Arraigns, And the Clerk asks him thro' the same Assistance are you Guilty or not Guilty. - Why my Lord the Man stands like the block behind him!  Can your Lordship or any of the other Judges try him?  Can you try him till he has pleaded?  You cannot: he his Dumb &amp; cannot Answer to the Indictment.  How then upon the Idea of this man committing the Crime of Perjury can my Client the Prisoner now at the Bar receive any retribution.  Another thing my Lord permit me to observe that there are motions and signs which are to convey to this Man Complex Ideas:  If it had been as your Lordship certainly supposed when you took up this Subject that it might be verbally or by communication of [partially lost line]syllables if that had been so my <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110117"/> argument would have been weaker that it is, but your Lordship sees if it is by looking up to heaven.  Now how will these questions so complex to be communicated to him, upon you Oath will you venture to swear that than Man at the Bar did so and so?  Did you know him before?  Is there any thing remarkable in is features?  How are these Ideas to be seperated in their communication to Him?  I ask again in the Name of Common sense how that poor woman can Communicate to him that complex question?  My Lord I wish I could also address that Jury on this trial I should be glad to ask them whether they would chuse to convict a man of felony upon the testimony of a man with whom they could not hold a conversation who has not more rationality than an Automaton, who does not appear more competent  (if I may be allowed to make such a Simily) than that learned Pig which is now exhibited to the publick.  My Lord if I conceived I had in the Course of this trial behaved myself with intemperance or with indecency [text lost at the bottom of the page] <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110118"/>term it I do assure your Lordship I should not feel that I was hurt in making an Apology: I never do mean to behave to the Court with any thing like indecency:  I thought it my Duty to Examine this Interpretress upon the Voire dire perhaps it was improper Zeal on the part of my Client but God forbid that I should ever set an example or that the meanest spectator in this Court should think I wanted or wished to set an example of treating great &amp; brave &amp; Venerable and learned Judges of the Law of England with anything like disrespect</p>
               <p>Court I am of Opinion that under all the circumstances of his case the Witness is a Competent Witness ought to be sworn after he is sworn it will remain with the Jury to consider what degree of respect he ought to have I am sure every body knows on what slight Notions Witnesses are permitted to give evidence we admit Children of ten eleven &amp; twelve years of age to give evidence can they be initiated in the misteries of the Christian religion? can they be Acquainted with [line lost at the bottom of page?] <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110119"/>  the Scheme of Redemption? It is utterly impossible, we reckon it Sufficient if they have some Idea of a future state of rewards &amp; punishments &amp; if they think that the Oath they take is Obligatory on them &amp; they shall be punished hereafter, it has been said this is as if the Man spoke on unknown language  I do not know that there is any objection to that if the language can be Interpreted to the Satisfaction of the Jury; It has been said too that he is not Ameniable in the Case of Perjury, that is a very Monstrous doctrine to say &amp; it is laid down by the Councel with great Confidence as if it could be supported, Now I am unacquainted with any Authority that says that a man that is born dead &amp; dumb shall not be punished, that if he commits Treason &amp; Assasinates  his Sovereign he is dispunishable, or if he Murders any of his fellow subjects I should think if ever an Interpreter could be found to a person guilty of such a Crime that would be Sufficient put him on his defence the Result wod. <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110120"/> be the task and I cannot say the event  if a Prisoner should appear to be deaf &amp; dumb  there were no means to convey the signes to him what was going forwards for in that Case it would be trying an absent Man but in the present Case suppose the Witness was to Commit Perjury then here is a person who could communicate to him and report the question of the Prisoner to the Court &amp; Jury so that a fair &amp; full trial may be had therefore that monstrous doctrine will not ensue.I shall therefore certainly Admit this Witness considering him as Competent &amp; I shall leave his Credit to you Gentlemen &amp; you will consider it under all the Circumstances of the Case.</p>
