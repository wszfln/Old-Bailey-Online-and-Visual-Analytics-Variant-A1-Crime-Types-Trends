                  </hi>. I am a barmaid at the "Crooked Billet," Crooked Lane—on Sunday, November 3rd, I was in Middlesex Street, about 12 a.m.—my purse was in my dress pocket. I felt a hand in my pocket. I turned round and saw two men, one of them was the prisoner—I cannot say which of the men had his hand in my pocket—the prisoner was nearest to me. This (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the purse.</p>

The man not in custody put his hand into the prosecutrix's dress pocket, withdrew her purse, turned to the prisoner, who was covering his movements as much as possible, and passed the purse to him. The prisoner put it in his pocket and put a handkerchief in on top of it—I followed them—the man not in custody saw me and said something to the prisoner, and they separated. I followed the prisoner and told him I should take him into custody for stealing a lady's purse. He said "I have stole no purse." I said "It is in your pocket," and it was found on him. He refused his name and address. It contained 1s. and some coppers.</p>

I went upstairs in my lodging and asked my landlady if she would like a drink, and if so I would send for a pot of beer. I took out half a crown and gave it to the boy to fetch the beer; be returned and said the half-crown was no good. I went and asked the matter, and the barman said it was no good and asked me where I got it from; I told him in a coffee shop in Slater Street; he advised me to take it back and get my right money. I did not go, as I was positive it was a good one. The boy I was with said, 'Come, let us try here whether it is good or bad; we will soon find out and pur<lb/>chase something for me, we will purchase "Kruger's face."' I asked for the face, which was given to me. I placed the half-crown on the counter and she gave me change."</p>

I live at Beverley, and also at Half Moon Street—in May last I was at the Wellington Barracks when some soldiers were being drilled in the yard—a number of people were looking on, and among them the prisoner—he said to me, "You take a great interest in what is going on," I said yes—he said that he had been in the Army in Africa, that was a place I was interested in, having been out to South Africa myself—he said that he was a cousin of Lord Roberts, or Lord Wolseley, I forget which, but it was a Commander-in-Chief—he mentioned the names of other people of position, and referred to having property in Ireland—he said that his agent was ill and he could not get any rents—I said, "Being an Irishman myself, I should like to hear more of you, if you like to come down to me at 42, Half Moon Street, I shall be home at 9.30," but I gave no name—he came at 9.30, and after about half-an-hour's conversation he was going away and said, "I am going to ask you as a stranger what you may think a very queer thing" (he had told me that he had found my name in the Red Book; that shows 18 names at that address)—he said "Can you let me have ₤50," and produced this bill, "London, May, 1901, three months after date, pay me or my order, ₤50 for value received, Cadwallader Edwards"—it was crossed, and it is accepted by Percy Thellusson, but the acceptance was not on it then, nor any place where it was payable—I let him have the ₤50 in money, and he left taking the bill with him—he came again next day at 9.30, and was let in by the first footman—he stayed about half an hour conversing, and brought this bill as it now is—I did not notice that there was no place where it was payable—he said that his friend had made a foolish mistake by crossing it at the wrong place and that his agent, Mr. Hunter, in Ireland, was ill, and that he had property at Ballyhier in Wexford—I never saw him again—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated, May 22nd, to the prisoner, stating that he would have to draw up another bill as it was so queerly backed and not dated or signed, and the bankers would object to it, but he would "hold up" the bill for the present</hi>)—I had received a letter from him asking me to hold up the bill—I have destroyed his letter—I wrote this letter on May 27th (<hi rend="italic">Asking the prisoner to send or get Mr. Thellusson to send him the ₤50, as he was going north at the end of the week.</hi>)—he replied asking me to hold over the bill as he had no money to pay it—he did not tell me where Mr. Thellusson lived, I never could find out—he also wrote asking me for money besides the money I had advanced, but I declined—on June 4th I went to my country seat, Dalton Hall, Beverley, and while there I continued to get letters from him—he said that if I would let him have ₤100 he would pay me back ₤80, and he wrote about a bill for ₤100 I believe—I wrote this letter of June 26th to the prisoner, but it is not in the same state now, ₤100 has been turned into ₤250, the ₤75 has been altered also, and the figures in the date—I accepted this bill for ₤100 dated June 14th (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and sent it enclosed in this letter of June 29th, the date of which has been altered—I wrote to him in London and in Brighton—I say that the acceptance to this bill for ₤250, dated</p>

               <p>June 29th, and purporting to be accepted by me, is a forgery: only the signature was written by me—I received a letter from Mr. Blaberg in July, in consequence of which I wrote to the prisoner stating that I under<lb/>stood that he had been using my name as surety for borrowing ₤250, and that I never had given him authority—he did not reply, and I do not think I ever heard from him afterwards until he was in custody—I received a letter from Mr. George Hunter on August 29th, and wrote to him in consequence—after the prisoner was arrested I received this letter from him from Holloway Prison (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been arrested on an unfounded charge of forging His Lordship's signature, whereas His Lordship had sent him a bill from Dalton Hall on June 14th, but declining to say anything as to the further charges except that not a penny had been received by him.</hi>) I found these bills in my bank pass book at the beginning of October, and that I was debited with ₤100 and ₤250 acceptances—I was of opinion that the ₤100 bill was a forgery, I had forgotten it—after the prisoner was in custody I saw the two bills and recognized that the ₤100 bill bore my signature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>When I first saw these bills I thought they were both forged; the ₤100 bill had slipped my memory, but the production of this letter brought it back to my recollection, that I had accepted one for ₤100—as to the forged one, I never make "H" in this way in my signature—I always make this little hook as a rule (<hi rend="italic">Signing his name.</hi>) but I may not always—I make the "H" with one action of the pen and there are two or it may be three separate strokes in this—I generally cross the "t" in "th" from the large "H" upwards from the left side—I end my name with an up stroke—the forgery ends in the same way—I did not find the acceptances in the pocket of my pass book, I saw them at the solicitor's office and on this the signature on the ₤100 appeared to be mine, I would not swear one way or the other, I did not know anything about it—I have accepted one bill for an old friend which has gone on for many years and has been renewed five times. I have accepted none this year, I have never done it for myself—I always write my name with two strokes and do not join the tails together—I first met the prisoner on a Friday, I did not tell him my name, I am not the sole occupant of the chambers, it is a mystery to me how he knew which of the many tenants to enquire for—I was at the door to meet him—I had said that I should be there at 9.30—I was coming from my club to 42, Half Moon Street, and he came up at the same time and we went in together—I have had it in my mind that he knew me all along, because there was another Lord in the flat—I never saw Percy Thellusson in my life, I do not know that he is the brother of Lord Rendleston—I saw him for about half an hour each evening—I sent him a telegram from my country house, I forget the date of it—the date "29th" is the only thing altered in this letter, but the "J" in June has been altered and tried to be removed; that may have been done to make the whole appear in the same ink—both these "J's" have been altered—no notice was taken at the police court of the dates having been altered—it looks as if it had been scratched out, it might have been that in altering one they have altered the other—I might make a mistake in writing a letter, and subsequently alter the date—I say that it ought to be the 14th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190111180017"/>
               <p>because it refers to the 14th, the tail of the "9" on the "0" is quite different—I do not say that it has been erased with a knife, the expert says that it was done by chemicals—both these letters refer to one bill, the first bill was drawn on June 14th; the date of the other is the 29th—I say in my letter "I am sending you back the bill signed," that was the ₤100 bill—I do not remember sending it, but I admit on seeing my letter that I did it—I cannot remember anything about the ₤250—I was to send him ₤100 and he was to keep ₤20 and return me ₤80—this says "I send you a cheque for ₤75," and I say that that has been altered from ₤80—that letter does not refer to another acceptance—I wrote ₤75, but I ought to have written ₤80, he was to send me ₤80 because he owed it to me, I wan to have ₤20 back—I cannot understand why I did not lend him ₤80 by trending him a cheque—he did not ask me to make it ₤250, and I did not alter it myself to ₤250, if I had done that I should have over-run my account, and Messrs. Coutts would not allow that—he did not ask me for ₤150 or if I could, ₤250, and I did not alter it to ₤250—I first heard in August that these bills were out, I heard from Mr. Blaberg in July—I wrote to the prisoner telling him that I would not have my name used, but I did not acquaint Messrs. Coutts, because I treated the prisoner as a gentleman and I thought he would not go on with it—Mr. Hunter wrote and asked if the bill for ₤250 was correct; I said "No"—that did not convey to my mind that it was a forged acceptance, because I never saw the original or the copy; I thought writing to the prisoner would be sufficient—I did not know whether it was at three months or any date—Mr. Hunter offered to send it to me, and I did not ask for it because I thought my writing to the prisoner would stop it—I told the police officer in the first instance that I believed they were both forged, but I believe I added that the signature was so much like mine that I could not swear one way or the other—there is no attempt to imitate my signature on this (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 19).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On July 23rd I heard that the prisoner had been endeavouring to raise money from Mr. Blaberg in my name, and wrote the letter of that date—at the end of August I had the letter from Mr. Hunter in which he asked me which of the two bills was the genuine one—this is my answer to it of September 2nd (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it did not occur to me to communicate with the bank—I noticed on October 2nd or a day or two before that the bills for ₤100 and ₤250 were in it—the incident had faded from my mind at that time and I informed Messrs. Coutts that they were not my signatures—I came up to London on October 14th between the first and second hearing before the Magistrate—on the 14th I went to Messrs. Mullins &amp; Bosanquet's and saw the two bills—on the remand on the 16th, before my evidence was given, a statement was made before the Magistrate withdrawing the charge with regard to the ₤100—one bill of mine was accepted at Blaberg's, that is my sole experience of bills—that bill was eight or nine years ago or more, and it was renewed five times—that was a backing of a bill for a friend—I kept my own banking account, and I thought I would wait—owing to the loss of ₤450 I was short of money—I say here, "So you can send me a cheque for ₤75"; my recollection is that that was ₤80—I had no document whatever to help me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professional expert in handwriting of Bath House, Holborn Viaduct—the bills for ₤250 and ₤100 have been placed before me, also Lord Hotham's letters of June 26 and 29—1 think Exhibit 1 (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> ₤250 <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>) is a very good imitation of the genuine signature to the letters—in my opinion this letter, Exhibit 5, is not in the same condition as when it was originally written, the letters "Bever" in the body of the letter are in the same ink but "ley" is in a different ink and that has been covered over and the "th" is in the same black ink—the up stroke in June was in grey ink but it is now in black ink and between "June" and the date I can see a faint brown outline and a figure which looks like a 7; there is no trace of any erasure with a knife but I should say that the figure where the 7 is has been removed by some chemical process: that is common in forgery cases, persons come hawking materials at offices, with which any writing can be erased, "Not negociable" is sometimes quite removed—in "I have filled up the ₤250 for 2 months" the "₤" has four distinct scratches in black ink on top of the grey, and the lower part is visible, a little bit of the grey ink still remains—then we get "250" all in black ink, different from the ink of the letter, and the whole of the telegram is marked down with black ink—in "and so you can send me a cheque for ₤75," a figure "1" appears to have been inserted before the 75, it is a different colour and the "1" has black ink on it, and in "you" the "y" has been covered with black ink from top to bottom—in the letter of June 29th, the bottom of the "J" in June and the "one" have all been passed over with black ink; the "29" has black ink on the top of the "2" and on the top of the "9" and all the way down the stroke—I cannot say what it was before but it may have been "20th"—there is no reason that I can suggest for going over the "June" because it was June before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. But it would be less noticeable; an alteration in the figures alone would make it stand out—in Exhibit 9 the signature "Hotham" appears to be written by the same person who wrote the signature on Exhibit 1; the whole bill appears to be in one writing—I should not say that "Hotham" on Exhibit 19 is as good an imitation as on Exhibit 1—I believe they were both written by the same man, one is as good an imitation as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Exhibit 19 is certainly the same style as the signature to Lord Hotham's letters—my attention was not directed to it before the Magistrate—it is a rough imitation of Lord Hotham's signature—I only saw the letter of June 29th a few days ago—I believe the word "omitted" in Exhibit 14 was done with the same ink as the rest of the letter, but it is darker—I think it has been altered, but it may have been a fresh dip—I do not think a slight erasure would make any difference—I do not think the same ink was used for the word "omitted"—I said before the Magistrate "I cannot say whether that has been altered by the writer of the letter" but that expression was forced upon me—I cannot say now who altered it, all I will say is that it is not in the condition in which it was when it was first written—in "₤250" there was a figure in advance of the "2" which may have been "1"—the "0" has been covered with the same ink—the "75" has not been touched, but I think the "1" has been inserted, it is in a different</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190111180019"/>
               <p>ink to the "75"—it is not impossible that the writer's first intention was to pat "150," and that he altered it to "250"—the "5" may have been an "0" originally, but there is no trace of it—there is a little something which does not quite follow the outline of the "5," it is in the straight line from the top down to the carve—I do not know whether it is merely a slip of the pen—I think that figure was not a 5, I think it more probable that it was some other figure—I do not bind myself to say whether there is more probability of an "0" being there than a "5," or the reverse—I see no trace of chemicals being used to the "5," but there is a trace in the other, a faint brown outline—I cannot say positively that chemicals have been used, but just in front of the "2" in "250" there is a trace of a figure being removed—I answered the questions put to me before the Magistrate—there is no sign of any forcible erasure—chemicals are used to romove all traces, and some people would look at this two or three times without noticing it—any one would be struck by the fact that there had been an alteration—there is no alteration in the "75" alone, bat a "1" has been put in in dark ink—my idea is that "75" was in the place where "175" is now—this letter says, "If you will send me a cheque for ₤75"—I am told that the signature to Lord Hotham's letter is genuine—I cannot say that the other is the same—I am not prepared to say that they are not signed by the same person—I was not asked my opinion ot this signature at the Police Court, I first saw it only a day or two ago—I have no recollection of being asked whether it was not a genuine signature.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I cannot say that I did not see the alleged forgery, but I have no recollection of seeing it—I am not prepared to say that the "Hotham" on Exhibit 1 is genuine, or that it is not; it ia the same signa<lb/>ture as is on the other bill, but not on the ₤100 acceptance: I certainly will not say that it is genuine, though to the best of my belief it is not—the exhibits were all shown to me together a day or two ago; my attention was not directed to that at the Police Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been pressed by my adoption of the word "tampered"—I am influenced by the fact that chemicals were used; they were used in my opinion—I cannot say whether the alterations of June 14th and 29th were also made by chemicals—in going over the original I see traces of the original ink; I see deviations; it is very difficult to obliterate the original ink exactly.</p>

He said "No"—I said "I cannot accept it without making applications to Lord Hotham," he said "Won't you accept any other verification?" I said "No" he said "Won't you acceptaletter with Lord Hotham's signatnre?" I said "Certainly</p>

Captain Edwards (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner.</hi>) did not ask me to give him the bill back—on August 23rd, I wrote a letter saying that he had played a little comedy on me—he did not say that he had heard from Lord Hotham and that his Lordship said that he had no authority to use his name—he did not draw out another bill and say that the bill he gave me was a copy and that if I would give back the bill he would give me the original if I would give him ₤2—he did say</p>

On the afternoon of October 28th from infor<lb/>mation I received, I ran up Commercial Road, along Nelson Street and Sidney Street—in Nelson Street I saw Smith, Price, Cowley, and another man running down Bedford Street from Nelson Street—I gave chase and caught them in Ford Square—I said to Smith, "What were you running for?"—he replied "<hi rend="italic">My pal</hi> got pinched just now"—I told him I should take him to the station on suspicion of being concerned with other men in robbing a man in Bedford Street"—he replied "I do not know anything about the old <hi rend="italic">bloke,</hi> I never had his bag"—he then called to the other three men a distance off "Highway robbery means a flogging, don't let them take me for this boys, this means something, and we are all in it"—he was sober—he said "If you want to lock me up cannot you charge me with being drunk and disorderly?"—the other three men came back, he was struggling very violently, and they all tried to get him away from me—I drew my truncheon and knocked one man down, the man that got away—I hit at Price, Cowley and the other man ran down Clarke Street towards Jamaica Street—I took Smith to the station—on the way I met other officers and told them the direction the</p>

I am the divisional Police Surgeon—on October 28th I examined the prosecutor about 5 p.m.—I found him suffering from a blow on his mouth which had loosened three teeth on the right side of the upper jaw—he had an abrasion on the lower ribs on the right side, his pulse was 104 to the minute—he was suffering from shock—he was sober—there was a little blood about his teeth.</p>

Smith in his defence said on oath that he was in the public house and never saw the prosecutor and knew nothing of the assault. Cowley in his defence said that he was drunk with Price and Smith, and they had paid their fines and were drinking with some women. I rice made a similar defence.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a chaff-cutter, of Albert Park Mews, Highbury—Between 12 and 1 a.m. on September 22nd I was with three others at Mount Pleasant, we saw four men coming toward us. One of them knocked up against me and I apologised, and he then bit me in the face. I went to retaliate, but missed him, and he then stabbed me in my left side. I did not see any weapon, and I do not recognise the prisoner. It was all done in about five minutes, and later on I found myself at the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newin's Court, Mitchell Street, St. Lukes, and am a carman. I was with Caney when this occurrence took place. When our party met the prisoner's party, the prisoner "shouldered" Caney, who begged the prisoner's pardon, and then the prisoner struck Caney in the face. He went to retaliate and the prisoner drew a knife and made a lunge at him. Caney stepped back and the prisoner made another lunge at him and stuck the knife in his side. They all then ran away and we took Caney to the hospital. On the following Wednesday even<lb/>ing at 11.30 p.m. I was in Warner Street, which runs in a line with Mount Pleasant and saw the prisoner cross the road and go into No. 52, Warner Street. I met two detectives at the corner of Eyre Street Hill and informed them and went to the house with them and there recognised the prisoner, who was in bed.</p>

He had a wound about 2 inches long in his left side between the eighth and ninth ribs, and was very feverish as the result of the complication of the wound. It has now healed up but I cannot say definitely whether or not any permanent injury will result from it.</p>

About 11.30 p.m. on September 25th I and another officer went with Parker to 52, Warner Street, where Parker pointed to the prisoner who was in bed and said, "That is the man," meaning the man who had stabbed Caney. I told him I was a police officer and should take him into custody for stabbing a man at Mount Pleasant on the morning of September 22nd. He said, "All right, if you say it is me, then it is me." At the station he said, "If you think I am the one who did it, put me inside; I have got to prove where I was."</p>

I am single, and live at Gladstone Terrace, Brighton—I used to live at Wallingford, in Surrey, the prisoner was in my service there as general servant—on January 10th I packed a quantity of wearing apparel, and directed the prisoner to send it on to me at Brighton—among the articles were 12 silk blouses, 4 dresses, a dressing-jacket, a velvet train, a shawl, a petticoat, a skirt, two bodices and a quantity of underclothing—I have since seen the property and identified it—it was to be sent by rail—a few days afterwards the box arrived at Brighton, I opened it and it contained only a few old rags. I had not locked it, the property was worth ₤35—in consequence of in<lb/>formation I received I charged the prisoner with stealing it—I found that some of the things had been pawned in Leytonstone—I saw the prisoner a few days after I received the box, I did not say anything to her about the loss of my property because I thought it might have been taken by the railway people—before I left Wallingford she had given notice—</p>

I work at Hemmingway's Colour Factory, Stratford Marsh, the prisoner formerly worked there, he left about October 3rd—on Saturday, October 5th, I saw him at the Sewer Bridge—he said I owed him 6s., I said "I <hi rend="italic">give</hi> it you three times, and you refused it"—he accused me of getting him the sack from Hemmingway's, and said he would pay me out—he put his hands into his pocket—I held him round his back, because I knew he had a revolver, I had my arms round his arms, I cannot say if the lower parts of his arms were free—while I was holding him he pulled out a revolver and shot at me while I was behind him, he missed me, then he got away from me, and I heard a shot across the road, I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Constable Larner <hi rend="italic">being</hi> shot on his leg—I went up to the prisoner again then, and held him tight down.</p>

               <p>he said "Look up, Bill"—I saw the prisoner in the middle of the roadway with a revolver in his right hand, aiming it at some man, there were several people about—he got on the footway and levelled the revolver at me, I said "Put that thing down," he ran away towards Stratford with the revolver still in his hand—I ran after him and caught hold of his right arm; I struck at his wrist with my truncheon and hit his fore arm and Manning closed on his left side—he did not release the revolver—I was putting my truncheon up to grapple with him when he pointed the revolver at my leg and said, "Shootee"—I had hold of his right arm then with my left hand just below his shoulder—I heard a report and felt I was shot—my trousers were all torn and there was blood on them—the bullet entered my leg just above the knee, it came out just below the knee and re-entered in the calf—I released my hold of the prisoner—I was put into a baker's van and taken to the hospital—I was there for thirty days and am still an attendant there—I did not know the prisoner before this.</p>

I am house surgeon at West Ham Hospital—Larner was admitted on October 5th, about 3 p.m.—I found a wound 3/4 in. long, 1/2 in. broad, and 4 1/2 ins. above his left knee joint, on the outside of his left leg, the edges were inverted—round the wound there were powder grains tatooed into the skin, particularly in the lower part, making a total measurement of 1 1/2 in. long and 1in. broad, including the powder grains—from the wound there extended a track beneath the skin in a downward, backward, and inward direction for five inches, and ended in the space behind the left knee—where there was another wound, 3/4 in. long and lin. deep—the bullet had evidently come out and gone in again, the edges were inverted—from that wound there extended a second track under the skin, backwards and inwards for 5ins., ending in a third wound a little to the left of the middle line at the back of the leg—the edges were everted, which showed that the bullet had evidently come out there—the lower part of that wound was seven inches below the knee joint—on probing the tracks we found that they were both ragged but neither touched bone—no large blood vessels were injured, but there was considerable oozing of the blood from the wounds—he was in the hospital thirty days I think—the pistol must have been pointed down, and I think the knee must have been bent at the time—I think the bullet was a softish, conical-shaped one.</p>

I went out and he assaulted me, I took proceedings against him and he was sentenced to two months' imprisonment by Mr Paul Taylor, he has uttered threats against me on several occasions before January and after—in April or March he said that he would do for me—he has repeatedly broken rules while in the workhouse, and I have had to send him before a Magistrate—I have only punished him once, but I have repeatedly cautioned him—he has been before a Magistrate to my knowledge nine times for assaulting the inmates.</p>
