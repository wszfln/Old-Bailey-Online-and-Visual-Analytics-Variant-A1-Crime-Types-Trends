                  </hi>. I am an undertaker at 56, Devons Road, Bow, and am one of the trustees of the Skegness Relief Fund—from time to time I signed cheques in conjunction with the other trustees—this signature on this cheque for £2 8s. 7d. is not mine—I did not authorise anybody to sign it—I was not aware in August, 1900. that the whole of the funds had been exhausted and the account closed—I first discovered that during the present year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I consider the imitation of my signature to be a very bad one—if this cheque had been submitted to me in the ordinary"way I should not have signed it because it has never been necessary for the trustees to sign so small a cheque—I do not know how many meetings I attended, or how many I was summoned to without attending—the great difficulty was to get you to have a meeting.</p>

I am the borough accountant for Poplar, and am one of the trustees for this fund—I attended meetings from time to time—at one of the meetings it was decided the accounts should be audited, and I, with one of the other trustees, was instructed to do it—once or twice I asked whether we might have the audit—I believe that was in 1898—I asked the prisoner for the books—he never let me have them—he did not give me any reason for that except that he was very busy and that it was not convenient to have the meeting—the books were never audited—the dividend warrants were sent to me from the bank—I sent them on to the prisoner—in August, 1900, I did not know that the whole of the funds had been exhausted, or that the account had been closed—I first heard of it in the beginning of this year—I wrote two or three letters to the prisoner, and I received this answer from him, dated January 31st, 1902, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)"Dear Mr. Mead,—Your letter to hand. It is most inconvenient for me to return to town just now. If you and your colleagues will just remember the patience I have shown during eight years you will feel the least you can do is to wait my pleasure now."—he was at Sudbury—he left the School Board in December, 1901, I think—I heard he had done so, and I wrote to him in the country.</p>

               <p>to 32, Great Peter Street, Westminster, to see a man whom I sometimes employ—No. 32 is a lodging-house—I went into the day-room and there saw about 100 people—as soon as I entered, four or five men jumped up and seized me—one seized my left arm and another my right arm and got behind me—I identify the two prisoners—I know them by name—Connors put his hand in my hip pocket and got it out altogether—Collins had already seized me by the throat with his hand—they threw me down on the floor, and I was rendered insensible for a minute or two—I took par<lb/>ticular notice of the two prisoners because they were in front of me—I could not identify the other men because they were behind me—the deputy connected with the lodging-house was there and saw what occurred—he told me I had better go and fetch a policeman, which I did, and I related the case to him—the policeman took a statement from the proprietor—I did not see the prisoners at the house when I returned—they ran out as soon as they threw me down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and live at 20, Abington Road, Bow—about 8.30, on May 19th, I was called to attend the prosecutrix—I examined her—I found a small incised wound—there was a fair amount of venous bleeding—I probed the wound, I found it was done with a sharp instrument which had glanced from the second rib to the third, to the extent of 1 1/2 inches—it was very near the vertebrae—it was not dangerous but it might have been dangerous if it had not struck the rib—if it had gone between the ribs it would, in my opinion, have been instant death to the woman—it was about inch deep—I should say it could be caused by this knife—I advised her removal to the hospital at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bank clerk and live at 22, Woburn Place—the deceased was a friend of mine, and at the beginning of June he was living with me at that address—on June 2nd, which was the occasion of the peace celebrations, I went out with him—we left home about 7 p.m., and having seen the illuminations in the West End, we returned home about 12.30 a.m.—we got home about 1.45 a.m.—we did not go in when we got to our house, but went on to the end of the road where it joins Euston Road—I left the deceased at the corner of the road and went over to the coffee stall opposite—he remained at the corner—we were both sober—we had not had any quarrel or dispute with anybody at that time—I was served with a cup of coffee at the stall—I finished my coffee and turned to rejoin my friend, when I saw he was surrounded by four or five men—I had left him for less than three minutes—the men had caps and mufflers on and dark clothes—their ages were about twenty or twenty-two—they were all talking when I came up and then they struck him in the face with their fists—I rushed at them with the deceased—we had a fight—they kept attacking us—I was kicked and hit in the stomach—we struck the men and kept them off us—one of them I struck down—we managed to get out into the middle of the road—we had been retreating backwards for about twenty yards or more towards Woburn Place—the men shouted "Kick them"—we had passed St. Pancras Church then—we must have been very near the electric lamp at the corner of Woburn Place and Ends<lb/>leigh Gardens—I saw a belt drawn, and I told the deceased we must cut for it—he said, "Yes," and we turned round and started to run in the direction of Upper Woburn Place which comes out ultimately into Russell Square—the deceased could not run as fast as I could, owing to his having been wounded in the foot while in South Africa—I took his arm and tried to drag him along—I looked round and saw a man with a belt about to strike—as far as I could see the belt was a black leather one with a big hook—it was not like this one—(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—we had barely run a few yards—I do not think we had got past the light at that time—he man with the belt struck the deceased over the head with it while we were running—I could not see where the blow alighted—the belt lapped round his head—he instantly fell on his face in the road almost opposite the corner of Ends<lb/>leigh Gardens—the men all ran into the Euston Road—I am not able to recognise any of the men—I am not able to say whether the prisoner struck the blow or not—the deceased did not get up—he remained un<lb/>conscious in the road—the police came up and the deceased was taken in a cab to the University College Hospital.</p>

I am a schoolmaster and live at 1, Woburn Buildings, St. Pancras—about 1.45 a.m. on June 3rd I was by St. Pancras Church—I saw the coffee stall on the other side of the road—I saw Mr. Budivent there—when I first saw him he was coming from the direction of the stall—I saw the deceased standing higher up the street than I was—he was alone when I first saw him—I saw five men go up to him together—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206300025"/>
               <p>they evidently came from the direction of the coffee stall—a minute or two after they went up to him they commenced pushing and striking him—I had not seen him do anything to them before that—I was only a few yards away, standing by the drinking fountain and on the same side of the road—the deceased kept retreating from the men and warding off the blows—I crossed over to the church side—the deceased and his friend kept retreating—I went up as far as the church gates—I saw a blow-struck which knocked the deceased down—the blow was evidently struck by a belt—just before the blow was struck I saw the prisoner swing his left arm and strike heavily at the deceased—there was something in his hand which I took to be a belt—I could not see what sort of a belt it was—the deceased was then just a few yards beyond Endsleigh Gardens—just after the blow had been struck a trap drove up which caused the assailants to scatter—the prisoner and two other men passed very close to me and I had no difficulty in identifying one of the three as they passed me—I had kept my eye all the time on the man who had used the belt, and I say it was the prisoner—the place is very well lighted—after the men had passed me they ran into Euston Road and Seymour Street—I did not go to the police—they came to me on the 13th—on the 17th I was at the Clerkenwell police court and I identified the prisoner from among nine others.</p>

I live at a lodging house—I used to live at a lodging house at Charlotte Place, Tottenham Court Road—I am an ironer by trade—just before 2 a.m. on June 3rd I was in Upper Woburn Place, and four or five yards from Woburn Buildings—I was walking towards Euston Road on the St. Pancras Church side of the road—I heard a scream—I saw some people in the middle of the road and I <hi rend="italic">run</hi> towards them—I got so near to them that if I had been a man instead of a woman I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have taken a decent stride to where the gentleman was, and then put my hand out and caught the coat—I was only about 1 1/2 yards off—I saw four or five men standing in the road, one of them was a little further off than the others, and I saw a man strike a gentleman as he was falling—he appeared to strike him on the left side of his head—I did not see anything in the man's hand—the gentleman fell with a heavy thud to the ground—he</p>

               <p>appeared to fall on his back—the man who struck the blow was the prisoner—I have no doubt about it—once before I had seen him at the coffee stall close by where I afterwards got a cup of cold water—I had seen the prisoner there on the previous Thursday or Friday—he asked me for a cup of coffee and I told him to do the same as I had to do, to pay for it, and he raised his left arm like that, as though he was going to strike me, but a gentleman got between us and I walked away, but I took a good look at him—I did not know his name or anything about him then, but when I saw the gentleman knocked down I recognised the man who did it as the man I had seen on the previous Friday—I went to the coffee stall and got some water, some brandy was asked for but I said it was impossible to get it—I did not see a policeman there—I went to the station the same morning and gave a description of the man—on the early morning of June 8th I went to the police station and was told I should be wanted about nine o'clock—I went there and picked the prisoner out from among nine or ten others—when I identified him he said, "Which hand did I strike with," Inspector Pugsley said, "No question had better be asked here"—I did not notice which arm the blow was struck with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the resident medical officers at the University College Hospital—I was present at the hospital when the deceased was brought in about 2.20 a.m. on June 3rd—Mr. Budivent was with him—the deceased was deeply unconscious and comotose—the only cut on him was a single one behind the left eye, that was a deep wound, not wide, but sharply cut; it might have been caused by the prong of a buckle of a belt—it was party punctured and party incised—he had dirt and blood marks on his face and on the front of his shirt—there was no dirt on the back of his head, but there was on the left side of his head—there was a bruise on the left elbow and one on the outer side of the left knee—I should have thought he fell on his left side and rather forward—he was evidently suffering from a fractured skull; there was no evidence of bleeding on the brain for five or six hours after<lb/>wards—an operation, trepanning, was performed at 9 a.m. that relieved his general condition, but not his mental condition as regards consciousness—he remained unconscious till he died at 6 p.m. on June 4th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found that death was due to the injuries to his head—the base of his skull was extensively fractured; there were over twelve separate fractures; the brain was slightly bruised—there was bleeding between the brain and the skull, and pressure on the brain which caused death—I think the seat of the injury which caused the fracture of the skull was just behind the left eye and in front of the temple—the bones were more crashed in there; the signs seemed to radiate from there, the fractures extending like a wheel or a star—in my opinion the factures could not have been caused by a belt; a man in a helpless condition falling would cause them—if a man received a blow such as caused the wound on the left of the eye he might very well fall in a helpless condition—the wound on</p>

               <p>next day in the cash book the £6,500 and the £17.500 is debited to Caspar Parsons, and a letter in May shows that the 600 deferred shares and the 3.000 shares are River Plate and South American Electric shares—I find no record of interest in cash paid to Parsons, but in the ledger he is credited with interest on December 31st. 1900, amounting to £692 11s. 11d.—in 1891 there is no entry to that effect—no balance appears in the general account after the payment of the £17,500—there are appreciable payments out of the deposit account between May loth and June 29th—on May loth, £1.000 to C.

James Oliver"'—I was present before the magis<lb/>trate when other exhibits were put in and when Moreno made this deposi<lb/>tion, which was taken down in writing, and signed by him, and in which he refers to exhibits 135, 138, 143, and 145 (<hi rend="italic">correspondence and cablegrams</hi>): (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "I am at the present time secretary to a public company, and I reside at 19, Oliver Grove, South Norwood. I deny entirely that there is any ground for the charges made against me. I have never conspired. I did not know Mr. C. Bright at all at the beginning of February, 1900. At that time. I was Chief Clerk in the American Legation at Madrid. In February, 1900.I had an offer from Mr. Bright through Mr. Sims. On February 26th. 1900. I went to London. I remained in London till the 5th April. 1900. During that time I had nothing whatever to do with Bright's business or the business of the companies. When I arrived, I confirmed the arrangement with Bright that I was to look after F. R. Bright's interests. That was one of the objects I came to London for, but the principal object was to look in connection with the Metropolitan Railway of Buenos Ayres. The accused. Bright, who held the Concession, was at that time thinking of commencing the construction of the railway. Between the 26th February and April 5th, 1900, I worked almost exclusively at the Hotel Cecil, except during about, two weeks at the end, when I was ill. On March 23rd. 1900, or on some day prior to it. Mr. Bright came to me and told me that he had certain shares belonging to his brother in his name, that on account of the litigation then going on, of which I had a very vague idea he thought it was no longer advisable for him to keep those shares. At that time I took Mr. Bright to be a rich man, and I had no reason whatever to doubt what he told me. And the transfer No. 5 was executed. At this time I knew there was some litigation going on, but I had a vague idea of what it was all about. On April 5th I left London and went to Paris on private business, which had nothing to do with Mr. Bright. I went to be married. While in Paris I met Mr. Bright once or twice. On May 22nd I returned to London and on May 24th, the accused. Bright called my attention to the fact that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206300049"/>
               <p>had not informed his brother, Mr. F. Bright, of this transfer (No. 5). I then wrote to Mr. F. Bright a letter dated May 24th, 1900, which I handed to Mr. Charles Bright on the same date, May 24th, 1900. I was appointed a director of the South American Electric Company, Limited, and on the 18th June following I became a director of the Metropolitan Railway of Buenos Ayres, Limited. From the 26th June, 1900, until the present time I have been managing director of the South American Electric Company at a salary of £308 4s. 7d. per annum. Since the 26th June, 1900.I have not received from the accused, Bright, one penny, either as salary, gift or in any other form. On May 24th, 1901, I became a director of the Central Buenos Ayres Railway Company. I became a director of Charles Bright and Co., on March 26th, 1901, and on August loth, 1901, I became a director of Bright's Light and Power, Limited. About the same date, or perhaps July, I became a director of the Buenos Ayres Electric Tramways Company, Limited. Until about July, 1901, I took no part whatever in the manage<lb/>ment of any of these companies. I had a desk at 14, Copthall Avenue, in the board room, quite apart from the general offices. The only company with which I had anything to do was the Metropolitan Railway of Buenos Ayres, and that not in the management, but in the preparation of estimates, preliminary work. Of course I was aware of the litigation going on, practi<lb/>cally, since I came to London, especially of the Arbitration between Charles Bright and the River Plate Company. On July 31st, 1901, I think it was, Mr. Fudge and I went to see Mr. Charles Bright at Boulogne. Bright told me that Mr. Fudge had 7,000 shares in Bright's Light and Power belonging to his brother, Mr. F. Bright, and he asked me to have them transferred to me by Fudge. Also 1,500 shares in the same company standing in the name of L. B. Trant. I cannot remember where the transfer for this last 1,500 shares came from. The transfer was made, however, and passed on September 11th, Mr. Harrower wrote to me claiming the shares. I took no notice. The first letter I received from Frederick Bright was about October 5th, 1901, by post, dated September 13th, 1901, and this letter of same date. I received a cablegram from him on September 13th, also on October 7th, and on October 11th. The latter telegram was in reply to one I sent a few days before, saying that the shares had been claimed by the trustee. I received the letter produced from F. Bright, dated October 17th, 1901, enclosing this letter from L. B. Trant, dated October 12th, 1901. I received this letter, dated October 31st, 1901 enclosing this copy. I received this telegram, dated November 25th, 1901, from F. Bright. The telegrams are addressed to my registered cable address "Mohican"In November, 1901, Mr. Charles Bright returned from South America and came to London. I could get no information from Mr. Charles Bright's ownership of these shares. The trustee had brought two suits against me, one for Charles Bright and Co.'s shares, and the other for the Bright's Light and Power shares. I consulted my solicitors. A judgment was given against me in the action for Charles Bright and Company's shares, and the others I gave up. Up to the time of the judgment I placed all the obstacles I could in the way of the trustee, believing honestly I was defending Fred. Bright's shares.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. I did not know in March, 1900, that; Killey had obtained judgment against Mr. Bright. I knew there was litigation. He may have told me that Mr. Killey had signed judgment against him for £5.000. He told me it was no longer advisable the shares should remain in his name. They were trans<lb/>ferred to my name, as it was no longer advisable for him to keep them and they were his brother's. At that time I held no power of attorney for F. R. Bright. In April 1901, Mr. Charles Bright was concerned in considerable litigation. I knew of the judgment of the Commercial Intelligence Bureau about the date of it. The arbitration in the River Plate Construction came to an end about March 1901. After that I executed transfers Nos. 8 and 9. I don't think I knew in 1900 of the charging order obtained by Mr. Killey on 12,500 shares. I knew it in 1901. In April, 1901, it was apparent to me that Charles Bright was in considerable difficulties. He asked me to transfer the shares to Mendeville and his brother. I asked him no questions about it. I did not consider myself bound to do what he asked. As a matter of fact I did. I knew of the presentation of the bankruptcy petition, its resis<lb/>tance by Charles Bright, and the making of the Receiving Order. I must have heard of it on July 30th. On July 31st I left for Boulogne, I think by the night boat by way of Calais. We went to the Hotel Folkestone, arriving thereabout 2 a.m. We did not see Bright at the Hotel Folkestone that day. We knew he was there. We did not go at Bright's request. I think Bright came to us on August 1st at the Hotel Folkestone. I think we left in the afternoon of August 1st. We were there, about four or five hours. The Receiving Order was mentioned. Miss Daisy Grosvenor was there. I have known her since I came to London. She has been always associated with the office, 14, Copthall Avenue. She was a typewriter at weekly wages. Down was always in the office. I went again to Boulogne on August 3rd or thereabouts. Owing to a desire to discuss business matter for a longer period. I think we agreed I should go. I went with John Down. I stayed from Saturday over Monday. Mr. Smurthwaite was already there. I think he remained He did not return with me on the second visit, I 'think the Receiving Order was mentioned. Everything was mentioned. I think only the 8.500 shares in Fudge's and Trant's names were mentioned as to be transferred to me. It did not occur to me that this was an effort on the part of Charles Bright to defeat the Receiving Order, which had been made within a week. I did swear on January 2nd, 1902, that I denied that Fudge had transferred the 7,000 shares at the bankrupt Bright's request. Bright asked me to got them from Fudge that is my explanation. At that time I was doing all I could to defeat the trustee. I would do it again. I did swear in that affidavit that I was acting as the said bankrupt directed. I did not know of the transfer 25, Fudge to Vidal, till it came. As far as I know it was brought over by Vidal. I trans<lb/>ferred the shares to Elkin and Hastings referred to in exhibits 10 and 11, at Charles Bright's request, according to instructions he gave when I was in Boulogne. I had no hesitation in fulfilling those instructions. I did not know the reason for these transfers of F. Bright's shares. I did not ask. It did not cross my mind that the defendant was ridding himself of his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206300051"/>
               <p>property to defeat the judgments. The only company that paid me was the South American Electric Company. They had no banking account. The money was drawn by Charles Bright and Co., Limited, by cheques on Glyn, Mills and Co. The letters I received from Bright, Nos. 91 and 92, dated September 6th and September 9th, are headed Buenos Ayres. I had rather you did not press me for an answer whether I do not now think that the subsequent letters from F. R. Bright were inspired by Charles Bright I had a suspicion then. I think I first had a power of attorney for F. Bright in May, 1901. I thought it was very natural that it should be dated about that time when difficulties were grave. The new power of attorney in the name now of Miss Daisy Grosvenor was first shown to me on January 22nd, 2 902. the day I was served with a summons from this court. I have always intended to go into the witness box in this enquiry. I know that the Chancery actions against me were adjourned in order to get an affidavit by F. R. Bright When Mr. Charles Bright would give no information at my solicitors, I was suspicious enough to wash my hands of the whole matter. The action proceeded. I did not desist. I wanted Mr. F. Bright to take charge of the action and the plaintiffs to leave me alone. I wanted my costs also. Mr. Charles Bright suggested the writing of the letter of November 21st (No. 45). I knew it did not come from F. R. Bright at all. He was in Buenos Ayres Mr. Charles Bright also suggested my writing the letter No. 46. I knew of the letter No. 47 being written. It is an absurd sugges<lb/>tion that at the meeting of the company on November 21st, when I was in the chair, I knew that the re-allotment of the shares was an endeavour fraudulently to conceal the property of Charles Bright. A meeting of directors of December 13th, 1901, was held at my house, as was ill. I was too ill to pay the slightest attention to the application (No. 33) of Miss Daisy Grosvenor. I did not know of the application. It never occurred to me that these shares belonged to Mr. Charles Bright. I will swear that I, at the time din't know what was the purpose of opening the account for Miss Grosvenor for £10,000. On November 28th, 1901, I don't think Charles Bright and Co. had any amount to its credit at the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mr. Charles Bright.</hi> I will not swear that Charles Bright told me of the Killey judgment. I don't recollect if, when I came over from Paris first, Charles Bright told me that his brother's interest and his might sometimes clash. It was understood that I was to look after his brother's interest. If any difference arose, I was to use my discretion. We have had arguments. The power of attorney I held was simply to deal with F. R. Bright's interest in companies when there was a question as to investing money for him. I could not do it without authority. I knew Charles Bright had a general power of attorney. Several things I refused to do when Charles Bright asked me. I won't swear positively the Receiving Order was mentioned when I was at Boulogne. I went there to discuss business in general, not to discuss transfers of shares. One matter was the South American Electric Company collecting £2,000 from the Tramways Company. Another was the sale of the tramways in Buenos Ayres. The Metropolitan Railway was also discussed. All the business of all the com<lb/>panies</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206300052"/>
               <p>was discussed. I did not know that Fudge's shares were F. R Bright's. I wrote to Mr. Fudge on August 10th, and requested him to transfer the shares. I did not speak to him about the shares before we went to Boulogne The object of the transfer of the 7,000 shares and 1,500 shares was to obtain voting power in the company and not to conceal the property. The question of concealing the property was never mentioned I have so sworn in affidavits. My recollection is that in November, 1901, we could get no particulars from Charles Bright as to F. R. Bright's owner ship. We wanted documentary evidence. He wanted to give evidence himself. I considered that was no good. Immediately after that the accused (Bright) was taken ill. I was not offered remunerative employ<lb/>ment by Wingfield and Blew. I have not had any offer from them. I do not know Mr. F. R. Bright One of the reasons I suspected the letters of F. R. Bright were inspired by the accused (Bright), was the style of the letters Mr. Charles Bright told me to open the credit for £10,000 for Miss. Grosvenor. I said I could not do that without Mr. F. R. Bright's express instructions At that time, according to the books, Charles Bright and Co. owed F. R. Bright more than £100,000 for the Metropolitan Railway Concession. Offers of £100,000 cash have been made for it. A cheque for £18,000 was brought to me signed by the accused (Bright), and I declined to accept it. Since these proceedings commenced I returned it. This is the cheque. The words "pp. F. R. Bright, D. Grosvenor" have been added since, and the endorsement. We consulted the solicitors of the company before re-allotting the shares The accused (Bright) was in custody at the time the cheque No. 145 was presented. As long as I thought what Charles Bright requested was right, I did it. I followed his suggestions so often as I did because he had great experience, and was the brother of F. R. Bright. I have repeatedly offered the trustee to transfer the shares still standing in my name. This is a copy of a letter I wrote to Fudge, dated October 14th."</p>

               <p>Chambers. I am the trustee in the bankruptcy of Charles Bright. On July 30th, 1901, a Receiving Order was made. On August 1st there was a notice of appeal against the Receiving Order. On August 20th the creditors resolved on the adjudication of the defendant, and on September 9th last he was adjudicated bankrupt. On the same day I was appointed trustee. The public examination was fixed for September 24th. Mr. Bright did not attend. It was adjourned to November 13th. On November 8th Mr. Bright's appeal against the Receiving Order was heard by the Court of Appeal and dismissed with costs. Mr. Bright did not attend on November 13th. There was an adjournment to November 27th, on which day the defendant did not attend, and the examination was adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die.</hi> Mr. Bright has not filed any statement of affairs, neither has he given any assistance towards the realisation of his estate. About November 17th I had an interview in London with the accused, and there was another interview either on November 18th or 19th at my solicitor's office. I did not inform him that the examination was adjourned to November 27th; so far as I recollect no reference was made to it. On December 12th the Official Receiver obtained a warrant against the defendant for failing to appear. On January 16th I reported to the Court, and on the 17th the Court made an Order for the prosecution of the bankrupt On January 21st I swore an information at this Court, on which a warrant was granted for some little time past I have been unwell, and as a consequence I have left the detail of this case to Messrs. Fairbairn and Wingfield, Chartered Accountants under my sanction. Mr. Fairbairn has made a minute examination of the books and documents. <hi rend="italic">Examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CRANE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">for Bright.</hi> On November 16th or 17th last I saw Mr. Bright at a club in company with Mr. Smurthwaite, and I was with him from about 2 to 6 p.m. We had a conversation about Mr. Bright's bankruptcy and matters relating thereto. The next day I saw him again, and we had another conversation of about two hours, and on or about November 22nd we had another long conversation. I believe Mr. Bright called once or twice at my office. In these conversations Mr. Bright talked most of the time. I also saw Mr. Bright at a meeting of Charles Bright and Co., Limited. I also saw him at a Board meeting. We had no <hi rend="italic">private</hi> conversation that day. During our conversation I never heard that Mr. Bright had come over to see me against his doctor's orders. Mr. Bright said he was not well, and that he was going away immediately to undergo a severe operation. In these conversations Mr. Bright told me all about the Killey judgment. From what he said, and from what my solicitors have told me, I know that that judgment was based on a contract for the purchase of a concession in South America, and the contract was to be carried out in South America. Bright said that Killey and his partners were the owners of the concession Bright was to purchase. I know that Killey has never been here, that his action was brought by Power of Attorney by Mr. Weir, the writ was for £20,000. An Order was made for £5,000 to be paid into Court, and leave was given to defend as to the rest. I know that Bright brought an action to set aside the Killey judgment. I don't know that Killey issued a summons to set that aside. There was a whole</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206300054"/>
               <p>shoal of actions, and I left the details to my solicitors. Mr. Bright did inform me that the Killey judgment was obtained on the faith of an instru<lb/>ment in Spanish which he said was a fraud. Mr. Bright also told me that proceedings were being taken by him in Buenos Ayres against Mr. Killey. Mr. Bright referred to so many actions that I suggested that he should see my solicitor and my solicitor has investigated Mr. Bright's statements, and has advised me that Mr. Bright's objections cannot be held in regard to the Killey judgment. Mr. Bright referred to four or five actions, viz.: The Killey the River Plate the Sandford, and, I think, two others. The admitted claims in the bankruptcy of Bright are:—Thomas, £7 18s. 6d.; Rapkin. £97 9s. 6d.; Crawford and Chester £23 17s. 6d.; the Commercial and Intelligence Bureau, £1028 3s. 3d. The time for the determination of the unadmitted claims has been extended to March 25th. The unad<lb/>mitted claims are: The Killey, £5,000; James Capel and the River Plate Construction. £2.445 10s.; James Capel and Co., £7,035 9s. 7d.; H. D. Perin, £42 6s. 10d.; Woodthorpe, Bevan, and Co., £84; Chas. Bright and Co., Limited (that is rejected). £58.494 4s. 8d.; South America Electric Company, Limited (that is rejected), £37,484 2s. 10d.; James Oliver (also rejected), £2.160; Chas. Bright and Co., Limited (rejected), £25,000; a further claim not yet adjudicated. The first two claims I have mentioned as rejected are standing over for further proof. Mr. Bright's object in meeting me was to get me to fight these actions for him, and that if I would he would find me the money, and that if not he defied me as the trustee, as he said he did not come under the English Bankruptcy Court. Mr. Bright told me that he disputed everything. I know that £75 was paid into Court in the action Bright <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Killey as security for costs. I have no knowledge as to whether any portion of the £75 has been paid out to my solicitor. Mr. Bright did ask me to continue the Killey action. I did not agree to do so if funds were provided. I know that the bankruptcy petition was stayed by the Registrar. I know that my solicitor agreed to recon<lb/>sider his opinion of the Killey action if Mr. Bright would put down £.500 as earnest money. I think that in the presence of Mr. Bright my solicitor had given it as his opinion that there was nothing in Mr. Bright's conten<lb/>tion. I did not consider this matter sufficiently important to take Counsel's opinion. When I assumed the trusteeship the action Bright <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Killey was still pending; it is still pending my decision as to whether I shall continue the action. I take it that at this moment I may continue the action if I am so disposed. I wish to correct that that action has been dismissed. I can't remember on what terms. In the action of the Intelligence, etc., Bureau Bright there was judgment for £514 12s. 6d. on March 27th, 1901. I don't remember Bright speaking about that action. I didn't offer to go to Paris to see Bright if he would pay the expenses of myself and Mr. Wing<lb/>field That action for £514 12s. 6d. was based on a contract in which Mr. Bright had contracted to take some shares. 1,000 bonus shares were allotted to Mr. Bright. They had been transferred to my name. I can't remember what value was placed on them. These are the only shares of Mr. Bright's that have been transferred to me. The security in that claim has not been valued. Mr. Bright brought an action to set aside that claim</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190206300055"/>
               <p>on the ground of misrepresentation and fraud in the prospectus. The Committee of Inspection consist of Mr. Taylor (of the River Plate Con<lb/>struction), Mr. Percy Wingfield (Secretary of the Intelligence, etc., Bureau), Mr. Warner, solicitor, representing Mr. Killey. The solicitors for the River Plate Construction also attend. My solicitors, Messrs. Wingfield and Blew, are also solicitors for the petitioning creditor, the Commercial Intelligence Bureau. Mr. Bright wished me to continue all his actions, but I don't remember him specially mentioning this one. In our discussions as to Messrs. Capel's claim Mr. Bright informed me that he had a contract with Messrs. Capel with respect to concessions in South America, and I under<lb/>stood that he agreed to go out there to extend the time for those concessions, and when he returned there was a litigation with Messrs. Capel, the subject matter being whether he had had these concessions extended; it was referred to arbitration; the award was that Mr. Bright should be entitled to 60,000 (£1) shares in the River Plate Construction Company on paying £60,000 for them. Mr. Bright didn't pay for them. Those shares were valued at £32,965 by Messrs. Capel, and they proved for the difference between that sum and £60,000. That claim will stand until the shares are disposed of; there is an Order of the Court to value those shares dated about last August. I have called upon Messrs. Capel to have those shares valued; they have not done so. Mr. Bright told me that in his opinion all these four claimants against him were acting fraudulently. My Committee instituted these criminal proceedings. Mr. Bright has contended that these shares concerned in this charge were not his, but belonged to Chas. Bright of Buenos Ayres, also that Charles Bright was the trading name of persons in Buenos Ayres. I have also been informed that by Argentine law a trader must disclose to whom his capital belongs, and that the books must be stamped on every page. I have satisfied myself from my investiga<lb/>tions, and from that of my solicitors, that the defendant is the holder of these shares. I have made no inquiry as to the existence of a firm trading as "Chas. Bright" in Buenos Ayres. After the examination of the witnesses in the Bankruptcy Court I came to the opinion that a criminal offence had been committed, principally the examination of the defendants Moreno and Fudge. I know that notice was originally for the application for the adjudication of bankruptcy to be heard on November 4th; that was changed to September 9th, 1901. I can't say at whose instance. I know that Mr. Bright returned to England on November 17th. A warrant for contempt in the Bankruptcy Court was applied for and subsequently withdrawn. I have no doubt that Bright was ill in Paris. I personally applied for the warrant of this Court.</p>

It was reported to me that judgment had been signed against him in his absence. An application was made to set aside that judg<lb/>ment. I left the whole matter to my solicitors. All the facts I have deposed to in the information I knew of my own knowledge and from reports of my solicitor. At that time I did not know that Mr. Moreno had held positions in the American Embassy at Madrid and later at Paris, nor do I know so now. I cannot remember having heard so before; if</p>

               <p>I had known so it would have made no difference to my view I do not know that Mr. Moreno was a stranger to Mr. Charles Bright previous to his coming here If I had known that it would still have made no difference to my view. I know of my own knowledge that Mr. Moreno has been in the service and pay of Mr. Charles Bright, and I arrived at my knowledge on hearing Mr. Moreno give evidence, and also from a personal interview with Mr. Fudge. I never told Mr. Moreno that I thought he was perfectly right in refusing to give up the shares standing in his name. I leave all the details of the actions in regard to the estate to my solicitors There are a number of actions pending in regard to Bright's Light and Power Com<lb/>pany's shares In regard to those in Moreno's name, Moreno claims that he is a trustee for Mr. Frederick Bright, and says that the latter ought to be made a party to the actions. I believe that my solicitor is instruct<lb/>ted to commence an action against Moreno, claiming the shares in his name in the company, Charles Bright and Co., Limited. I did not know that Mr. Moreno was not a director of Charles Bright and Co., Limited, at the forfeiture of the shares, nor until longer afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Wingfield and Blew, solicitors, of 74, Cheapside—I first acted as solicitor for the Commercial Intelligence Bureau, Limited, and conducted the proceedings on their behalf up to the date of the Receiving Order last year—subsequently I acted for the trustee—I was so acting in October last when Fudge and Moreno were examined in bankruptcy—I received no information with regard to the actual position of affairs of Charles Bright and Co., Limited, except what the petitioning creditors told me—I was not able to examine the books—I obtained from those examinations considerable information with regard to the administration of this company's affairs, and by order of the Examiner, Mr. Hansell, I examined the books—Bright was in London between November 16th and 23rd last—I saw him three or four times with Mr. Harrower—he only obtained information with regard to his litigation, but none with regard to the distribution of assets—he always maintained that he had none except the shares which the Commercial Intelligence had given us, which he had in that company—the public examination had been postponed twice, and was fixed for November 27th last—Bright left England the Saturday before that—I served him personally with a notice on Friday, November 22nd—he did not return to this country till January 19th or 20th—between those dates I received no assistance from him—with regard to the</p>

The action of the Intelligence Bureau Co. was brought under my supervision—it was for payment of £500 for Bright's calls on 1,000 shares, 50 per cent having been called up—I got judgment under Order 14 on March 27th—the vendors had also agreed to give him 1,000 fully-paid ordinary shares as a bonus—they gave them to the trustee—the judgment was obtained upon affidavits sworn, I think, by the secretary of the Intelligence Bureau Co. or my brother, Mr. Percy Wingfield, who was the chartered accountant at the formation of the company—I gave the bankruptcy notice three days after the judgment, and the petition was filed on May 23rd—I did not disclose the fact that we had the shares—it was not necessary—it did not occur to me they were held as security—there was no right in the company to hold those vendors' shares—I have not the Articles of Association—I can produce them—I will ascertain whether Bright was on the Register—I was present when my brother was examined before Mr. Registrar Giffard—Bright was nominated for the vendors' shares about a year before the action was commenced, and at the time of the contract—Bright has denied being the owner of the shares in Bright and Co. from the beginning—if that were so he could not give up the books—the meeting for the examination of Bright on November 4th was antedated to September 9th—I was not cognizant of his movements after July 30th—I did not know that he had gone to Brazil—Mr. Smurthwaite said that he had gone to South America—that was at the first meeting—I forget the date, I will take it from you it was August 6th—I think one meeting was adjourned—Mr. Smurthwaite stated on the first day that Bright had gone to Buenos Ayres before the Receiving Order, and I denied it at the time because I had seen him the day before if it was August 6th—I do not accept that date—the application for antedating the examina<lb/>tion was supported by my affidavit, in which I stated I went to Boulogne in July and that I saw him twice at Boulogne, on August 3rd and again on August 10th—I thought so at the time, but if he sailed on August 9th from Bordeaux I could not have seen him on August 10th—I think now that I did not—I saw him on two occasions, on the second he was with Mr.' Smurthwaite and they went into Bayley's Hotel—I stayed at the adjoining Hotel Paris—I may have got wrong in the date—I said that he was not on his way to South America, and must have known of the Receiving Order—Mr. Smurthwaite stated he was on his way to Brazil—I understand now that he was—I do not see that the date is material—I keep a diary and a day<lb/>book—I do not enter what I do in my holidays, but I will look for entries on August 10th and 12th, the 11th was a Sunday—the object of the affi<lb/>davit was not to antedate the examination sixty days—the object was to show that instead of Bright going straight to Buenos Ayres about three' weeks before, he had at a much later date been seen at Boulogne—the</p>

               <p>previous Saturday was the August Bank Holiday—that was why I went to Boulogne on the Saturday with my family, and came back the following Tuesday night, August 6th, and I went back on the Saturday following, August 10th, and returned on the Monday or Sunday evening—I think I saw him on the first Saturday I arrived and again on the Tuesday before I left, and I must have put down the following Saturday in mistake—I state in my affidavit that on the following Saturday, August 17th, I went again to Boulogne and was informed at Bayley's Hotel that he had removed to the Imperial Hotel in the same town—I could not believe in the coinci<lb/>dence that I had seen him, so I went to enquire at Bayley's Hotel; they told me he had removed to the Imperial—I did not pursue the matter—I did not like detective work—I did not go to the hotel to do detective work, but to make sure I was not mistaken—I do not know of any other affidavit in support of the application antedating Bright's examination from November 4th to September 6th—I was not present, I do not think there was one—the Official Receiver conducted the proceedings, and the Registrar directed him to cancel November 4th and fix the earlier date on the application of the creditors James Capel and Co,. Killey, and the Commercial Intelli<lb/>gence Bureau—I think when the facts were brought to the Registrar's notice I was present—I knew that Bright had appealed against Registrar Giffard's order, that it was pending, because he asked the Registrar to stay the bankruptcy pending it—the Registrar refused because he was of opinion that during the Long Vacation Bright would make away with his property—the evidence of that is in the Registrar's judgment, which is on the file—the civil actions against the nominees of Bright were brought at the instance of the Committee of Inspection, and on my advice—I expect I swore the affidavit in Moreno's action referred to in the examination before Master Lawford and in the Killey judgment case, because I have sworn so many—I swore that Bright said he had no assets in this country—I cannot recollect the words, but I meant in this country—I assume the copy affidavit is correct—judgment had been obtained a month before that—that affidavit was on an application to set aside the judgment—I know that Bright did come back on November 16th, and from his own informa<lb/>tion that he landed from South America at Bordeaux on November 9th, and came to London within a week on a Sunday—Harrower knew it—I do not know that he despatched a message to Harrower—Harrower did not tell me the next day—he telegraphed to Harrower and to my residence—the meeting on September 4th was adjourned to November 13th, and again adjourned—the Receiving Order was on July 30th, Bright left on the 29th—the creditors' resolution for adjudication was on August 28th—Harrower who lived at Enfield, came to see Bright—Harrower told me they had a very long interview and decided to discuss nothing except in my presence, and they adjourned till the following morning at my office, because their meeting was at a club on a Sunday and they had no papers—the next day, Monday, both came to my office—we talked over matters nearly the whole day—I made notes in my day book—I will produce it—I swore the affidavit of December 9, that I had a long interview with Bright on Monday, November 18th—I had many interviews—we certainly</p>

               <p>saw him that week—Bright stated that he had consulted a surgeon in Paris, and that he had submitted to an operation—I have no reason to doubt it—I have had letters from Paris confirming it—I only employed a detective a fortnight, that expired practically the day Bright was arrested, on January 7th—we had agents in Paris, solicitors, not detectives—I understood Bright was to undergo an operation—it was a thing of the future—the Registrar adjourned the examination with the result that the Official Receiver applied for a warrant—he consulted me about it—a warrant was issued—Bright could not be served—he was out of the jurisdiction—I have heard that the warrant was withdrawn—Vidal, Moreno, and Fudge were examined—Vidal told the Registrar that Bright had undergone an operation in Paris, and was ill in bed, and the Registrar wrote across the file "withdrawn "or "suspended" owing to Vidal's evidence—Bright returned to London from Paris on January 19th or 20th—I saw him on January 21st at the Treasury, sitting in the waiting-room—while I was talking to Mr. Angus Lewis, a piece of paper was written on by Bright—I read it—it was a list of crimes, bribery, forgery, perjury, conspiracy—I surmise that his object in going there was to accuse the trustee and the Committee of Inspection of all these crimes, and blackmailing and a lot of things, I believe perjury was one—Bright was arrested the following day, and his two trunks and a dressing-case at the Hotel Cecil were seized, and his books and papers in Paris, at the instance of the trustee, and he was taken, I believe, to Holloway—I was present at the hearing before the magistrate—the bail was two sureties in £2,000 each—Bright was unable to find it, and it was reduced—the Par's authorities refused to give up his trunks without the consent of both parties—I heard a lot about it and read of it in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi>—Bright has given me no assistance—I think we have practically all the shares of Bright's Light and Power and Bright and Company in the possession of the trustee.</p>

From inquiries through the United States Embassy in Paris, your character is satisfactory—when the detective was watching Bright he made those inquiries, in January—I think you have always claimed to hold the shares in Bright and Company for F.

Bright had any interest in the shares—I think you read letters from F. R. Bright to support your case—you went into the box and gave evidence as to F. R. Bright's title—I read a letter from you the next day and on other dates—on February 12th there was an action about the re-issued shares—we objected to the re-issue—we knew it was being done and wrote to your solicitors objecting—you did it as a director of the company—if you say so I will admit that we issued a writ to prevent further re-issue—we could not accept your terms, and 1 suggested that the only way was for you to defend the action which is still alive—I know Mr. Oliver—he has lived many years in South America—as far as I know you were not a director of Charles Bright and Company, Limited, at the time of the forfeiture of the 12,500 shares.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The action against Moreno for the recovery of the shares was early in October—it stood over at his request for two months for affidavits—F. R. Bright, in an action before Mr. Justice Buckley, insisted upon being the owner of the shares and Moreno produced correspondence produced here at the time the affidavit should have been made—Moreno commenced an action about the end of November, and sought to remove the directors, Wharton being one, of Bright's Light and Power, as soon as the directors showed a desire to assist the trustee, and the circular of December 31st, 1901, as to their removal was drawn up and sent out by Moreno—the action continued till March 8, when it was abandoned—at the meeting which was held in consequence of the circular, every director was removed, or purported to be—the Receiver would not let Moreno have the minute book—Moreno executed a deed poll of January 10th—Cohen and Cohen were acting for him—the deed poll was produced by Moreno's solicitors with affidavits in support of the motion to remove the Board—all the directors except Moreno were removed—Fudge had resigned—Fudge had been a director until after the receiving Order—we have applied to Bright's representatives to have Bright's boxes in Paris opened in his presence, and to use any documents because he con<lb/>tended at the Guildhall that we were keeping back materials for his defence—that offer was made by our agents in Paris to his agents in Paris and refused, and afterwards an application was made by Bright to get the luggage himself—my affidavit of December 9th correctly sets forth the whole information I obtained from Bright during his stay here from November 16th to 23rd—I personally asked him to file a statement of affairs—Bright's documents have been sealed by the Court or the police authorities, but the trunks can be opened by the consent of both parties, and if objection is withdrawn they can come to London, or if the trustee withdraws his objection, Mr. Bright can have them.</p>

I live at 36, Lansdowne Road, Old Charlton, and am an accountant—I am employed at the Supply Depot in Woolwich Dockyard—the prisoner is one of the clerks tinder my control there—he came into that employment on April 21st—he had been in the Army Reserve—he had to prepare monthly accounts in connection with the supply of provisions—in order to do that he would have bills of contractors, before him—the bills would show the prices at which the contracts were tendered—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is an office copy of a bill showing the prices at which Sturton Brothers were supplying provisions—the prisoner would require that bill for his work—whilst he was using it it would be kept in</p>

Sturton Brothers,—Sirs,—Being in a position to give you valuable information regarding your Contract with the Government for Meat and Vegetable Rations, this said information is such that will enable you to know exactly what to quote each month for future deliveries, giving you in ample time the latest prices quoted by other firms for current deliveries of the same article and of the same stan<lb/>dard quality as your own, there are now no less than eight other firms contracting for meat and vegetable rations other than yours, viz.,—Maconochie Bros., 131, Leadenhall Street, London; John Moir and Sons, Limited, 9 and 10, Great Tower Street, London; Poulton and Noel, 62, Brewery Road, London; J. M. Davidson, Logan Street, Glasgow; Duhamel and Co., Plough Yard, Shoreditch; Lazenby and Son, 18, Trinity Street, London; Moir and Wilson, Esplanade and Old Ford Road, Aberdeen; the London Canning Co., 30, York Road, King's Cross. I can quote you each of the firms' prices for current deliveries each month, as this will convince you yours for old contract was 9s. 6d., last bill passed for you was 2,028 cases, total £2,247 10s., and now you have a contract for another 72,000 at 9s. 3d. I could have given you such information that would have at least given you a few hundred pounds more, so if this is of any use to you reply per return, confidentially, when the necessary information will be supplied you on the following conditions, that is, 10 per cent. on the actual benefit gained, taking as a basis your first con<lb/>tract, viz., 9s. 6d. per dozen, that is to say, supposing by information supplied you get 9s. 9d. per dozen that would be 3d. per dozen, and on 12,000 tins that would mean £75 net gain; my charge, 10 per cent., £7 10s. Again, I may benefit you in helping you to increase your Contract, if you can supply more than you are at present doing; also assist you in getting your Bills passed quickly. This must be in strict confidence. Awaiting immediate reply.—I remain, yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. FLETCHER</hi>." The list of names in that letter is correct—the information could be obtained from the office copies of the contractors' bills, and to which the prisoner had access—no clerk has any right to divulge that information to any out<lb/>sider—I know Messrs. Sturton, of Cambridge; they have held several contracts from the War Office for meat and vegetable rations—the contracts are given out, as a rule, by tender from the Director of Contracts at the War Office—other things being equal the cheapest tender is accepted—I was afterwards shown this letter, dated May 24th (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Sirs,—Your</p>

               <p>acknowledgment to hand, and as there has been an important development in price of meat and vegetable rations and favourable to sellers,—should communicate the same at once to you immediately you accept my terms I may add that I am not employed in the Dockyard but am in touch with the principals in the supplies branch, and this information is not got without cost; therefore, by getting the information from me it does not interfere with the conditions of your contract. Of course this must be kept strictly private. Again, I may say there may be some other goods you manufacture you could get contracts for. If you accept my offer I will send you a schedule of goods the Government are now purchasing for shipment to South Africa, together with average current prices. In haste, awaiting your decision, I remain, yours faith<lb/>fully, Fletcher. Messrs. Sturton Bros., Cambridge."—The information in that letter is correct and could be obtained by the prisoner from the same source as the other.—I also saw this letter: "28, New Road, Woolwich, May 28th, 1902. Dear Sir,—Yours to hand this morning re the two mistakes Price of present Contract it was a misunderstanding between my informant and myself. I understood him, to say your present contract was 9d. under the last one. Instead of that it was 9d. increase, conse<lb/>quently your present contract stands at 10s. 3d., which price I will take as a base to work on any increase of price from that 10 per cent, re the amount of bill, I cannot say the amount I stated your bill was in my first but, to convince you I am getting copy (Office) of your last bill and forwarding it on to you, so you may see the information is reliable, as no one but myself could get in possession of them this, of course, I am trusting your honour to return at once the amount of the two bills that have been passed to War Office are as under: Original Bill sent by you was £712 13s. 2d, amended Bill passed for payment 17,724 tins, 633 cases, £701 11s. 6d. Passed to W.O. for payment 16/4/02. The following is a copy of your letter pinned on the front of the Bill:—' 11 April 02. Dear Sir—We enclose corrected Bill for 7,907, and trust the same will now be found in order. We will include the ten cases with our last delivery.—We are, yours truly, Sturton Bros.' Reference No. A.B., 531/02 The <hi rend="italic">last Bill, which I will forward copy as stated on receipt</hi>, 56,784 tins, 2,028 cases, £2,247 14s. Passed to the War Office for payment 12 May, 1902. Your last contract, 53 Cape 6978, 72;000 at 10s. 3d. to deliver 18,000 per week. This should be sufficient to satisfy you re the reliability but if you will promise to send back copy of bill, I will forward copies of other Firms' Bills to guarantee correctness these Bills are initialed by Colonel in charge of supplies. When checked reply at once as time is important.—In haste, Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. FLETCHER</hi>."—The document referred to is the copy I have already seen—no clerk is allowed to send copies of an account out of the office—I would not part with one myself without getting a receipt for it, and then only to a proper authority—I am acquainted with the prisoner's writing—in my opinion these letters and this envelope are in the his writing.</p>

               <p>called out for two years and served till 1902—he was then serving as a colour-sergeant—Sturton's bills had been passed to the War Office for payment—what the prisoner did was wrong, because he improperly parted with an official record—the lowest tender is not always accepted, but it is the regular thing in my experience—Maconochie tendered for the same class of goods as Sturton and their price was higher than Sturton's, and they got a larger order than Sturton for the same quality of goods, but there was a reason for that—if the Government want ten millions of a thing and the big con<lb/>tractors can only supply nine, then the other million must be got at a higher price—each clerk has a separate locker and key—I do not think all the keys were alike—I cannot say if the prisoner's key would open all the lockers in the room, but I should not think so, because I know when clerks have mislaid their keys they have been unable to open their lockers with other keys—I know the meaning of the Official Secrets Act of 1889—I have seen many copies of it posted up in Government offices—it was no part of my duty to have any conversation with my subordinates about that account—when the prisoner was sent to me I did not say to him, "Re-member, documents in front of you are confidential," or that it is an offence to communicate anything official—no notice to the effect was posted up in my room, but my office is only a temporary one.</p>

I keep a coffee-house at 22, Blackfriars Road—on June 10th the prisoner was in my employ as a nurse—about 11.30 a.m. on that day I heard a call rushed upstairs—the prisoner told me the hoys' room at the top of the house was on fire—I went upstairs, and with the assistance of my waiter extinguished the flames—the room was full of smoke—I thought the waiter and the kitchen porter had been smoking—at 1.20 I was again called upstairs—I rushed to the top of the house—I could not see anything then, but on the second floor I found a chair on a bed and some girls' things and bedding were all alight—that was in the waitresses' room, the prisoner's room was next to it—I went to the police station and Inspector Pipe came to my house in the afternoon—I asked the prisoner if she had seen anybody go upstairs, and she said no—after dinner I asked her to fetch her matches down—two days afterwards she said she did not know why she had done it, and she was very sorry—at the time of the fire there were about 100 customers in the shop—about £25 worth of damage was done.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On June 10th I saw the prisoner in the presence of her master"—she denied all knowledge of the fire—there was another servant in the room at the time, and the prisoner said to her, "Did not you say you would have revenge against your master?"—the other girl went into hysterics, and the prisoner said, "It is true, I set the beds on fire, forgive me"—I took her to the station, where she made a, statement which was taken down in writing (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—"I am a nurse in the employ of Mr. Adams, coffee-house keeper, 22, Blackfriars Road. On Tuesday morning, the 10th inst., I took my mistress's children to school in Stamford Street. I returned to 22, Blackfriars Road at 9.40. I went upstairs to the top-floor back-room and set fire to the corner of the room with a match; that is where the waiter and porter sleep. I ran out of the room. The maid rushed downstairs and shouted out, 'The house is on, fire.' My master came rushing upstairs to where the fire was. I went up and saw the fire had been put out. At 12.25 the same day I fetched the children from school. About 12.40 I went up to fetch the children's aprons. I went into the second-floor front and set the bed on fire with a match. I came down to the dining-room and went down after<lb/>wards into the shop. I cannot say why I did it, I am sorry, for I had no spite against anyone in the house. I make this statement quite voluntarily. I have read it over, and it is quite true."</p>

The police stated that a fire had occurred at a previous situation of the prisoner's, and that she had been discharged from employments several times for thefts and cruelty to children. Dr. Scott, the medical officer at Holloway, stated that he could find no signs of insanity, that she would give no explanation of the conduct, and that she had had no hysterics whilst under his care. <rs id="t19020630-522-punishment-43" type="punishmentDescription">
