The prisoner came the next morning to me, and desired to have half a guinea; I did not let her have it, but told her I would come up the next day; I went the next day, and took two men with me; I told her, that as the family were coming to town, I brought them to put up the furniture; I called up Woolaster, who told me things were just as he suspected; I then took the prisoner into the parlour, and she owned she had pawned the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) part of them at Mr. Hall's, St. Martin's-lane, and the remaining part at Mr. Freer's in Walker-court.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises to induce her to confess? - None upon earth. I had no power to make her any; she said she was in debt, and in great distress, and pawned them to pay her debts.

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, This is the only time I have been charged with a crime of a criminal nature; I am innocent of the charge; the leather found in my possession is my own property, and has been in my possession almost four years; when I was in business as a tanner and currier, I manufactured a large quantity of that leather; I am sure no man could have dared to have sworn to that leather but Mr. Esdaile, it being a property numbers of people have as well as himself. It is customary when skins or hides are cut out, to throw the offal aside till somebody comes to purchase it without any mark thereon, and it is impossible to tell one piece from another. I could go further, that there was a man that purchased the same kind of leather of Sir James four years ago, with some of the army bands. I dare say, Mr. Esdaile, you sold some at that time?</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. I do not recollect.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Your clerk does not make bills when he sells leather; he frequently sells<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090006"/> leather without making bills, as he sells it for ready money . I am at a loss at present, as my evidence is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. Here is a piece of leather which is very remarkable. Some gentlemen in the city associated themselves in order to defend their king and country, and learned the military exercise; we made their belts; there was an alteration afterwards in the manner of wearing the belts, on which account a large piece was cut off; here is one of the pieces. The prisoner fully confessed the fact after he was taken into custody; and there is a great deal of this buff leather which is manufactured abroad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, my witnesses are not come, though the court indulged me with putting off my trial; I was fearful of being troublesome again; I expected them momently almost; there was a man would have proved my buying the leather.</p>

I heard of a place at Hampstead; but the man that drives the Hampstead coach, having somebody on the box, he could not take me up, but desired me to walk on before; I went as far as Pancras, there I met with the carrier, he asked me if I was going to Hampstead, I said yes; he asked me if I would ride, I told him I could not give him any more than a pint of beer; he said never mind that, if you can drive, for he was very drunk. I got up into the cart; going along I got down to ease myself; a gentleman came up and asked me the nearest way to Islington; I went back to show him the way, and met two men with bundles; they asked me to carry one of the bundles to Gray's-Inn-lane, which I did; then they wanted me to take it to Houndsditch; I told them I could not; they were to give me two shillings; they said they had no money, and one of them pulled the shirt out of his pocket and gave me, and asked if that would satisfy me.</p>

               <p>Which whetted the knife? - I do not know her name, that is her, (pointing to Reading) they call her Prologue; the other asked her if she should do it, she said, no, d - n you, I can do it better myself, and then went back and cut his pocket; I saw Reading cut his pocket and take something out, I do not know what; as I was walking past, I walked towards the Rose door, they followed me, and said, d - n him, we have done him; they said they had only four shillings in money, and asked me if I would have one of them.</p>
               <p>How came they to tell you? - I suppose because they perceived I saw them in the very act.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing about the watch? - No; they asked me to have one of the shillings; I said I would not have any; they begged me not to say any thing of it; I said I would; I went to call the coachman, and they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take them? - I did not know that I was to do that without an order from the justice; I waked the coachman immediately; he was some time shaking himself, or he might have caught them.</p>

I asked his address; he said, No. 6, Duke-street, Smithfield. I sent and enquired after him, and heard a good character of him. I took it on Thursday morning myself; he said it was to go to a common (I forget the name) two miles below Woolwich; he said he should return by seven or eight in the evening; I said then, I would send my man to bring it home; he bid me do so, and he would send me the money for the hire of the chaise. I sent my man at eight in the evening; he staid till ten, but the chaise did not come. I heard nothing of it till the Saturday following, and on Monday I saw my horse and chaise which I had let to the prisoner at the George in Drury-lane, in the possession of one Nelson. It was that which I let to the prisoner.</p>

I went to the public office in Bow-street, and gave information of it, and the horse and chaise was removed to the George in Drury-lane. I was at the George on the Monday, when Mr. Smith saw the horse and chaise; it was the same that had been offered to me. The prisoner was very drunk at all the different times that I saw him.</p>

I came home between four and five in the afternoon, and found the door wrenched open; there was no one in the house when I went out; the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were locked up in my trunk; they were all missing. I had met the prisoner some days before; she asked charity of me, and said she had lost her husband, and had been obliged to pawn her clothes. I gave her some victuals, and let her lie all night by my fire; she said she was going into the country. I told her in the morning I could not keep her any longer, and sent her away; she went away about ten o'clock. I saw her afterwards in London with my hat, cap, and apron on; when she saw me she ran away as fast as she could; I cried, stop thief! and she was secured; she then confessed she had pawned my things, but would not tell me where.</p>

They lay in the shop window; I had put them there not long before, but missed them between ten and eleven in the forenoon. While I was in my inner room, the two prisoners came in unpereceived, but I saw them through the glass door when they were in the shop . I saw Herbert put something into his bosom; upon that I came out of my inner room, but before I could get out of the room, Herbert got out of the shop, but I followed him as fast as I could, and desired my wife in the mean time, to detain James till I brought Herbert back. I soon overtook him, and brought him back into the shop, upon which he took the handkerchiefs out of his bosom and threw them near the place where he had taken them from, but I did not see James do any thing.</p>

After I had lost the things, I was told by a person, that she had seen one of the gowns in a pawnbroker's shop. I had a piece of all the gowns and of the cloak left; I took them to Sir

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in the Broadway, Westminster. The prisoner pledged this gown with me on the 15th of October, between seven and eight in the evening; she had a woman with her. The prisoner pledged the gown in the name of Walker. About a week after this, Mrs. Harris came and asked me if I had such a gown as this in pawn; I said I had; she asked whom I took it of, I said of the prisoner. She said she had been to Sir

            's, and she desired if the prisoner came again, that I would stop her; the prisoner came on the seventh of November, in company with another woman, and desired to have this gown put in the other woman's name, as she was going to sell it to her. That is not the same woman, I believe, that came with her when she pledged it. I immediately secured her, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got acquainted with a woman, who is a girl of the town, and walks the Strand; she would take me to a milliner's in Clare-Market, as I was distressed; she was going to have her cap put on to go out of nights; this woman, the prosecutrix, hired me to come there to go out for her, and I was dressed up in these things, and what money I got of a night I gave to her; she saw company at home herself; she stays at home of a night; I went out; she said the other things I should have to change me. She ill-used me one night when I got no money, and said I should not come there. I thought as I had given her all the money I got, I had a right to take these things away. I am but sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been in this way? - About six months. I was with her about a fortnight. The girl, who took me to her first, was one Miss Jones; who is now in Tothil-fields Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Prosecutrix. How came you to find out that the gown was at that particular pawnbroker's? - A girl of the town it was that told me. There are several girls I work for. I rent the place of this gentlewoman that is here.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the girl that gown ever upon her back? - No; it never had been upon any creature's back since I bought it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it a girl of the town told you it was at the pawnbroker's? - No; nobody told me that this was pawned, but only they saw her at a pawnbroker's pawning a gown.</p>
               <p>Jury. I understood you that you was informed that that gown was at a pawnbroker's, and therefore you went there? - That she was pawning a gown there; two silk gowns; the one was this, the other a light-coloured one.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you ever given the girl any thing to wear? - Never.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was she doing in your shop? - Trying on a cap. This gown would not come on her if it was to be tried; it is a very little size; this gown was bought of a clothes woman. I have a witness here who saw me pay for it a few days before.</p>
               <p>Court. That gown does not seem to be finished? - No, it is just as I bought it; if I had let it out the cuffs and apron would have gone with it, but they were left in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you get it from the pawnbroker? - Never, he has brought it with him now.</p>
               <p>But when was it you heard of it? - The 7th of November.</p>
               <p>To John Hill. Had you that constantly in your custody from the time she brought it to you? - Yes.</p>

It was the 29th of October; I wanted to go up stairs; he pushed me away twice, and the second time got hold of my throat, and wanted to gaggle me.</p>

               <p>Jury. Is your master Captain Robinson? - Yes. He promised to come here. He ordered me to wait till twelve at night, till the men were gone from the pay-table. I staid till twelve o'clock When I was going away at twelve o'clock, I found these sows and eleven pigs upon the dunghill in the brick-field; I went down, took a hurdle stake, and drove them up to Mary-la bone pound; the keeper of the pound was gone to bed; he said he would not take them in till the morrow-morning.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 12th of November I saw the money in the bureau at nine o'clock at night. I went to the bureau between twelve and one the same night, when I was just going to bed, and missed it all; there was nothing left in the drawer. The prisoner had been in our service nine months .</p>
               <p>Was he at home that night during that time? - Yes; in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Might he have gone into the place where the bureau was kept without your seeing him? - He might.</p>
               <p>What induced you to suspect him? - I did not suspect him till Sunday evening the 22d of September, when a new silver watch was found upon him.</p>
               <p>What wages did you give him? - He never received any from me. I laid it out in clothes for him as it became due.</p>
               <p>Jury. He had vales from the people that use the house I suppose? - Yes; now and then a six-pence, or a shilling. He ran away on the Monday morning. I sent a person after him as far as Reading, who brought him back.</p>
               <p>How did you trace him to Reading? - A person who came to town told us he saw him on the Reading coach box.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find out who he bought the watch of? - Yes; the watch-maker is here. When the prisoner was taken to Litchfield-street, he confessed he took the money.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - I did not.</p>

I took it up, and asked him how he came by it; he said he had it to save for George the wheelwright till the next morning; I said, if it was George the wheelwright's, I would give it to my mistress, and she should keep it and give it to George the wheelwright in the morning. He wanted to get it from me, and said, hush, hush, do not say any thing to my mistress, for I do not want her to know any thing about it. I took it, and gave it to my mistress.</p>

               <p>(The purse produced.)</p>

               <p>To Wilson. That purse you took on the prisoner the night of the 25th of November? - Yes; between eight and nine o'clock I took him from Lord Townshend's to the watch-house, and gave charge of him to the constable of the night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am choachman to General Paoli. On the 25th of November as I was driving out of Stanhope-street into Park-lane, about eight o'clock, I saw a man coming on horseback into the street as we were going out of it. He had a handkerchief tied round his neck, and the cape of his coat up; we went down the lane; he came after us; he over-took the carriage, and presented a pistol to me; he told me to stop; I did not stop then; he rode on, and came to meet me, and told me again to stop; I did stop; he went to the coach door. I jumped off the box, and halloo'd out. I did not see whether he robbed my master or no; as soon as I halloo'd out, I heard him gallop away.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say he stopped you, who do you mean? - A man; I do not know who; it was a dark night. I cannot swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Was it near any lamps? - I cannot say it was near any lamps; it was dark in the lane.</p>
               <p>Wilson. He had this wig (producing it) over his hair when I took him.</p>
               <p>[There being no evidence to bring the charge home to the prisoner, he was not put upon his defence.]</p>

He called after the coachman to stop; there was a gentleman whose name is Garth with me in the coach. I believe the prisoner called twice before the coachman did stop; when the coach stopped; the prisoner came to the side of the coach, presented a pistol, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>What did you give him? - I am uncertain as to the sum, but I gave him more than the indictment states. The other gentleman gave him his money first; when the prisoner had got the money, he wished us a good night, and rode off.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was he on? - I conceive it to be a kind of brown or bay; it was of the small size. He had his hat flapped down before, was dressed in a black coat, with a red waistcoat, and something round his neck. I suppose a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Had he his own hair? - I cannot speak to that; he had his hat on and flapped; I think he had his hair tied behind. I saw his face.</p>
               <p>How long might he stay with you? - I cannot tell; I suppose about three minutes.</p>
               <p>It was a dark night, as we heard from the witnesses on the other trial? - No; it was not a dark night; the moon shone bright, and the lamps were alight. I came from the Devizes; we had the benefit of the moon a great way.</p>
               <p>Upon the best and most serious recollection; do you take upon you to swear to the man? - I am certain to him, or I would not have come here. I came with great reluctance; I saw him at the Rotation-office, and knew him directly. I described him very particularly; he behaved exceedingly civil.</p>

               <p>Where did Barrett lodge? - I do not know; I took him in the street; I followed him out of Deer's lodging; I brought him back to the lodging, and searched him; I found the chain in his pocket. The bureau was in the lower apartment of the house. I was informed by

               <p>I live in James-street, Westminster. On the third of October, as I was going with another gentleman to Brentford, in my own coach, at about eight at night, we were stopped by two highwaymen, near <placeName id="t17781209-26-crimeloc164">Gunnersbury-lane</placeName>

               <p>The coach did stop immediately? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Had he any arms? - One had a pistol, which I saw very plain; the other, the man that stopped the coach, was on the opposie side.</p>
               <p>The one that came up and demanded your money had a pistol? - I did not observe his pistol; it is natural to suppose he had one; the one that came afterwards on my side had a pistol. The man who stopped the carriage demanded our money; I gave him my money, but he not having a sufficient booty, I gave him my watch; he turned to the moon, and seeing nothing but silver, he said, gentlemen, I beg to have more money, I had much rather return your watches; and he asked for our purses; this was the man that came up first; the other, who was behind, hearing him complain, asked him what he had got; he said, nothing but silver, upon which the other came up to the right-hand side of the coach, and said, upon my word, gentlemen, if you do not give more money I will shoot you. After that he threatened to shoot the coachman.</p>
               <p>Did you take sufficient notice of them to be able to swear to them? - No, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Neither to their persons nor to their horses? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - It might be about three minutes, I cannot pretend to say. My watch is in the hands of Dixon.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Seymour. About two o'clock last Saturday, while my master was at dinner, the prisoner and another girl came into the shop; I was behind the counter; she applied to me for a yard of black ribband; I showed her some; she fixed on the broadest of the two; at the same time I observed that she secreted two pieces under her cloak, which was a long red one. I let her go out of the shop; as soon as she had shut the door, I sent a little boy up to tell my master; I immediately followed the prisoner, and brought her back into the shop, and saw my master take the ribband out of her apron.</p>
               <p>(The ribband was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not see the ribband; he did not find it upon me. I met with a young woman; who asked me to go and buy a yard of ribband for her in Oxford-street.</p>

He was on horseback; he rode up to the coachman and desired him to stop, and I saw him present a pistol to him. As soon as the prisoner desired the coachman to stop, I got down from behind the carriage. The prisoner tapped at the coach-window. He saw I was down, and said to me, be you quiet, young man, or I will settle you; when he had said so to me, he tapped at the window again; I immediately seized his right hand which he had the pistol in.</p>
               <p>Was the window let down? - No; as soon as I had got hold of his hand, I called to the coachman; he got down and secured his other hand, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Did you pull him off his horse? - No, some other people came up.</p>
               <p>Court. You secured him before the window was let down? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I did not present any pistol, I had no pistol in my hand when I stopped the coachman, I had only my whip in my hand. I might bid them stop while I passed; the footman immediately seized my horse's bridle, and stopped me; I pulled my pistol out of my pocket; I told him to take care of himself. I did not demand their money; I had no such intention. I did not speak to the ladies.</p>

               <p>What time did you go to bed? - About nine o'clock. My mother was up last. Soon after twelve o'clock I heard a terrible noise. I lay in the first floor; my father, mother, and two sisters all lay upon the same floor. Soon after I heard the noise, I saw several fellows come up. My room door was open; they came to my door; three of them came in.</p>
               <p>Did they bring any lanthorn or light with them? - They had three or four candles lighted. One of the three men had a handkerchief over his forehead .</p>

               <p>What time was it when you saw him? - Almost one o'clock. He came into my room several times, but stopped only a little time.</p>
               <p>Were there any lights in your room? - Yes; all the time. There were two candles in the room, sometimes three.</p>
               <p>Were you in bed, or up, when he came in? - I was in bed all the while. After I saw the first man, I was getting up in my bed.</p>
               <p>Had he any disguise upon his face? - No; none at all. He had on a brownish coloured great coat, almost a copper colour, buttoned together round him. I saw him very plain two or three times.</p>
               <p>Do you swear from a recollection of his face? - Yes; his face and voice. He came into the room, and halloo'd several times, how are you now? how are you now?</p>

               <p>My Lord, there was a prosecution against, I think, four men for this burglary, who were all convicted . Three have been executed; Condon, one of the four persons convicted was, (I presume, upon well-grounded doubt stated to the crown) respited, and has since had his sentence changed to working on the Thames; therefore it is fit the Court should know, that there has been an enquiry upon this subject before, and that there have been three executed. The whole will turn upon this; what sort of credit is to be given to this kind of positive evidence as to identity .</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The question is, whether you did not swear to

            ? - I did not swear positively to Carleton.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, you had been a-bed an hour when this man broke into the house? - More than that.</p>
               <p>I suppose you must have been a good deal frightened? - Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>And these men continued in your house some time! - Near two hours.</p>

               <p>You had no light at all in your room? - No; only the lights they brought up stairs with them.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Hartley before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Nor you had never heard his voice before? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did they cover you up? - No. One of them struck me on the back, and bid me lie down. I laid down upon my side. One was going to throw the clothes over my face; the other said they should not, and I had only the sheet and blanket upon my face, and sometimes they were off. I was taken out of bed afterwards.</p>
               <p>I should suppose you thought your life in danger during this time? - To be sure I did. I did not see the first man only now and then; he came in two or three times, but did not stay above a minute or so in the room when he did come in.</p>
               <p>He never came close to the bed to you? - A yard and half or two yards from the bed.</p>
               <p>Where were the candles? - They had them in their hands. One man stood by me a little time.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - No. My back was to him.</p>
               <p>Did not he take care that your face should be covered? - He cried out now and then. you don't see do you? you don't see do you? He was at the drawers.</p>
               <p>What is there particular in this man's voice that you can swear to it? - He has a very remarkable gruff voice, and I know him by his face.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you saw this man since the robbery was committed? - I cannot recollect when the first day was, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090032"/> him at Sir

One of our carters, that lay in the next bed, jumped out immediately. The maid called to him, Will Carter; he ran to the door, and seeing them come up stairs; he said, Lord, have mercy upon us! there are a parcel of fellows broke into the house! He got under the bed, and his bed-fellow got under the bed after him. The men saw them, and pulled them out, and made them get into bed. One of them called them villains, and said, he would cut their bloody heads off. They all went down stairs, but they had covered us all up close; Hartley stood at the door to see if any body moved. When he was at the door there was no light in the room; when they took the light away, I thought I could get from under the bed, and get into bed; I was afraid, if they saw me there, they would kill me. The bed was so low that they heard me; Hartley cried out, you bloody thieves, d - n your eyes and limbs, and so on; upon which they all came tumbling up stairs again. Will Quick had thrown the clothes off him; they thought it was he that made the noise. One of them said, blow his brains out, cut his bloody head off. They covered him up again, and struck him on the head with, I believe, a pistol.</p>

               <p>And the only light in the room was a dark lanthorn some man held in his hand? - Yes.</p>

I was much frightened at that. I sent for a woman; I gave her 3 s. for the week, to be with him. On the Monday morning, the second of March, I went to an apothecary in Holborn; he came, and turned us both out of the room, at the time he used an instrument upon him, but what it was I cannot tell . Hartley was not out of his room for three days after he came home bad on Saturday. I sent for the woman on Sunday, which was the first of March. On Monday the second of March, I went to the gentleman, the doctor in Holborn; he used some instruments on him, and sent him some stuff, which I paid four shillings out of my pocket for. Hartley never was out of doors, not so much as out in the yard. He could not go down stairs, nor walk across the room.</p>
               <p>Where did you live at that time? - Number 20, Gray's-Inn-lane, up one-pair-of-stairs backwards.</p>

            , and lives at this time in Northamptonshire .</p>
               <p>What did he pay it for? - For a little place that I have down there, though it is not properly mine. The rent was paid to him; he paid it to me.</p>
               <p>Did you give him a receipt for it? - Yes, for the money; he wrote it, and I crossed it.</p>
               <p>There was nobody present to witness that receipt? - No foul . It was a Monday or Tuesday; there is one Willoway comes up that can prove it.</p>
               <p>How soon was Hartley able to go out of doors? - It was four or five days first I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Duncan knew he was ill? - Yes, at the time.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Duncan alive or dead? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have changed your lodging? - I have a house of my own since.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Little Maze-pond, (not Little Maze-court, Maze-pond, in the Borough) No. 3.</p>
               <p>You keep that house now yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you carry on any business there? - No; none at all.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether Duncan is dead or alive? - No; I know he is in Wales .</p>
               <p>Court. How long might the apothecary attend him? - The first day he came he turned us out of the room. When we came in there was the prisoner very bad; and then, on the next morning, up came the gentleman; he said he thought he should have found him dead. He lay in his bed very bad; he found him better; he asked him if he found that he was any ways injured by the instruments which he used upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the journeyman or apprentices of this apothecary ever attend? - Not that I know; but when I went for the stuff, I dare say the gentleman would say it now, that I always paid for them as I had them in, because I would have no bill.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you pay him? -</p>
               <p>The first time of coming I paid him half a crown for using the instruments upon him, and eighteen-pence for a small bottle of stuff; and afterwards one shilling and sixpence for every bottle of stuff sent in; four shillings the first time, and eighteen-pence for every bottle of stuff after.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mr. Duncan see him in this condition? - He was a man that was never at home. I can send for the woman that was in the next room; she saw him, and went out of the room because she thought he would die.

I dispatched some officers after them, while I went to see after the press; it was under the shop; they had brought it through into a vault. There I found a large press fixed, and a pair of dies in it, and by comparing the half-pence, afterwards found on one of the prisoners taken at the King's Bench, I found they were struck with those dies that were in the press. We found some half-pence lying by the side of the press; and we found another die with the impression of a farthing; the die in the press had a hole in the head; and there is a rising on the head of the halfpence corresponding with it.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was the press fixed? - In a piece of wood, two feet thick.</p>

No, he said, he was the father of children, and loved to look upon a child; we came away, Figges gave my bundle to Taylor to carry; when we came to St. Giles's I asked for my bag, they would not deliver it to me; Taylor said he would go with me to my friends, and tell them I had not money enough to pay my journey, and I might perhaps get some money from them; and Taylor told my friend that I had but ten shillings to pay my passage. I said I with you would be kind enough to hold your tongue, I don't want to encroach upon my friends for any thing, I will do as well as I can. After I had called upon my relation, Figges delivered the bundles back again to me; I had asked for them before, and he had refused to deliver them to me; and we were going to the waggon; just as I got into Monmouth street, Taylor knocked me down, and dragged the bags from under my arm, and said to Figges, halloo Tom! here, take this.</p>
               <p>What hour was it? - It was between six and seven o'clock, it rained very fast; there was not a person standing any where; I lay some minutes before I could recover myself, and my child was screaming; the parcel contained the things mentioned in the indictment. (repeating them). I did not think the prisoners were bad people when I went with them .</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What time in the night was it when you first came to the Swan Inn? - Between four and five, because the waggon is appointed to go out at five.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking before you got there? - Not a drop, but a farthing's worth of small beer at dinner.</p>
               <p>What did you drink after dinner? - A pint of beer, when Taylor came and told me he was clerk to the waggon.</p>
               <p>They all drank at the Swan Inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you drink after? - Only a draught out of a pot of beer at my friend's where I called for the letter.</p>
               <p>Had you no gin? - No; when they called for gin and water in Holborn, they asked me to drink, but I would not.</p>
               <p>I thought you said, that after you was knocked down, or fell down, that you did not think they were bad people? - I thought they had ran on before me.</p>
               <p>Whether any bargain was made between you and Taylor to spend the evening together? - No, none in the world; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any conversation where the bundle was to be left for you that night, at a public house in Holborn? - No; I don't know where it was to be left, but Taylor told him to carry that away?</p>
               <p>Can you remember whether there was any such conversation? - I know no further conversation than I told you.</p>
               <p>What was the crime that you charged them with before the justice? - With knocking me down, and robbing me in the street.</p>
               <p>What did you say the first time you was before the justice? - I was called into the room, and asked if any of these men were concerned in it; by-and-by these men were brought in. I was called again, and asked if I knew any thing of these men; I said yes; there is Taylor that knocked me down and robbed me; and there is Figges, which is the man he gave my parcel to.</p>
               <p>After you had told the justice that they knocked you down and robbed you, did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090044"/> say that you thought them bad men? - I thought at first within myself, may be they were only gone in a hurry with the parcel to the waggon.</p>
               <p>Don't you recollect that there was an agreement that this bundle should be left at the Cock and Hoop ale house for you the next morning? - No; Figges next morning said the bundle was at the end of Gray's-Inn Lane, Holborn; he went with one of the men; the bag was produced; I said that is my bag, but it was tied with a red garter; yes, said Figges, so it was.</p>
               <p>Was you knocked down with any degree of violence? - I lay some minutes before I could speak a word.</p>
               <p>If they knocked you down with any degree of violence, how could you think that they meant this harmlesly, and were only gone before to meet the waggon? - It was because I was foolish.</p>

               <p>On Monday morning, the 16th of November, the waggoner at the Swan Inn, Holborn-Bridge, came to Sir John Fielding's Office, and asked me if I knew one Taylor; I said I knew his name, but did not know his person; he said that Taylor and another person, shorter than himself, had taken a woman from the Inn, knocked her down, and ran away with her bundle; he said a person informed him at the Inn, that he was to meet the driver of the Andover waggon in Piccadilly; I went to Piccadilly, and there I took the two prisoners; it was about ten o'clock on Monday morning. I searched them, and found a little flat iron, and this tin box. (producing it) I found it in Taylor's pocket; and there was an indenture which I took out of Figges's pocket. The landlady of the house said a bundle had been just left; I took the bundle to the

I said, is this your bundle? she said no; it passed for tea, but upon opening it, it was found to be 8 half-pounds of sawdust. I asked Figges where the bundle was; he ingenuously told me that he had left it at the Cock, near Holborn Bars; he said it was not himself that had done it, but that it was Taylor had; I sent Carpmeal for it.</p>

            's. I found a flat iron in Taylor's pocket, which the prosecutrix said was her's; she picked the prisoners out from a dozen, I believe. Figges then said, if I would go along with him, he would tell me where the bundle was. Another man and I went with him to the Cock, a publick house in Gray's-Inn Lane, there we found the bundle.</p>
               <p>(The different articles that had been found were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>TAYLOR's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went down to the Swan, at Holborn Bridge, to know when my brot her-in-law would come up by the waggon. I had a pint of beer there; this woman knew me. She said Taylor are you here? I said yes. She said she had just booked herself to go down to Bristol; that she was sorry for it; but, says she, now you are come I will not go down before Wednesday; she said she had had one parcel booked. I borrowed three half-pence for her of Figges; she went down to the bookkeeper, and said she could not go till Wednesday, and she had her name scratched out again; the waggoner gave her half a guinea. The waggoner laughed and said, I know what you want. She took the bundle out, and away we came to the Cock and Hoop, the corner of Gray's-Inn Lane; there we had a glass of gin a piece at the door; she said she was going to carry a letter to Bristol, and would get a bottle of gin, for she had a bottle in her pocket. I said I must stop at the Coach and Horses, for I had some money to receive; there we had six-penny worth of gin and water; I asked the landlady to give me change for a guinea; she said she could not; but the prosecutrix said she would lend me half a guinea, for it made no odds between she and I. She lent me half a guinea directly; she said she should be too late, she was afraid, for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090045"/> waggon; I said you are time enough; she did cannot you tell my friends I have got no money to pay for my carriage; and then I shall get some more; and I don't mind spending it all, if you and I shall lie together. She went and bought some gin, and then brought the flat iron and things, and asked me to put the flat iron and things into my pocket; we drank that pint bottle of gin out between us, and I had to do with her, that is the truth; then she began talking to the mob in that sort of way. I told her that she knew where to find her bundle, that it was left at the Cock and Hoop. I knew the prosecutrix down at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>FIGGES' DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>She and this man agreed to go to bed together that night; and they gave me the bundle to take care of, till next morning; I took the bundle home, and laid it under my head all night; when I got up in the morning, I was going down to the Cock and Hoop; I overtook Taylor; I asked him what had become of the woman; he said she was so drunk over night, he could not keep her company any longer; that they had spent most part of the money. I left the bundle in the morning with a lad, and told him to let a woman with a child have it; I was going to work at Kensington, for Mr. West; there I lit of them; I told them directly as they asked me, where the bundle was left; they went and enquired there, and they had it directly. I am a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Did you know Taylor before? - If I was to die this minute, I never set my eyes on him. I drank no gin, nor never was to bed nor board with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Figges before? - I never saw one of them to my knowledge, all my days before; I never had the least acquaintance with them; I had never seen them before.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you an Irish woman? - Yes .</p>
               <p>Court. Was you in a private room with Taylor? - No. Before I saw him, I went to the book-keeper with a piece of new linen cloth; I said I had but half a guinea, I shall be short of money, take this linen, my passage will be paid when I come down. I said so to the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Figges. Taylor called upon me on Sunday afternoon to go down to the inn with him.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I went to the inn to enquire whether my brother was come up by the Taunton waggon; I lay with her in the gateway, after we had drank the bottle of gin out.</p>

               <p>Do you remember this woman coming to take a place on the 15th of November? - I remember it very well.</p>


               <p>What did she pay for it? - She paid nothing at all; she was to pay her passage at Bristol, for herself and child.</p>
               <p>She did not pay a half guinea then? - She paid nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she seem in liquor? - I did not perceive that she was at all.</p>

               <p>Does this Taylor belong to your waggon at all? - I never saw him before that night. After I had entered the piece of linen in the book, she went up to the tap-house, to wait till the waggon was ready to go; and she came down again with Taylor, and said she had met her brother-in-law, with a letter from her husband, that required her staying in town a little longer, and she could not go till Wednesday night; she asked me to let her have the linen that I had charge of, out of the waggon; I told her I could not do that, but as she was going on Wednesday, it would make no difference. Taylor said he would be d - d if he did not have it, for if she paid me two-pence for booking it, he would compel me to let her have it. I said it was a thing we never did, after having taken charge of goods, to deliver them back again; as she was going to Bristol a few days after, it would make no difference, and I had given her a note for the delivery of the parcel at Bristol. Taylor said d - n the note, throw it down, and we will make him deliver it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they seem acquainted with one another? - I cannot say they seemed much acquainted; but she referred to Taylor, and said you see my brother-in-law give me a letter; and after she had been robbed she said that that story was what he had told her to say, as they were going to the waggon from the tap-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she come back to your inn that night? - I did not see her any more that night; she came back to the house, but I did not see her till the next morning. She lay at the inn.</p>
               <p>Did she, next morning, tell this story as she has told it now? - Yes. She said that her things were lost. I said that served you right; why did you hearken to that man. Said she, he told me that he had the management of the waggon at Piccadilly, and I should go for six shillings, and save nine-shillings; and she said he bid her tell me that she had received a letter from her husband.</p>
               <p>Court . Did she tell you the same story that she was knocked down, and had her bundle taken from her that night? - She did, when I saw her, which was the next morning.</p>

The two prisoners came to my shop, and desired to look at some muslins; while I was wrapping a piece up for them, Taylor took a piece off the counter, and held it up before my eyes, which gave me a suspicion that they meant to steal something. I then saw her take another piece off the counter, and tuck it under her stays; she had agreed for a remnant; the woman said she had but a shilling, and desired me to put it by for her. I agreed to that, and they were going away; Fubbs was out of the shop, Taylor was not quite out; I laid hold of Taylor, and said she had my property about her. I took up her apron, and saw the muslin under her stays; I immediately sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>I went with Fubbs to the prosecutor's to buy a piece of muslin; we looked at several pieces; I thought them too coarse; at last he showed us a remnant. I desired her not to bargain for it, as knowing she had not money enough; she would not take my advice, but seemed determined to have it; upon which I turned from her in a huff; there was a piece of muslin on the counter; my elbow was on it; whether he was angry with me for persuading her not to have it, or what, I am not accountable for that, but he laid hold of me, and said I had taken some muslin. I never meddled with it, it was not under my stays.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Clark to Bunhill-row, to a room up two-pair-of-stairs forward; I found the door locked; we broke it open; Ball the landlord was with us, and I found under the chest of drawers a great quantity of halfpence, and amongst the litter there was a little leaden pot like a snuff pot, and in that a parcel of puncheons and halfpence. Under the drawers I found some shillings, and some half crowns upon the tester of the bed.</p>
               <p>Clark. There were some bad guineas found in this pot; the puncheons are completely finished. It might be necessary to have a tail made, but that would be more trouble and expence; and therefore only the head side is represented, and not the tail. I do not take upon myself to say, that the impression upon these shillings was made from the puncheons found, but it has all the appearance of it.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of October. I found no counterfeit money upon him, but there was found a piece of paper, which imported to be a notice from him of his intention to surrender; it was dated the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. PINGO sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an engraver of the Mint; the prisoner is not employed by the Mint; the puncheon makes the die, and the counter puncheon is the die when it is made; the machines produced are puncheons, but not puncheons made at the Mint. The method by which these are made is, that they first take a true shilling, and cut it away to the out-line of the head; when they have done that, they take a piece of steel, on which they fix this outline, and then they file or cut the steel close away to that outline till the steel is exactly the shape of the head, and that is what is called a puncheon; these particular puncheons are all ready for use, for they are hardened, and they never are hardened till they are ready for use, that is the last operation they go through. It is impossible to say positively whether the shillings found in the prisoner's lodgings were made from these puncheons, because they are so imperfect, but they have all the appearance of it. In a new die or counter puncheon, the letters are always engraved in the counter puncheon after it is struck; there is no occasion to have any letters on old coin, it will pass without. The letters are put on afterwards, and a puncheon is complete without any letters at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090052"/> all; a puncheon may have letters made upon it, but they never use such puncheons at the Mint from the inconvenience of them, because they would be so liable to break, and would require so much nicety to represent all the little angles and corners of the letters, that is the reason that we engrave the letters afterwards upon the counter puncheon; but for making base shillings nothing else is necessary but this puncheon; these puncheons which are produced, barely as you see them, though they might be for the making base shillings, yet they may be made use of for other purposes; namely, for making seals, buttons, medals, or other things, were such impressions are wanted.</p>

The prisoner had the key of the center room the morning that his lodgings were searched; he had it by my desiring him to lock it up when he went out, because I had washed, and there was linen in the room.</p>

             came to me in the middle of last May, and asked me if I worked for any of the silversmiths in that neighbourhood; I said I did for a good many; he said will you do a favour for me; I asked what, he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a little dirty bag; he said he had picked up a parcel of bad shillings, sixpences, and counterfeit guineas, and if I would show them to some of my acquaintances he should be glad to have them valued for him; he opened the bag, and there were to the value of thirty or forty shillings. There were some sixpences, two half-crowns, several halfpence clapped together as if they had been run together; and there were thirteen counterfeit guineas, or thereabouts, and a leaden thing punched in at the top, with some iron images at the bottom; and at the bottom of these things there was some very clean cotton. I had three or four images in my hand. Mr. Fisher was in my room at the time, and after the man was gone he looked at them every one.</p>
               <p>Were they such images as these (showing the witnesses the puncheons)? Yes, if I had picked them up I should have thrown them away, I believe, for I never saw such things before. Mr. Ridgley came the next morning to my house; I said, Lord drown it, you can get these things valued for me; he looked at them, and said, to oblige me he would get them valued. I said, bring them soon because the man may want them again. He took them away, and I never saw him any more till he was in prison.</p>
               <p>Then you positively swear the bag now produced was delivered by you to the prisoner? - If I see the bag and the leaden thing at the bottom, I should know it again. The images and puncheons were in that bag. I never saw such things before.</p>

               <p>What are you? - A shoemaker. I have lived in Mugwell-street, opposite Barbers-hall, these twenty-eight years. I never had any acquaintance with Holt, but only just passing by the street, and that as a neighbour. I was never in an alehouse with him in my life. I used to do a little work for him sometimes.</p>
               <p>Were the guineas such as these? (showing the witness the guineas which were found at the prisoner's lodging) - Yes.</p>
               <p>The next morning you gave them to Ridgley? - Yes; I knew him an apprentice; he served his time to a book-binder just facing me. He has worked up to this hour as a <rs id="t17781209-43-deflabel264" type="occupation">book-binder</rs>

               <p>Then you can tell me some master he has worked with lately. - I cannot tell that, because I never kept company with him. He had presses up in his own shop .</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090053"/>Was Ridgley an acquaintance of Holt's? - I do not know that he ever spoke to him.</p>
               <p>How came you to let Ridgley have them? - Because he served his time facing me, among a great many working silversmiths.</p>
               <p>You never called again for these things? - I sent one Fisher.</p>
               <p>How long has this man been dead? - Six weeks, or a little better.</p>
               <p>Where was he buried? - At London-wall church, almost facing Sion-college.</p>
               <p>How long had you had these things before he died? - It was the middle of May that I had them.</p>
               <p>Holt left his property a good while in the hands of a stranger, without calling for it? - He called two or three times before he was taken ill.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether Ridgley carried these things about to any silversmiths? - I do not know; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>And never sent after him but once? - Once by my wife, and once by Mr. Fisher. Ridgley kept a house in Aldersgate-street, next door to the Star. His wife lives there now. Fisher is at the door.</p>

            , Esq.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; I have known him from a lad about twelve or thirteen years of age.</p>
               <p>How old may he be now? - I take him to be about forty-one or forty-two.</p>
               <p>Do you know his hand writing? - I will not take upon me to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with him relative to this affair? - He has openly confessed the matter to me. I went to him in the house of correction, by order of Mr. Galliard, to postpone his being brought down for a second examination. I went on Monday the 30th of November; he was to be brought down on Tuesday the first of December, to Mr. Galliard's house at Edmonton .</p>
               <p>Why was you to postpone his being brought down? - Because it did not suit Mr. Galliard nor Mrs. Teshmaker to come down that day. On Monday the 30th I went to Mr. Hall, to desire him to detain the prisoner till Wednesday. I saw the prisoner in the house of correction.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promises? - No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090055"/> The moment he was let out of the gaol gate into the open yard, he came to me and this gentleman, Mr. Day, and immediately confessed it.</p>
               <p>Had you the letter with you at that time? - I believe I had it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you show him the letter? - No.</p>
               <p>What were the words you made use of? - He hung round us and begged we would recommend him to Mrs. Teshmaker; that he had been informed she was a very good lady. He hung round Mr. Day, and said that he had wrote the letter.</p>
               <p>What letter? - The letter to Mrs. Teshmaker.</p>
               <p>What letter? - The letter threatening her life.</p>
               <p>What words did he make use of? - I do not recollect the words particularly.</p>
               <p>You must recollect as near as you can. - He said that he never meant to put his threats in execution.</p>
               <p>What were the words as near as you can recollect that he made use of? - I cannot be particular .</p>
               <p>He hung round you both, and begged for mercy? - No; he did not hang round me, he went and hung round Mr. Day, and said that he did send a letter to Mrs. Teshmaker, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did you show him the letter? - Not then.</p>
               <p>Did you at any other time? - Yes; he saw the letter before Mr. Galliard.</p>
               <p>Did he first accost you, or you him? - I never spoke to him till he ran to us and begged for mercy, that we would intercede for him. He said that it was the first matter that he had been concerned in, and had not done it but poverty and the devil put him upon so doing . I believe I did so far say to him, that poverty need not have occasioned him to do it, because he had a workhouse to come to whenever he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Was that all that passed? - With me.</p>
               <p>I am surprised you did not show him the letter, as you had it in your pocket? - I did not go with that intent, I only went to desire Mr. Hall to detain him till the Wednesday following.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday, the 30th of November, Mr. Draper called at my house. I went with him to the house of correction at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe he was committed thither for writing a letter to Mrs. Teshmaker? - I understood so.</p>
               <p>Did you begin to speak first to him, or he to you? - He was speaking with Mr. Draper. I was in an obscure part of the yard; he turned his head and saw me; he flew to me, and took me in his arms, hugged me round, and said, pray, Sir, God bless you, Sir, be my friend, and get me out of this dismal place, you was always my friend. I said, what do you do here, Bonner? He said, O God knows! God bless you, Sir, get me out of it; you will if you are my friend get me out of it. I said, what are you here for? What have you done that you are here? Why, Sir, says he, and whispered softly to me; I am here for writing a letter to Mrs. Teshmaker; I then said to Mr. Draper do not let us stand in the yard, but let us go into the house. We went into the house. I said to him, Bonner, how could you be such a confounded fool and a rogue to attempt to do such a thing as you have done? O, said he, Sir, it was the Devil, the Devil, the Devil, and this leg, putting his hand and lifting up his leg, that induced me to do it; he had a sore leg; I said, did you absolutely write this letter?</p>
               <p>Court. Did all this pass before Mr. Draper? - He was talking with one of the clerks that stood at the desks. I said, did you absolutely write this letter. He said, I did, and it is the first fact I ever was guilty of in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you speak of this letter as a threatening letter, or in any particular terms? - I asked him about this letter.</p>
               <p>Court. You asked him about this letter, he was under commitment at this time, was he not, for writing this letter? - Yes; he was in prison, in custody for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you one of the parish officers? - No; I am not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know his hand writing, if you look at the letter? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090056"/>There were no promises of any kind made him, were there? - No; not one. The people at the work-house got him to write something, and there is a similitude between the two hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Similitude of hands has never been allowed to be given in evidence in criminal cases since

               <p>Mr. Day. He worked for me five years, or near upon it, as a day labouring man. I did look upon him for four out of the five years to be a good honest sort of a man.</p>
               <p>Court. He is in his senses, is he not? - I never knew any otherwise; he is rather hard of hearing.</p>
               <p>Jury. What does he do? - He is in the country way; he is a day labouring man. I have a great many houses; he was out of employment. I took him out of the country where he used to do business. I said, if you will go to London I will employ you; I will give you ten shillings a week, hail, rain, blow, or snow, long days, or short ones; I will employ you constantly. He agreed to come to London, and worked for me four or five years.</p>

               <p>I was nursing at Captain Crockat's . Mrs. Crockat lay-in.</p>
               <p>Was you there on the 14th of October? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - I never saw her till I saw her in the house. She was <rs id="t17781209-45-deflabel275" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I saw her standing by the side of the dresser; I saw a great quantity of blood; I asked her what was the matter with her? She gave me no answer for a good while, at last she said something had come from her. I immediately asked her where it was, and what she had done with it?</p>
               <p>You supposed it to be a child? - I really cannot say just then, whether I thought so or no.</p>
               <p>Upon your asking her what she had done with it, what did she say? - She made no answer; not in the least.</p>
               <p>Did you press her further? - No. I lit the candle, and looked about, and I tracked the blood to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Describe the situation of the necessary to this kitchen? - I went out of the kitchen across the wash-house; then up two or three steps into the yard.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the yard is the necessary? - About a couple of yards from the steps. I looked down, and there I saw an infant.</p>
               <p>How deep might the necessary be? - I cannot justly say. It was very deep, as deep as a common sewer. I sent directly for Mr. Midford; he came. I told him our maid, I believed, was delivered of an infant, and that it was down the necessary. I went directly up stairs as I thought my mistress might want me, and left Mr. Midford below.</p>
               <p>Before the doctor came, had you any further conversation with the prisoner after you returned from the necessary? - Yes. I returned into the kitchen again to her, and asked her what she had been doing? She made no answer.</p>
               <p>Did nothing else pass between you before Mr. Midford came? - I do not recollect that there did.</p>
               <p>How long had you seen this maid in the house before this happened? - She had been in the house about two months before this happened. I had been in the house three weeks, and one day.</p>
               <p>Had you had any suspicion of her being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090057"/> with child? - Yes. I challenged her on the Wednesday before. It was on the Saturday following that she was delivered.</p>
               <p>What did she say to it? - She did not say any thing at all. She had very little to say for herself.</p>
               <p>Had you any more conversation with her, at any other time? - No.</p>
               <p>She had of course, I suppose, the appearance to you of being with child by your challenging her? - I thought she had some little appearance. It was very trifling to my sight.</p>
               <p>You are a nurse; how far gone did you suppose her to be from her appearance? - I supposed her to be four or five months. I did not think that she was further gone.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the child since? - I did not see the child till the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>By the appearance of it then, what age was it? - I cannot justly say. I took very little notice of it. I was so frightened, that I could not bear to look at it, it was so shocking.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - There was violence upon the neck of it; it seemed as if the head was off.</p>
               <p>The head was not severed from the body, was it? - There was a bit of skin held it.</p>
               <p>Were there any other wounds upon the child? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you saw the prisoner in the kitchen, did you observe any instrument of any kind? - There was a knife lay upon the dresser, but whether that had been made any use of I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When you tracked the blood from the kitchen to the necessary, was there any thing that could lead you to distinguish whether the blood began in the kitchen, and went from thence to the necessary, or began in the necessary, and went to the kitchen? - I cannot say that there was.</p>
               <p>Had you any further conversation with her upon the subject? - None.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>It was about seven or eight when you first came down into the kitchen? - Yes. Seven or eight at night.</p>

             at any time, while you was in Captain Crockat's service, complain? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time see her making child-bed linen in the kitchen? - I cannot say. I was very little in it. She was at work at times, but I did not take notice of what she was about. She might for what I can say. She had the kitchen mostly to herself.</p>
               <p>In what posture was the child when you discovered it in the necessary? - It seemed as if it laid upon its back,</p>
               <p>You said the necessary was very deep; did you examine it so closely as to know whether it might not be possible for the child to be wounded in dropping down? - I do not know but it might.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon I believe? - I am.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Burr-street .</p>
               <p>Do you remember being sent for to Captain Crockat's, on the 14th of October? - I believe it was on Saturday the 10th at eight in the evening, I think I made a memorandum to that effect.</p>
               <p>To Osborn . You was not sure of the day was you? - It was the 10th.</p>
               <p>Who came for you, Mr. Midford?</p>
               <p>Mr. Midford. A servant maid in the neighbourhood, I do not know whose servant it was. I went immediately. I was desired to go into the kitchen. I saw the prisoner sitting in a chair near the dresser; I asked her what was the matter; she told me that she had had for several days a complaint in her bowels, and a purging, and that the child had come away at the necessary. I asked her how long before; she said just before. I asked her if she had hurt it; she said she had not. Thinking it probable, as so little time had been lost, that the child might be alive, I went from her immediately to the necessary; with the assistance of a candle, I saw it upon the filth, in a huddled-up posture; I got assistance and had it taken up with the loss of a very little time.</p>
               <p>How soon after you got there might you get the child out? - I suppose about twenty minutes. When it was taken up I found the head nearly separated from the body. I then went back to the kitchen, and recommended that the prisoner should be taken to the work-house.</p>
               <p>Was the child at its full growth? - It appeared to be so.</p>
               <p>It had its hair and its nails had it? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090058"/> Yes . I went to her a short time after at the workhouse. and brought away the after-burthen .</p>
               <p>Was the after-burthen of that kind as where the child is come to its full size? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any other wound upon the child? - I was in doubt whether it was all one wound or not; there were several of the ribs cut through, but I am in doubt whether the stroke, or whatever was the cause, might have been begun upon the ribs and ended with taking off the head.</p>
               <p>Give a description of the wound particularly; and how you suppose it had been made; whether it was severed by an instrument or torn off? - It appeared to me to be done by a cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Did the wound upon the ribs appear to be given by a cutting instrument? - It did.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible that these wounds could have happened by the falling of the child down into the necessary, by striking against the edge of bricks which sometimes project? - I suppose that very improbable, I cannot take upon me to say positively.</p>
               <p>Might it be possible to have happened from the sharp edge of the hole of the little-house? - I did not see any thing that could countenance such an opinion.</p>
               <p>Was there any blood upon the hole of the necessary? - I did not look particularly; I do not remember that I saw any.</p>
               <p>Did you observe blood in the little house? - I do not remember that I did; I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Were there any traces of blood from the kitchen to the little-house? - I did not examine that; my attention was taken up at first by thinking it possible that there might be life in the child, and that it might be preserved.</p>
               <p>Did you see any effusion of blood upon the ordure? - I did not perceive any.</p>
               <p>What must have been the effusion of blood from such a child as that if its head had been cut off alive? - There must be a considerable quantity.</p>
               <p>Was that examined into? - No; that circumstance was not looked into.</p>
               <p>When a child is first born, is its neck come to such a state of firmness, as that it would require a considerable degree of force to cut it through? - Not a very great deal. I should imagine it would require some little degree of force.</p>
               <p>Have you ever known a child's head torn in that manner, where a woman has been delivered by herself? - I never have.</p>
               <p>Could it be done by pulling the child's head out of the womb? - I will not say it could not be done so; I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Did you attend Mrs. Crockat as a midwife? - No.</p>
               <p>If the head had been torn off or pulled off in the act of delivery, would the separation from the body have had the same appearance, or would it have been more ragged and jagged? - I should suppose if the head was torn off, which might be done with force no doubt, that it would have had a ragged appearance. I should think it would not have the appearance of having been cut off with a sharp instrument. The force with which it would be torn off must make the edge of the wound ragged .</p>
               <p>Did you make particular observation whether it was ragged or not? - No.</p>
               <p>Because before you said it appeared as if it was cut off with a sharp instrument. - Some parts of it appeared so; I only speak to how it struck me as far as I could judge; but I looked at it but very superficially, for as soon as I found the head off, I returned into the kitchen, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Did you make any other remark upon it? - I did not .</p>
               <p>Had you any further conversation with the woman? - I desired that the mistress of the work-house would take care of her.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner tell you where she was delivered? - I believe a day or two after I asked her, and she told me she was delivered in the kitchen, as she stood by the fire-side; to the best of my remembrance she told me so.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. Was Mrs. Crockat lying-in at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was her room from the kitchen? - Two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Was it at such a distance that you could have heard any body cry out in the kitchen? - The children were making a great noise at the same time; there were three children at play in my mistress's room, and they made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090059"/> a great noise, that I could not have heard any noise that happened, unless it had been a violent great noise indeed.</p>
               <p>How long had Mrs. Crockat been brought to bed? - Three weeks and one day.</p>
               <p>Does the kitchen window look towards the street, or backwards? - Towards the street.</p>
               <p>Is it a publick street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the kitchen window even with the street, or under ground? - Under ground.</p>
               <p>If a child had cried, might the noise have been heard in the street? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How many windows is there to the kitchen? - Two.</p>
               <p>When you went down into the kitchen, did you observe whether the windows of the kitchen were shut? - I don't know whether they were shut or open.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Midford. Do you recollect how the windows were? - I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. Are there shutters to the kitchen? - Yes; but I don't recollect whether they were shut or open.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Midford. Did you dissect the body? - The Coroner ordered the usual experiment to be made upon the lungs.</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing. We never suffer that to be given in evidence.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. You came down directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been used to lying-in women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw a great deal of blood in the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it like the blood flowing from a labour, or fresh blood, flowing from a wound? - I was so frightened I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination of Mr. Midford.</p>
               <p>I think you said it was possible for the mother to have wounded the child in the act olabour? - It is possible for a person to do so.</p>
               <p>When you had the candle in your hand, and was at the necessary, did you look carefully round the necessary? - No.</p>
               <p>You don't know then whether there might be any glass bottles, or nails, or any thing of that sort? - I don't.</p>
               <p>I think you said you did not so closely observe the wound as to know whether it was done by tearing the head off, or cutting it? - I said before, it appeared to me to be done by a cutting instrument, but I did not examine it so particularly as to be able to say that it might not be done any other way.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether the edge of the hole of the little-house, was sharp or no? - I did not take notice of that.</p>
               <p>How old was the young woman? - twenty four.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you, my Lord, I had a sad looseness; I did not think it had been my labour; I had fell down stairs some days before, and had a bearing down; I had no appearance of labour; the head might be severed upon my helping myself. I called out for assistance, but nobody heard me.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Midford. Did you see any thing of a knife? - Not till I saw it on the table before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>What sort of knife was it? - It appeared to be a kind of carving knife; a common kitchen knife.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. Did you say that you observed the knife, and that there was no blood upon it? - Not to my knowledge; I did not look at it.</p>
               <p>You must have been at this necessary house. Are the edges of the holes sharp or not? - I never looked down.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>In what manner did she behave to that child? - As a very tender mother.</p>
               <p>Is the first child alive? - No, it died when it was between eight and nine months old; she behaved like a tender, affectionate mother.</p>
               <p>Had she had any opportunity of mentioning to you her late pregnancy? - I cannot say she had.</p>
               <p>Do you know of her having provided any child-bed linen? - I have it here. I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090060"/> it among her clothes; she has sufficient to wrap a new born infant in at first.</p>

               <p>I have known her from a child; she lived with me twelve years. She was fatherless and motherless. She behaved very honest and just; she has borne an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Did you know her other child? - Yes; she behaved very well to it. She put it out to nurse; she lived with me at the same time. The man had been very vile and wicked to her.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of her late pregnancy? - No. I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Do you think from the opinion that you had of her; that she would be guilty of the murther of her own child? - No; she was too good natured for that always; for she was always very fond of children; she was ready to eat them up.</p>

There is the name of the four churchwardens, the date of the year, and the parish of Elsemere upon it. The prisoner gave evidence against Davis, and produced the property that was in his possession.</p>

On Monday morning he acquainted me with it. I carried the plate to Mr. Legrix, and told him the circumstances; he asked me what I would advise him to do, and said the man who brought it was to return on Thursday morning with some more. I advised him to wait till Thursday morning, and, when the man came, to take him into custody. I went on Thursday; the man did not come; Mr. Legrix seemed very uneasy. I advised him to go before Sir

I went directly with the boy to the coach-master, who, he said, lived in Portpool-lane. After knocking some time at the door, he looked out of the one pair of stairs window. I told him my business. He said he could do nothing in it, I must come to-morrow, perhaps the man would be come home. After some trouble, and receiving some abuse, I was obliged to apply to Sir

I got some of Sir John's men to go with me, about one o'clock in the morning, and on my return we found the coach standing in the yard; the coachmaster continued obstinately to deny knowing the coachman's name, or place of residence, nor would he give us any assistance to find out the prisoner; there was another coachman in the yard, and partly by threatening, and partly by soothing him, we got him to go with us to the prisoner's house, in Cold-Bath-Fields; we got admittance, and found my trunks in his lodgings, with the locks wrenched off, and the things contained in them were lying about on the chairs and tables in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you find all your things again? - I believe I did. I informed the people when I went into the room, that there was a bank note in a book in the trunk. The prisoner's wife said she had seen no note. I went to the trunk, and found the book and the note in it.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday morning, about half an hour after twelve, I went with the prosecutor to the coach-master's, the coach was in the yard. I begged of the master to get up and assist us to take the prisoner; he would not; he said he did not know him, nor his name, and behaved very abusive; there was another coachman in the yard; I asked him if he knew him; he said yes. I asked him if he knew where he lived; he said if he did he would not tell us, or to that purpose. I told him then I would take him into custody, and he should go to the round house till he would tell; he being frightened, went with us to the prisoner's lodgings; we found the prisoner in bed; he pretended to be asleep, or dead drunk, or something. I believe he was not drunk. The trunks were both in his lodging, broke open, and all the things lying about the room.</p>

I called the coach, and drove down to the court myself, and bid him follow me; we went up stairs for the trunks, he brought one down, and I put the other in. I saw them both in the coach; then I went to tell Mr. M'Sween .</p>
               <p>When the coach was gone, you told Mr. M'Sween the number, and where the master lived? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Compton, a sugar-baker, in Brewers-lane; there were six of us in company; going home to Mr. Compton's, the deceased, Schultz, was running before me; we were all upon the foot pavement. I saw a woman with a lantern in her hand, crossing the way, and a girl about eight years old with her. Hardwicke lifted up her petticoats behind with his hand.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. My Lord, we shall prove that woman and child, are the wife and daughter of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Hageman. After the woman had crossed over, she walked an hundred yards, and then the prisoner overtook us. She pointed to Hardwick, and said this is the young man that laid hold of my gown. The prisoner crossed over to Hardwicke, and asked him what business he had to meddle with the woman's gown. Hardwicke made no answer. Kello came up and said to this Lieutenant, Sir, I am your prisoner; I will go with you where you like. I went home, and saw nothing more of the matter.</p>
               <p>When he challenged Hardwicke for meddling with the woman's gown, did Hardwicke make no answer? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hardwicke do any thing to the Lieutenant? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the Lieutenant do any thing to Hardwicke? - The Lieutenant took him by the neck, and pulled his hat off.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Hardwicke, Kello, and Schultz had been that night? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Were they sober? - Hardwicke was drunk.</p>
               <p>How was Schultz? - I can't tell. I had not been in company with him before that night.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether Hardwicke was sober? - I can't tell whether he was not a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hardwicke meddle with a woman's petticoat? - I did not see it; the prisoner walked along side us, between Bell-dock and Wapping church. I saw nothing of the prisoner till he came and put the hanger upon my breast; he did not speak at all to me. I said to him I am your prisoner, and will go where you please. He thrust the hanger through my clothes, and just wounded me in the breast.</p>

Schultz laid hold of the point of the sword; the prisoner had hold of the handle; they struggled a little, and then I laid hold of the hanger.</p>
               <p>Had Schultz any stick in his hand? - No. Then I took the hanger from the Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Had the deceased been wounded at the time you took the hanger from the Lieutenant? - I did not see whether he was wounded or not.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the hanger after you took it from the Lieutenant? - No; I do not. The Lieutenant went to a publick house afterwards; I don't know the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090068"/> sign; I followed him. I heard soon after that Schultz was wounded.</p>
               <p>Was the Lieutenant wounded too? - He was cut in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether you or any of your company had sticks in their hands? - I had a stick, and another had a stick.</p>
               <p>Did you beat the Lieutenant with the sticks? - Nobody used the sticks before Schultz and the Lieutenant were together, then somebody beat the Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Did you see a woman and a girl with a candle and lantern? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not the Lieutenant on the opposite side of the way you was walking on? - The Lieutenant was on the side of the way; we were walking in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased with you in the middle of the street? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. How do you imagine the Lieutenant got wounded? - I can't tell which way he was wounded.</p>

            ; he said, if you don't go along with me I will draw my sword and stab you, or run you through. They struggled then from the Bell alehouse door, till they got between a brazier's and tin shop; which I believe may be about nine or ten yards. One of the three men, but which I can't say, had a stick, he hit the Lieutenant on his back, while Frederick and he were struggling.</p>

The Lieutenant went into the ale-house.</p>
               <p>Had he a sword in his hand then? - I could not see. There was a great mob, and I had my oysters on my head. I sell oysters.</p>
               <p>Court to the Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you mean to make this less than manslaughter?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. No, my Lord, we cannot make it less than manslaughter. The Lieutenant was used very ill while his wife was hanging round his neck to prevent any further fighting. She was cut across her neck, and the Lieutenant had his hand and his coat cut in two places, and was beat all over his arms and shoulders.</p>
               <p>Court. If the Jury are satisfied, we need go no farther, if not we will go on.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday was se'nnight I was called up about five o'clock on an information of a robbery having been committed. I heard the woman was in the watch house. I went to her and charged her with the robbery. She said she took the watch out of a man's pocket she was in bed with, and that she had had it a week, and had sent it to pawn by Randall. I sent for Randall; he immediately acknowledged he had pawned the watch.</p>

               <p>I met the man in Oxford-road; he asked me to take him to my lodging; I said I had never a lodging of my own to take him to, but I could get him a lodging for sixpence, in Banbury-street, St. Giles's, and asked him to give me something to drink; he said no, he would see the lodging first. When we came there, we went into a back room. I then asked for something to drink; he said he had no money, he would treat me in the morning; in the morning he said he had no money, and he gave me the watch to pay for the lodging, and some liquor we had bad; I kept the watch a week, and he never called. That is the truth, my Lord, as God is my judge.</p>

I showed the officers the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090071"/> mark that should be upon the silk, if it was what I dyed for Mr. Hewitt before I looked at it. I tie a particular kind of knot to distinguish one man's silk from another, and as far as any private mark will identify any property, I can swear that is Mr. Hewitt's.</p>
               <p>You found two of these marks on that quantity of silk. How many ought there to have been? - I do not know that it ought to have more; we seldom put more than two marks, if it is 70 lb. weight; we divide certain quantities into certain parcels; we seldom put less than 30 lb. in a parcel, sometimes five, six, or seven and thirty; we put a mark upon each; therefore, I apprehend, this could have but two marks upon it. We often boil forty men's silk together; we have a different mark for every man's silk. This mark has been Mr. Hewitt's as long as I have been in this way, which is ten years and upwards.</p>

They were at the distance of about four lamps from the waggon. I had some suspicion of them; the porter went out of London a little way with the waggon, and was driving it for the waggoner; when he returned, I told him of these men following the waggon. On Tuesday morning the waggoner came to me, and told me his waggon had been robbed, and he asked me to show him where these people lived.</p>
               <p>You knew the men, did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to them that night? - Yes; I bid them good night, and Cooper, the young man, bid me good night. I went with the waggoner to their house in Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - I do not know who owns the house.</p>
               <p>Who did you find in the house? - The two prisoners and another man who got away from us. When we came into the house, the men sent me back to the room they had moved from to this place, and they went up into the room and found the goods. I met one of them going up stairs, and laid hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>You was not present when the waggoner got into the room? - No. I had been to another house, and was come back. I secured Cooper on the stairs; my partner had before secured Lewington. We took him to the White Hart; then we went back and searched the room, and found two bags of silk. We did not open the bags till we came to Sir

The maid came out for some water;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090072"/> we followed her in; we went up stairs. When I entered the room I found Lewington asleep, with his head on the table. There was a woman there; I said to her, is this your husband. I then turned round, and saw a trunk, the lock of which was taken off. The porter opened the trunk, and said, that was some of the property. I opened a door into another room, and saw Cooper and Woodey both asleep with their clothes on; Woodey was on the bed, and Cooper on the ground, with some of the property under him; Lewington rose up, and I caught fast hold of him. Woody got up. I desired my partner not to let him get out, but he made a push by him, and got away. The watchman returned, and took Cooper as he was going down stairs. I sent for a constable, and secured them; then we searched the room, and found two bags of silk and other things that will come out in the next indictment. I can swear to the bags.

I got up, and was going gently down stairs, and the watchman stopped me, and said I had robbed the waggon, that is all I know of the affair.</p>

               <p>I am the waggoner of the Newcastle waggon. When I came to Hertford I found the ropes cut, and the sheet rent down for about a foot long, and I missed three boxes out of the waggon. This was about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Was there anybody in your waggon that night? - Only an old gentlewoman that went passenger from the inn; she was in the waggon all night. The three boxes were in the middle of the waggon.</p>
               <p>What was the weight of the boxes? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Joblin. The box that contained the silk, weighed one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>To Read. Could anybody take this box of one hundred pounds weight out of the waggon without getting into it? - Yes; they might pull it out at the side.</p>
               <p>Where abouts was the gentlewoman? - In the tail of the waggon. There were a great many goods between her and the boxes. They might very easily be taken out without her seeing it. I was by the side of the horses all the night, sometimes walking, sometimes riding the hobby. The ropes were cut on the off side. It was light the beginning of the night, and dark the latter end of it. When I got about two miles out of town I saw three men; they did not come near enough for me to see who they were. They followed the waggon till I got to Ponder's End, that is, about eight miles from London. I kept my eye on them as far as I could.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you stop any where to drink? - I drank a pint of beer at the ship at Tottenham. I did not stay a minute.</p>

The mistress of the house demanded the money for the lodging. I had changed a guinea before I went to bed, and put my breeches under my head. I went to sleep, and slept till eight in the morning, then I waked; I found a woman in bed with me; I immediately felt in my pocket and missed eight guineas, the change of the other guinea was left in my pocket. I said to the woman, you have robbed me. She said she had not.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you met the woman? - Past eleven o'clock. I had been in the city.</p>
               <p>Are you in any employment? - I have been ill all the summer almost. I have lived with Alderman Townshend, and since that with Mr. Banks.</p>
               <p>What house had you been at? - The Sun Tavern. My lodging was at the Greenman, Green-street, Grosvenor-square. I was not able to get to my lodging, I was rather in liquor; my head ached, and I wanted to lie down.</p>
               <p>Did you not know the woman was a woman of the town? - No; I did not; I had seen her before. I did not know that she was a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that it was a disorderly house? - No. I never was in it before.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask her for a lodging. Where had you seen her before? - In Newtoner's-lane . I went to speak to her.</p>
               <p>What did you go to speak to her about? - I thought she was a pretty woman, and went to make love to her.</p>
               <p>Did you look upon her as a woman of the town, and go with her as a woman of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090074"/> town? - No. I did not go to bed to her; she came to bed to me.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - About half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed instantly as you got there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you drink nothing there? - Yes sixpenny-worth of liquor.</p>
               <p>Where was she when you went to bed? - She came up into the room with the landlady of the house.</p>
               <p>What time did she come to bed? - I do not know. I went to sleep. The door was fastened.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room or out of the room? - I believe in the room.</p>
               <p>Who fastened the door? - I believe I did; it was only latched, there was no lock to it.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the house? - One Duffin; he said that was his name.</p>

               <p>This man knew me very well; he had been at my house several times. I met him in the street; he asked me to take him home; I said I could not; he asked me to take him somewhere else; I said I would not go; he pulled me about; then we went to this house; we had some brandy and water, and then went to bed. I said there was no lock to the door; he said never mind that, come to bed. When I waked in the morning he was getting up, and felt under the pillow for my pockets; he said he had been robbed, and wanted to search my pockets. He searched me; there was nothing found upon me.</p>

             Sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Wandsworth . I came to London by water, on the 10th of November, to see my father and mother. I thought it would be more safe to return by water. After I had spent the day in town, I went to Queen-hithe; I saw the prisoner there with his boat.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any children? - I have four. The prisoner asked me if I was going home; I told him I was going by Westead another <rs id="t17781209-58-deflabel342" type="occupation">waterman</rs>

                        targets="t17781209-58-defend688 t17781209-58-deflabel342"/>. Moody said he had been gone sometime,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090075"/> and therefore I might as well go with him.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I have known him many years. We both lived at Wandsworth .</p>
               <p>Had you ever been with him before? - I have . He told me to go into the house, and he would call me when he was ready. When he was ready to go, I went into the boat; it was then about four o'clock, and was rather dark. The beadle of Fulham went into the boat when I did; he found it cold; he landed by Westminster-bridge, and said he would go by the stage.</p>
               <p>You was then left alone with Moody? - I was. He stopped at the Spread-eagle, at Millbank; he asked me to get out there, which I did. As he was a neighbour, I did not think of any hurt. He called for a pint of hot.</p>
               <p>Did you go into a publick or private room with him? - We sat in the publick room.</p>
               <p>What was the hot made of? - I believe of gin and beer; I did not drink much of it because it is a liquor I do not care for.</p>
               <p>Did he press it upon you? - No. We staid there about half an hour. He stopped at the King's-head, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>What was his behaviour from the time the beadle left the boat till you came to the King's-head, at Chelsea? - Nothing but civility.</p>
               <p>He did not kiss you did he? - Not once. When he stopped at the King's-head, he said he wanted to have a pint of beer. He persuaded me to go out of the boat with him. I had not got my pattens; he said, never mind your pattens; I said I did not choose to leave them in the boat, as I had once lost a pair. We went into the publick bar. He had a pint, but I did not drink of it.</p>
               <p>Did he press you to drink with him? - Yes; he asked me two or three time, but I did not drink any.</p>
               <p>Did you drink any other strong liquor on your passage? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - I was. We got into the boat again. Just before we came to <placeName id="t17781209-58-crimeloc343">Battersea bridge</placeName>

               <p>Are you used to sing? - No. I said, I cannot sing; I am not so light-hearted.</p>
               <p>Did that frighten you? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by not being so light-hearted? - My husband is out of his mind; he has been in the mad-house, and was turned out incurable; it lay on my mind.</p>
               <p>Does he live with you? - No; he is in the work-house. On my saying I was not so light-hearted, he swore if I could not sing I should do the other thing; with that he pulled me down. I cried, for God's sake. -</p>
               <p>Was you in the stern? - Yes. He pulled me down in the bottom of the boat.</p>
               <p>Was there any tilt in the boat? - Yes; it was not up, but was put round my back. He pulled me down. I cried, for God's sake, Moody; upon which he said, if I mentioned his name, or screamed out, he would throw me over.</p>
               <p>Were you near land at this time? - Not to my knowledge. He pulled me down, tilt and all together; the tilt was over me.</p>
               <p>Did he use any violence? - He took hold of me by the hips and pulled me down.</p>
               <p>Did he pull up your petticoats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle? - I struggled as much as I could do.</p>
               <p>What did he do with his oars at the time? - They were laid down in the boat, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did he penetrate your body? - He did.</p>
               <p>How did he get your thighs open? - By main force. I was in the bottom of the boat; I had no command.</p>
               <p>As the boat must be wavering, how did he keep himself steady upon you? - The boat was to all appearance steady enough; it was a very calm night.</p>
               <p>Then the boat did not shake about in the struggle? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find any emission from him? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long might he lie with you? - I can't tell how long; it was some minutes to be sure.</p>
               <p>He had the same carnal knowledge of you that your husband has? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you scream out at this time? - I did frequently.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you make all the resistance that was in your power? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you yield to him through fear of being thrown over-board, or by reason of his overpowering<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090076"/> you? - With my struggling, I was almost gone.</p>
               <p>What did he then do? - After it was over, I set myself up, and said, Moody, I will expose you to every body I know.</p>
               <p>Did he throw by his oars when he first began to attack you? - He never rowed afterwards till he had laid with me.</p>
               <p>Which way was the tide going? - To Wandsworth .</p>
               <p>Did you receive any bruises from him in the struggle? - Only on my shoulder that went off.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you told him you would expose him? - He swore he did not mind being exposed.</p>
               <p>Did he row on quietly after that to Wandsworth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he carnal knowledge of you after that? - No.</p>
               <p>When the boat came on shore at Wandsworth, was there anybody on the causeway? - Only a little boy.</p>
               <p>Is Moody a married man? - Yes; his wife lay-in at the time.</p>
               <p>What passed when Moody came to the shore? - He said to the boy, pull the boat in. I took a shilling out of my pocket, and said, Moody, pay yourself. He made answer, the woman is a fool, and swore, and said I paid him once before; I said I had not. He would not take the money.</p>
               <p>In what kind of way did you part? - He said the woman is a fool; she paid me before; I said I had not, that was every word that passed. I immediately went away. I went directly to my own brother's, Mr. Fermage's; I knocked at the door; Mrs. Fermage let me into the shop; it was then about half after seven o'clock. I related to my sister how I had been used.</p>
               <p>Did you relate it of your own accord, or did she take any notice of your having been tumbled? - When I went in I was full of tears; I could hardly speak. She asked me what was the matter? She took me into another room, because my brother was in the shop, and I told her how I had been used; after that, my brother was acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner? - The day after; that and the following day I was in London, and the next day they said he was off.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of your coming to London? - I came for a warrant. I first went to the Rotation at the Swan tavern in the Borough; they said it was the wrong side of the water, and they sent me to Sir

               <p>What day was he taken up? - I cannot tell the day of the month. It was better than a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Had you a warrant on the 12th? - Yes. Enquiry was made after him, and he was gone away.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts was the boat when he made the first attack upon you? - On the Chelsea side near Batersea bridge .</p>
               <p>Was you near the shore? - In the middle of the stream.</p>
               <p>He pulled you down before you came to the bridge? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you know the man in the barge? - I did not at first know him, but we knew one another afterwards.</p>

               <p>Did any conversation pass after the outrage? - No; not three words.</p>

She appeared to have been very much tumbled and mousled about, and she appeared to be very much agitated in her mind. I asked her what was the matter several times before she told me. We were then in the shop, and my husband and a little boy were likewise in the shop. I took a candle and lit Mrs. Bethell into another room. I did not know what to think; I knew she had been to see her brother, and I imagined her brother was dead, seeing her in such confusion. When we got into the other room and had sat down, I asked her what was the matter; she said she had been used very ill by

               <p>Did she tell you when it happened? - She did; but I am unacquainted with the river, and therefore I cannot directly express the place.</p>
               <p>Did she go into any fit? - To all outward appearance she must have been in a sit in the boat, for her face and cap were stained as if she had been fetched to with water.</p>
               <p>She had no sit in your house? - No; none at all. As soon as she had related the case to me I sent for her father, and I acquainted my husband with it. When her father came, my husband told him that

My son came to me, and said, Sal is in a terrible condition. I went to my daughter; I saw her in a terrible condition, which struck me very much indeed. She said, Moody had used her very ill. I said I will make him suffer for it as sure as he is born; he shall have what the law directs. I went to the Rotation at St. Margaret's-hill the next morning. As I was going by my son's house, at about nine in the morning, Moody came out, and said, for God's sake have compassion upon me! consider my wife and children. I told him he should have what the law would allow him. My daughter and I went to the Rotation in the Borough. One of the clerks asked her which side of the water she was on; she said she was sure it was the Chelsea side. They said they could not grant a warrant, we must go to Sir

               <p>Court. After you had been told that this woman had been ravished, was it consistent with a woman of decency to speak in that manner, you must be in a very jocose humour to ask this woman how she did after this merry bout. Is a rape a merry bout in your estimation? - She is a jokeus woman. I only thought it a joke.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did your ever see or hear of any familiarities at any time between her and Moody? - No further than she said once, that Moody had asked her to drink. I do not think any harm of that.</p>

               <p>I keep the King's-Head at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prosecutrix and the prisoner drinking at your house on the 10th of November? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection whether she drank with him, or no? - She did. I sat close by her.</p>
               <p>Were they apparently upon good terms? - Very agreeable.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the expression she made use of when she asked him to go? - She said, Mr. Moody, will you go; he replied yes, my dear, I will directly. The pint was three parts empty; he drank up what remained, and they went out of the door arm in arm.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from the bridge? - Hardly so much as an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Court. What had they? - He had one pint or two, I cannot rightly say which. She asked after some person in Chelsea; I do not know who. Some of the men in the taproom said the person lived in London.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she drank of the porter, or only put her lips to the pot? - I cannot say whether she drank, or not. I saw her put the pot to her mouth.</p>
               <p>Did any thing familiar or indecent pass between them? - They were very agreeable; they seemed very sociable together.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is the King's-Head near Mr. Milward's brewhouse? - Close by it, on this side the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Jury. That is then above an hundred yards from the bridge? - When it is low water, from our causeway to the bridge, I believe it is not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any of the conversation that passed between them? - I cannot say. I was in and out of the tap-room; but when they went out, some of the men wished them good luck, because they saw them very sociable together.</p>
               <p>Were the men who wished them good luck in the room and heard their conversation? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. When you say they were very agreeble with each other; do you mean to convey an idea of any particular familiarity? - I was backwards and forwards in my business. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the prosecutrix? - No. She never was in my house before as I know of.</p>
               <p>Does the prisoner often use your house? - Yes; he plies at our stairs, when he comes there and wants a fare. He called at our house on the Friday, after the rape was committed; he asked me if I recollected his calling there on the Tuesday; I said I did. He had a man went in his boat from our house that night.</p>
               <p>A WATERMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>You was upon the river in the evening of the 10th of November last? - I was. Moody came within four or five boats length of me, between six and seven o'clock; he was very merry; he was singing. That was near the Two Blue Posts, at Chelsea. It was after he had been at the King's-Head.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body scream out or make a noise? - No.</p>
               <p>If there had been any noise, must you have heard it? - I must, for I had an old woman in my boat that must take me a minute landing. I put off directly, and neither I nor my passenger heard any noise. I went directly to Wandsworth .</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090081"/>How far is the King's-Head from the Two Blue Posts? - I imagine about forty yards. They passed me at forty or fifty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had lain a quarter of an hour upon his oars must not you have passed him? - I must have run upon him.</p>
               <p>Was there time for a man to lie upon his oars a quarter of an hour? - He could not be got fifty boats length a-head of me when I put off.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What distance is the Two Blue Posts from the bridge? - A hundred yards, or better.</p>
               <p>Is it not 500? - I cannot say; I speak to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you first saw Moody, was he on his passage? - He was rowing, and somebody was sitting upright at his backboard; I cannot tell whether a man or woman. He passed by my boat as I was landing; I never overtook him.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose he had left his boat to be driven by the tide, would he have got through Battersea-bridge before you? - No; I must have been through first if he had lain on his skulls.</p>
               <p>How long would the tide have been carrying him up from the King's-head to Battersea-bridge, if he had not rowed a yard. - It might take five minutes from the Two Blue Posts where I was.</p>

               <p>Did you hear a screaming, or outcry, or any noise made by a woman? - None at all.</p>
               <p>If the prisoner had rowed; he must have got through the bridge before you quitted your boat? - Yes; he might have rowed through bridge in two minutes and a half with pleasure.</p>

               <p>Not to open the bales? - No.</p>
               <p>What you mean by breaking is what we mean by removing? - Yes; that is the seafaring term. The prisoners were employed in the hold. I stood on the gun-deck and saw the lower hatch was taken up; I asked the men at work in the hatchway, where the prisoners were, they said they thought they were gone to sleep somewhere; I went aft and saw Otman lying down on the larboard side in the hold. This was as I think about seven. Hughes was standing by the side of a case that was broke open. I asked Otman what he was doing there; he said he was going to sleep. I came forward to the second hatchway; I then saw Hughes take two pieces of silk out of this case and chuck them to Otman. I went immediately on deck to the commanding officer, the chief mate, the company's surveyor, and the king's superintendant, and told them of it. I got a light and went down and found eight pieces of striped silk, three pieces were lying by Otman, by the corner of the pump, one by the corner of the case that was broke open, and four on the opposite side of the ship.</p>
               <p>Could they have got out of the case by accident or fell out? - They could not.</p>
               <p>Were they part of that bale of goods? - Yes; I verily believe they were.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether upon your oath you understand silks? - I know silk when I see it; I do not understand the quality.</p>
               <p>Were there any more lumpers working in the hold that day? - Yes; two more, but they were never out of the hatchway, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. Were they near the case? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a custom-house officer. I was on board this ship on the 30th of November.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090083"/> Arthur came and informed us of this affair. I got three candles, and we went down into the hold. I saw the case broke open at the corner, so that you might just put one hand in and lift the silk up, and with the other hand draw it out. There is a coarse wrapper over the case that was cut. There was a piece of silk lying under the corner of the case. We found the pieces in the several places Arthur mentioned.</p>
               <p>This is one of the eight pieces; I sealed it myself (producing it) the other pieces are here.</p>
               <p>- DAWES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am gunner on board the Duke of Portland. I was on board on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Were there any silks or any bales lying about this place on Saturday night? - On Saturday night, at near five o'clock, the Captain gave me orders to go and look for a particular bag of rice, with a W L upon it. These two cases were in the larboard side of the ship. The two prisoners were with me to seek for this bag. To the best of my knowledge there was no broken package nor loose silks.</p>
               <p>What day were the bales broke open? - On Monday morning. This was the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you do any business on Sunday on board the ship? - No.</p>
               <p>To Arthur. How was your situation that you could see Hughes take out two pieces? - By the light of the hatchway. I was in the aft part of the hatchway, in the hold. I do not know who broke the package.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go immediately to stop him? - I did not know that there was any such things carrying on in the ship. The lumpers have no right to break any package on board the ship.</p>
               <p>When you saw a Jumper departing from his duty and breaking open a package, why did not you take him? - I did not see him break the package, I only saw him take two pieces out.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it within a case? - Yes; a new case, nailed up with a bag over it, and cordage over that.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the examination made by Surry? - I imagine it might be about ten minutes after I saw him take the two pieces out before I get up upon the deck. I gave the custom-house officer charge of the hatch-way.</p>
               <p>Are these packages ever broke by order of the captain or any body else? - Never.</p>
               <p>How do you suppose they became broken? - The gunny bag sewed over the bale could not be broke open by any force without the help of a knife or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Do these goods pay custom-house duty? - Certainly. They are for exportation; most of the duty I apprehend is redeemed again when they are exported.</p>
               <p>Is it not a usual thing to break these packages to run them on shore without paying the duty? - I do not suppose the Honourable Company ever ran a pound's worth of goods.</p>
               <p>But are not these packages frequently broke in order to run them on shore without paying the duty? - This was the company's mark and number.</p>
               <p>But are not these packages frequently broke in order to run them; could not the captain put the company's numbers upon them? - No. The captain nor no one ever dare put the company's number upon them.</p>
               <p>Did you see the particular mark of the company upon these bales? - I saw the company's mark on these bales, to the best of my knowledge, on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where was the mark put? - On the outside of the gunny bag.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see positively that the bale out of which the goods were taken had the company's mark? - I was. I am very positive I did see it.</p>
               <p>You know very well these lumpers and all of you break goods in order to run them on shore? - There is no such thing as trusting to a lumper to run goods on shore.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Though officers may happen to run goods on shore, does any body ever run the company's goods on shore? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not the officers put the company's mark on some sometimes to run them on shore? - I imagine it is death to do so.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the bale now? - At the company's warehouse, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am surveyor to the East India Company.

And they were on Monday morning in the same situation as I left them in on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Then it was impossible to do any business till Monday morning? - No; it is impossible. I am intrusted with the keys till the ship is cleared. The case which was broken open was No. 4.</p>

               <p>Do not the company pay duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do the packages always come entire or are they not often less than they purport to be? - We have always the quantity of pieces put upon the invoice, but we often find them plundered, as this has been, particularly the silks.</p>
               <p>Every piece that comes on shore pays a duty? - I cannot positively answer what duty it pays.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did you ever know any of the officers of the ship to smuggle the company's goods on shore? - Private trade they do, but never the company's goods. What is the company's property must be stolen out before it can be got on shore.</p>
               <p>Court. But cannot the captain put on board his own private adventure under the seal of the East-India Company? - It must be a fraud if he did.</p>

I have in my hand the invoice of the Duke of Portland; this was delivered to me from the company when the ship arrived, and it is my duty to see that every thing comes out clear from these packages into the warehouse agreeable to the invoice sent from the company's servants at Bengal . In the second page, here is a No. 4. S. Taffety, which means striped taffety. Upon the opening of this chest, the servants under me gave me what we call a piling bill; they found only 176 pieces and a small bale containing ten, and this piece, which was kept for evidence. These goods were in a strong chest, nailed down, and there was a strong gunny or hopsack sewed upon it.</p>

I agreed to give four pound sixteen shillings for it, but had not paid for it. I turned her upon Uxbridge Moor . I went to see for her on Friday afternoon, and she was gone. I did not see her again till the 25th of October. Mr . Sage the person I bought it of, went down to Leighton-fair to buy some horses; he stopped the mare there. I saw it on the Saturday following. I am sure it was the mare I bought of Sage, for I had marked the fore-hoof with the initials of my name, but it was rasped out.</p>

               <p>I bought a mare for 4 l. 16 s. I told the prosecutor if he liked it he should have it at the same price; and he had it of me. It was lost from Uxbridge Moor . I saw it again in October, in Leighton-fair; I challenged it as Mr. Duncan's mare. There was a boy had it. I laid hold of the bridle. The boy said it belonged to one Stevens, a capital man in the town. We went up to Mr. Stevens's. Duncan and I agreed if the mare was lost to be at the loss between us.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Uxbridge Moor is an open moor? - Yes. Very likely it might stray, there are many roads through it.</p>
               <p>You agreed with the last witness if the mare was lost to bear an equal proportion of the loss; Duncan swore to the horse being his property? - And I swore to the property.</p>
               <p>You could not swear to the mare, if Duncan did? - I swore to half the mare, it was half mine.</p>

	              <p>* * The Honourable Court of Aldermen and Common Council having recently resolved that the Trials at the Old Bailey shall, in future, be printed at large, as well in cases where the prisoners are acquitted, as when they are convicted, we could not possibly conclude the many remarkable Trials during this Sessions, in less than three parts. The third (being the last) part, will be published in four days; it will contain the trial of ROBERT MOODY, for comiiting a RAPE on the body of SARAH BETHALL; Of ANN TAYLOR, for the MURDER of her BASTARD CHILD; of JOSEPH RALPH, the Lieutenant of a Press-gang, for the MURDERof ANDREW SCHULTY; of SAMUEL BONNER, for sending a letter to Mrs. TESHMAKER, of Winchmore Hill, threatning to burn her estate, and murder her; of ROWLAND RIDGELY, for HIGH TREASON; and of JAMES TAYLOR and NICHOLAS FIGGES, for a highway robbery; the last four of whom were capitally convicted.</p>
