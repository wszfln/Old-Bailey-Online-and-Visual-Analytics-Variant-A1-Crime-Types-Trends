I went on as far as Old street, then crossing the road, this gentleman tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody tapped you on the shoulder - A. Yes. He said, my man, you must go along with me to your master, for he had got something to tell me; my master is going out, and he wants the things directly; I said, very well, sir. He said, you may as well give me the bundle to carry, we shall then go on the quicker; I said, no, sir. I am much obliged to you; I can carry it very well myself. He said, you must give it me, I want to go directly back to my master, for he wants to go out of town; you can deliver the message. He then put his legs between mine, knocked me down, and forced the bundle out of my hand; there was a gentleman, officer, near, that saw the transaction. The prisoner ran away with the bundle.

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you go to the Justice - A. Mr. Lamprell sent his man, Nash, to the officer Hancock, and when I saw Hancock, I told him what had happened; Hancock took me the same night to a place, where I saw some men, it was at a public-house up a court in Whitecross-street; the first time I pointed out no person; I went several times afterwards to other houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you first saw the man that you thought robbed you - A. At a public-house by Hatton Garden; this was about a fortnight ago; Hancock, the officer, went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many persons in the room - A. Yes, about eight or nine; among these I saw the prisoner at the bar was one; I knew him as soon as I saw him; I singled the prisoner out from among the rest. He said, mind what you say, you are certain that I am the man; I said, I am certain. He put his hand to his head, and appeared agitated. I am sure the prisoner at the bar is the person that robbed me.</p>

On the 9th of April, I apprehended him in Great Shire-lane; a man of the name of Day gave me an information; I went into a shop in Great Shire-lane and went up stairs; as soon as the prisoner saw me, he asked me what I wanted with him; he asked me if I wanted him about a snow; I said, no; I wanted him about something else. Whilst going along with him to the office, I told him I wanted him for a highway robbery; he said, he did not care about that, or words to that effect. I put him into a room by the office with several others; Barnes came; I cautioned Barnes to be correct. He pointed him out directly; he made no hesitation at all. The prisoner then said, look at me again, be sure that I am the man; he said, I am sure you are the man that tripped me down; the prisoner was then take before the magistrate.</p>

On the 1st of April last, between four and five in the afternoon, I met him by accident, in Lincoln's-inn-fields, I had known him four or five years before. We talked about respectable trades; and his conversation led me to believe he got his living by thieving. He informed me that he was in danger of being apprehended every minute, and that he apprehended that Garnan, the Westminster police officer, had two warrants against him; I asked him what they were for; he said, one or two pieces of Irish linen, out of Barbican. I asked him how he got it, and whether by a croke! croke is a slang word for house-breaking; he said no; from a boy. I asked him what the other was for; he said; from Peter-street, Westminster. I asked him how he got that; he gave an account how he got it; this conversation was on the 1st of April. I afterwards saw Hancock, and gave him some information; in consequence of which, the prisoner was apprehended; I saw Roberts again on the Saturday following; on the Sunday following the Saturday he was apprehended; he was not apprehended until the 9th of April.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you ever in custody - A. I am not come here to convict myself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Day about the 1st of April, he asked me what I had been about, and what I was doing now; I said, I am looking out for bread in Shire-lane. He said he had been taken up on suspicion of stealing a watch, in Pickett-street. I asked him if he had a lodging to go home to; he said, no; so I gave him a shilling to got one. I wished to put off my trial until Monday, when I hoped to have this butcher here. I therefore throw myself entirely on the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>MARY PEMBROOKE. I was attending Mrs. Stafford as nurse. On the 23rd of April, I was up stairs at the time this happened. Mr. Stafford went out a after six o'clock, he was going to church; when he went out, I went into the kitchen; I went up stairs directly after, Mr. Stafford's little daughter went up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What person were in the house at that time - A. I many persons; there were lodgers: the lodgers had separate rooms. Mr. Stafford had at that time, a shop, parlour, and bed room; it is a shop for ready made clothes. When I went up stairs I had locked the parlour door, and kitchen; the parlour opens into a yard, and it has another door that opens into the passage inside of the house; this inner door of the parlour was broken open; the door that opens into the yard was bolted; the door was locked, and the key was in my pocket. After I had been up stairs a little while, a young son of Mr. Stafford's came in, about seven o'clock; I gave the child some tea; then I looked at the parlour door, and went up again. Some time afterwards, I heard a noise; it was a little after seven o'clock, drawing on for dark; I went up stairs a second time, and then I heard a noise from below, it seemed like the cracking of a piece of deal; it was not quite dark then; I did not go down immediately, it may be nearly a quarter of an hour before I went down, more, or less, I cannot exactly say. When I went down, I saw the door open, and I saw a man with a bed on his back entering the passage, the man went on to the step, and out of the house; I followed him immediately, with a candle and candlestick in my hand, into the street, I called stop thief, and I learned that a young man stopped him of the name of

               <p>Q. Had you left this bed in the room when you went up stairs - A. Yes; and locked the door, and put the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken out of the room - A. The bed and all the entire bedding belonging to it; there was the bed, the bolster, two pillows, and pillowcases, three blankets, and a pair of sheets; all these things I left when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the bed worth - A. I cannot say, it is a good bed; I could not buy such a one under five pounds, the bolster about seven shillings or eight shillings, the pillows and cases nine shillings, the blankets are worth a pound, one is a new one, the sheets fifteen shillings; the bed things were with the bed; they are here. When I went into the parlour, I saw the lock of the parlour door had been forced off; that was the noise I heard the time before; the door had been forced open by two crows, two crows and part of the lock were produced before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before, was he a lodger in the house - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. In the first place, when I was taken to the office, the prosecutrix swore it was between seven and eight o'clock; now she says it was between six and seven - A. I saw the place secure at seven o'clock, as I had left it.</p>

            . On the 23rd of April, as near as I can guess, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, I was going up Tower-street; I met a man running with a bed and bedding on his back; I pursued him; I saw the last witness with a candle, hallooing out stop thief; she went a very little way from the door, and again she hallooed out stop thief. I turned about, and went after the man; there was nobody in the street besides me. I overtook the prisoner, he had the bed on his back, it was tied up in a blanket. I sprang on the bed, and pulled it off his back; the man ran off; I jumped over the bed, and went after him, and catched him in Little St. Martin's-lane, I took him after a deal of difficulty, he struck at me, and said the bed did not belong to me; he got from me again; I went after him a second time, I followed him up some considerable way; he said, I had no business with him, and I took him again, and I took him up to the house where he had taken the bed from: we got him into the passage; then I saw two women, and there was a mob about the door in the street; and I gave him up to the women; the women took the bed and bedding into the house. When I got back with the prisoner, the bed was gone from the place where I left it.</p>

               <p>- GODDARD. I was constable of the night. I took the bed into the watch-house; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house about nine o'clock. The bedding and other articles, were brought by Maloney to the watch-house; they were put into my custody to keep; they have been at my house ever since; they are here now.</p>

On the 23rd of April last, I was in the Strand, I met the prisoner Smith, I came up to him; it was about a quarter before ten o'clock; at that time, I was at the end of Holywell-street; I never saw him before to my knowledge; he endeavoured to get into some kind of conversation with me; I took no heed of him; I kept on, and he kept on walking with me until we nearly reached Temple Bar; when we came to Star-court, (which is by the side of Temple Bar,) he spoke about turning up Star-court; I did not know for what purpose we were to turn into the court. We walked together within a few yards of Temple Bar; the prisoner, Simons, joined us about four or five yards from Temple Bar, he came as if from the road side; he came close to my right hand. All three of us passed through the Bar together; nothing occurred until we came close to Bell-yard; I turned up Bell-yard; they walked on with me, one on my right hand, and the other on my left, until we came to <placeName id="t18150510-4-crimeloc21">Apollo-court, in Bell-yard</placeName>

The prisoner, Simons was on my right hand, close to me, and at the instant the blow was struck, I felt my watch go from me in an instant; it was in my breeches fob, on the right side; there was a ribbon, and a gilt key, to it, and a valuable seal. The prisoners ran away, immediately I heard them running. I never saw them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing one to the other - A. They did not say any thing together that I heard, to my knowledge not a word passed from Simons to the other; if they did say any thing after it was done, I did not hear it. I never saw my watch again; the value of the watch is two pounds ten shillings, it cost me five pounds ten shillings. I am perfectly sure I had the watch at the time I was struck, I had felt it a few minutes before, and I likewise felt it drawn out of my pocket as I fell down; I was perfectly sober, I had not been in any public-house. Somebody picked me up. I was going to my own lodgings; this was the nearest way to my lodgings. I called out stop thief as I was laying on the stones; two watchmen came up, and said, had I called out stop thief, they could have secured them; they were not stopped at that time. I went home to my lodgings; and I had a thought that they were then lurking about Temple Bar, and it struck me that I would go out, and see if I could see any thing of them; I then went from my lodgings back again to Temple Bar, with intention to go into Pickett-street, to see if I could see any thing of them lurking about; I had a friend with me at the same time; we passed through the bar, I had scarcely got though it, before the alarm was given of stop thief, by a gentleman of the name of Jones. The prisoner, Simons, had been picking his pocket; the rattles were sprung upon the alarm of stop thief being given and several people were in pursuit; I, and my friend, went among the number, with the watchman, and in turning about from St. Clements, the prisoner, Simons, fell, he was running as if he was making for Essex-street, and in turning down he fell; Simons was then secured, and taken to the watch-house; I knew his person immediately, I was positive to his person, having joined me at Temple Bar, he looks very much like a Jew, that is the one that joined Smith at Temple Bar; he took my watch. The other was not taken then, he was Tuesday evening following; I was Smith was taken, two officers took him Bow-street, the other belonging to when he was at Bow-street, I at to his person; it was on the Monday taken, at his second examination sure of both the prisoners.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner, Simons, on the 23rd of April, in the evening, he was with Mr. Jones, who accused him of picking his pocket of a pocket-book: Mr. Jones gave charge of him to take him into custody. He was walking by the side of Mr. Jones when he gave him in charge, just by St. Clements pillars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Jones had laid hold of him before you - A. Yes; when I laid hold of the prisoner, he ran; I called stop thief, I sprang my rattle, and with the assistance of other watchman, and the prosecutor, we took Simons; Eglinton was with me at the time I took the prisoner; the prosecutor, Eglinton, said, he would swear to Simons, was one of the two that knocked him down, and stole his watch. The prisoner said, he was innocent. I asked him what made him run away; he said, what should he stand to be taken for.</p>

            . On the 23rd of April last, about half past ten o'clock, I heard my partner's watchmen calling out stop thief, he sprang his rattle; I immediately ran to his assistance; I saw Simons running in St. Clements, by the end of Essex-street, he had a fall, the watchman and I catched him, and secured him. Eglinton gave charge of him for robbing him of his watch. I have had him several times in custody before for picking pockets, and riots in the street.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAN. I am a patrole. I know the two prisoners; I saw them together on Sunday, the 23rd of April, in Pickett street, Temple Bar; the first time I saw them was about half past eight o'clock; this was the first time I saw them that night; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100007"/>then after that, I was watching them from Wych Street to Temple-bar; I watched them till nine o'clock at that time; I watched them up and down Pickett-street, I saw them trying every gentleman's pocket they came nigh. The prisoner Simons get sight of me, he told Smith that he saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you should not say that.</p>

Afterwards I turned back, and went into a public house, the public-house is at the end of Wych street the sign of the King's Head the prisoner Smith came into the public-house; he called for a pint of half and half, he gave a three shilling piece to change while he was looking at his change, in come Simons; they drank their liquor and went out, and I saw no more of them, I did not see any thing more of them till I saw Simons at the watch-house. The next morning the prisoner Simmons was taken to Bow-street, I went with Simons on Monday morning to the magistrate. I asked Eglinton if he could swear to the man. On Monday morning at Bow-street he said positively he could; which he did swear to him; I then gave him a description of the other man who was with Simons, and asked if he should know him again, he said he positively should, and that the man I had discribed, was the man. On the Tuesday following, I informed a Bow street officer, Archibald Ruthwin, and on Tuesday evening, Ruthwin and I went in search of Smith, we found him at the Dover Castle Dover street, St. George's Fields. We apprehended him, we began by informing him that he must go with us, he said, he wanted to see one man a bit by himself; and that he was taken on Simons's business. We told him that we took him for felony.</p>

About half past eight o'clock, when I was at the King's Head the corner of Pickett street, I called for a pint of half and half; the patrole came in, I asked him to drink, whilst he was drinking Simons came in, I asked him also to drink, I bid Simons go off, and I went down Fleet-street. I am very innocent of the crime that is charged against me.</p>

            . On Saturday evening between nine and ten o'clock on the 16th of April, I and a young women had been in the Borough, at Shoreditch church, I thought I would treat myself with a coach, I asked a coachman what he would take me to Cambridge Heath for, he asked me three shillings and six-pence, I told him I would not give three shillings and six-pence, he said are you going through a turnpike, I said no; he said what will you give, I said a shilling, he said, will not you give two, I said no, I would not; he said well then get in; the coachman came and put me into the coach, and this young woman was with me. The coachman said, I have a little business to do down the road, you will have the goodness to let me come into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100008"/>coach, with that he came in, and called the prisoner into the coach, the prisoner got into the coach, and set at the side of me, the coachman went on the opposite side. The coach went on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who drove the coach - A. No, I do not. It was a hackney coach, No. 737, the coach went through the bar; the prisoner unbuttoned his breeches, as we were going along, and I would not yield to his deceitfulness I was obligated of turning myself down upon my knees, then he struck me, he said if I did not yield to him, he would have my life. I told him I was a married woman and mother of a family, I held myself down on my knees. He struck me on the eye; and then he said if he could not have his will of me, he would have it of the young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then do any thing to her - A. No, he then took my shawl off, and stuffed it into his breeches. I let down the sash and cried out, a gentleman was going by, whether he opened the door, or the coachman I cannot say, the coach stopped. The woman got out, and the coachman got out, and I got out, the prisoner staid in the coach; I saw the prisoner put my shawl into his breeches by the light of the lamps; I saw his person also; that is the man there at the bar. I asked him for my shawl, he would not give it me. The prisoner jumped up in the street into the coach; as soon as I got out, of the coach, I went home immediately, and the young woman with me; I told the coachman where the prisoner had put my shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the gentleman the prisoner had the shawl in his breeches - A. That gentleman protected me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by when you told the coachman that the prisoner had got it in his breeches - A. He was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your shawl again - A. No I have had an offer to be paid for it; an Attorney was with me yesterday, I had never seen the prisoner before nor the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that he was taken up - A. This was on Saturday, and on Monday I went to the office, and stated the case, the same as I have done it now.</p>

             the last witness, I had been with her into the Borough to buy some tea and sugar; I got into the coach with Mrs Martin; she got in first, I afterwards, the coachman asked if he might get in, he got in and called this man the prisoner, and said he was his brother. We asked him who this man was, he said he was his brother, when he got up, I saw him, I am sure he is the man. He sat on the opposite side; I did not see him offer any undecency, it was dark, I could not see; I heard them I asked him what he was at, he told me I had better hold my tongue or I should share the same ate. I saw nothing, I heard a bustling about; I told the prisoner she was a married woman, and would do nothing of the kind; he said he would have his will of one or the other, with that in a little time she got up and screamed out of the window, the coach stopped, the door was opened; I first got out of the coach, then the coachman jumped out, and then Mrs. Martin got out; I heard her ask him for the shawl, before she got out; he took an oath that he had not got it, that is all he said.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

We asked them were they were going, they said, to Cambridge Heath; they got into the coach, and the coachman and I, after them; the coachman had connexion with that young woman, and when we came near the Durham Arms, Mrs. Martin said I had robbed her of a shawl; she said she saw me stuff the shawl into my breeches.</p>

               <p>JOHN DOBSON. I am a hackney coachman, I drive the coach. No. 737. On the night in question, I was called to by the two young women, the prisoner was in company with them.

               <p>Q. Had anything happened before you had the gin - A. No, nothing at all; when we had the gin, we turned about into Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the coach stop - A. No longer than while we took the gin.</p>

We went on till we came to the corner of Wheeler-street; there the man ran against him, as if he was going to throw him with both hands; Butler says, halloo, my friend, what are you at; I did not see any thing in the man's hands. I am not certain whether it was the prisoner or not. I thought the man's determination was to rob Butler; I saw three more rush forward on Butler, with dark great coats on; I saw that by the light of the lamp. Butler immediately hallooed out murder; I ran, and made an alarm myself; I went back again to the place where I left Butler; I found Butler with his coat all over mud, standing up, and from the violent blow he had received, his nose bled very much.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any other person to notice them, but that one that ran against Butler - A. No. The three others past by us first, and presently after, the same three came back again, they had dark great coats on.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Kennedy, my brother officer; I was at the Swan public-house, in Swan-yard, on Wednesday, the 12th of April, and there we apprehended the prisoner, he was in the tap-room; we brought him from there to Worship-street office; he was drest in the same jacket as he is now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To Butler. Have you any doubt whether the prisoner was the man that came against you, and snatched at your watch-chain - A. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100010"/>sure he is the person; I knew him before by sight; I had seen him many times about the neighbourhood.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop on the 18th of April, about ten o'clock in the forenoon, she asked to look at some cotton shawls; she said, she lived over the way, at a bakers shop. I took her to the counter in that part of the shop where the shawls were; I shewed her several; she fixed on one, and before she purchased it, she said, she should like her mistress to see it; I then let her have it, and she went out, and I saw her go into the shop of Mr. Johnson; she staid there about five or ten minutes, she then came over, she returned to the shop with the shawl, saying, her mistress thought it was not good enough. She said, she thought, she would like one in the window; there were several in the window; she pointed one out in the window; after seeing it, she said, she wanted some scaffs; which I shewed her; she then fixed on one; she then said, that she wished her mistress (who lived over the way) might see it, before she purchased it, that she might not think her too extravagant; she then said, how can I get my mistress over; have you a housekeeper? I will say you want to pay your bread bill; she said, she might not cross directly over, for fear of her mistress seeing her; she went out, and instead of crossing over, she went up the next street; I then followed her; I overtook her two doors up, and said, she must return back to the shop with me; she hesitated a little at first, and afterwards went with me; when she was in the shop, I told her we wanted to know about the shawl; on which, she began to take a shawl out of her pocket; she said, she would pay me for it, but said, let her go; I told her she must not go before I fetched a constable; I fetched the constable; I gave her in charge to him.</p>

            No, I do not. His house was broken into on the 12th of April. I went to bed about half past eleven; the other servants were left up, I left them up in the kitchen; before I went to bed the doors and windows of the kitchen were all fastened; I had fastened them myself. I arose next morning about twenty minutes past four, it was drawing towards day-light; the house maid and me came down to the street door; we first went into the kitchen a little after five. After we had been at the street door, we went up to our bed room again. We went down because there was a man rung at the door; the man asked if any body was sent from there with a bundle; we said, no. He said, he wanted to see the house; we said, we could not open the door at that time in the morning. A little after five, a ring of the bell came again; we went into the drawing-room; from there we went into the kitchen, when we came into the kitchen, we found the kitchen doors open; we then went out at a door that opens into the passage to come up to the parlour; I do not know whether that door was shut or not. I found all the things in other parts to where I left them the night before; we found the bread and meat which had been put into the pantry the night before, was standing on the kitchen table; we observed both the back doors of the room unbolted; one back door goes into the back yard, the other door goes in a yard, seperate from the kitchen; they were both unbolted. I bolted them myself the night before I went to bed. The sky-light was broke; there is a sky-light over the sink; the skylight was broke, some of the frame work was broke, and some glass was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke so as to enable any person to get in - A. Yes; then when they went into the kitchen, they unbolted the back door, and by that means they were capable of getting into the back yard, and there is a gate in the back yard that takes them into the tenter ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100011"/>Q. What then did you miss - A. There was some money missing out of a gentleman's writing desk, it is a small desk with a drawer; I had put some money there the night before, one pound some shillings; there were two one-pound notes in the kitchen taken; there was a small trifle of money taken out of the house besides, but where it was, I do not particularly know; there were two towels, and a pair of shoes of mistress's; I had seen these things all safe the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. No; I had never seen him before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen some of the things since - A. I have, some.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the notes - A. No, I could not.</p>

I do not know whether we shut it to or not. The middle door, which is a door in the kitchen, was fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body come out of the outer part of the house into the kitchen, without passing through the middle door - A. No, they cannot.</p>

A shawl belonging to me; I lost them out of my drawer in the kitchen, a middle drawer, that is my drawer; a sheet and a frock belonging to my mistress, that I was at work on, on the over night, that was gone; and two shillings and sixpence in silver, belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What else - A. Four silver table spoons, they were under my care; I had seen them the day before, I make use of them every day.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of April, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner; I was on duty, I was in the Minories; it was dark; it might be about two hundred or three hundred yards from Mr. Dacosta's house; he had two bundles in his hand, he was walking, coming down from that part where Mr. Dacosta's house is; I turned round on my heels, and walked along side of him, he was by himself. I asked him what he had got in the bundles; he wanted to know the reason I asked; I told him, I must do what I generally did, know what were in the bundles. He said, one was a parcel he was going to send down to his mistress at Portsmouth; he said, his mistress was Mrs. Dacosta, I asked him what that other bundle was; he said, provision, bread and meat. I asked him whether he was going to send his mistress provision; he said, no; that was for himself; he was going by the ten o'clock coach, and the parcel was going by the five o'clock coach. I asked him what capacity he was in at Mrs. Dacosta's; he said, footman to Mrs. Dacosta. I then asked him where did Mr. Dacosta live; he said, No. 41, Prescott-street, Goodman's fields; that is Mr. Dacosta's house. We walked together until we came to the watchhouse; I said, young man, you can have no objection to go over the way, I am not satisfied; I laid hold of his arm; he made no resistance; we went into the watchhouse, and I examined the bundles. When I came to look at him by the light, I knew he was not a footman; he had a dirty check apron on. I asked him if he had any objection to my going down to Dacosta; he said, no I said, what name am I to ask for if I go. He said my name is Johnson. I left him in the watchhouse, and went to Mr. Dacosta's, rung the bell, and two women servant came to the door, they would not let me in; I went again between five and six o'clock in the morning, they spoke to me at the window; I told them they had been robbed; I entered the house, found the windows of the house all safe; we went into the back yard, we found the outer shutter broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. The shutter that was in the yard - A. Yes. We went into the kitchen; we found the frame of the sky-light split: there was an entrance there, so that they could get into the kitchen. I examined the kitchen with the servants; the servants said what they had lost. I went back to the watchhouse, I searched the prisoner's person; I found exactly the money the servants said they had lost; two one-pound bank notes, a three-shilling piece, seven single shillings, and half-a-crown; that was all the money that was lost; he had exactly the money.</p>

            . I went along with Forrester into the watchhouse. I know nothing of the transaction, but, that the prisoner was brought into the watch-house with the other officer; he had the bundles with him; the bundles were examined on his being brought, and his person was afterwards searched.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100012"/>I went to Dacosta's house in company with Forrester.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the house in the state that Forrester has represented - A. Yes, I did. The kitchen goes right along from the passage. I got a pair of steps to get into the kitchen from the yard; the top of the kitchen is tiled; I went out over it. I found some wood, which matched to the place where the sky-light had been broken away; there had also been feet marks in the gutter. On my return from Dacosta's, at the watchhouse, I took this shawl off the prisoner's neck, I took these shoes off his feet, and the pair of stockings from his legs, after he had been examined before the magistrate, the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. In what parish is Dacosta's house - A. In the parish of St. Mary Malfellon.</p>

I saw the prisoner take Mason's watch; the prisoner looked sharply at Mason's breeches; there was a black ribbon hanging out, the prisoner passed by him; and took a second look at Mason's breeches, I withdrew from the prisoner about a yard; he laid hold of the ribbon with his right hand, and

He withdrew from the mob, and turned into the next street; I kept my eye upon him from first to last; I think he took notice of my watching him; he returned back into the mob, and there I lost him. Mason missed his watch, and gave the alarm of being robbed; I said nothing to him. He made an attempt at my jacket pocket first, that induced me to watch him.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember seeing a poney at Mrs. Mitchells - A. Yes, I cannot tell the day of the month. it was a small poney a stone-horse; I sent a man of the name of Hasland he bought the poney for thirty shillings, of Mrs. Mitchell, or there abouts, I saw it delivered to Harland; I saw the poney after Harland had it about fourteen days or thereabouts; afterwards I bought it of Harland myself, I was to give him two guineas for it. I had it about a month, and when it was out one day, a man, Hambridge was going by, he said to me it is my poney, this was about the end of February; he asked me where I had got it, I saw the poney after it was delivered to the officer, I saw it in the street, with Hambridge's letters upon it. I thought the poney was the same that I bought, but I was not sure of it. As I am upon my oath, when I say it is the poney, I mean, I think it is, I had no doubt it is the same poney, none at all, I have never seen the poney since.</p>

I told him he must take it to our house; we had a cask of white pepper, we examined it, and found the cask deficient thirty pounds weight.

            . I live at No. 17, Baltic-street, Old Street-road. On the 24th of April, I lost this wearing apparel particularized in the indictment, at the <placeName id="t18150510-16-crimeloc95">Cross Keys, in Gracechurch-street</placeName>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18150510-16-victim204 t18150510-16-viclabel96"/>. Richards applied to me on the 5th, of April, in consequence of an advertisement I put in the papers; he came to me, and said, he wanted to engage me for a friend of his; he mentioned no name, any more than he said it was at Woolwich. When we came to Gracechurch-street, the prisoner went into the Spread Eagle, and he came out, and said, we must go over to the Cross Keys, the coach is there. I took my box myself; I put my box down on a step at a door, and carried it into the passage of the coffee-room; he asked the waiters if the box would be safe; they said, yes. I left my box in the passage, as the waiters said it would be safe. I sat down on the opposite side to the prisoner; he talked about my character. He called for a glass of negus; he paid for it, and gave the waiter two-pence; presently after, the Woolwich coachman went up the passage, and gave notice that the coach was ready, and asked whose coach I wanted. The waiter came into the coffee-room, and said to Richards, is there a gentleman going to Woolwich; the coachman also said to him, are you going to Woolwich; no, he said; what do you ask me such a foolish question; the coachman took no notice, but left us. The prisoner said, he would go by the next coach, a quarter before eight. He then asked me, if I had any white stockings; (I had boots on,) he said, you will not want boots, as the place I was to go to was a tavern. I told him I had plenty of white stockings. He said, there is one thing yet to be mentioned, that is, have you any white aprons; I said, if I want aprons, I can soon get them. Soon after this, Clark came in with a note to Richards; Richards looked at the note, and asked the prisoner, Clark to come inside the house. By their conversation, I learned that it was a bill. Clark went out; my trunk was still before me. After Clark went out, Richards called for a sheet of paper, and wrote a note, and wished me to take the note to a Mr. Jones, in Bull and Mouth-street, and ask him for his box coat, and in the mean while, he would go into the Poultry to search more into my character. On coming out of the room, he said to the waiter, take care of these things, let nobody have them, (pointing to my trunk,) they will be very safe here, will not they waiter; the waiter said, perfectly safe. We came out of the house together, he to go into the Poultry, and I to Bull and Mouth-street; he stopped at the gateway, and told me not to be long, or else I should lose the coach. I made the best of my way, but could not find Mr. Jones; there was no such person there. I returned back immediately to the Cross Keys, and I found that my box was gone; I went into the coffee-room, and made enquiry; I could not find either of the prisoners, Richards or Clark.</p>


               <p>Q. Did Richards describe who Clark was - A. No. I next saw my box at Bow-street, on the 26th or 27th of April, and all the contents, except a pair of shoes. I lost the things on Monday, the 24th; I gave information of my loss on Tuesday morning; I then went instantly to the Cross Keys to find Richards, I stopped there until near nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been into the tavern at Woolwich - A. No; I never heard any thing of that place since. I saw Richards two or three times between the 10th and the 24th of April, at my lodgings in Baltic-street, he came to me there; I never saw Clark there. Richards came to me there in a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The trunk remained in the same state until you left the coffee-room - A. It did. When we left the house, the waiter took care of it, into his own custody; the waiter's name is

            . I am a waiter in the coffee-room of the Cross Keys. The two prisoners were strangers to me. On the 24th of April, I was in the coffee-room when both Richards and Hodson came in; they brought in luggage; Richards desired me to take charge of the luggage, and asked me if I thought it was safe there; Hodson put it down. I saw Clark come in with a letter, he delivered it to Richards. After Richard had read the letter, he called for a sheet of paper. After this letter was wrote, Hodson and Richards went out; Richards asked me if the luggage would be safe until he returned. Hodson and Richards both went out together. I did not see

             any more. I saw Richards again in about ten minutes, he returned into the coffee-room, and asked me if I could get a porter for him to take the luggage; I got a porter; Richards went away with it. Hodson came back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100016"/>when he returned, he made enquiries for his luggage, and for Richards. Richards never returned. I never saw the trunk again until I saw it at Bow-street; I am quite sure that the trunk I saw at Bow-street, was the trunk Richards and Hodson gave me in charge.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On the 24th of April, about eight o'clock, I saw Richards and Clark in a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Hodson. About what time was it that you get back from Bull and Mouth-street - A. About twenty minutes before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brown. Where is that public-house - A. In Kirby-street, Carnaby market. They had this trunk with them; which was afterwards claimed by Hodson. I had seen Richards before. Richards asked me if I was going home; I told him, yes. He told me he would give me a ride in a coach; he put the box into the coach, he me, and Clark, all three, went into the coach. The box was left at my house; he said, he had got it of a young man, who wanted a waiters place, and he would endeavour to get him a situation. I saw the box opened by Clark and Richards; I do not know which it was that opened it; they were both present the time it was opened; it was corded up; I believe it was not locked; the articles were most of them taken out; on the 25th of April it was opened; they both lodged in my house the night before. The same day it was opened, the 25th, two Bow-street officers came to my house; they took the box and its contents, together with Richards and Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Richards lodge with you before - A. No.</p>

            . I am wife to the last witness. While the prisoners were in my room, Richards asked me if I could dispose of some of the articles. I never saw Clark before, nor Richards but once. They told me the things belonged to themselves; I found by their account, that they did not belong to them. I did not dispose of any of the articles. I met Dickens, the officer, in Church-street.</p>
               <p>- DICKENS. I am a Bow-street officer. I went after some other business to Brown's house. both the Browns gave me information; in consequence of which, I apprehended the two prisoners, Richards and Clark, on a charge of taking this box. I found the prosecutor the next day. I asked Richards and Clark where they got the box; they refused to tell me. The trunk and its contents were claimed by Hodson.</p>
               <p>- BATEMAN. When they were taken, I took a pair of shoes out of Clark's pocket; they were afterwards claimed by Hodson.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The trunk, and the articles are my property.</p>

I followed the man, calling out stop thief; he turned into the road; I laid hold of him, and gave him in charge to the watchman; when I gave him in charge, there was a great hustling about his person; he made away with the handkerchief at that time.</p>

            . I was going home to the King of Prussia, Lower John-street, Golden-square, about five minutes before one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at the bar in King-street; I had never seen him before to my knowledge; he asked me where I was going; I said, home. He said, he would see me home; I told him I could find my way home very well. I am sorry to say, I was very much intoxicated at the time; I had a bundle in my hand with two pair of small clothes, which I had fetched away from Bond-street, they were tied up in an handkerchief. He walked with me, and pulled me about in a very rude manner; he pulled me about, and shoved me against the wall as we went along. I remember being down, but whether he pushed me down, I cannot say; my bundle was dirty; I cannot say whether the prisoner was on the top of me, or I on him, or whether we both fell down together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner intoxicated - A. Not that I know off. The watchman came up, and lifted us up, and want away. We went on together till we came opposite London-street; I wanted to go to King-street; he said, that is the way, and he would see me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him where you lived - A. Not to my knowledge. We went into <placeName id="t18150510-20-crimeloc121">London-street</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. I first saw the prisoner and Beadle together in King-street, Golden-square; I was calling the hour of one. They were by the Red Lion public-house window. I perceived Beadle was intoxicated with liquor. I saw the prisoner handling him by his arms. Beadle said, he had a wife and family, and he wanted to go home; the prisoner said, he would see him home. Beadle had a bundle in his hand. I heard the prisoner say, you had better deliver it to me. When the prisoner saw me take notice of him, he took Beadle across the road; he had got hold of him by the arm. Beadle said, this is not my way home; the prisoner wanted to take him through a court, and put Beadle on before him, and they went on to Lucas-court, which is no thoroughfare. The prisoner said we will go in here, and make water. The prisoner said, you had better deliver it; there were some persons in the court, and I found they both returned again, and moved up King-street about twelve or fourteen yards. The prisoner said, take hold of me by the arm. The prisoner pushed Beadle, and Beadle and the prisoner fell; the prisoner was at the top; I went to their assistance; the prisoner said, help me up, watchman, in a faint manner. When I stooped down to help Beadle up, I saw the prisoner had got part of his bundle, and Beadle had got part in his hand. After I lifted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100018"/>them and I asked the prisoner if I should see him home; he said, no. I kept hack behind, and watched them. I saw the prisoner having Beadle about the waist. Beadle says, what do you want of me; I want nothing of you; I want to go home. The prisoner said he would see him home. The prisoner turned to go on London-street; he had got Beadle by the arm; they went together up London-street; Beadle said, that was not his way home; he wanted to go up King-street. I followed them about three parts of the way up London-street, I saw them turn round the corner into Marlborough-street; I lost sight of them, I waited about a minute; I heard Beadle call out watch three times; immediately I turned the corner into Marlborough-street, and saw Beadle had got the prisoner down. On my coming up, I asked Beadle what was the matter; Beadle said, the rascal has robbed me of my watch. I said, I thought there was something of that kind going forward; I said so in the hearing of the prisoner. I seized the prisoner by the collar; another watchman came up, and seized him also; a third watchman came up, and took Beadle to the watch-house, and we two took the prisoner. On entering into the watchhouse, the prisoner attempted to make his escape, he tore the sleeve of his coat off. Beadle gave charge of him, and I conducted Beadle home. After I had seen Beadle home, I went round with my candle and lanthorn to the spot where we took the prisoner; in an area by the light of the candle, we saw the watch in one part, and the key in another; the glass was broke, and the face also; this was at three o'clock; we went again at five; I, and the beadle of the parish,

We walked together some way; when he gave me a blow, knocked me down; as I was rising, he rushed on me, thrust his hand into my waistcoat pocket, took out the one-pound note and some of the silver; he said, I am out of place, and therefore you must give me some money; this was in Marlborough-street; I called watch; he called watch also. When the watchmen came up, the prosecutor said, this fellow has robbed me of my watch. I was taken to the watchhouse, and from thence to Marlborough-street.</p>

The prisoner said, what money have you in the house; I said, I had two one-pound notes, and two pounds about me in silver.

I found them in Todd's I sent for an officer, the rods are worth thirty shillings; Todd was absent, and the officer found him and took him to Worship-street I received this letter (a letter produced.) by the post mark on the 3rd of May, after he was in, Newgate; I went to Newgate is consequence of this letter, I read the contents of this letter over to him; he said the contents of the letter was exactly the same as he meant to say; (in the letter he confessed the crime of which he was charged.)</p>

               <p>REDFORD BURKER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Redford I am master give the prisoner that gold to work two ounces, three penny weights, on the 3rd of April, he had been working about twelve months before that. He worked that gold out process, is master's shop where he was always accustomed to what he parted it into so many weights, I see him do that I see him heat it on the 4th of April in the morning he went away. On Sunday master sent to know why he had not been at work, I went to his house, I told him, master wanted to know the reason why he had not been at work, he said, he took some gold home, and that he had lost it; that was the reason he had not been to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any licence to work at home, you don't know perhaps - A. I do know that none of master's men work at their own home, they all work in master's shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the gold out of the shop, and put it in my pocket; I went out of the place in a hurry, and I happened to meet with two persons, shopmates, we got drinking such a quantity of liquor, that I was insensible, so that the next morning I played truant, having found I had lost Mr. Redford's gold; I know no more of the gold than Mr. Redford does.</p>

I am a dealer in all kind of things to get my living in an honest way, I heard of a sale of about fifty pieces of print; I asked the man what will you take for one of them, he said five shillings; I bought two pieces, I took them to Mrs. Barrett's she bid me twenty shillings for them, she said Sam I have no money, but I will send to Barrett my relation to borrow; I said Mrs. Barrett will you let me have my handkerchief again in which the print were tied up; she said no, I will not return it, afterwards she did not like the prints, and said, Sam you had better return me the money; I said no, I had sold them, and could not do it; in two or three hours after this, she came with a Police officer and took me into custody.</p>

             that is my name. The prisoner was an out-door clerk; his duty consisted in receiving the bill and cashing them. On the 8th of February, he came home between one and two o'clock, as near as I can recollect; I asked him where his list was, that he had been out with in the morning; he produced his book, which contains the accounts of that day so far as concerned the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it contain the eighty pounds of Greenwood - A. No, it does not; this is his bill list. In this list given him in the morning, the sum of eighty pounds is scratched out. When I saw this bill of Greenwood's not accounted for; I asked what he had done with it, he replied, it was due on the 10th of that month. There were two other bills that were returned; he gave no account of them. The bills speak for themselves; they were put into the box. I supposed the eighty pound bill to have been an undue bill, and to have been put into the box, in order to have been taken out again on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had you any suspicion of the prisoners dishonesty - A. None at all. I took what he said, for granted, and did not go down, and look at the box.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that occured, the prisoner left your service and house - A. He did; in consequence of which, I made enquiry at Greenwood's about the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill - A. This is the bill; the signature is the prisoner's own writing.</p>

I locked the door; left the key in the door. When I came back, I found it locked. I left all the things in the room when I went out very safe. They were all gone when I came back; some were my own, and some I took in to wash to get me a bit of bread.</p>

Some time about Christmas last, my clerk informed me, that I was robbed; he told me, that he had picked up a duplicate in the warehouse. The clerk is here. I went to the pawnbrokers, and there I found a coverlid had been pledged. Some time afterwards, I was going into the counting-house, I observed the prisoner, Church, stooping and peeping into the accounting-house, watching the clerk, who was writing; and a little further on, I found the prisoner Beckenham, behind a bale of goods; he was evidently confused, when I spoke to him; I asked him what he stood there for; he said, he was just come in from attending my riding horse. I was convinced they were then about committing a robbery. After that time, I missed goods in a wholesale way, whole peices of goods. I got an officer to watch, and the first morning the officers came, they detected the two prisoners; I was called up by the maid-servant, and informed, that the two men were in custody. I went down, and saw the two prisoners; I asked Beckenham how he could think of robbing me, when I had been such a good friend to him; I thought he would have protected my property, and not even seen others rob me; he made no answer to that; he hung down his head, and trembled very much. The officer took them away in a coach. My warehouseman is here. The prisoners were taken before the Lord Mayor. By what I found out since, I suppose, I have been robbed of three hundred pounds.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information I received; on Friday, the 7th of April, in the morning, I went to Aldgate pump; there I met Atkinson; there I saw the two prisoners in conversation together; they went down the gate-way close to the prosecutor's house, and went into the warehouse, and in a few minutes after, I saw Beckenham come out with a pail in his hand, he went into the stable with it, and in a short time after, came out again; me and my partner had placed ourselves at a window, which looked into the yard, and as Beckenham came by the warehouse door, I saw him make a motion with his hand, he was up at the top of the gateway, and in a minute, out came Church, with a hamper on his shoulder, I could see by the light, that the hamper, on being put down, contained something white; he took the hamper into the stable, and in about a minute, came out with it empty, and took it again empty into the warehouse. Me and my partner came down stairs directly from the house in which we were; we turned round into the yard; I took hold of Church, took him into the stable: Atkinson took hold of Beckenham, we took them both into the stable; where we found the blankets, close under the horse, two dozen pair of blankets altogether; we took them back into the warehouse, and called Mr. Gunston up; we confined them together, whilst my partner went back into the stable, and found some more goods, of which he will tell you, under the manger, covered over with straw.</p>

               <p>- NESBITT. The prisoners were sent to the watchhouse. Joseph said, he had the hay of his brother, William, the coachman; he went off with the hay, but he meant to return it again.</p>

            . On Monday evening last, I was passing the Surry side of Westminster-bridge, I saw Mr. Boucher about five or six yards from me. I saw him fall with a man, a little before me; Mr. Boucher was at the top; the man who was under, proved afterwards to be the prisoner. I did not know Mr. Boucher at the time. I heard him say, that the man had robbed him of his watch, or that he had lost his watch, I cannot say which. About two yards to the right from where the man and Mr. Boucher fell, I saw a watch; I said, here is your watch; I picked it up; Mr. Boucher was raising himself up, with the man in his custody; I gave the watch into Mr. Boucher's hands. Mr. Boucher then called the watch, and I walked some distance with him before the watchman came up. I saw him give the watchman charge of the prisoner; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100025"/>watchman took the charge; I then accompanied them to the watchhouse, in Westminster; after hearing the charge given in the watchhouse, I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of of the bridge was this on - A. I believe on Parliament-street side.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other people about - A. I suppose there might be fourteen or fifteen, but not very near.</p>

On the evening of the 21st, or the morning of the 22nd of April last, my shop was robbed. About half after five in the morning of the 22nd, I had occasion to go through the shop; I saw the shop in confusion; I suspected it arose from the neglect of my servants; I went to bed again. I returned into the shop a little after eight, the same morning; I was asked by my shopman, if I had moved my lamps; then I perceived that the till had been broken open, and a large glass case that stands on the counter, had all the things moved out, and taken away; an other glass case also had the things moved, and some things taken out; next to the shop is a can, containing oil, that was gone also; then I had a light, and went into the oil cellar, by a trap door from the shop; then we perceived that the iron grating that opened into the street, had been forced open, and the oil cellar in great confusion, and a great quantity of oil spilled about the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trap door fastened, whereby you went from the shop to the cellar - A. That trap door is never locked or bolted; the iron grating in the street must have been opened by violence; there were several pieces of timber forced, as well as the grating. The prisoner was in my service at the time, as a lamp-lighter, he was not working in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time afterwards, find any articles missing from your shop that morning - A. Soon after, in about an hour and a half after, the prisoner came to my shop, for his oil that he was to use that day, the 22nd; it had been his business that night to go about, and see if any lamps were out, and re-light them. I asked him what he had been drinking so soon in the morning, he appeared overcome with liquor; his answer was, he met a friend, and he had been drinking with him; he had got some beer at a night house. Then I sent one of my men to get a constable; in the mean time, I told him that my house had been broken open, and a large quantity of oil taken, and that they had taken away all the lamp-lighters scissars; I suspected it was done by some lamp-lighters, and he was so overcome with liquor, I suspected he was one of them; he said, he knew nothing about it, he should have been a great rogue if he had committed that robbery. I asked him if I should search his lodgings; he consented to it. He sent the constable and my shopman to his lodgings; he told them where his lodgings were. Afterwards, they thought about the key of his lodgings; and returned. We all then went together, and the prisoner unlocked the door; then we went into his room; the first thing I saw was a trimming pot and bottle; the bottle ought not to have been there; we searched about his room. The first things found in his room, were some snuffboxes, taken out of the little glass case; the officer found them; I was present, one metal box, and two japan boxes; I had seen them in the glass case a few days before. The officer searched him, and found twenty-six shillings in his pocket, in silver; among the silver was one shilling which my young man had taken the evening before; I found no scissars.</p>

               <p>Q. You are in a large way of business; it is possible a person may secret himself in your premises - A. No; I always look to the doors before I go to bed.</p>
               <p>- REARDON. I live with Mr. Owen; I am shopman to him. On the over night I went about the shop, and saw the shutters were all safe; I did not go into the cellar; I saw the shop safe about a quarter past nine. I was up the next morning, at seven o'clock; went into the accounting-house, and found that the lamps had been moved from there into the shop; a burner had been moved from the place where it is kept. I went to the glass case, and found it was very much smoked, by a light having been held in it; I observed the till, I thought Mr. Owen had shut it, but not put the lock too; I knew there was some silver in the till, and a book on it; I put them into a tin box; Mrs. Owen put them into the till; I saw neither till nor money. After breakfast, we missed some scissars out of the glass case; the trap door was fastened as usual; I went into the cellar that morning, about nine o'clock, I found it very wet, I thought it was water; it proved to be oil; there was not a great quantity about; there was a great quantity kept there, in twenty large casks; I saw no marks of violence at all. I missed a bottle of oil from the shop, which I had seen the evening before, and I missed from the cellar, two empty bottles, and one full of oil. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100026"/>came into our manufacturing shop that morning, about half after nine; we went to his lodgings; the door was locked, I came back; master, and me, and the officer, and the prisoner, went to his lodgings, at his lodgings I found one metal snuff-box, and one or two other snuff-boxes, japaned; I know them all to be my master's property, they have his private mark upon them; I had seen them in the glass case in master's shop on the evening preceeding, I am sure of that. The officer searched him, and found twenty-six shillings in silver in his pocket, there was one shilling which I had taken the evening before; I put it into the tin box that was in the till, along with the other silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Who goes to the till - A. Mr. Owen, Mrs. Owen, the girl, and myself. I saw it in the till about three o'clock the day preceeding.</p>

The ribbon was sixpence a yard. She told me it was her wedding ring, and not to give it to any one else but to her; she went away then. Merritt was with Mrs. Duddle, and staid in the shop bargaining for a bonnet; Mrs. Duddle could not agree with her, she did not go, before I examined the ring, and found it was not a gold ring; I said, I thought I was deceived. Merritt seemed embarrassed, and confused, and soon after left the shop, without buying any thing. I desired the little boy, that was in the next room, to follow her, to see where she went; he followed her to the George public-house; after he was gone, Mrs. Duddle examined the ribbon drawer; she missed half a piece of white ribbon, seventeen yards, or seventeen yards and a half. Merritt had never been near the drawer where the ribbon was, so that she could not have taken it; they never spoke to one another in the shop at all. The boy returned, and told me that Merritt had gone to the public-house. I immediately went to Hatton Garden office, and got two officers; I went with the two officers in search of Merritt; we went to the George, in Little Saffron-hill; there we found the two prisoners, they were both sitting together; they were taken into custody; the officers searched them, and found the ribbon on

            . I am a tides-man at the Custom House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the ship Aberdeen, when she was in the London Docks - A. I was on board the 4th of February; she was taking in her cargo for Quebec. I saw some cases shipped; at that time, the prisoner, Gooch was a seaman on board; he assisted in loading; there were four cases of jewellery, watches, trinkets, and shells.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know particularly what these four cases contained - A. Not till afterwards; I know now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any marks that were on these cases - A. They were not then marked; I put the marks down; one was marked J. R. No. 3, I took this box myself, on the 13th of April; another J. R. No. 2; and No. 4, Ph. and Co. with the letter M, under Ph. that case contained watches; No. 1, contained trinkets. These cases the prisoner, Gooch, assisted in loading; I think they were taken on board about the 4th or 5th of April; where they were placed, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where afterwards in company with the mate of the ship - A. I went with the mate of the ship the second time, that was on the 13th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not the mate here to-day - A. He is on board. I went with the mate to the forecastle of the ship, that is the prisoner, Gooch's, birth; Gooch was there. The mate searched the boxes; nothing was said to the prisoner as I know of. On that search, we found a one-pound note, and six or seven shillings, in the prisoner's box; we found no goods that we suspected belonged to any body else. The mate asked him what he had taken out of the hold; how he came by the shells; the shells were found on the deck about half an hour before that; the chief mate brought up a pair of shells, and delivered them to me. The chief mate said to Gooch, that he had been robbing the ship; Gooch said, he had not robbed it. I, the carpenter, the chief mate, and my partner, went down the next day into the forecastle; the prisoner was then in the steerage; we took a stick, and found there was something lodged on the steer-bed, below; the chief mate ordered the carpenter to fetch his chissel; the carpenter cut open a hole, through that hole we took out nine witches; they were delivered to me; I delivered them the same day to the officer; I took the numbers of them, On the same day as we found the nine watches, the man prisoner, Gooch, told me, he wished he had mentioned it at first, it would have been better than throwing them down the air holes. The next day, he told me, he had got some other things at his house; he said there were three silver cups, one silver tureen, two ladles, two silver mustard pots and spoons, one dozen table-spoons, one dozen tea-spoons, twenty-eight more watches, some papers of beads, and two clasps, belonging to ladies ridicules, but whether these were gold, or no, he did not know. He asked me to speak to Captain Allen when he came down. I then examined to see if these nine watches that were found, all which were lost, and I found there were only five left. The plate box had been broken open; I examined the other cases, but what was gone out of them, I cannot say; they had all been opened, each of the four.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell from their appearance, whether goods had been taken out of them, or not - A. Yes, goods had been taken out. I remained with the ship until about the 17th of April; the officer took the cases before I left the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not those cases be broken open in the London Dock, during the time they were staying there - A. They might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Gooch - A. About ten days before we left the Dock. Before I had any conversation with the prisoner, I told him it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100028"/>would be better for him to tell me all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th you had this conversation with the prisoner - 
               <persName id="t18150510-37-person413">A. </persName>
            Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When first a search was made for the watches, you did not speak to the prisoner at all - A. No; the conversation on the 13th, was trifling; on the 14th, the captain was gone to town; what he said on the 15th, was in consequence of my encouraging of him to tell the whole truth.</p>

               <p>JOHN GOTTY. I am a Thames Police officer. In consequence of some communication from the ship Aberdeen, on the 15th of April, I searched the premises of Mrs. Garlick, situated at No. 1, Taylor's-court, Shadwell, when I went to the house, I asked her, whether she had not a person lodged with her of the name of Peed; she said, she had no lodgers. I then said, I understand there is a young man on board the ship Aberdeen, that was at your house, is it not so; she said, yes. I told her I must search the room that he had occupied; she shewed me to a room up two pair of stairs. After having examined round, I desired her to bring the keys of some drawers; she did so; she unlocked the drawers herself; in one of the drawers I found a watch; in another drawer, I found two watches; they are three silver watches; I have them in my care. She then begged me for God's sake, not to hurt her; she said, her daughter put them there. I said, what, is your daughter, Peed's wife; she said, yes. I then saw a deal box standing at the feet of the bed, and asked her for the key of it; she said, she had not the key, that her daughter had the key: it was her box, and her daughter was not at home. I broke the box open; in the box I found four silver watches, two metal watches, a gold ridicule clasp, two silver cruets, a silver tureen, and ladle, twelve silver tea-spoons, two silver tablespoons, three silver desert-spoons, two silver mustard pots and spoons, five papers of beads; I opened a pocket-book, containing thirteen pawnbrokers duplicates, they all related to the subject of this indictment. I went away to the office with the things that I had found; and afterwards brought the mother and daughter; when the daughter came into the office, I asked her if that was her box, and for the key; she gave me the key, which unlocked it. I then took the duplicates out of the pocket-book, and looked them over, and such of them as were for wearing apparel, I returned to her; she then told me her husband's name was not Peed, but Gooch.</p>

I shipped fifty-six watches, on board the Aberdeen, they were packed in deal cases, lined with tin; I superintended the packing of them; the case was marked Ph. and Co. with M under it, and No. 4; the case contained nothing but watches. I shipped two other cases on the same occasion, with jewellery and trinkets; I shipped them on board the ship Aberdeen, on the 6th of April. I was afterwards shewn the cases again at the Thames Police office; first the case containing the watches, there remained but fourteen; from the other boxes also various sorts of the trinkets were missing. These watches produced by Gotty, have the same name, as these found in the box; they also all correspond to the numbers. I know none of the articles of plate; the trinkets I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it usual for a foreman to be searched - A. The labourers are searched every day; the foreman only now and then. The prisoner was foreman at No. 6, warehouse of the coffee department; the prisoner had a very good character; he has been at the Docks about seven or eight years. He was at work that day in the coffee warehouse. The coffee is worth about five shillings.</p>
               <p>- SINCLAIR. I am the captain of that warehouse. All the property in it is under my care. We had such coffee as that found on the prisoner in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry; I picked the property up.</p>
               <p>Sinclair. The prisoner had one pound fourteen shillings a week.</p>

I immediately went to my drawers, I looked them over about two hours, it was a large chest of drawers, in hopes of finding the note; I did not look into the drawers until I missed the prisoner, and then I missed the note. I had a man lodger of the name of Thomas Spencer, he went in search of box; he found her on the 13th of April, and brought her home, it was on the 6th of April, when she took the note. I asked the prisoner how she could be so cruel as to take the note; I told her, she was a most base, ungrateful, woman, to take it from me; she said, she was very sorry, she had never had an hours peace since; I should have six pounds for it, in the course of a day or two.

               <p>Q. Who was the constable - 
               <persName id="t18150510-40-person460">A. Robert Lock</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not put the note into the drawer, I put it into my bosom. I had an execution out against me, and I broke into the money to pay it, and if Mrs. Ford would have shewn me mercy, I should have made up the whole five-pounds. The prosecutrix keeps a house of ill fame for girls.</p>

            . As I was coming out of my own door, in Baldwin's-place, at five o'clock in the morning, I met the two prisoners together, they came up to my door; the prisoner, White, asked me, what was o'clock; they had nothing with them as I perceived; I told them they may know what was o'clock, for the clocks were striking five at the time; they walked off, down the road, towards the City-road. I was just coming out to go to Spitalfields market; I followed them down, with my knot and basket on my head. About half way down the road, they made a stop, and seemed to be in deep conversation together; I past them; I conceived all was not right; about twenty yards after I passed them, I stopped; I saw the prisoner, Brooks go over a pailing, and go into the fields adjoining the road, and hand over three coppers, and then returned; White was outside, receiving them of Brooks; the prisoner, White, took two big coppers, put one over the other, and put them on his head; Brooks took the small one with wet linen, on his head. I then slackened my pace, to let them pass me again, with the coppers; when I came to the turnpike, I communicated my thoughts, that all was not right; I communicated them to Billing, at the turnpike-gate; they passed us. We followed them; we afterwards stopped them as Billing has described; I spoke to the prisoner, White, I asked him where he was going with these things; he said, they belonged to his master. I said, you must go along with me, your master must come forward; I do not think you have came by them honestly. When we took White, he took this chissel (produces it,) out of his pocket, and threw it over a carpenter's wall. After we took the coppers off his head, we took the prisoners to the watchhouse; they were delivered to the constable. Mr. Sandham lives in Craven-street, City-road, the back part of the house comes into the the field that Brooks went over, and handed the coppers to White; it was all done in the course of five minutes; the coppers were close to the pales.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a copper - A. Yes, in the washhouse, that adjoins the back part of the house. On Friday, the 7th of April, I used that copper to boil the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100031"/>clothes; the linen and the copper both belonged to me. I saw the copper safe on the 7th of April, it was affixed in the washhouse, in brick work; I saw it about ten o'clock in the evening. On Saturday morning, about six o'clock, my husband went into the washhouse, and missed the copper. About two hours after that, Mr. Baker came. I saw my copper afterwards at Worship-street, I knew it to be mine, by two small holes in the side of it; these holes had been there some time; the washhouse window was broken into, and the copper taken out of the brick work.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. I am a constable. This copper and the prisoners were delivered into my custody at the watchhouse; I received them from Billing and Cook. The copper that Mrs. Sandham claimed, was one of the coppers brought into the watchhouse with the prisoners. I fitted that copper to Mrs. Sandham's washhouse; Sandham's house, the back of it adjoins the fields, a little way out of the road; it is in the parish of Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Brooks's Defence. I was along with White; I saw the coppers lying on a dust hill; we agreed to take them to the first public-house, and in the morning enquire for the owners of them.</p>
               <p>- SMART. On this Saturday morning, I expected White to come as usual to work; he did not; he is a journeyman baker.</p>

            ; I told him no; my name was Eleanor. He asked me whether my husband ever worked in the City when he was alive; I told him yes; I told him he helped to point down Drapers Hall, when it was repaired. He said, he had come to do a great deal of good for me, there was a great gathering made; he said Mr. Wilson, Mr. Taylor, and he, had been buying blankets, rugs, and flannel for petticoats; he said, they gave them away to distressed widows and housekeepers; and he said, they had been about again, and found in many cases that what they had given, were made away with. He said, charity was very much abused; I cried, and said, what a pity. He said, they had now made up their minds to pay poor peoples debts. He asked me for a sheet of writing paper; I gave him one; he then asked for a knife, and cut it in two; then he asked me to give him a chair and a pen and ink, and then bid me shot the door. Then he wrote six or eight lines on a piece of paper; he asked me to put my name to it; I told him I could not; I had lost the use of my hands, by the rheumatic gout; I could not get a bit of bread. He told me to take the pen, and put a cross; which I did. He asked me whether I was in debt with my landlord; I told him, yes, I owed him eight guineas. I told him, that I had learned that I was over head and ears in debt with King's taxes, I told him, I owed five pounds sixteen shillings, and eight guineas. He said, that should be paid, and if I owed any more small debts they should be paid. He asked me what I had got towards it; I told him two one-pound notes, and some silver, I could not tell how much. He asked me to let him look at the two one-pound notes; I put them on the table; he took them in his hand, and said, he would direct a paper, and Mr. Wilson, Mr. Taylor, and himself, will also be with you. I cried very much to the prisoner, and I said, how good God is, to send me an unknown friend. He put this paper in my hand, and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. What, he went off with your notes, did he - A. Yes, he did. He said, put your silver with your notes, and I will be with you in a short time; he gave me this paper, opened the latch of the door, and went out. Instead of my notes, he left me this paper, with something wrote inside. The prisoner was taken up for tricking Mrs. Martin, of Peter-street; I went with her to Newgate, to see if he was the same man that robbed me; when I saw him in Newgate, I said, oh, you villain! you are the man that robbed me. That is the man at the bar.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of April, about seven in the evening, I was at St. Giles's church; I perceived the prisoner in company with four others; in consequence of suspicion, I watched them, and followed them into the Strand. When the prisoner came to the prosecutor's house, they all walked to and fro a number of times; I was on the opposite side of the road, watching them. Two of them went up to the prosecutor's door, and the other three to the window; the one with the prisoner, who made his escape, he was a great deal younger than the prisoner; he accompanied the prisoner to the door, and took off the gingham, and the prisoner received it in his apron: the other then ran off; and the prisoner when he had delivered it into his apron; he made off also; I followed him; I crossed the street instantly, and caught hold of the prisoner's collar; he threw down the piece of gingham into the street, out of his apron; I secured him; I had a good deal of trouble before I secured him. I left the prisoner in the custody of a gentleman at a stocking shop, and went, and picked up the piece of gingham out of the street, where the prisoner threw it down. I took the prisoner and the goods to Mr. Todd, he said, it was his.</p>

I knew her some years before he had her, she was a ladies maid, and house-keeper in a gentleman's family; part of her time she followed the millinery and mantua making business, and she was a laundress; after he married her, she was obliged to do any thing, because he could not maintain her; they lived together upwards of two years after he married her, they lived together up to the present time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your shop - A. I do, on the 3rd of May he came in and asked if we sold table knives and forks; I told him we did; he said he had been recommended by Roberts and May, because they had no goods to suit him; he desired two dozen table knives and forks, two dozen desert, also two pair of covers, to send them to Mr. Parsons, Hanover-street, Hanover-square, past the church; he desired a bill and receipt to be sent with them; he said, he was only a servant; he had not the money, or he would pay for them. I was not well satisfied, and I took the goods myself to Mr. Parsons, where he had ordered them; I there saw a servant; she told me there was no such thing ordered there. I desired her to ask Mrs. Parsons, and she sent back the same answer. When I was returning with the knives, I saw him waiting at the corner of George-street, Hanover-square, he was standing; I conceived he did not notice me. I returned home, and desired Samuel Hains, the boy, who is here, to take back part of them, thirty-seven knives, and thirteen forks, and go with them to the door of Parsons; Hains took them, and I followed him; I observed the prisoner meet him in George-street, he spoke to him; they walked a little way together; he spoke to the boy again, and took the goods from him; I then ran up, and secured him; I brought him home into our shop, and Mr. Peachey soon went with him to Marlborough-street office.</p>

            . I was employed by the last witness to carry some knives and forks to the door of Mr. Parsons Hanover-street, Hanover-square; as I was going along George-street, the prisoner came to me, and said, a pretty fellow your master is, not to send the knives before; he said, come along; I followed him a long way towards Dr. Parsons's house; then he turned about, and took the parcel from me; he said, come along, he was before me; then Mr. Huxley came up, and collared him, and took him to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got from you before Huxley came up - A. Not above two or three yards.</p>

She went to her box, fetched a fruit knife and a tea-spoon, and asked me to pledge them for her, she had no money to buy tea and sugar; I pledged them at Mrs. Fothergill, in Aldersgate-street, for four shillings; she had then been at Mrs. Clarke's about a fortnight as near as I can say.

             was trying peoples pockets outside; when Davis took this handkerchief, Allen was engaged in other pursuits of a similar kind, further off; I do not think he saw Davis do this act. I am sure Davis took the handkerchief out of Mr. Parry's pocket.</p>

            . I am a bookseller in Bridge-street Westminster. Between the 13th and 15th of March, I purchased this book of the prisoner, he said it was his own; in a short time after this his aunt called on me to enquire if I had bought a Bible of the prisoner, I told her I had; I afterwards delivered her the Bible, in consequence of her saying it was her property, and he had taken it from her. I am sure this is the Bible, I bought of the prisoner. I gave him the full value of it, as he appeared distressed.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This Bible is my property, I never gave him any reason to suppose he should have it; it was is grandmother's Bible, after his grandmother's decease it was his mother's it then became mine.</p>

He came into the shop, asking for an ounce of tobacco, I told him we did not sell it, and pointing to a shop opposite where they sold it; he went over, I saw him cross the way; in a few minutes I saw him walk by the door, and look in, at last I had some suspicion, as I had lost some bacon on the Saturday before, I kept out of his sight concealed, he walked backwards and forwards, he had a bag under his arm; at last nobody appearing to him to be in the shop, he stole the bacon, put it into his bag, and walked off. I pursued him, in about an hundred yards I laid hold of him; I said my friend, walk back, he went back, he had the bacon under his arm covered with the cloth, he laid it down on the bench, I got a constable and he was secured; the bacon is worth ten shillings.</p>

I immediately made the best of my way to the person I received the check from, in Wild-street Lincoln's-inn-fields, it was for seven pounds sixteen shillings; I had also a bill in the pocket book due for thirty two pounds ten shillings, I have not put it in the indictment; there were in the pocket book a two pound note, and a one pound note. Mr. Harper's young man made the best of his way to Catherine-street in the Stsand; and I followed him. I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody of Mr. Harper's young man, and Mr. Hodsell, coming up Catherine-street, they were taking him to Bow-street; immediately I saw him I said, that is the man, I will swear to him; Mr. Hodsell had the check in his hand, he said here is the check; Mr. Harper's young man took the check from Hodsell, that check was part of the contents of the pocket book. He was taken to Bow-street, and committed. The check is the only thing I found.</p>
               <p>- . In consequence of what I had learnt from Mr. Northgate, I went to Hodsell's and Stiring, the bankers, immediately; I saw the prisoner in the banking-house, he had already presented the check for payment; I spoke to the cashier to stop a check of the name of Northgate; the cashier said, this is your check; he had it in his hand; I stopped it; the prisoner said, he had just picked it up, with some other papers, he had not brought them with him; he never produced the other papers. He told the officer where he lived; he wanted Mr. Northgate to go into a house with him; Mr. Northgate would not consent. The check I have got in my possession now; I know the check; it is my master's hand writing.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. On the 2nd of May, I went down to Harlow Green Fair. I saw the prisoners at the bar, in company with two others, and watched them afterwards; the other two that escaped, stopped before Munroe, and the two prisoners went behind Munroe; Tachary put his hand into Munroe's pocket; the other covered him at the same time; he hid him as much as he could from me. Tachary unbuttoned his trowsers, and put the handkerchief inside his trowsers. I told Munroe he had had his pocket picked; I was alone by myself; I caught the two prisoners. On searching Walker, I found this handkerchief on Walker; I found the prosecutor's handkerchief on Tachary, and two others. Walker said, Tachary picked pockets, and gave him the things.</p>

The prisoner was in the tap-room in my company. I was serjeant in the 13th regiment. The prisoner's husband was a private in the same regiment. I met this woman accidently, and asked her to go and drink with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she known in the regiment - A. Yes, very well. I got change while she was drinking with me, for a twenty-pound note; they were told over to me by the landlord and landlady, both; I was counting them; the landlord said, are they right; I said, they were; the prisoner said, she would count them, and she took them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You let her take them, and count them - A. Yes. She said she would put them into my pocket; she walked away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her go away with them - A. She must go away with them; they never were in my pocket; she came round to my left hand pocket, and pretended to put them into my pocket; she went away from me to go home; I did not go with her. She never put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You were drunk, were not you - A. I had been drinking that day. I never got my money again; this was on the 28th of April. On the 29th of April, about half after nine in the morning, she came to the door, and called me, and offered me two pounds fifteen shillings in silver, and seven pounds in notes; such as they are, the constable has got them.</p>

I took the prisoner up; I had a warrant to take the prisoner up; when I took her up, she pulled out these notes, which I now produce, torn to pieces; five one-pound notes, and a two-pound note. She said, she would sell every thing, her ring, and her clothes, if Stanhope would not prosecute her; I did not suffer it.

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 9th of May, I was standing behind my father's counter; the tin kettle was on the threshold of the door with other things. As I was standing there, I saw Alexander, the prisoner, come to the door, and with his left hand, he took this kettle off from the threshold of the door, and turned it into his right; then I thought he would come in, and ask the price; the price was on it; instead of that, in the course of a minute or two, he went off with it. I then pursued immediately after him, laid hold of him about the distance of forty yards from my father's house, and took the kettle away from him, and took him into custody; it is my father's sole property; I only work as a journeyman to my father. I delivered the prisoner to Kennedy, the officer.</p>
               <p>- KENNEDY. I took care of the prisoner and the kettle; I searched the prisoner, and found three pennyworth of copper in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Brick-lane, and there was a man hanging up these kettles about three yards from the shop, and I went up to them, and took this down with an intent to buy it.</p>
               <p>James Saunders. It was on the threshold of the door; I put it there myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

I missed three three-shilling tokens from the till, on Friday last, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I had five, and I lost three; I had seen the till about five minutes previous to missing them. The prisoner was in the habit of coming into the bar, whenever he came; I had known him ever since I lived there, four or five months; he was no relation, a mere customer. I had occasion to leave the bar, and the till was unlocked, and the bar door not shut; he was against the tap-room door when I left the bar; I left it for a few minutes, when I returned, I did not find any body in the bar; I examined the till a few minutes after, and found three of the five tokens were gone; when I perceived the three tokens were gone, the prisoner was with me in the bar; he came in after I had returned to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, you had missed any three-shilling tokens - A. No; I sent for an officer without acquainting him; I had done so. The prisoner went from the bar to the tap-room; he was in the tap-room when the officer came; I mentioned my suspicions to the officer. The officer called the prisoner into the parlour, behind the kitchen, and told him, I suspected he had taken three tokens; he said, he had not. I missed money before, and therefore I put a mark on this money, that I might be able to identify it; I marked this money with a cross on the head, I marked them all in that way. The officer searched him. I had given him no change that day. I was by when he was searched; the officer found three three-shilling tokens.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked as you had marked your money in the till - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe them to be your's - A. Yes I did.</p>

               <p>- HOLT. I was the officer sent for to take this man into custody. In the parlour I challenged him with robbing Mrs. Mitchell of three three-shilling pieces; he was intoxicated, but he knew what he was about; he denied it, I found four three shilling peices, three of which were described by Mrs. Mitchell; I found one shilling besides.</p>

            . I belong to the Police office Bow-street. I was going up Holborn on Wednesday the 10th of May about a quarter past eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner walking before me nearly seven yards, I did not know him before. He had got this pot of honey wrapped up in his great coat, and this cloth hanging about six inches from the great coat. I saw him lift it up two or three times under his arm, apparently as if it was heavy. With that I stepped up to to the prisoner and asked him what he had got there he told me he had got something that he had brought from his sisters, No. 330, Holborn-bars, I asked him what the things were, he said, he had come honestly by them, he was going to take them to his brother; I told him I must see what it was, so he might as well tell me; when he found I was going to examine the bundle, he told me it was a pot of honey. I told him he must go along with me to his sisters, for I did not believe the story he had told me was correct. As I was crossing the road towards Turn-stile, I told him he might as well tell me the truth, he told me he brought it from Mr. Corbyn's. I then took him to the office; I searched him, but found nothing particular about him. I afterwards went to Mr. Corbyn's with the honey, and it was claimed. The apprentice was watching him the whole of the time, but being a quaker he did not swear to it.</p>
               <p>- TEARING. This honey is the property of Mr. Corbyn, I am sure it came from the shop, twenty-seven pounds, it is worth about thirty-one or thirty-two shillings; there was such a not missing; the hand writing of young Mr. Messer is on it, it was on it when it was taken.</p>

            . The first attempt to take the chest was at the bottom of Skinner-street, just by Fleet market; I said to my fellow servant, there is something the matter. These chests were secured by a rope, well tied in, as soon as ever he put the chest on the truck, I said hold fast, because he was not used to it. I then went behind and saw the rope was cut, the top chest was off the truck, it might have fallen, or it might have been taken off, I cannot say which. I put the chest up well safe again, I fastened the rope, and was obliged to keep a sharp eye on it.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you distinguish any persons near the truck - A. The two prisoners were the only, two persons that I saw, I cannot swear to their faces, they seemed to be the only persons that were watching the truck; then I got a lift behind a dray which pulled me up Holborn-hill. When I got to Middle-row Holborn, I said to my fellow servant again, there is something the matter, then I perceived that the rope was nearly cut through, there were still some persons near the truck, I could not distinguish who they were it was very dark, it was eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be the same two persons that were about the truck when the chest fell off at the end of Fleet-market - A. They did. We went on till we got to the end of Southampton-street, Bloomsbury-square, then I let go the dray, and turned to go up Southampton-street; I said to my fellow servant, there is something the matter now; then I went behind, and found the ropes cut again; the one who I think was Osborne, who had a white apron on, was watching me, whilst I tied the chest, leaning on a post, and his companion with him. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100041"/>fastened the rope, and went on into Russell-square, I left the truck to go and see which way the numbers went; the instant I was going away from the truck, two gentlemen came up to me, and asked me if any thing had been the matter; I was not ten yards from the truck; I said, our rope has been cut all the way; they said, we are two officers. We then went, and delivered all our tea safe and well.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you never lost any one of the chests - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any chest lifted from the truck, though it was not taken away - A. I rather suppose so, at Fleet-market, but I did not see it.</p>

            . On the last day of the former sessions, I saw these two men, when I turned the corner of the Old Bailey, in Newgate-street, I observed Osborne follow the truck down Snow-hill; when they got about half way down Skinner-street, Osborne came to the truck, cut the rope, and took hold of the chest, but it being heavy, he let it fall; they after that, followed the truck up Holborn-hill, and when they got just opposite Red Lion-street, Osborne cut the ropes again, and pulled the chest nearer the back of the truck. When they got into a street near Russell-street, the men with the truck stopped, and one went away from the truck; I went to him, and asked him if he had not the ropes cut; he said, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Osborne take hold of the chest near Red Lion-street - A. He put his arms round the chest, and pulled it from the middle of the truck, near the back part, so as to make it convenient to take off. Ellingham was not near the trunk at all, but all the way along went on the pavement. This was the top chest; he might have drawn it out about a couple of feet; this chest was a common size.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it out of the City of London - A. It was. I did not immediately lay hold of them; I followed them back. I am sure Ellingham was in company with Osborne at the time the ropes were cut. I followed them back into Holborn, and did not take them till I got into the City.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say that Osborne had cut the ropes in the City of London; you did not take them then into custody - A. I did not; I knew well that he would follow the truck again.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a felony committed, and yet you did not take them - A. I thought it was my duty to follow him still further.</p>
               <p>Q. Ellingham was on the foot-path - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw Osborne attempt to move the chest - A. In Russell-square, he took a knife out of his jacket pocket, opened it, and cut the rope.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you saw Osborne take hold of the chest, and remove it to other part of the truck; why did not you stop him at that moment - A. He let it fall.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the last attempt - A. That was in Red Lion-street; I was close to him, not a dozen yards off; I kept my eye close upon him; he knew my brother officer, Matthews, better than me.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not take the chest off, or carry it away - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been a consultation among the Justices, whether this was a felony in London or in Middlesex - A. Yes, there has.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City, I was in company with Johnson in Newgate-street; I saw Osborne and Ellingham looking in at a picture shop, I knew Osborne very well. I crossed the way, and then the truck came down Newgate-street. I kept behind Johnson, and followed it pretty close; I saw Osborne go up to the truck in Skinner street, nearly to the bottom of the hill; Ellingham was in the foot path; I saw two men having charge of the truck at the front drawing it, Osborne was dressed like a porter, with a velvet jacket and an apron about him. I saw the chest of tea tumble from the truck, and he went away, I did not see his arms about it then. I was not so near to the truck as Johnson. Osborne knew me well to be a constable, that was my reason for keeping more aloof. Osborne then joined company with Ellingham. The men stopped, and tied the chests on again; Osborne and Ellingham stopped standing against Fleet-market, the truck went right up Holborn-hill, tied behind a dray; the prisoners went up on the left hand side of the way, and I kept on the right. Just near to Red-lion-street, I saw Osborne go up to the truck again; Ellingham was then on the pavement; I saw the sides of the truck give out directly the ropes had been cut; I saw Osborne's arms around the chest of tea, and pull it towards the back of the truck; by the weight being increased at the back of the truck I could see the handle move up a bit, the man turned around, and Osborne left the truck, she went on turned up a Court, and came into the street again, and met Ellingham again and joined his company. They stopped there a good bit, and then walked up and down the path way, and stood against the railing while the men who had the care of the truck were tying the ropes again. The truck went on, and the two prisoners at the bar followed it till, it got to Russell-square, and then I told the men to keep one behind and the other before, and we would take care of the prisoners; the prisoners went down Holborn, and we took them in Holborn; Osborne had this knife in his night hand pocket. I did not take Ellingham; I knew he had no knife about him.</p>

On the 1st of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, this boy stole a piece of print; I was taking the prints in from the door, it being late; I had taken about twenty pieces in, and came out for the remainder, and saw the prisoner at the bar, with a piece under his arm, about a yard from the pile; I asked him what he was doing; he said, he was only looking at the print; I told him it was a rum way of looking at it. I laid hold of him, and took him into the shop, and Mr. Jones sent for an officer. He put his hand into his pocket, and pulled something out, opened his hand, it was a pound note, which I kept. The officer searched him, and found nothing on him, except a few halfpence.</p>
