            . I am father to the prosecutor; my son came to me and told me he missed a piece. He, by hunting about, found it concealed. Then I said be sure you see it every day: when he missed it he told me, then I went and took the prisoner into a room, and tax'd him with it. He said take care of my character, I never was a thief. But at last, finding me resolute, he told me he would fetch it, which he did: this is it. The next day he said he would take his oath on the book, never to do so no more. We always took him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mrs. Curtain in White-Chapel, asked me, if we had any callimanco which was very good, I said yes. She desired me to bring it for her to look at it. I asked her what time I should bring it. On the Monday morning I had some yarn to be carried to be scowered at a Dyer's. I looked among the goods, and happened to find this piece. I took it and put it among the yarn, and carried it to show her. I left the yarn at the Dyer's, and carried the piece, but she was not at home; then I carried it to my own house; then I went out with two bills, and left one for acceptance, the other I took the money and brought it to my master, which was 10 l. Then my master's father took me into a room, and asked me what I had done with that piece of callimanco that I had taken away. I said I had carried it to my own house, and went and fetched it, and told my wife if the gentlewoman came, to tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060002"/> her the price; and that I should be at dinner. After that, my master and I <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> the other end of the town, and din'd a pipe together. After which Lombard-street, where I acceptance for the m I went a the prisoner 18 en he was servant had the business his ut four days before the called upon usual, I been a customer to his master Richardson. asked me if I wanted any thing in his way. said if you have my callimanco of the best sort would see he said he had not, but would some as soon as he had. On the morning following, he brought a black piece of callimanco to my house as I was told, but I was not at home, then he left word he would ca it to his own house, and I might call there d see it. I went over and look'd at it, and asked the price, his wife said 2 s. per yard was the lowest price her husband's master would take. said I thought 22 d. was a good price. She said if you'll be so kind as to go to his master's house may be we might agree.</p>

               <p>Mrs Richardson. The prisoner served me 11 years as my fore-man, when I carried on the trade as the prosecutor does: I have trusted him to carry out bills: he has received a hundred, or a hundred and 50 l. a month for me.

There were some halfpence in my pocket which were lost. When they were going to lick me the second time, I desired they would let me get my cloaths and my money, they carried me on the deck again, and for this quarrel they sent me here; it was not at all on the account of tobacco.</p>

               <p>John Wimble. The two prisoners came into the house where I was drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Where.</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. It was at the Chequers in the Ambury.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. This was on the last Lord-Mayor's day at night; I went with them from the Chequers to a room belonging to one of them about 11 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the Chequers ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I believe I went in there between 7 and 8.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoners come into your company?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I believe that was hard upon ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I lost ten 36 s. pieces, 19 guineas, and 4 half guineas; it was wrapt up in a rag, one piece over another, and put into an old silk handkerchief, and put into my fobb-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had this money in your pocket when you went into the Chequers ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had it when the prisoners came into your company?</p>

             I fell asleep, and I awak'd between 4 and 5 the next morning, then my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoners when you awaked ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. McCay was in the room with me, but the other was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any of your money since ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. No, not one shilling of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did McCay say for herself when you said your money was gone?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. She said Hush; and immediately fled out of the room, and was taken at the Coach and Horses in King's-Street; we took her before Justice Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say there?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. She said,

Then he sent out Lee for a pot of beer and a halfpenny candle, she came and returned the two-pence-halfpenny to him.</p>
               <p>Lee's defence. We had some gin together, after that he gave us a pint of beer, then he follow'd us home, and toss'd down a six-pence, and sent for a pot of beer and a halfpenny candle.

               <p>William Blincow. I have looked after Mrs Catherine Talbot's sheep a good many years. There were some lost about the beginning of last Sept. they were found in another man's field; it is impossible to say the exact time they were lost, for they lie upon <placeName id="t17581206-10-crimeloc53">Uxbridge common</placeName>

I was sent for to see them in this field; there were 5 but 2 of them, I had mark'd my self, I swear but to them, they are both ewes, one a large ewe lamb of the last year.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they mark'd?</p>
               <p>Blincow. The ewes were mark'd on their heads with ruddle, the lamb was not; I had crop'd that's ear, and the ewe also; that is I flit the near ear of each, the lamb was almost flit down. I found them branded with a pitch mark on the near side: I know nothing against the prisoner: how

            . I am constable: I took up the prisoner with a warrant, and carried him to my house; there he said, if we would come along with him he would show us where the lock was. We went with him to his sister's room in Drury-Lane, there he took out the lock from a drawer and gave it to me, and it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I served that master ten years and three months, and I took this lock on purpose to learn my business.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you engage to teach him to make locks?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No: I did not, I make iron chests: locks is another branch: I do not make locks.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you say you would forgive me, if I would tell you where the lock was?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Upon my oath I never told him any such thing. I said, I am sorry I am oblig'd to come after you in this manner: the less trouble you give me, the better it will be for you. He began to be in a passion, and gave me bad language, and said there where more locks in England than mine. At last, he told me he had taken it, and it was at his sister's room.</p>

            . The prisoner and I were at Guildhall together.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. He is a gentleman's servant out of place. Then the prisoner and I went to drink together, we went to the two Blue Posts in Bunhill-Row, into a one pair of stairs room; we had a tankard of beer, I was there about a quarter of an hour; I remember the maid opening the beaufet, and gave us out two plates, we had some meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what was in the beaufet?</p>
               <p>J. Madison, No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Humphreys. When the beaufet was opened, could they as they sat observe the plate in it?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. They were in sight of all the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Madison. Did you observe that the door was lock'd?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. I know she open'd it with a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that she turn'd the key afterwards ?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. I did not observe that: as soon as as I had dined, I went down stairs, and went to the fire, it was very cold; I staid by the fire about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no fire in the club-room?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. No: after I went up the prisoner went down, then I call'd the people up to pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060010"/>Q. How long did you stay after you went up stairs again?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. We did not stay above five minutes after that, we both went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the time was it that he went down and left you in the room?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. He went down to go into the yard after I went up; I had ordered Mr Wood's nephew to bid my countryman meet me at such a place in the Strand, by that means they found me; we had a search warrant and searched the prisoner's lodgings, but nothing was found; and Dr Blackwell and I were discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you call him doctor?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. He is a Surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was not there another person in the room besides us three?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. Yes: there was an acquaintance of Mr Wood's that lodges in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the room?</p>
               <p>J. Madison. He just came in, but did not stay a moment.</p>

            . On the 28th of October, Mr Peters call'd upon me, to desire I would go with him to Guildhall, he had summoned a person there; when I came into the court, Mr Madison was there; after the trial was over, we came back again; Madison ask'd me to go and see an acquaintance of his at Mr Wood's. I told him I could not possibly go with him there, having business that would take me up above an hour. I told him I would come in about an hour's time. When I found they did not call upon me, I went to the house; when I came there, I ask'd Mr Wood's daughter-in-law, whether there were two gentlemen in the house? she told me there were not two, one was gone, the other was above stairs; I went up, there was the prisoner with a pint of beer before him. I ask'd him how he came to stay? he said, he came back on purpose to wait for me, as I had promised him to come. I told him, I could not stay in the room upon any account, the room being white washing; he went down stairs and paid for his pint of beer, and came up again; I said I would not stay, when I came to the bottom of the stairs, I saw a silver tankard on the table, I spoke four or five times, at last Mrs Wood's daughter spoke; I said, you have workmen about, and there stands a silver tankard. She said we looked like gentlemen, we do not mistrust you.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known him before?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. Yes, I had; he had dwelt with me before, my young man served, I was in the back shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come in?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. No, but I observed him when he was in; I perceived a little sort of a catch he made use of with his hand, as he was dealing with my young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other customers there at the time.</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. No, there were not. My young man served him with two or three sorts of ribbons.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by this twitch with his hand?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. It was a little sudden move of his hand, which gave me to conjecture he had a design to take something, that occasioned me to go into the shop; then came in other customers, but still I watched him. As I served them, I observed my young man had two drawers out, one near the prisoner, and the other near my young man, on the counter; I saw the prisoner had two or three pieces in his hands, done up in rolls as they usually are; one of which he dropt short of the drawer which was near him, the other he put into the farther drawer; my young man and he were opposite each other with the counter between. This I saw was done quick, by that dropping into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060011"/> wrong drawer, gave me a suspicion that he had a design for that piece (it was pink coloured). I went then upon the stairs, as if going up stairs, and looked through the bannisters on the top of the stairs: the bannister twists round and comes part over the shop, so that I had a good view of him and the drawer; I saw the piece of pink colour'd ribbon lying on the top of the others; I saw the prisoner look round him, and make another twitch, and instantly the pink ribbon was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his hand in the drawer ?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. I did, but it was done so instantaneously, that I cannot say how.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. I believe there were about 18 yards of it; I then went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go up when you saw it gone?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. I was in some little manner of fright, and there I consulted another of my servants about what was best to be done. We concluded it proper to send for a constable, I sent for one, when I came down again, the prisoner was buying in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner buy any?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. Yes, he bought some sattin ones. Presently came in the Constable, Mr Adamson whom I sent for him, my father, and a neighbour. My father laid hold on one of the prisoner's arms, and I the other, and we took him into the back shop; there the prisoner shuffled with the arm that my father had hold on, and had got 4 pieces from his cloaths somewhere, into his hand.</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. Was the piece of pink any one of them?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he bought any of them?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. No, he had not. The 4 pieces produced. Then I desired he might be searched, and I walked away at the time; I having to my servant mentioned the piece of pink coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about the four pieces?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. He said these I'll pay for, in broken English, or was going to pay. The pink piece produced. This the constable took out of his pocket, but he is gone into the country. Here are the other witness that saw him take it out; it contains 18 yards, I have great reason to think this is the same piece that I saw thro' the bannister. There was but this one of this quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do all these pieces contain?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. About 60 yards; they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your young man's name that was serving him?</p>
               <p>J. Bennett. His name is

               <p>Q. You mentioned four pieces in his hand: were they concealed?</p>
               <p>Bennett. He had nothing in his hands, when we laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he have secreted those pieces without your seeing him?</p>
               <p>Bennett. I was not observing him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of 1 l. II s. being paid for those ribbons?</p>
               <p>Bennett. I think he laid out about 26 s. at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of ribbons were sold him?</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr Bennett: the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, I think on the 3d of November, and ask'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060012"/> to see some ribbons; he usually came once or twice a week; I show'd him some: I open'd two or three drawers, and cut him several six yards, in a quantity to the amount in the whole of 1 l. 11 s. and three half-pence. There were none larger than six yards; I remember there was one of two yards and a half, being a remnant; he paid me the money, and the three half-pence I bated; after that, he desired to see some black ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any pink among the quantity you sold him?</p>
               <p>Cook. No: there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner take any?</p>
               <p>Cook. No: I did not. I observ'd my master go up stairs and come down again, and Mr Adamson went out. I was still showing him the black ribbon; presently came in my master's father, the constable, and a neighbour. My master laid hold on one of the prisoner's hands, and his father the other, and carried him backwards; but by the time they got him into the back shop, he had struggled, and got one had loose, there I saw four pieces in it: the same that my master produc'd here. My master desired he might be search'd, and went out: then the constable pull'd out a piece of pink ribbon from out of one of the prisoner's pockets. It was a great pocket, which he had by the side of a horseman's coat. He looks at it. This is it. It is my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not sold him that ribbon?</p>
               <p>Cook. No: I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say about the four pieces in his hand?</p>
               <p>Cook. He said, I'll pay for them; but this piece of pink he said he had paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he paid you for any of those goods here produced?</p>

               <p>Cook. No: he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it is there?</p>
               <p>Cook. Here is near sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth?</p>
               <p>Cook. We cut them all at 6 d. per yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before my Lord-Mayor?</p>
               <p>Cook. I was: the prisoner said the same there, as at our shop; that he had paid for the piece of pink, and intended to pay for the four other pieces. After we had sent for a coach to go before my Lord-Mayor, he begg'd he might not be prosecute, and that he would pay him for all this ribbon what my master desired; he said he had a wife and some small children, and hoped on their account he would not prosecute him.</p>

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you conclude, that when a person is charged with an offence of this sort, he would much rather pay for these pieces of ribbons than be prosecuted?</p>
               <p>Cook. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you make up the several items ?</p>
               <p>Cook. He bought some at 5 s. and 9 d. and some at 5 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you make up the sum of 1 l. II s. and three half-pence, without this piece of pink?</p>
               <p>Cook. If I was to put that to it, it would make much more: I can't recollect all the several pieces that he bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut him two yards, and four yards, at 5 s. and 6 d. per dozen?</p>
               <p>Cook. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut him four pieces at 5 s. and 9 d. a dozen?</p>
               <p>Cook. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut him three pieces at 5 s. and 9 d. a dozen? Cook. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that sum total amounts to 1 l. 2 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any more you cut him?</p>
               <p>Cook. I cannot: neither should I those, had they not been mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this piece of pink, if it came to 8 s. 7 d. 1/2 would make it amount to I l. II s. I d. 1/2.</p>
               <p>Cook. He neither bought nor paid for that piece of pink. I cannot recollect the things he did buy: he and I cast them up and he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it in writing?</p>
               <p>Cook. I did it with a pencil on a piece of waste paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that paper? that would have been material.</p>
               <p>Cook. I did not preserve it. I can speak as certain as to the pink, as if I had preserv'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any piece of ribbon he bought of you, that makes up the money 1 l. II s. and three half-pence, without including that pink?</p>
               <p>Cook. I cannot. I can be so exact as to say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060013"/> he never did buy above six yard in one piece of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a coat had he on?</p>
               <p>Cook. He had a great coat hung loose on his shoulders, with his arms not in his sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put the parcels in that coat pocket that he paid for?</p>
               <p>Cook. No: they were all lying on the counter at the time they took him from that counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say the goods he bought came to I l. II s. and three halfpence?</p>

               <p>Cook. I can.</p>

               <p>Adamson. I am journeyman to Mr Bennett. We had often suspected the prisoner before; and Mr Bennett said he seem'd to shuffle about as if he had a mind to take something. Some time after Mr Bennett call'd me up stairs, and told me he saw the prisoner convey a piece of pink ribbon some where, but could not tell where. I told him he had bet ter send for a constable, so I went for one of the Bridge constables. My master and his father took the prisoner by each arm, and took him into the back shop; there I saw four pieces of ribbon in his hand, and another piece of pink colour taken from out of the prisoner's pocket; he had nothing in his hand when they first laid hold of him, and when he had wrench'd one hand from them, then I saw the four pieces in it; the prisoner said he had paid for the pink, and the others he would pay for. I know he never us'd to buy any more that 6 yards in one piece, and there were eighteen in that pink piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Can he speak English so as to be well understood?</p>
               <p>Adamson. He has been in England many years, and can speak well enough to be understood; I have known him some time.</p>

            . My son the prosecutor let me know, that the prisoner at the bar had taken a piece of ribbon. I went out of my shop into his; there I took hold of the prisoner's right hand, and my son took him by the left; he ask'd me what I did that for; I told him he had got some of my son's property about him. We led him into the back shop; he had then nothing in either hand; he prayed for his hand at liberty; I had had him by it I believe for the space of a minute. I thought I might let it go, as there were a number of us; this was after we got him into the back shop; the moment I got it at liberty, he throw'd it like under his great coat, and brought out four pieces of ribbon, and laid them on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put his hand under his great coat?</p>
               <p>E. Bennett. I plainly did: he said he would pay for them; he would give 3 l. 12 s. for them; I desired the constable to search him; he put his hand into the prisoner's pocket, and pull'd out this pink piece of ribbon, and my son had before told me, he saw him take a piece of pink ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket was it taken from?</p>
               <p>E. Bennett. I cannot say that: I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>E. Bennett. He said he did not intend to steal them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about the piece of pink?</p>
               <p>E. Bennett. He said he had bought that.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before my Lord-Mayor? E. Bennett. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the accusation against him?</p>
               <p>E. Bennett. It was for all the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any man in the world would not rather pay 3 l. 12 s. than be prosecuted, if they were not worth but 30 s.</p>
               <p>E. Bennett. This was not accidental; he had them secreted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have dealt with the prosecutor two years, I pay him ready money, and sometimes he gives me credit 'till I come back again, then I pay him; I had those four pieces in my hand, the piece of pink I paid for, so put that in my pocket. I had my coat hanging loose on my shoulders, as the young man had brought me a glass of brandy, I saw them come behind me, and they took me backwards, and then before my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>T. Reeves. I am a coppersmith and brazier, and live in Bride's-lane Fleet-street; he ask'd me whether I could make him some brass kettles. I ask'd him when he would have them done? he said, when I could do them. I said he might have them on Monday or Tuesday. Then Mr Gyles came in and said, Mr Applebee, why do not you tell him what you came about? then Mr Applebee said, did not you sell some copper at Mr Gyles's to day? I said, Yes: he ask'd me how much? I said, 15 pounds weight: he ask'd me for whom? I said for Mr Swinton, he desired me to sell it for him. I sold it for 12 s. 6 d. at 10 d. per pound; he brought it to my house. The copper produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where was this piece taken from?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. From out of my warehouse. I had mark'd some pieces upon Mr Gyles's information. (He looks in a parcel produced, bought by Mr Gyles's man, he finds some of them) I can swear all here is my property: here is also a copper sauce-pan and cover, which I found in the prisoner's lodgings, mark'd with my own hand. The prisoner, upon being charg'd, down on his knees and ask'd pardon; and desired to be sent abroad in the King's service, rather than to be transported.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner and another man came into our shop; he ask'd to see a good strong pair of shoes; be fitted on a pair; and said, he thought they were rather to short; I show'd him a pair longer; he fitted them on; I ask'd him 5 s. 6 d. for them, then I bated 3 pence; at their going out of the door, I told them they should have them for 5 shillings; they went away, and in about a quarter of an hour after, they both came in together again; the prisoner ask'd me for the shoes he had been about; and said, he was come to give me earnest for them; I had a suspicion of the other man at his first coming in; while I was turning towards the shoes the other man snatch'd a pair of shoes from out of window, and run away; I said to the prisoner, that man has stole a pair of shoes; he said, he knew nothing of the man, and push'd out into the street; I followed him into the court, and call'd stop thief; he turned about and said, what do you stop me for; I said, you have brought a man that has stole a pair of shoes; the neighbours came and secured him, and we took him before justice St Laurance.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. When you call'd stop thief, whether I did not stand still?</p>

            . I saw the prisoner stopt; he laugh'd, and made a sneer at it; when he was before the justice, he said, he did not value what they could do to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into that shop to buy a pair of shoes; I had but 4 s. 6 d. about me, so could not pay for them all at once. As I went in a man follow'd me, he did not belong to me, I know nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did they seem to be both acquainted when they came into the shop?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, they did: while this man fitted them, on the other said, they will do very well, they are good strong shoes; they convers'd and pass'd there opinions together about them.</p>

            . I am a watchman; to the best of my remembrance, last Friday was a month, about 6 in the morning, I met the prisoner at the bar, coming down St Giles's, with a bag of lead; he pitch'd it on a bulk; I ask'd him what he had in his bag; he said, he would not tell me; when he found I would know he threw the bag down and ran away, and I after him; I took him, he pulled out this iron chissel. (Producing one, about a foot long.) He throw'd it down into an area; I had assistance; we searched, and found this knife in his pocket, ( Producing a case-knife, with about two inches broke off, and ground up very convenient to cut lead,) it was in a sheath. We ask'd him were he brought the lead from;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060016"/> at first he said from Whetstone, and at last he said from Hadley from out of a stable; we weighed it, and it weigh'd near fourscore pounds; there are ten pieces of it; we took him before justice Welch; there he said he found it. Mr Welch ask'd him were he liv'd, he said at Westminster, then Mr Welch sent me to the house were he said he lodg'd, they told me he had been gone out on the yesterday, and had not been at home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The justice ask'd me where I lay that night; and I said, in my own room.</p>

            . About half an hour after one o'clock that night, I was siting at the corner of Fountain-Court in the Strand; I heard this gentleman call stop thief; I call'd to the first watchman; and said, if you see a man come that way stop him. I saw a man coming in a white coat, and he ran up Marrigold-Court; I knew he could not go through, for the gate is shut on nights; there we found the prisoner standing close up in a corner. In bringing him away I had hold of his collar; I perceiv'd his hand behind my back; I look'd and saw the watch fly into the middle of the Strand; I said hold him, he has thrown the watch away; I went and pick'd it up while he held him, and brought him to the Watch-house.</p>

               <p>J. Goulding. She would quarrel with us on that Sunday, and would not take dinner up, but went away in an abrupt manner; I went to Mr Fielding, and took out a warrant against her; we could not find her, but we took up her mother, after that we took the prisoner and had her before Mr Fielding, and he committed her: she would not confess any thing.</p>

            . The prisoner came very poor into my service, on the Thursday morning my husband went up stairs, the prisoner said, I wonder what my master goes up stairs for! with an oath, I'll go up and peep. On the Saturday morning I call'd her about 5 o'clock; she never answer'd me: after that I call'd her again, she made no answer, presently I goes to the stair-foot, and heard our room door creak.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your husband then?</p>
               <p>S. Goulding. He was asleep in bed. We lay up one pair of stairs, and she lay in a room opposite, on the same floor; I said nothing to her, nor she to me: on Sunday we had some friends come to see us, and at noon, when we went to dinner, she went up stairs and would eat no victuals; she had quarrel'd with one of the women that had help'd me to dress dinner; she said she would go and see her father and mother: I said pray take your week's wages with you; she had been with me that time. She would not take it, her mother came on the Saturday, and brought her a pair of old shoes; after that a strange man came and brought her some cloaths; I miss'd my money and took her up; in the drawer where this money was, was a small piece of chints, for many years, producing it. This I found in the prisoner's bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was not you much in liquor; did not you take a half pint pot, and go down into the brandy cellar and get drunk, and then come and give me a slap in the face that Sunday morning?</p>
               <p>S. Goulding. O you wicked girl! I never did such a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She lock'd up the victuals, and would not let me have any dinner.</p>

Justice Fielding ask'd her how she came by the money; she said her brother gave it her; then Mary Peters said, you shew'd me another black petticoat; the prisoner said it was a red one which she had then on; one of the Justice's men look'd at it, and said it was a very good one; it was ordered to be taken off. When she came in again, her mother was coming to speak to her; she shov'd her mother aside, and said, what are you going to turn evidence against me, and hang me? when we found those cloaths of her's, they were conceal'd within the tick of a bed, in a pillowbier, after the tick was ripp'd open.</p>

               <p>A. Millican. She went from me about two years ago; she behav'd very well: she liv'd with me three years, but she had a mind to come to London, like a great many more people, they are very fond of London were there is a great deal of silver; she thought to get all the world by coming here; I have trusted her with all I had; I would take her again did I want a servant, as soon as any body I know.</p>

               <p>Foley. I us'd to send for him to a publick house at first, he us'd to ask me what it was for, I said you can partly guess, I suppose; have you got any thing, said he; I gave him a nod. Where are they? we did not mention shoes. I told him the first time, I had them not then, but would bring them at one the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry them the next day?</p>
               <p>Foley. No, but in a day or two after I brought him some.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Foley. About eight.</p>

               <p>Q. Eight what?</p>
               <p>Foley. Horse-shoes, new.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any mention made of Mr Shaw's shop?</p>
               <p>Foley. Yes. I told him I was to bring them from there, he knew very well I could make none of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did he give you?</p>
               <p>Foley. The first money he gave me was two shillings, and promised me more the next day; but did not mention any quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth?</p>
               <p>Foley. Some were worth 6 d. some 9 d. and some a shilling, according as they were for weight. He bid me not to send for him to one ale-house twice, but to meet him at another house next time; he desired me to bring of the largest sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry him any more?</p>
               <p>Foley. I did, about the same quantity; sometimes he gave me two shillings, sometimes half-a crown, but he always promised me more; when I carried large shoes, I could not carry so many at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you carry him shoes?</p>
               <p>Foley. I carried shoes about six or seven times, I remember he gave me two shillings all in halfpence the first day, and about half a crown the next day; he us'd to give me about a pint or two pints of beer for my waiting for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might he have given you in the whole?</p>
               <p>Foley. About 5 or 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the shoes you carry'd worth?</p>
               <p>Foley. I can't tell; Mr Shaw can tell the value of his shoes best.</p>

               <p>Foley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what was the meaning of those words you said to Fisher?</p>
               <p>Foley. Neal had given me some money for some shoes, and a day's wages; I had some words in a publick house with a journeyman, the journeyman had got a warrant for me, and Mr Neal insisted upon my going before Justice Welch, and the other insisted on going before Justice Fielding, where he had the warrant. Fisher he gave in bail for us both.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know your own horse-shoes?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I do by my mark; I had information from the last evidence, that he had stolen shoes from me, and sold them to the prisoner at the bar; I got a search-warrant and searched the prisoner's premises; I found 24 lock'd up in a cellar under his house. Produced in court. These are all my property.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say upon your finding the shoes?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He desired me to be favourable to him, but he did not confess the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the horse-shoes weighed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had, they weighed upwards of 50 pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you value them at?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I value them at 10 s. I should be glad of some tons at that price.</p>

I did employ him one Saturday, in order for money for a Sunday's dinner; because I would not pay the expences of the bail-bond, he neglected his business and went to Mr Shaw's shop, and brought shoes from thence.

               <p>Q. Has your master been a man of credit?</p>
               <p>Carter. He has for five or six years: I can't say to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think if your master had receiv'd shoes of Mr Shaw's, knowing them to have been stolen, he would have trusted you to have set them on?</p>
               <p>Carter. It is common to buy shoes that are lost from off horses feet, that are good ones.</p>

She put her hand behind her, as tho' she was going to shuffle the guinea into his hands; I laid hold on both their hands; he said d - n you what do you want with this woman; I expected a blow. When I found this, I laid hold of them both, and call'd out Watch, the Watch came up and said to me, do you take care of the soldier, and I'll take care of the woman; we carried them to the Round-house; I staid there all night to appear against them, the next morning they were search'd, and the guinea was found upon the soldier; I saw it taken out of his coat pocket.</p>

            . I am Watch-house keeper at St Margaret's, Westminster. I have had this woman in my charge several times; on the 22d of November last, she was brought into the Watch-house by the prosecutor and a watchman, for picking the prosecutor's pocket of a guinea; I was very particular in searching of her. Said the prosecutor, I believe you have no need to search her, for I believe the man has the guinea, for I saw their hands together; said the soldier, if I have got a guinea, it is that man's (meaning the prosecutor) he pull'd his coat open: I felt in his pocket, the first thing I found was a giblet-pye: I put my hand in a second time, and pull'd out a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other money besides that?</p>
               <p>Bagerly. No: there were none but the guinea.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I had just done calling the hour between 11 and 12; the prosecutor call'd to me for assistance, and charg'd the woman with robbing him of a guinea. I took hold of her, she gave me two or three slaps on the face, I was oblig'd to knock her down; we took them both to the watch-house, and there I saw Mr Bagerly take a guinea out of the soldier's pocket.</p>
               <p>Bunny's defence. I had two-pence and the guinea; I had bought a candle, and saw a soldier, and had given him the other penny; I did not know any thing that it was a guinea; the woman gave the halfpence and guinea to me.</p>
               <p>Stow's defence. The prosecutor gave me two-pence half-penny, and whether the guinea was one of them, I do not know. He wanted me to go into a secret place, and said he'd say more to me; and I gave the money to this man, ( meaning her fellow prisoner) I am not his wife, my husband is now in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You hear what the woman says, what do you say to it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have had some little education, having been four years at the university, and know the nature of an oath, and consequence of swearing what is not true. I never gave her the value of a farthing, nor offer'd to give her any money; this soldier says he bought a candle and gave a penny to another soldier; it is impossible, when he was stopping me all the time, he was in my sight all the time, and stopp'd me four or five times; the woman call'd him her husband before the Justice.</p>

I took him up into the work-shop, he was so much dejected, he could hardly stand; I did not search him; I went down and told my housekeeper of it, and bid her go up and see if she miss'd any thing. She went up, and came down, and said every thing was in the same position as before; and said she belived she had lost nothing. A woman that the prisoner liv'd with came into my shop, he came down, and they went away together. At night, I went to see whether he had not taken any worsted, and miss'd one pound out of a parcel of half a dozen  there I found but 45 skains, which was nine skains short; then I call'd one of my men down, and told him I miss'd a pound of yarn: I shew'd him the parcel, and he saw there was a pound missing. He went and fetch'd him from an ale-house in Holloway-Lane, very much in liquor; I held out the bundle to him and said, You have taken out a pound from it: then he said, Have you a mind to hang me, I wish I was hang'd, I'll cut my throat. He agreed to pay for the worsted, I let him go. On the next Sunday in the forenoon, I was below, my kouse-keeper was above, I heard her fall down into a swoon; I stepp'd to the stairs and ask'd what was the matter? she said, This villain has robb'd me: I went directly and got a constable and apprehended him in Holloway-Lane. At first, his wife said he was not at home, and I should not come in; but I got in, and found him in the necessary-house, and carried him to New-prison, the next day before Justice Keeling, and he was committed. Then the Wednesday following, came his own brother with two gentlemen, they told me I had no occasion to say any more to them about it, for he had confessed the fact. On the Monday after, I and a neighbour, one Mr Collins, went to the prison to him; as soon as he saw me, he burst into a flood of tears, and acknowledged he had taken the money, and said he was very sorry for it; he said, How much money was it? I said, 18 l. odd. Said he, I did not keep count, but spent it as I wanted it: he said also he had taken it before that time that I catch'd him in the room. I said, How could you rob this poor old woman? he said, It was drinking and the temptation of the Devil; but he took all the blame upon himself, he thought it would never be found out, but every thing is brought to light, he said.</p>

               <p>Q. What workmen do you keep?</p>
               <p>Badcock. I keep Wool-combers; the prisoner has work'd for me as a Wool-comber.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave your service?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060029"/>Badcock. I believe he left my service about the beginning of November.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave in his business?</p>
               <p>Badcock. Not well at all; always drunk in his business; I lost the selling of many goods upon his account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took the money all at once ?</p>
               <p>Badcock. No, he said he took it at separate times, while he worked with me, and he had taken all his wife's cloaths from pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he come this time to your house?</p>
               <p>Badcock. I verily believe it was to get up into that room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the yarn in your house-keeper's bed-room?</p>
               <p>Badcock. Sometimes I have not room for all I have in my shop; then sometimes I have half a pack lies there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge the prisoner with at the goal?</p>
               <p>Badcock. I ask'd him if he was guilty of stealing my house-keeper's money? he said he had taken it, but not when I found him in the room, but at separate times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of favour made him?</p>
               <p>Badcock. No, none: only I said I'd do what I can for you (my meaning was, to bring him to justice ).</p>
               <p>Q. Was this confession before or after this?</p>
               <p>Badcock. I believe this was after his confession; he confessed voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Badcock. He said he would not confess; but whether he liv'd or died Mrs Greenwood should not lose her money; his friends should give her that.</p>

            . I am house-keeper to Mr Badcock; I had all my money on the 12th of August, 15 guineas in gold, eight crowns, of which he left two, 20 s. in single shillings, and two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. I was at my chest one day looking at my things, I thought my box was a little light, but I did not look in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. This was the week before this came out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the money?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. The Sunday morning after he was taken; he was taken on Friday the 14th, the day he was found in my room; then I went to make my bed, and sweep my room, I went to take a basket from off a chest, and my black silk purse that my gold was in, was lying on the chest; then I looked for my silver, and all were gone but two crown pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing about the money?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. No, I did not; he told me at the Justice's, he would not confess; but said, Mrs Greenwood, let me live or die, my friends will make you recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you us'd to keep your chest lock'd?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. I did, but this time I found it open, and the box that I us'd to put at the bottom of all my cloaths, I found on the top; and I was frighted very much.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw the money?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. I saw it since the 12th of August, but I did not tell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in your purse that time you look'd in your box?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. I saw money in the box, that was silver, but I did not look in the purse; I only can say there was some gold in it, but I did not tell it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before he was found in your room?</p>
               <p>E. Greenwood. This was about a week before.</p>

               <p>Q. Before, or after, he confess'd?</p>
               <p>Collins. Before he confess'd: I think the promise was, that he would be as favourable as he could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much in liquor when I went into this house; Mrs Greenwood was in a little room; I ask'd, if I might step up to the men at work; she said, yes; I stepp'd into the room, on the second story, where the wool used to lay; the men where talking what good work they had been upon, I went to see what sort of wool it was, whether it was better work than my own; I was looking at it I believe ten minutes, my master came and catch'd me there, I had put the door too, because he should not see me looking at the work; he ask'd me what I came there for; I said, for a dram; he took me up stairs; they ask'd me if I would have a pint; I said, I had been drinking all day; we joined for a pint a piece; I went home, and then to the Crown in Holloway-lane for a pint of beer, and Mr Badcock sent a man for me; I went to him, and said, what do you want with me; then he said, what business had you in Mrs Greenwood's room, I have lost some yarn and I lay it to you; I said, I never saw a skain of yarn there in my life; he said, if I would not pay him for it he would have a warrant for me. Then I said, sooner than I would be sandaliz'd I will pay you for it.

               <p>S. Rush. I did not miss it 'till Saturday night last. </p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at your house that day?</p>
               <p>S. Rush. He was. I have known him from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>S. Rush. He served his time to a Peruke-maker, at Rotherhith. His mother is a very honest woman, and lives at Newport-Pagnel.</p>
               <p>Mark David. Last Monday evening the young man at the bar came to my house with a silver pint mug to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>David. I am a Taylor by trade, and deal in gentlemens left off cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go to a Taylor's house to sell a silver mug?</p>
               <p>David. He had met one of our Jews, that carried a box about with silver, and that man recommended him with it to me, because I am constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask you for it?</p>
               <p>David. He ask'd me five shillings an ounce. I stopp'd it. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mrs Rush. This is my property, here is W. R. S. on the bottom of it; our people sometimes leave them in the yard.</p>
               <p>David. I brought the prisoner to Guildhall, before an Alderman, and he was committed to Newgate; he own'd, as we were going along, that he took it out of Mrs Rush's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>David. He cried very much, and said, he was very poor, and was asham'd to borrow money of Mrs Rush, and he took it out of want.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Rush. Was you with the prisoner at Guildhall?</p>
               <p>Mrs Rush. I was: I cannot say that he said three words there; had he ask'd me for twice the value of it, on his mother's account, I would have let him have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found it lying in the yard. I implore the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of letters were they?</p>
               <p>Stapp. They were letters that had been open'd and read; we found the prisoner by the directions of them letters, near Temple-bar, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the execution of the search-warrant?</p>
               <p>Stapp. I was: we found about two or three pounds of grey horse-hair, tied up in bundles and seem'd very fresh, just as if immediately cut off; there were some black a smaller quantity; we took the prisoner before the gentlemen at Guild-Hall; his defence there, was, that he had had that hair by him there years; it smelt greasey of the horse and oily, as if fresh cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a house-keeper?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find other hair besides that?</p>
               <p>Stapp. We found very little besides this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find no human hair?</p>
               <p>Stapp. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the letters shown to him?</p>
               <p>Stapp. I do not know what he said to them: but he own'd the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he lost it</p>
               <p>Stapp. He said he went to his father's at Totenham-High-Cross, for some apples, and going along, lost his b: but where this was found there was no path.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's father ?</p>
               <p>Stapp. I do: he belongs to the turnpike at Stamford-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the nearest way to go over your grounds to his father's house.</p>
               <p>Stapp. No: it is out of the way to his father's, go which way you will.</p>

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060033"/> was prosecutors, to come to examine this hair, which I did, and gave it as my opinion, that the greatest part of the hair were just cut off, and had it's natural sweat and moisture about it. 'It is tied about with Barbers thread, part of it is manufactured: some of it has been washed: some of it has the radical moisture, or sweat of the horse now. I don't apprehend it can have remain'd in the state it is now, so long as the prisoner talks of. We find by experience it always will dry.</p>
               <p>Q. Compare this other small parcel that was cut off at Guild-hall, with the others?</p>
               <p>Redman. (he takes them in his hand ): It is impossible to give judgment of this, for hair will come so near: we find the nearer the shoulder it is the strongest, and nearer the head the softest, the out side of the mane in general is lightest and softest, that is the upper and under, provided that is grizzly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stapp. When was the hair missed?</p>
               <p>Stapp. It was miss'd the 21st of September, and the search made the 26th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. to Redman. Has there been time enough since the 21st of September, to manufacture that which is manufactured, to be in the state it is in?</p>
               <p>Redman. Yes: there has. He might have manufactured the whole, and a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, that which you say has it's radical moisture in it, that may have been in the state it is in for twelve months?</p>
               <p>Redman. I cannot say how long: no man can be certain. I very much query whether it could: for in lying, the radical moisture will dry into powder and fly off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Monday the 18th of September, I had been at my father's at Tottenham-High-Cross; they have a very large orchard, and were complaining they could not get people to gather the fruit; they desired the first leisure time I had, I would come and help them. I did, but then I went by Islington; but the afternoon proving showery, we did not gather much fruit: that afternoon I got an accident, by falling from a pear-tree; my mother insisted on my staying all night; I came home to town the next morning, the day proving fine again, and I was very little wanted at home, as my business is chiefly among the gentlemen of the Law, and they were many of them out. I went on the Friday again, the day being fair, I went to cross these fields, but I found it very wet; I went to go up lordship-lane by Newington, and it was so bad I was oblig'd to take to those fields where these horses were; I remember seeing a great number of them, and whether by pulling out my hankerchief I know not, but my book was dropp'd; there was a usual path, and people have frequent intercourse through that field; I have often gone that way, there are 4 gates to those fields, and I think I went the nearest way to Stamford-hill; I was in bed at my father's house at the time the hair was cut off, and it will be proved, that I had this hair in my house some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stapp. Was the pocket-book wet or dry when it was found?</p>
               <p>Stapp. It was very dry: it was a fine day and found about 4 in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any rain before that?</p>

He was tried for firing of a pistol at Gustavus Forshohm, on September the 23d, the prosecutor swore it was done betwixt the hours of 8 and 9 in the evening. The prisoner in his defence said he had people in Court to prove that he was in their company, from 7 that evening 'till half an hour after 9. This made me take more notice of the two prisoners now at the bar, expecting I should be called upon to give an account of the evidence they gave at that time. I saw them both sworn: Macdonock was called first; he said, on a Saturday night, or that Saturday (I could not rightly distinguish) Nolan came to pay him some money for keeping his child; that night he gave him 3 s. 6 d. towards the maintenance of it, that they had some beef-stakes for supper, and they parted about 9 o'clock to the best of his knowledge; that there were his wife, and

Then Sarah Holland was called, she swore she was at the house of Macdonock taking care of the children, that the then prisoner Nolan came in, it was on a Saturday night between 6 and 7 o'clock: that they had beef-stakes, butter, onions, and three pots of beer to supper; that she saw Nolan pay Macdonock some money for taking care of his child, and that Nolan went away about half an hour after 9 o'clock: that she went over the way to see what o'clock it was when he went away; it was understood by the Court, that they both meant Saturday the 23d of September, and the Jury desired they might be committed to take their trials for perjury. Nolan asked his landlord, who was next called, if he did not borrow 31 s. of him that Saturday night; but Cranley his landlord said it was not the Saturday, it was on the Friday night, meaning the day before Mr Forshohm was shot.</p>
