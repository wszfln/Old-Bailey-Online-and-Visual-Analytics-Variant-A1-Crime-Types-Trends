On the 8th of January, about two o'clock I went out of the warehouse, and the street-door is always open; joining the street-door there is a warehouse door from the passage; I left the warehouse-door, I believe, on jarr; I went up stairs and staid about two minutes; when I came down again, a person in Court informed me that a man was gone out of the warehouse with two parcels under his arm; we pursued him, and met him just turning the corner of the gateway, about sixty yards off; he had put the two parcels down by the gateway, I saw the parcels in the gateway, not in his possession; the prisoner was turning the very corner of the gateway; I took him and brought him back to the warehouse; I know the parcels to be my property; they contained twenty-four pair of women's black worsted stockings, as I believe, but I really had not examined them, because the goods had not been in the warehouse two hours; I had opened them.</p>
               <p>What value were they? - About twenty shillings; they were worsted stockings.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the warehouse at the time? - Nobody; there was a gentleman in the counting-house, but he did not see him.</p>
               <p>I understand you then that it is a wholesale warehouse, not a retail-shop? - It is a warehouse; not a retail-shop.</p>

I turned my head behind the gate, and there lay the goods; I am sure he was the man that went into Mr. Deans's, and came out with the parcels; I am sure I saw him again, after he came out with the parcels.</p>

               <p>Had he any thing in his fist? - I do not believe there was; he took my watch from me, and put it in his left hand jacket pocket; he had a soldier's jacket on, the upper garment; the other man struck me with his fist in the eye, the soldier then took three guineas in gold, and the man that struck me took nine shillings, or ten shillings in silver; after this, the other man in the brown came before me to strip off my great coat; my money was in different pockets, one in my right hand pocket, and the other in the left; the other man threw down my great coat on the ground, and attempted to take my other coat, and was in the act of doing it, when two men appeared, whom I did not know; the prisoners ran away, I called out stop thief, and the two men ran after them; not knowing who these men were, I did not stay, but went directly to Hyde-park-corner; I stopped at the park-keeper's lodge, and told him I had been robbed, and described the persons I had been robbed by; the servant said, he saw them two men at the Triumphant Carr, next Hyde-Park-corner, five or six minutes before; it is not an hundred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090006"/>yards from Hyde-park-gate; I desired the boy to go with me to the public house, which he did; I came to the publican, and described these men to him; says he, Sir, they have not been out of my house ten minutes, and I thought they were on no good; the publican's name is Cressey; I went back to the Park-keeper, and desired him to lend me a lanthorn, to look for a key, where I had been robbed, a key that I valued; I could not find my key, but we saw the place, with the struggling on the grass very plain, and I found this stick; I went to Mr. Justice Bond's, but he was gone to bed; the next morning I intended to wait on him, but my eye was so bad, I was confined to my bed, and he was so obliging to come and take my evidence; I swear positively to Green, the soldier; the other I cannot speak so; positively to because Green looked at me for a minute or two, threatening me, with his face quite close to mine; the other I did not take so much notice of; I saw them on the Monday again; I was robbed on the Saturday night, about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice enough of the other man, to be able to say, this is not the other man? - No, I did not; I took notice enough to describe him, and this man answers my description of him, so much, that the boy said, I saw these two men in the house, not above five minutes before; he answers to the description of the man that robbed me, but I do not under take to swear to him.</p>

               <p>How long had they left you before Mr. Evans came to you? - I do not know; it might be fifteen or twenty minutes; there was some little interval, but certainly they are the two men that were at my house.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Francis had a white surtout coat over a jacket seemingly, and the other had a soldier's jacket seemingly, as he has now; they had drank three half pints of gin as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Court. What! the two men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing with them? - I did not observe any thing.</p>

               <p>Why you seem to treat that as of course? - No, but it happened to be the case then.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder that these robberies are so frequent! what is the charge of three half pints of gin? - Three fourpences; my servant is not here.</p>

               <p>What disagreeable work? - Seeing people drinking gin; I did not take particular notice how many there were, but I saw the prisoner Green in the park before, made me know him; and he struck the boy, and he went to charge the watch, that made me take notice of him.</p>

I said he had; he asked me if I knew where he was? I said I did not; he asked me to get up, and have something to drink, accordingly I did, and we went to look for Green, and found him in Howarth's apartments, in the same street; he was asleep, we opened the door, and Howarth got up, and let us in, and Green was awake when we came into the room, and he spoke to Francis, and asked him how he could use him so ill the night before, for his shirt was tore as if he had been fighting, or something of that kind. Green got out of bed, and put on his things, and Francis had on that great coat that lays there, to the best of my recollection, which coat was found afterwards in my box, and Green had on Francis's brown great coat, to the best of my recollection, and Francis took his own coat off the bed and put it on, and took the great coat off, and we all four came down stairs together; Francis had his coat on his arm when we came down, and he said, we will go and have a pot of beer together; and he gave me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090008"/>coat, and said, I will be obliged to you if you will put that in your room till I call for it; we went and drank two or three pots of beer, and stopped at the public house, which was the Angel, in Tothill-street, then from thence to another house in the Broad-way, Westminster, and had two or three more pots, then we came to the George and Bell, in St. Ann's-street near where I live, they went up to my room to have some breakfast, in the mean while I was toasting some toast at the fire, Green and Francis had a watch in their hands, which I believe that to be it; they had it in their hands looking at it; they called me, and asked me if I would put that by with the great coat, and take care of it till Monday morning, that they would call for it.</p>
               <p>Which of them called to you? - I cannot say, but I believe it was Francis; I immediately took them, and put them in my box, and locked the box, and put the key in my pocket; after that Francis wanted a shirt and stockings washed; I told him I would not let my wife do it being Sunday; he said, will you lend me one of yours? I did so; and he took half a guinea out of his pocket, and said, if I do not return them, you may take pay out of that for them; after that we all went out together; I called on Malpas at his house; Howarth and Francis went on to go down to Tothill-fields; I went up and called Malpas out of bed, and me and Green, and Malpas, came and found Francis and Howarth at a house joining to Tothill-fields, that they call the Blue-coat-boy; he ordered in a can of beer into the gaol, and we sat there till it was all drank; when we came from there, we had a glass a piece at that public-house, and then we parted; I was ordered for a regiment party on the Monday morning, I was getting my things ready to march, and just as I was getting into bed the constables came; the watch and great coat I had from Green and Francis, I put into my box, I put in no other.</p>

               <p>What did he want at Parsons's? - I cannot say; nothing passed only what I said; he desired him to go home.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for any body, or any thing thing there? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what he said to Parsons? - He did not say any thing particular, only wished to come in, and Parsons wished him to go to his lodgings; I took him to my lodging, where he staid all night; in the morning came Francis and Parsons between five and six, and knocked at my door; and I asked first who it was; they answered it was Parsons, he wanted to speak to me; I asked what he wanted; he said, is not Green here? I said yes; he is asleep in bed; I let him in and awaked Green, and he got up and dressed himself; both Parsons and Green came in, and we went out to the Angel in Tothill-street, and there we had two or three pots of beer, and at several different public-houses, and had some beer, or one thing or other, from that we went back again to Parson's room, there we had breakfast; after that we went down to Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>When you was at breakfast, did any thing particular pass? - Nothing in particular passed.</p>
               <p>How was Francis dressed when he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090009"/>to your room that morning? - I could not perceive; we had no light, I struck a light; there were some clothes changed, but I cannot say what they were.</p>
               <p>When you saw him in the light, had Green the great coat on you saw him in over night? - No, he had a jacket on; Francis had the great coat; I did not perceive any thing else; I never saw any coat at all.</p>
               <p>Look at that coat? - That coat was not there; I did not see that coat.</p>
               <p>Was you there the whole time of breakfast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had you for breakfast? - Tea.</p>
               <p>What had you to eat? - Only bread and butter, and tea, that was all.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - No.</p>
               <p>No toast? - I believe there was something toasted, but I do not recollect who toasted it; I eat nothing but bread and butter.</p>
               <p>When they were at breakfast, did you see any thing pass between Francis and the other men? - Yes, I saw Green, and Francis, and Parsons, looking at a watch at the window.</p>
               <p>What became of that watch? - Green gave it to Parsons to take care of.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else given to Parsons to take care of? - No, I heard nothing said, but only give it to him to take care of it; then we went to different public houses and had some liquor to drink, and we went to Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the beer there? - I do not recollect, I did not see any paid for; I paid for none.</p>
               <p>Court. Who were the people that changed clothes at your lodgings? - Francis and Green; Green had the great coat on, that I believe to be Francis's; Francis put it on; it was a great brown coat, an oldish coat to my thinking.</p>
               <p>What under-coat had Green under that? - He had a red jacket under the great coat; when he was dressed in the morning, he had only a red jacket, not a regimental coat; I never saw any coat he had there, only a jacket.</p>

               <p>Why did he have the red jacket on; did you see Green put it on? - I cannot say, it might be his own; I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it the red jacket that Green went out in that morning, after he left your lodgings? - I did not see them change any clothes.</p>

               <p>What else did he say to you? - Nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him why you should go to Bow-street? - He said he was in company with him, and he heard he was in trouble, and he wanted to know what was become of him.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you about what he was in trouble for? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say this was all that passed? - I asked him if there was any thing the matter; and he said no; that was all that he said to me.</p>
               <p>You went to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There you was stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Francis at the time you went to Bow-street? - I left him in my room.</p>
               <p>Tell us all that passed? - He came up to my room on the Monday morning, and asked me to go, and I went.</p>
               <p>You know you was examined at Bow-street, and there it was taken down? - He said there was something in Parsons's room, and if it was not removed, Parsons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090010"/>and his wife, if they were taken, would be done; I asked him what it was; he said it was nothing to me, or to him; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he lodge at your house? - No, he said he slept at Parsons's, at that time.</p>
               <p>Where did he lodge? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Howarth. Where did Francis lodge? - I never knew where he lodged this time; I never was acquainted with him since he left the regiment.</p>

               <p>I never saw any of the things; and that man that says I gave them to him, I never gave him any; he just says what he pleases to say, to save his own neck; I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to speak for you? - No, Sir, I do not know that I have; I belong to the first regiment.</p>
               <p>Have not you your serjeant to give you a character? - He is here behind.</p>

               <p>"say never a word, or I will blow your brains out;" that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Was you frightened? - Yes, I was alarmed; I said nothing, that was the reason, I made no resistance.</p>

               <p>What became of them after they had your cloak? - I walked on some bit, and did not look back, till I came to the Three-path-ways; the man that said, say not a word about it, was the man that robbed me, to the best of my knowledge; when I came to the Three-path-ways, I looked back, and saw the two men running; I walked on the length of a short field, the men were taken about an hour after they were out of my sight; they were stopped by the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of them again? - One.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - This man in the light coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Collins; I cannot be positive to the other; Collins is the man that took my cloak.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Positive; it was a bright day.</p>
               <p>How long was he with you? - I cannot tell, a minute, I suppose, not more.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing him particularly? - Yes, I am quite clear he is the man; my cloak was found again, I heard of it on Sunday at the Justice's, which was the next day; I was informed if I went to Justice Smith's, I might see the prisoner and the cloak; I went and found both the prisoners in custody, and my cloak was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did she ever see me before? - Never before I was robbed.</p>

               <p>It was dark, I suppose? - It was dark.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - No, I knew none of them before.</p>
               <p>How long had he hold of you and the coat? - About five minutes, I believe he was standing looking at me; he laid hold of the coat, and kept looking at me.</p>
               <p>Could you see his face? - Yes, I looked in his face, when he looked in mine; there was a lamp at the corner of the back lane.</p>
               <p>Did he threaten you at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he snatch the coat? - He laid hold of the coat, and called the other; I asked them what they wanted with it; they did not tell me; I struggled to keep it under my arm.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; when did you see the man again afterwards; I saw him at Justice Wilmot's on Wednesday after; this was on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sure it was the same man? - The same man.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you alarmed and frightened? - I was frightened; but he looked in my face, and I looked in his face, and I thought he was going to rob me of it.</p>
               <p>What did you think he was going to do? I did not know what; I looked in his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time I was apprehended for the robbery, I was brought before Mr. Justice Wilmot; I was brought into a room by myself, and four officers had this lad to see me, to swear to me; they gave him descriptions who it was, and what sort of a person I was, before the lad had seen me; they brought him into a room where I was sitting in a chair; they asked the lad if he knew me, and was not that the person; he said yes; had I been with any body else, the boy would not have known me from any body else.</p>
               <p>Drewitt. There were two more prisoners in the room at the time I saw him; they asked me, if I knew the man, if I saw him; I said yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of the officers of justice that took you into that room, point to that man and say, is that the man that robbed you? - No, Sir, they never put up their hand; there were three men in the room, and they asked me which was the man that robbed me, and I pointed to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The officers have told him to swear so, and therefore he swears to me; whether I am the person or no, makes no great difference to him.</p>

               <p>Was it light enough for you to see him? - I had three or four candles, and I had a lamp that gave three lights, and there was a shop on the right hand side, and another on the left with lights; it struck a very great light into the street, and the street is not very wide, it was a very wet dirty night; I heard the report of the blow as plain as you hear me speak; I went out then directly; before I heard the blow, I thought it was amongst themselves, it is frequently done.</p>

               <p>How far was this blow from your house? - About twelve or fourteen yards where the boy was knocked down.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday last, the eighteenth day of December last, I received information against the prisoner and three others; coming through Petticoat-lane, I in company with other officers, met four men, the prisoner and three others; as soon as they got past us, we turned our heads, and they all set off running; one of the officers and myself took one of them; we took him to the watch-house; I went home, I think it was about ten at night, or between ten and eleven; we received a further information of the prisoner and another that had gone to a lodging in Frying-pan-alley, Petticoat-lane; we went there, and in a two-pair of stairs room, we went and knocked at the door, and they said they would not open the door; we told them we were officers belonging to Justice Wilmot, and should break the door open; accordingly the man that belonged to the room opened the door; we went into the room; there was another man that is discharged undressing himself; we could see nothing of the prisoner; but we looked under the bed, and between the sacking and the floor we found the prisoner and secured him, and took him to the watch-house; he there said, if he had not been afraid of being shot, he would have jumped out of the window; when we were before the magistrate upon examination, there was a dispute about what parish the robbery had been committed in, and the prisoner then said that it was done in Whitechapel parish; and the two men that were in custody that night with him were innocent; they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why you certainly cannot be on your oath that I made mention of them words? - I am on my oath, and there are more people to prove it; they were all three committed for further examination; when he was brought up for further examination, he begged his companions to take warning by him, as they saw the situation he had brought himself into; I heard him; this was before the magistrate, it was not taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Court to Lowe. I think you told me you had known Burne very near three years? - Very near three years, I know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Did you inform any Justice of Peace or any body that Burne was one of the men? - I informed Mr. Dawson at the time, as soon as I could speak to him, not on the Saturday night; but as soon as I could after.</p>
               <p>Court to Drewitt. What was you knocked down with? - With a stick.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090018"/>Jury. Where did it strike you? - On the head.</p>
               <p>Did it cut your head? - It did not cut it, it raised a lump on my head.</p>
               <p>Lowe. He had a lump on his head when I came up.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have not a friend in the world; I was in this room when Dawson and another man came up; a woman that I had connection with had a warrant against me, this man and two more brought in the boy into a room where I was sitting; when they brought me before Justice Wilmot, they asked the boy if I was the person that robbed him; and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Williams. With submission to the Court. and the gentlemen in general, if the oath I have sworn is not sufficient, I will be sworn again; I did not let these men have any intercourse with the boy at all, I kept him at my back, I never suffered them to speak to him once; I said tell the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. Was the boy carried into the room to look at the prisoner? - No, my Lord; there were five prisoners in the room, and Burne was in the middle; I came out of the room, and desired Mr. Williams to take the boy in himself, which he did.</p>
               <p>Did you describe the prisoner to the boy at all? - No, my Lord, not at all.</p>
               <p>Did you say when he went in, is that the man that robbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Did you point out the prisoner at the bar to the boy, when you went into the room, and ask him if that was the man that robbed him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you describe the prisoner at the bar as the man that robbed him? - God forbid I should do any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any body else besides the prisoner in the room? - There was the prisoner and several other people; now, says I to the boy, as soon as we got into the room, if you find any of the people that insulted you, point to him; the boy went in and pointed out the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. Did you, when the boy went in the room, point out the prisoner as the person that robbed him? - I did not; there were several prisoners in the room, all standing together, and the boy looked at them, and looked all round the room, and said this is the man that robbed me; I did not point him out to the boy in any way whatever, upon my oath: there were three prisoners in the other room that were ironed, and the boy went and looked at them; there were three prisoners in this room; I never spoke to the boy about the man, nor described him, nor touched him in no way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I going to die, I would say with my last breath, that that man Shakeshaft asked the boy if I did not rob him? - I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury to Lowe. When these three or four people were past the butcher's door, did you see any thing under their arms? - No, nothing that I could discern in their hands, any further than sticks, I could not discern every thing, I see them go past to and fro' two or three times in the evening; they run as hard as they could in the horse-road, Burne was one that came past my window.</p>

            , he did not write his real name; when I sent the second order according to his direction, which was in the afternoon, after he was gone, the people where I sent the second order, refused to take it in, saying such a person did not lodge there; then I ran myself there, and asked the woman; she said there was nobody lodged there but only mechanics; then I went to the house of Mr. Martin, and Co. and presented it, and asked if it was a true one; and they told me it was a false one, and they refused payment; then I went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and we did not find him till he was taken in the Minories, eight or nine days after, till he was advertised; then I went to the Counter to see him, and it was the same man; I know him perfectly by sight, he talked German, and I talked German with him frequently; but I never knew his name; he is indicted by the name of Ludlam, that is his original name.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - His own friends have been with me, and told me his name was Ludlam; his cousin has.</p>
               <p>Did you know what situation of life he was in at the time he came to your house first? - He was an officer, I know.</p>
               <p>Was he in regimentals? - Not in full regimentals, only in frocks.</p>
               <p>You did not know where he lodged, till he gave you that paper of directions? - No; I asked him where I was to send this to, and he took and tore it from a letter.</p>
               <p>(The paper of directions put into Court.)</p>
               <p>What did you do with the bill? - I offered it for payment to Mr. Stone, and they refused me payment, then I went to the office, and shewed it to the Justice; they made me write my name on it, and it was delivered to this gentleman. (Jealous.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Do you happen to know whether this prisoner has been in America? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he has, for some years past, used the name of Washington? - Yes, he has left that name of Washington before.</p>
               <p>Have you had any connection or transaction in which he has used the name of Washington, either by leaving a card at your house, or by calling himself by that name, or any other way? - I never knew, till after this transaction, that my wife told me he left a card in the name of Washington.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you which house of Martin and Co. this was? - In Lombard-street, he told me.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of that bill; was it ever presented to you? - Yes, I believe this is the same bill that Mr. Treyer brought one evening to our house, and enquired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090024"/>after the goodness of it; the answer given him was, that the bill was not a good one; that it was a forged one, and in addition to that, we mentioned another circumstance that had lately come to our knowledge.</p>
               <p>That you need not enter into; look at the acceptance of that bill? - This is not the acceptance of Mr. Stone, the partner in that house; his name is Richard; the initial of the Christian name here is E. D. I know nothing more of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand there is another banking-house in London of that firm? - No Sir, there is a banking-house, with a Martin in the firm, but that Martin stands last instead of first; that is not in Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Is there ever a Mr. Stone in that house, Not that I know.</p>

               <p>Court. What answer do you give, Mr. Ludlam, as to the fact of your giving that direction to carry a second parcel of goods to a place where you did not live? - I had lodged in Mortimer-street, for two months, very nigh, in a room, with a gentleman of the Navy, named Worrel.</p>
               <p>Where did you lodge at that time? can you give the Jury any satisfaction on that point, and why you ordered these goods to be sent to the other place? - I had lodged there so long, I did not, in the least, doubt but they would have taken them in; and I dare not have them sent to my own lodging, being very much in debt in name of Ludlam.</p>

Bankers, London; it imports to have been accepted on the 5th of November, 1787, by a person described on the acceptance, E. D. Stone; and it purports to have been indorsed by Wright; the person to whom it was paid; and by W. Washington; it is the acceptance that is charged to be forged of Mr. Stone, and it is that indorsement by Washington that is charged to be forged; the prisoner is not charged with having forged either of these, but with having uttered the bill with the false acceptance and indorsement, knowing that they were so; by uttering is meant that he passed it in payment, and used it like a true bill, when he knew it was false; upon the facts of the case on the evidence, it stands thus: this prisoner had used the house of one Goslib Agustus Treyer, who lives somewhere in the Hay-market, and deals, among other articles, in snuff. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence and then added as follows:) On the paper which he left with Mr. Treyer, which looks like the cover of a letter, are written these words,</p>

               <p>"Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square,</p>
               <p>"London." Now, if in indorsing the name of Washington there was no particular fraud meditated, that would not be considered a forged indorsement; signing by the false name, will not alone, unless there is a fraudulent use made of it, make it a forgery, so as to expose him to the charge of making a forged indorsement; upon this evidence, I think it must be taken to be a bill on Martin, Stone and Co. who are bankers in Lombard-street; and to have upon it a forged acceptance: but the material point for your consideration is, whether this man, who offered it in payment, appears to you to have uttered it, under circumstances that prove he had some concern in the forging of the bill, or that he knew it was forged; I directed the attention of the prisoner in his defence, to that point which seemed to me to press him most, with respect to the knowledge; because, if you find a man uttering a bill, which turns out to be forged, with all the circumstances on his part that are open and fair, and no disguise whatever; you will not conclude, merely from the circumstance of his having the misfortune of uttering a forged bill, that he knew it was forged; on the other hand, if you find him playing any tricks, or using any disguise, or any management that demonstrates any fraud in the passing that bill, you will conclude he had such knowledge; the circumstance that presses this man, is certainly, that he came there, and gave two different orders for different parcels of goods; with respect to the largest parcel of 7 l. 3 s. he takes this away with him in a hackney coach, therefore he actually got the possession of these goods, and carried them off, and where he carried them to no body knows; with respect to the other parcel of goods, he gave a direction, which turned out to be a direction that was not a true one; it was not a place where they were likely to be received, and in fact the people would not receive the goods, so that the question is, whether that is not an artifice to prevail on the man to part with the first parcel of goods, on a false security, and that is the way in which it applies: now, he says first, as to the bill, he received it from Mr. Allamby; his trial was put off last sessions, to give him an opportunity of establishing that fact, Mr. Allamby is dead, and he cannot now establish it by calling Mr. Allamby; and to be sure it would not be a very likely thing that he would come here to prove that he put a forged bill into his hands; he says to that, if his trial was put off longer, he might have been able to establish that by other testimony; but he was not able to state any circumstance that could induce the Court to suppose, that if any time was given to him, it would be possible for him to shew the fact that he received it from Allamby;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090026"/>therefore, that the Court cannot take any notice of; but with respect to the more material point as it strikes me, which is the transaction itself with Treyer; what he says, is this; he wanted such goods, and took away such as was convenient to him; he took it to his own lodgings, which he was obliged to keep private on account of his distressed situation; and he says, it occurred to him that he might order the other part of the goods to this other place where he had lodged before, as he supposed that they would take them in; and he says, that that circumstance therefore ought not to operate upon you, that he meditated any fraud on the prosecutor; it is on that subject principally upon which your discretion is to be exercised; here unquestionably is a bill with a forged acceptance upon it, passed by the man at the bar; the question is, whether he must have known this was not a true bill at the time he passed it; to be sure originally, a man who has the misfortune to pass a forged bill, is bound to prove how he came by it, and there might be a great deal of indulgence on that point for a man who might have the misfortune to pass a forged bill; because a man may receive a forged bill and lose his evidence, as the prisoner says he has; therefore, jurors in all those cases, look more narrowly into the manner of the circumstances, under which the man acts the moment he passes the bill, and form their judgment, rather from these circumstances, more than from the passing the bill merely; for though his saying he received it from another person would not be a direct answer; yet if a man passes a bill with every circumstance of fairness and openness without the least disguise, there is great reason to suppose that he did not know it was a forged bill, unless there is proof that he knows of the forgery; now, you will consider the manner in which this man conducted himself at the time he passed this bill; if you believe he was conscious this was a forged bill, and he knew it, then he is answerable to the extent of this indictment which charges him with the uttering the false acceptance; with respect to the indorsement, if you can satisfy yourselves about the acceptance, I think you may satisfy yourselves about the indorsement, having put that name publicly on it, which there is some evidence he did go by at that time; but upon the other point particularly you will consider seriously, and do justice to him and the public credit by your verdict.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we wish to know when he received the bill of Mr. Allamby.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot ask the prisoner questions now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Because I think he said he received them in October, and the date of the acceptance is the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Court. It would not be fair to press the prisoner with very sharp observations, on what he says here in his defence; as to what he says now, if it does not make for him, it should not make against him, because we do not ask him to accuse himself, but to defend himself; as to what he said at the time he gave the bill to Treyer you do well to consider that.</p>

               <p>Was he purchasing for himself or another? - He said they were for himself, that he was going out in the civil establishment in the East India Company's service to Bengal.</p>
               <p>Did you see some cash in his hand? - I saw some cash, it was gold, but what I cannot say; he then said, here is a good bill, will you chuse to take it; I looked at the bill, took it and read it, and made several trifling excuses, and avoided parting either with the bill or the goods; at last I put the bill in my pocket, and knocked the goods back with my elbow, which were ready packed up; and I told the prisoner, as he was a stranger to me, before I parted with the bill or goods, I must make a proper enquiry about the bill; he said he was going to dine at the Bull Inn, in Bishopsgate-street; he said he lived No. 3, Dover-place, Newington Butts, and would call again in about an hour; I told him I would send to Dover-place the goods and the difference, after I had enquired about the bill; I told him I should do that first; he said that was needless, as he would call again for the goods and the difference; as soon as he went away, which was in a hackney-coach, I went directly to Mr. Pybus; I did not offer it for payment, but I asked them whether it was a good one; they replied it was not.</p>
               <p>To what Pybus did you go? - To Mess. Pybus and Co. in New Bond-street, where the bill is addressed; Mr. Pybus junior informed me it was a forgery; I came back as soon as possible, and found he never had called; he did not call again; a week elapsed before I gave myself any trouble to enquire about him, and I never saw him after, till I saw him in custody before the Lord Mayor; after he was in custody I went to enquire for No. 3, Dover-place, to ask if a person of the name of Watkins resided there; there is no number to the house in Dover-place; I took the third house from the beginning, as you go to the Elephant and Castle, and there was no such person; I went to the third house from the other end, which is a lady's boarding school, kept by a person I have known some time, and no such person resided there; I know nothing of the bill further than I was told at Mr. Pybus's; the bill is in the same state I received it, except my name at the bottom, and a bit of paper pasted at the back.</p>
               <p>(The bill read and examined by the Court.)</p>

               <p>Who are the persons that do accept in your house; have you any clerks that accept for your house? - There is one, his name is Raines; I know his hand, that is not his writing; he always accepts in his own name for the house.</p>
               <p>Then that certainly is not the acceptance of any of the persons that compose the firm of Pybus and Co.? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Ludlam, what have you to say to this? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, it might happen to an honest man to have a bad bill; but if he conducts himself as an honest man, if he utters the bill, and gives a true account of himself, it may be a reason, though a bill is forged, not to charge the person who utters it with knowing it to be forged; the question here is, whether he knew it to be a forged bill; and most unhappily the circumstances are very strong against the prisoner; he represented himself to be a man of the name of Watkins, his name being Ludlam; representing himself to be a person, going on the civil establishment to Bengal, and using that pretence to get this bill negotiated, and never returning; instead of which there is no such person living in Dover-place, he never comes back again at all, but abandons both bill and goods; these are circumstances that do manifest a consciousness that that bill was not negotiated in a fair and regular course; therefore what can we infer, but that the prisoner must have known what sort of a bill? this poor unhappy man has no answer to give to it at all, and I am afraid it is a case too clear to admit of any answer.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090029"/>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you bring these curtains here? - I have brought them here; I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Court to Barnett. Was it at the public-house where the watchmen meet that you found this man? - He came into that house, and had a pennyworth of purl, and a halfpennyworth of gin, and the landlord turned him out, then I saw his pockets stick out; he told me he found the things at Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he said Whitechapel? - Yes, and then he said he found them in the city.</p>

               <p>What opportunity had you of observing her? - I talked to her, and changed a great many words with her on the stairs, and again on the landing-place; I stood facing her some time; I know her by her speech; I am very sure it is the same woman.</p>
               <p>When had you seen your watch at your bed's head? - About eleven o'clock the same day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This was about half after two, I think you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not say it was two, did you, when you was first examined, you did not mention the hour of two? - I do not remember that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Are you deaf? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090032"/>Then why do not you answer me, because it is a plain question, whether you did or not? - No, I did not, I said it was after two.</p>
               <p>Now you have got to half after two? - I never said no other.</p>
               <p>You did not alter your note when this woman said she would prove where she was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Your maid servant was there when the person was on the stairs? - She was called up.</p>
               <p>To look at the young woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your wife at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she called up too? - No.</p>
               <p>She did not see her then? - No, she had some ladies with her, but the maid servant came to look at her particularly; she only put her head up; she did, I believe, see her.</p>
               <p>Is she in your service? - She went away from us this morning.</p>
               <p>How came that about, is not she here? - No.</p>
               <p>How came she not to be here, Mr. Willows; did not you tell her the trial was to come on this day? - I told her nothing about the trial; she was not the only person about the house that saw her, my daughter saw her, and the coachman in the yard; the maid servant is not a sober person; she was discharged for being drunken.</p>
               <p>Yet you kept her from the first of January till this day? - I suppose she lived with us six months.</p>
               <p>You was a little alarmed at the time you know? - Very well, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So much so, that you could not hold the young woman but let her go, and was so frightened that you did not follow her? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Now all these things that were put into the indictment, none of them were lost, but they were found on the stairs? - She left them on the landing-place; she had them there first.</p>
               <p>That is as you say? - The first person I spoke to was Mr. Hyde; I did not speak to any of the family first; I saw one as I went in; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Was that the man that brought you the woman? - I do not know who brought her.</p>
               <p>Who came to you? - One of Mr. Hyde's men; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>What did he say; master we have got the woman, that will do for us, did you see the person? - No; what person do you mean.</p>
               <p>Is not he here? - I do not know who it was that did come with the bag.</p>
               <p>What had you no conversation with any one of the runners about this business? - I had no conversation with any of the runners.</p>
               <p>Why you described the person? - Yes, I did; I had opportunity enough of seeing her, and hearing her speak.</p>
               <p>How did you describe her speech? - Very soft; I knew her by her speech as much as any thing, though the next time she came to Mr. Hyde's, she came disguised.</p>
               <p>Who did you describe her to? - To Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>Did he take it down in writing? - I do not know; I did not give it in writing; I described her person.</p>
               <p>Let us hear you describe the person? - A short woman with a pale face, a black bonnet, a black cloak, a black gown and a white apron.</p>
               <p>Now does not every woman almost answer that description; which of the runners was it that told you they would find you a woman that would answer the description as well as they could; was not it the same person that told you, I owe a grudge to a young woman for indicting me at Hicks's Hall some time ago? - I described her very hollow in the upper part of her nose.</p>
               <p>You mean to say upon your oath, that without any other marks at all than what you have told us, Mr. Hyde immediately told you, I know the person; come on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090033"/>Monday you shall have a woman that will answer the purpose? - He said, he believed he knew who it was.</p>
               <p>Who whispered the justice? - Nobody saw her in the house so much as my eldest daughter; she is here; she was in the doorway of the room, about a yard and a half off.</p>
               <p>And the woman had a bonnet? - It was not a deep very bonnet; her face was seen plain enough.</p>
               <p>Was not you told the day afterwards that she was the woman that you was to know again? - I was sent for to see if I knew her, and I did know her.</p>
               <p>What was you told as you was going there, or when you came there? - I went by myself.</p>
               <p>Who spoke to you first, upon your oath? - I believe Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>Are you sure one of the runners did not, upon your oath? - I am pretty sure they did not.</p>
               <p>Where was the woman put? - To the bar.</p>
               <p>No other young woman put there but her? - I believe there was; I think there was another young woman present.</p>
               <p>There was another young woman present; she was a very tall woman perhaps? - I do not know; I know this woman; there was another woman in sight.</p>
               <p>How wide is the bar? - I suppose four feet.</p>
               <p>Why you know to the contrary, because it is the width of a common door? - No, it is wider than a common door; there is another door into the office.</p>
               <p>No; that is the door into the office? - I do not believe it is much less than four feet.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you say you live? - In Leicester-fields? I keep a carpet and upholstery warehouse.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see this woman before that day? - No, never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to part with that maid servant this morning in particular? - She was not a proper person to bring; she is hardly ever sober; we have hired another to come this week past; she is to come to night.</p>
               <p>When was it fixed that she was to go away to-day? - It was fixed two or three days ago.</p>
               <p>Why did not you bring her here as a witness? - I looked upon it that myself and my daughter, and another woman that saw her come into the house, were sufficient witnesses without her, who is never sober.</p>
               <p>Did you ever take that maid to see the prisoner, since she was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Never? - No.</p>
               <p>She has never seen the prisoner, to your knowledge, since she was taken up? - No, we never thought of her being an evidence in the cause.</p>
               <p>Why you called her up to see if she knew the prisoner? - Then it was for want of thought indeed, and nothing else; I declare we had never any other meaning, whatever the Counsel may insinuate.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Who advised you to indict this young woman capitally? - I know nothing at all of that.</p>

               <p>Were you at home when the woman was found by your father in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see that woman? - Yes, in the passage.</p>
               <p>What was she doing in the passage? - She was struggling to get away from my father.</p>
               <p>I believe she did get away from your father? - Yes, Sir, I saw her.</p>
               <p>How long was it before she got away from him? - Not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Your idea of ten minutes cannot be correct; do you mean to say she was struggling with your father ten minutes? - Yes, I dare say she was.</p>
               <p>Have you any idea how long ten minutes is; was it as long as you have been out of Court? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now as near as you can judge, how long might she be struggling with your father? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>How many servants were in the house at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090034"/>that time? - I called them all; the moment she saw the servant come up, she got away from my father.</p>
               <p>Why could not the servants come up sooner? - I did not call the servants till my father told me.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you to call them immediately? - No, not directly.</p>
               <p>Where did you stand? - At the nursery door, that is on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Was her face or her back to you when she was struggling with your father? - Sometimes one, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Did you see her, so as to know her again? - Yes, perfectly well; it is her, I am quite positive of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old are you? - Between sixteen and seventeen.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you did not go to your father's assistance at all? - I heard a person on the stairs, I was in the nursery, then I went to the door, they were in the passage struggling.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go to your father's assistance at all? - No, I staid still, and called the servants; the person struggled and got away, and nobody went after her; I had never seen that person before; the person had a bonnet on.</p>
               <p>Part of the time you saw the face, and part the back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the side was to you, you know you could not see the face at all? - Part of the time she faced me.</p>
               <p>The person did not stand still for you to take an observation of them? - No, Sir, they did not; I never saw the person before; I saw this young woman at Mr. Hyde's, and she was the person I saw at my father's.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the person came from Mr. Hyde's to fetch you and your father? - Yes, I was there.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - My father came the first time to fetch me to Mr. Hyde's, my father asked me, if I knew the woman when I saw her.</p>
               <p>Did not your father tell you there was a woman in custody? - My father said he fancied he had the woman, and desired me to go and see her.</p>
               <p>Then he told you he had been at the Justice's, and he had seen a woman there, who he fancied was the prisoner? - To the best of my remembrance he did; I had not seen the officer from the office before that.</p>
               <p>As you was going to the Justice's, your father and you talked about this matter? - No, Sir, all he said to me was, he fancied the person was in custody.</p>
               <p>The maid did not go with you? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>She has left you to-day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was with you this morning? - Yes, she went this morning.</p>
               <p>What kind of a woman is she? - A cook.</p>
               <p>A decent person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A woman of good character; I mean nothing bad about her? - No Sir, it did not suit my father to keep her.</p>
               <p>What was she parted with for? - Because she was apt to drink.</p>
               <p>She was not tipsy this morning, I suppose? - No Sir, not that I know.</p>

               <p>About a second I should suppose? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Court. She does not seem to be short; do you mean to say the prisoner is a short woman? - She is not very short nor very tall; I do not know her by any thing particular, only I went to her house; Mr. Hyde mentioned it first, and desired we would go there.</p>
               <p>How came he to know her by that description? - I do not know, she had been at our office several times before.</p>

             the magistrate heard her first, he would not let her; we went back to the house with a search-warrant, and found a parcel of keys that I have in my pocket; but nothing belonging to Mr. Willows; Mr. Willows went with us; (the keys produced) she picked out the key of her own house, and here is a turn-screw.</p>

               <p>Who had you the description of this person from, from Mr. Hyde or Mr. Willows? - From Mr. Willows himself; I was called into the room after he had been talking to Mr. Hyde some time; then Mr. Willows gave me the description.</p>

               <p>How came you not to deliver them yourself to the witness? - I ordered him to keep them secure to himself, and he took them to the Justice's; and since that I kept them under my lock and key; he took them from the spot where I left them; I left them just with inside of my bed-room; they were all lying loose.</p>

               <p>I live in Castle-street, Leicester-fields, at one Mr. Bishop's, a chandler's shop; I do not know the number.</p>
               <p>Was this young woman with you on New-year's-day? - On the last day of December she came in the afternoon to see me, and slept with me and my girl all night; I have a husband and a boy; we have two beds; my husband and the boy slept together; in the morning we had our breakfast, and she dined with me on cold beef; she staid with me to the best of my knowledge, till ten minutes, or a quarter before three; she and me went out; she said, she must go home, for her dog and cat would be perished; says I, stay with me, and drink some tea; she said, you might as well go home with me; but I had a cold; I went across Leicester-fields to the corner of Milman-street, opposite the Hay-market; I said, I cannot go any farther, my breath is very short, and we parted; she says, you go home, and make the kettle boil, and I will be at your house in the course of an hour and a half; I went home immediately.</p>
               <p>About what o'clock was it when you parted at the end of the Hay-market? - I think it was about three when we came out of the room, and we were some minutes going that way; I left her there, and she came as she appointed, about five; I did not see her again till she came; I am positive it was near three when she and me went down, and we walked so far; she was never out of the room, nor myself, one moment before that.</p>
               <p>Court. She was with you on the last day of December, and the next day till after dinner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came she to leave you? - She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090038"/>wanted to go home because of her cat and dog; she asked me to go home with her; I told her I did not imagine I could, my breath was so short, I will not be punctual to a minute or two, for I take it to be ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, when we came out; and when I left her, I take it, it was past three; she came back about half after four, or between four and five; the bells had just struck out for prayers.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - At Chelsea, in Clifford's-row.</p>
               <p>What part of Chelsea is that? - Almost by the bridge.</p>
               <p>Did you ever visit her there? - Yes, I have been at her house several times.</p>
               <p>How long are you walking there and back again? - If I was well and hearty, I could go there and back in an hour and half; it is no great length from my place.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Leicester-fields to that part of Chelsea? - I suppose it was not more than a mile.</p>

               <p>What is her general conduct and character? - If I had not thought her a worthy honest person, you should not have seen me here in behalf of a wrong doer; she is the most reputable of all my tenants; I say she is the most reputable of all I have among my neighbours, and I have eleven or twelve; if I thought her to be any thing like the person she is represented here, I would not have come; I do verily, and from my heart, believe, she is injured in this business.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Payne. How was the prisoner dressed the day she was with you? - She had a black gown, a black cloak, bonnet and white apron, and stuff round the bonnet; as she came, so she returned; in the same dress.</p>

               <p>On the 22d of December, a silver table spoon of mine was missing, as my servant informed me; the next morning I was sent for to Sir Sampson Wright's, when I was informed, that the prisoner had offered it to sell; my spoon was there, and produced in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe this man lived in your house as a servant? - No, he did not; he lived with my father in law; he was his coachman.</p>
               <p>Did he occasionally assist at dinner, in carrying down the plate, and other articles, as other servants do? - I suppose he did; there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was carried before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>I believe this was the story he told there, that in carrying down the plate he had trod on a spoon, and bruised it, and afraid of losing his place he sold it? - The bowl of it was bent; nothing of it was deficient.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought me this spoon, and gave it to me to sell; I asked him whose it was; it was on the 22d of December last.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - Between eight and nine in the morning; he said it belonged to a servant that lived in the Minories; I told him that he must send for that servant, and in the mean time I acquainted my brother with it, and sent for a constable, and took him to Bow-street; in about half an hour I was sent for to Bow-street; this is the spoon, in the same state in which the prisoner offered it to sell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I see the crest is the most plain part of it? - Yes, it is very plain.</p>
               <p>Now, I believe, before he went out of your shop, he told you he was a servant in Mr. Crossdill's family, and that he had trod on the spoon, and bruised it? - He did so; not at first, but after I had stopped him, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>He said he meant to replace it with another? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>He offered his silver watch to purchase another with? - He did.</p>
               <p>He said that afterwards; after he had trod upon it he bent it together? - Yes, he said he set his foot upon it.</p>
               <p>Did he say he doubled it together? - First of all he said he trod upon it and bent it; and then, he said, afterwards, he set his foot upon it to bend it as it is now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to prosecutor. How long has this man lived in your father's family? - Two or three months; I do not know who he had his character from.</p>
               <p>During the time he lived in your family, what character did he bear? - Upon my word I cannot say any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you learn at all whether he said any thing of this to his fellow servants? - No, quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Fitter, your father-in-law, remarkably strict with your servants? - Very properly so.</p>
               <p>What was the rule of the family, with respect to breaking any thing? - None at all; with respect to myself, I keep my servants in very good order, and, at the same time, I am rather humane to them, for, when my own servant told me there was a spoon missing, I told him do not make yourself uneasy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell any of your fellow servants of this accident, and to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090047"/>enquire of them whether you would run any risque of displeasure by it? - I was afraid they would mention it to my master, and I was willing to make it good.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in the family? - About five months.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been obliged to make good any damage or accident before? - Yes, Sir, the last place I lived in, I was obliged to make good every thing I lost or broke.</p>
               <p>But not at Mr. Fitter's? - No, Sir, they never mentioned it to me; my witnesses are not come, and I have not had an opportunity to look them up; I lived with Mr. Bray, at Clapham, better than eight months.</p>

               <p>I am partner with Mr. Palethorp, but I have no concern with this garden or shrubs; I was at the house at the time that this happened; on the 23d of December I was alarmed by a tittle underneath my chamber window; between twelve and one at night; I immediately jumped out of bed, and took a cutlass I had in my room, and ran down stairs, and opened the garden door, and found these two men close up to the door, with a blunderbuss presented at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090048"/>them; I asked him how many he had got; he said here are a couple, but I do not know how many more; we took those two into the kitchen, and searched them; and I saw them searched at the watch-house; there were found upon them two knives and a cord; I had seen the state of the shrubbery before, when we came, to examine it, I found they had ben cut by some body in the course of that time; I took them into the shrubbery, and shewed them one bundle compleatly tied up; and another bundle ready to tied up, with a cord underneath; I told them I made no doubt but they were the people that had committed the former depredations; they said they had never been there before; on Friday, the 28th of December, in order to ascertain the value of the bay that these people had cut, another friend and myself went down to Fleet-market, and we found it is of larger value than five shillings considerably, for I gave sixpence for this bit alone, (producing a sprig which he had bought.) and in proportion to the value of this, it must be worth three pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any conversation on this subject with any body before? - No, Sir; no further than buying this piece; the woman I bought it of is here; she told me it cost her four-pence; they pleaded guilty to the charge, and begged pardon; I cannot particularly recollect the words.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how many plants were destroyed that night? - I believe there might be five or six cut down close to the ground.</p>

               <p>Then tell us, upon the oath you have taken, is that of the value of 5 s. or is it not? - The value Sir, for me to buy? we buy it of people that bring it into market; we never ask them any questions where they get it; there are many things that grow wild, and this may grow so.</p>
               <p>Court. When you buy these things, they are brought to you in the market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there is the price of carriage upon them? - May be I buy half a dozen out of six dozen.</p>
               <p>But they would not be worth so much if you was to go to the garden and fetch them yourself? have you judgment enough to say, whether the bays growing would be worth five shillings? - In my opinion they are worth five shillings; I would give 5 s. for them.</p>

               <p>Do you mean a piece that was cut? - Yes, India muslin; they told me that the checque was too small; I reached a whole piece of India muslin out of the same paper; they objected to that, it was too small a pattern; I asked one of the shopmen named Whitworth, to give me some others, which he brought me; he brought a quantity, but among these were four pieces of six-quarters British muslin; I did not shew them all at once, but according to the patterns which I thought would please them, they did not fix for some time; at last they fixed; and I cut the prisoner Roberts a quarter, and gave her change; after she had taken her change she went out of the shop, and the woman with bruised eyes,

            , to the best of my recollection, went out about two minutes before; they were gone out, I imagine, about five or ten minutes; I mentioned to the young fellow in the shop, I suspected they had taken something; he said he had a suspicion of them likewise, by their appearance; on looking about, we found there was one piece of the six-quarter British muslin, which I shewed them last, was gone; I said, one of them has left her muff behind her, which was a black feathered muff; she returned for it.</p>
               <p>Which woman brought it in with her? - Roberts. Two women came back, the two which I served, that is, the prisoner Roberts and Wilson; I threw a piece of print over the muff, and detained them for a minute or two; she said finding her hand cold was the reason of missing her muff; I asked Mr. Ashby whether I should detain the women; he said, you may depend upon it they have not got the property about them; I asked one of the shopmen to follow them, which he did, and I afterwards went into a public-house near the corner of Bartlett's-buildings, where the three prisoners and the other shopman Whitworth was; there were the three prisoners, and three other women; the three prisoners were shuffling together; Mr. Ashby ordered a constable to be fetched; I ran out to the public-house door to watch that they did not come out; Whitworth and the constable went in first, he came back, and I went along with him the second time; it is a very dark small room, and the three prisoners were altogether in a bustle whispering; the other three persons stood by the window in the light.</p>
               <p>How far from these three? - I suppose as far as I am from the table.</p>
               <p>Did they mix with these three? - Not at that time; I pushed the two small women away; says I, let us have none of this work here, get into the light; after that they were examined, and the constable said to me, which shall I take out? I said take out that woman first, that was Wilson, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090050"/>being the woman I most suspected; then I told him to take Roberts, and after that he took the other; we examined them three, we found nothing; two others were examined; the constable came in, and said, let us look round the room, before the other is examined; and upon looking round the room with a candle, we found a bundle under the table, which

             picked up; on opening the bundle, which was tied up in a dark handkerchief, on the top of the bundle there lay a remnant of print, and two pieces of muslin tied up in the same handkerchief; one of these pieces was one that I missed of the six-quarters British; the other piece was one of the two which I reached from behind me on her first asking for muslin, both whole pieces; they had the shop mark upon them; one was only marked that morning; the constable asked me if I knew them pieces; I said yes, I was positive they were the same; they were taken into custody and committed the next day.</p>

               <p>Had you seen the other three women before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had they been in the shop that afternoon? - They had not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Not at the time these women were there, there was not a soul to buy a piece of goods at that counter from the time they came in to the time the goods were missed, nobody except our own people were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop? - Mr. Ashby and Mr. Hardinge, and a porter; we have to pass from one shop to the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for the prisoners Roberts and Wilson. Mr. Price, what may be the value of these two pieces together? - The value of the two, I should rather speak under than over, are, at least, five pounds.</p>
               <p>Have you got the muff here? - No, the woman had the muff back with her.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of the muff? - No great matter, five shillings, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Then this woman had been gone some minutes before she came back for the muff? - She had.</p>
               <p>They had been gone ten minutes without being followed, or any means taken to take them? - Between five and ten minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners Roberts and Wilson were not present in the room when the pieces were found; I believe they had been taken into another room to be examined? - They were taken out one by one into another room to be examined.</p>
               <p>Were they brought back again into the room where this bundle was found, before it was found? - No.</p>
               <p>Then they were not present when it was found? - No.</p>
               <p>The other three women had been still left in the room, while these three women were examined? - They had.</p>
               <p>It was Roberts that purchased the articles? - Yes, Roberts and Wilson came in together; there appeared no connexion at all between them two and the other woman while they were in the shop, as I perceived.</p>
               <p>You have told us that there was a lady in the fore-place? - There was.</p>
               <p>Which of the shops was it in? - It was in the middle shop.</p>
               <p>Was that lady in a situation to have a view of these people while they were dealing with you? - Not all of them.</p>
               <p>How far distant from the counter? - Not as far as from you to me.</p>
               <p>Within two or three feet? - Somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Was she in a situation to see what was going on there, if she had paid attention? - Probably she might, if she had paid attention.</p>
               <p>What other persons were there in the shop besides? - No other customers.</p>
               <p>How many persons belonging to the shop were there? - There was Mr. Ashby; he is here; Mr. Hardinge; he is not here; Mr. Whitworth; he is here; myself and the porter; he is not here; he was in the front shop; I do not believe he was in either of the other shops.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090051"/>Is there a glass partition? - The shops are a distance of a yard or two, and divided by glass doors.</p>
               <p>Then there were this lady, the porter, and Mr. Hardinge; there were in these different shops these three persons that are not here now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long were you searching these three women in the other room? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour? - I cannot tell to half an hour, I was in the room chattering with the other women, I imagine it was half an hour; there was one woman not searched, because we found the property, before we searched her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Counsel for Simpson. You have stated to the Court and the Jury, that the person who calls herself Simpson, went out some time before, about two minutes; had any, and what conversation passed between you and her? - None in the shop, any further than I told her, finding her sitting there, that I would wait upon her in a few minutes; she told me she was not in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Was that in consequence of any thing she had said to you? - No, there was nothing further.</p>
               <p>She said she was not in a hurry; then after you had served Roberts, did you ask her if she wanted any thing? - I asked her at the time Roberts and the woman was in the shop looking at the muslin.</p>
               <p>Then did not you ask her what she would please to have? - No; Whitworth served Simpson.</p>
               <p>In which shop was she served? - In the same shop, and at the same counter.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the woman come into the shop? - I observed the two women come into the shop; Roberts and Wilson came in together.</p>
               <p>Did they come in first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after they came in, did Simpson come in? - Between one and two minutes as near as I can tell.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Ashby; the prisoner Roberts, and Wilson came in first, the other about two minutes after; at the time they came in, I was engaged with a customer in the front shop, just by the house door; I was very soon at liberty, and went to serve the prisoner Simpson in the middle room with some cambrick; I shewed her three or four pieces; she bought some cambrick to the amount of two shillings and eleven pence; she gave me half a crown, and desired I would keep the cambrick and half a crown, and she would call again and pay the five-pence, and she was in want of a body-lining and some callico, and she went out; this is the cambrick she bought; she did not call for it; when these two ladies came for the muff, I followed them to a public-house which they went into, the corner of Bartlett's Buildings: I watched them in the back way; they went up a passage to the back door from Holborn; I followed only two women; I ran round to the front door; I found that the women were altogether in a room; I saw these women with several others through the door; I stopped in the house a few minutes; I then left the house, and ran down Shoe lane to get a constable; the constable and me went into the room where these women were, and I pointed out the two women to the constable; then we asked Mr. Ashby whether he would have these women searched; and he wished to have them searched; then we took them one by one out of the room.</p>
               <p>Who was searched first? - I am not positive; there were five searched, there were six in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you begin with the women that had been in the shop? - I am not positive which of the women were searched first; I believe those that had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Was the woman that was not searched, one of the women that went into the shop? - No, the woman that was not searched was not in the shop, he searched five of them; we then thought it necessary to look round the room, and I looked underneath the table and picked up this bundle; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090052"/>opened it before the constable; I believe Mr. Price was in the room; I found these two pieces of muslin; the constable has the bundle with the whole contents.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the time that this bundle was found, was either of the three present prisoners in the room? - They were not; there were some other persons in the shop; and some were there who are not here now; there was a lady in the shop, the wife of a merchant.</p>
               <p>How long might you have been searching these five women? - I cannot tell for a few minutes; about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Were the other three permitted to go at large? - No, they were taken.</p>
               <p>How many of them were taken? - They were all six taken, and afterwards three of them were discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was Harding and the porter in the shop when the women were purchasing the muslins? - Mr. Harding was for a certainty; I believe, the porter was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I think you said you served Simpson with some cambrick? - I did.</p>
               <p>She gave you half a crown, and told you she should come again? - She did.</p>
               <p>When you went to the house, you fixed on two, you did not fix on any more? - I did not; the women were in a very small dark room, and it did not strike me that this was the woman that bought the cambrick.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure now that she was? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I keep the public-house the corner of Bartlett's Buildings; one of these two prisoners that are alike in size, (Simpson and Wilson) came to my house between three and four; she asked for a glass of brandy; she sat about a yard and a half from the bar in a box, I handed it to her; she said, she had some company coming; and soon after, four or five women came in for something to drink, and one of the women came to her, and said, they were come; I served them with some liquor separately, and I shewed Whitworth and the officer into the parlour, and after the fifth person was searched, the bundle was found; I thought the women seemed to be acquainted.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any body been in the room before these women came? - It is a back parlour, and there was no fire; I do not know that any body had been there, but my own family had dined there.</p>

               <p>So, he treated you, did he? - Yes, he wished us to go and drink; we rather wished not to go in with him, because we were twenty yards from our duty.</p>

               <p>Court to Stewart. Was the horse you saw at the Green-yard, and that which was taken the next morning to Bow-street, the same horse you lost? - It was the same horse, saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Are any of Mr. Goddard's people here? - No, none of them; his Christian name is John; I took the horse home on Wednesday night; it was a cropped bay horse, fourteen hands and an inch high.</p>
               <p>Had you ever rode him before? - Yes, a great many times; I knew him perfectly well; I have had him a week together in my possession.</p>
               <p>Court to Palmer. What did this man bring, the horse away for? - I do not know; I fancy he was in liquor, and did not know where he was going.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it when you saw him at the Savoy? - It was half past seven when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Did you find out where he had been? - No otherwise, than I heard he had been riding up and down where the centries were, and at both the playhouses, and that he was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 1st of December, I went to the house of Mrs. Burkett, where I saw the three prisoners and this woman, and I bought some things; and in looking over them I saw these two table-cloths, and considered them as of no value, and the woman was present, and I gave them to her.</p>
               <p>You bought some of the other things? - Yes, seven sheets, eight table-cloths, with these two, and a white cotton counterpane; I gave three guineas for them, I bought them at a house in Duck-lane; Mrs. Burkett's.</p>
               <p>How came this woman there? - She was there when I went in.</p>
               <p>What had she to do there? - I do not know, she was there before I went in.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am not any thing at present; I am engaged in something.</p>
               <p>What was you at that time? - A pawnbroker at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Was you a witness on the last trial? - Yes, to prove my buying the things of the prisoners who were then convicted.</p>
               <p>You was then a pawnbroker? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090057"/>Was you sent for to buy these things? - No, I was sent for by the prisoner to buy them.</p>
               <p>Are those two table cloths, in your judgment of no value? - They would not to me, because I could not have made any thing of them; I thought if they were sold, they would only answer the purpose of cuting up for napkins or clouts.</p>
               <p>What would you have given for two such? - I would not have bought them; if I had them, I would have sold them for eighteen pence, or two shillings, most likely.</p>

               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said that a young man let her into the room; I asked her how she came in, for I had locked the door; she said a young man let her in, unlocked or unbolted the door; she could not say which; there was no bolt on the outside, it was within; she was searched, but there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Then you had not lost any thing? - Nothing was taken out of the room, but the sheets were taken from the bed, and every little thing that laid about put into a pillow case that was taken off the pillow.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find the room; were any of the doors or windows forced? - No, not at all; somebody held out their hand, and gave me a key, which in my slurry I thought was my own key, but found the next day it was a strange key; there was nobody present but the people that are here; my servant went out about half past one; I went up before four, and double locked the door, and put the key into my pocket; when I heard the noise I said, my God, there is somebody in my room, I am afraid.</p>
               <p>Were the windows shut? - They were shut; they were casement windows, and a two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>What time had you been up? - Rather before four.</p>
               <p>Not after that? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand you had some conversation with this boy, I want you to state it to my Lord and the Jury? - When we first took him in Dyott-street he denied the fact; I then took him by the collar into my parlour, and asked him whether he would be obstinate or tell the truth; he then requested I would not send him to gaol; I told him it very much depended upon that, whether he was in one story, and told the whole truth of the business; I told him if he explained the whole of the transaction, from the first to the last, that in that case, I should certainly be as favourable to him as the nature of the case would admit; till that he denied knowing any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am content.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Nothing else passed but that, with respect to promises or threats? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord has decided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I submit, this is not evidence of confession, but that he would be as favourable as he could; only that he would be as favourable as the law would allow; and that it is not that kind of threat which might induce a man to take upon himself a crime of which he was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. To be sure you will take the whole together; then it stands in this way: the boy at first denied it, and, if there was any doubt of the operation the thing had on his mind, it is manifest, for the prosecutor still accuses him as a person guilty; he then stipulates, but do not take me to gaol; why, says the prosecutor, that will depend on your own conduct; now, I have understood the principle always to have been laid down in this way: that if there is any thing that operates either by threat, by menace, or promise, so that the party is seduced into saying anything by which he may accuse himself. Cases happen here constantly; such as saying, it is better for you to confess: and saying, it will depend on your explaining this, whether you go to gaol or not, has the full effect on the mind of such a boy, that the dread of hanging would have on a man of riper years. I remember a case, a man of the name of Thompson was indicted for stealing a note out of the shop of Prescott's; he was taken in the country, the man that took him in the country said to him, it will be in vain for you to deny this, for it is all known in London; there was no more, the Court were of opinion, that the man's mind was not perfectly free; I mention that as an extreme case, most certainly; but so far has the tenderness of your Lordships gone in favour of liberty and life.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very clear, that that which a man is induced to say, either by the influence of threats and menaces, or by the influence of hopes of favour, never can be made use of against him; that is a decided principle; the only doubt that occurred to my mind, was, whether this person could, by this sort of declaration made to him by Kirkman, whether he could be said to be induced by that to say, that he is guilty; certainly he is not induced by that to say he is guilty; he is induced to tell the truth, whether that truth made for him, or against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090060"/>him; if Kirkman kept faith with him, he would be intitled to favour; nevertheless, it has been so universally held, that every thing that is drawn from a man, by the hopes of favour, or the influence of threats, whether it is within the strict terms of the engagement or not, yet, what he says, under these circumstances, shall not be received as evidence against him; and though I rather rank that for the sake of public justice, it were to be wished, that the principle should not be extended quite so large as it has been, yet I think, as it has been so extended, it would not be a prudent thing how to attempt to vary it; people must understand, that when they are talking to persons in this situation, what they say, is to come from them without any bias, or influence of hopes or favour; therefore, it is my opinion, that the evidence cannot be received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Wilson. I agree with the Lord Chief Baron; after it has been carried so far, I think it would be too much now to vary it.</p>
               <p>Court. What proof have you of the chain coming into the hands of the other prisoner? - Only finding it there, by the boy's saying so.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know that this is not a case to go to the Jury against the boy; the boy is set to watch this chain, and is to be paid; in less than five minutes the boy is gone, the chain is afterwards found; perhaps it will turn out, afterwards, how this came into the hands of this man; the Jury must exercise their judgment upon it.</p>
               <p>Kirkman. We found the chain at the prisoner Sherrard's house, in Bowl-yard, St. Giles's; it is an old iron shop; we found the chain under the counter; we took the chain and the man together; when we found the chain, I asked him how he came to buy a chain for so little money as one shilling and ten-pence halfpenny, of such lads as the prisoner, that was then with me, and another that was described to me; he said he had given the full value of it, meaning three farthings a pound, and meant to sell it for a penny; and, that it was worth no more in his shop, to sell again, than a penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he had given for it? - He did not.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for supposing he gave three farthings a pound? - He said it was the value, and that he never sold such a chain for more than a penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Did you know the weight of it? - From the boy's description it was 30 lb. we weighed it afterwards, and found it 36 lb. that is six pounds more than the boy had sold it for; we took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say of whom he bought it? - He acknowledged having bought it of the prisoner Cheshum and another; the boy was present.</p>

               <p>Did the boy say any thing then? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was the chain dirty or clean when you found it? - It was quite wet; it was a wet afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner Sherrard tell you what account these boys gave him of the manner in which they came by it? - He did not; he always contended he gave the full value for it; till on the second examination, he denied having bought it at all.</p>
               <p>Was that examination taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Was it signed by him? - It was not.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of its being there? - He said, at the second hearing, that the boys brought it into the shop, and that he had suspected it to be stolen; that he desired them to leave it, and, if it was not owned in two or three days, he would buy it, but that he had not then given any thing for it. (The chain produced and deposed to.) Here is the point of the hook bent; a notch in the chain, that was cut one day going down the hill.</p>
               <p>Is not that a common thing to happen to a chain? - That might happen to any other chain; I can swear to the chain.</p>
               <p>Kirkman. I do not know the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. The chain is as good as new.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CHESHUM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The boy took it, and then he called me to take it; says he, old one, come and take this chain; says I, what is it? says he, I am going to sell it in this yard, at an ironmonger's shop; says I, I will stop at the door till you come out, and he gave me some money; I do not know whether it was for the chain, or what it was; I believe my mother is out at the door.</p>
               <p>Court is prisoner Sherrard. You are charged with buying a very useful chain, weighing 36 lb. capable of doing a great deal of service, of two boys that could not be supposed but to have stolen it; how can you justify such a conduct as that?</p>
               <p>PRISONER SHERRARD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>About five, on the 27th of December, this lad and another came in with a chain, they threw it on the counter; I was in the parlour, at tea, with a friend of mine; we had been drinking tea some time; they asked me if I would buy it? I said no, I would not; and I asked them how they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090063"/>came by it; they said, it had been dropped by a timber carriage, in Broad St. Giles's; I said, I should not buy it; says the boy, if you will not buy it, I will leave it by G - d; and he threw it on the counter; I said, if you do prove that it is found, and is honestly come by, in a day or two, I will buy it, if you find no owner; but I mean to advertise it first; Freeman, Mr. Kirkman, and this boy came in; they said, they had a search-warrant, and they took me in custody; and Freeman and Kirkman ran behind my counter, and trod on the chain; they took it and me to the justice; Mitchell, and Treadway, and another, staid on my premises, while they took me to the office; I told them I had not bought it, that I had not had it in my possession half an hour; and the two boys did come in with the chain, and I stopped it, and told them I would not buy it; there never was any such word mentioned any where, that I had given the full value for it.

               <p>I live at No. 6, Pultney-court, Broad-street, Carnaby-market; I am a shoemaker; I am acquainted with the prisoner Sherrard; I was at his house the day after boxing-day in the Christmas week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What, Christmas-boxing do you mean? - Yes; when we had done tea we went into the shop; and a boy came in with a chain; he asked Sherrard to buy it; Sherrard asked him how he came by it; the boy said he found it in Broad St. Giles's; he saw it drop from a timber cart; Mr. Sherrard said, he doubted he did not find it; he said, he would keep it two or three days, and if not advertised, he would buy it; Sherrard took the chain, and threw it under the counter; after the boy went out, Mr. Sherrard said, he doubted he did not come honestly by it; the boy went away while I continued there; I went away before the officers came; while I staid, he did not buy it, nor did any money pass; I heard all that passed between them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>So you and Mr. Sherrard immediately suspected the boys did not come honestly by this chain? - I did not; Mr. Sherrard said so.</p>
               <p>How came you not to stop the boys? - I do not know, it was not my business; I did not know any thing of the affair; I did not attempt to stop either of the boys, nor did Mr. Sherrard; the boys went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>He did not lay hold of the boys at all? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many boys were there? - One, Sir.</p>
               <p>Only one boy? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>No money passed? - No.</p>
               <p>The money was not divided between any body? - I do not know about money; I saw no money pass.</p>
               <p>Where was you all this time? - I was in Mr. Sherrard's back parlour at tea, but after I had done tea, I came out of the parlour into the shop, and was going away; I did not take much notice of the boy; I do not think that is the boy; I am sure that is not the boy; he was a lesser boy than that.</p>
               <p>How many chains were in Mr. Sherrard's shop that day? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you are sure that is not the boy? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the chain; I went to fetch my brother and Vernon from the public-house, and Vernon drank tea there; and when they had drank tea, they went into the shop together; I do not know any thing further; I was about my business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sherrard. When Mr. Kirkman went to Mr. Walker's; he said, your Lordship, I have undertaken another job; I believe I shall be a thief-catcher in time; I have transported once or twice; pray, gentlemen, says he to Mr. Fletcher, who are the Grand Jury this sessions; I will take care there shall be a bill found, depend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090064"/>upon it, Mr. Walker, you will succeed in your business, I do not doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. Did all that pass.</p>
               <p>Kirkman. It is altogether false; the officers are in Court somewhere, that were present as well as the carter; I beg they may be called.</p>
               <p>You say this did not pass? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>You did say in your examination that the prisoner when first you went in, and had asked how he could buy the chain of these boys? said to you, that he had given the full value of it; now, recollect yourself, what he did he say? - He said, he had given the full value of it.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time say any thing to you, of his having stopped the chain till there would be an owner for it? - He did not till afterwards before the Justice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Sherrard called four witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of November last; as I was coming down Holborn-hill; I observed a country-man standing there, facing Field-lane; I had just left two of our patrols; it was about four in the afternoon; the prisoner passed by him quick, and immediately turned back again; I rather thought that was suspicious; I stopped, and suffered the prisoner to go from the country-man; and I went to the countryman, and said, do you know that man? no, says he; then says I, be cautious how you go into strange company; I said no more; I went up Snow-hill, and the prisoner followed me, and said d - n your eyes, or b - st your eyes, what business have you to trouble your head; when I had got about half way up Snow-hill, he came d - ng and b - ng again; a mob assembled; I told him to go about his business, or I should take him in custody; somebody said, d - n you, shew your authority; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090065"/>there was the word go it; and he struck me over the head, and gave me two black eyes, and I received a kick; one of our patrols came to my assistance, and we took him into custody, and he has been in gaol ever since; as to his returning from transportation, I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord and gentlemen of the Jury, I had been drinking with a ship-mate of mine, and I was coming up Snow-hill, and this constable accosted me; here is my defence in writing.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen; I humbly beg leave to lay myself at your feet, to implore your mercy, not being guilty of returning from transportation, pursuant to my sentence; I received his Majesty's most gracious pardon, on condition of going abroad for five years; I immediately shipped myself on board the Jane, captain Walker, bound to the coast of Guinea; I was out in her most of the time, but was ill, and not able to do my duty when the ship was at Liverpool; I could not go on my second voyage; I was obliged to part with all my clothes, and being in a strange place, I was reduced to the greatest distress, and in want of necessaries; in this deplorable situation, (in a very sickly state) I came to London, in hopes my friends would assist me, that I might go out with the India fleet, which would have been done, if I had not been detained; but I hope I may be restored to liberty, and proceed to sea in the next fleet; when I shall as in duty bound, ever pray.

               <p>Where did you find these buttons? - In the cellar among the loose papers in the lower warehouse; these buttons were kept in the upper warehouse on the 15th and 17th; I took notice of them on the 15th; I also found a pound of thread; and on the 17th, there were three balls of twist with the buttons; in consequence of finding them there, I put a private mark on the thread, and likewise on the twist, but not on the buttons; I cannot tell the day I marked them; it was one of the days when I found them.</p>
               <p>Look into your own memorandum, and fix on those parcels; what is that paper? - It is a copy of the original.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the marshal-men; I went to Annand's house the 29th of December; Mr. Welsford and Mr. Jackson went with me; I found a number of articles which I have here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You found them among other goods I suppose? - Yes, Sir, in his shop.</p>
               <p>What shop does he keep? - A haberdasher's; what they call a piece-broker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you observe what Annand did, when you went for these goods? - I found him behind the counter; the things were found in the shop; I was obliged to take him from behind the counter, because he made a snatch at one of the drawers where the buttons were, and the twist; and another drawer they pulled out themselves; that was the drawer he made a snatch at to take one of the marks off; he was very loth to shew them any thing; I advised them to look regularly round, and not to put things into disorder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He lives in Shoemaker's Row? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went there, you thought he made a kind of snatch at the drawers in which they were? - There were a great many gross of buttons there.</p>
               <p>How many bundles did you take? - Several bundles; I suppose half a dozen.</p>
               <p>The threads were not among the buttons, nor the buttons among the thread? - No.</p>
               <p>But every thing in the place where any other piece-broker would keep his goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Jackson. Look at these things; is there any there that you marked? - This silk I marked with a knot, which I have tied with one of the skains, and here is another on this; and I have the skains which will match them likewise.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090067"/>Mr. Sylvester. As to the colour you may match them at any haberdasher's? - The mark is a knot that I tied on one of the skains.</p>
               <p>How did that enable you to know that from the other? - There was no knot on the other skain when I had it, I am clear in that; I examined it particularly before I knotted it, and there was no knot at all; none of the skains had any knot on them, before I knotted them; I cannot say whether I knotted one skain or two, nor whether I put one knot or more; I did not observe any knot when I looked into it.</p>
               <p>Court. This will render your marks very uncertain indeed, for every skain on this head of silk has a knot.</p>
               <p>The Foreman of the Jury. Every skain of silk is knotted on account of the dyer, but where there are two knots, it is a private mark.</p>
               <p>Court to Jackson. Can you, on any recollection you have, state the mark you put on these articles of silk? - I put no other mark than specifying the colour, and tying the knotts; I took one of the skains off the head of silk, and I made a knot on the skain of silk, above that that was made by the dyer; I undid each head of silk, and I took a skain out of each head of silk; I am not clear whether I made one or two additional knotts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not know how many knots you made in a skain, nor how many skains you knotted? - No.</p>
               <p>Then is it possible for you to swear by that mark, that these are the heads you knotted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Suppose there had been another head of silk having one skain or two with additional knots, could you distinguish it? - I could not tell it.</p>
               <p>Then if you had found any head of silk of the same quality and colour to what you have missed, you would have supposed it to be the one that you have knotted? - Here is the sample, this head I know nothing of, only by the colour; I took this skain of silk out of Mr. Welsford's silk, which matched it; here is a head, but I do not recollect whether I matched it or not, I judge of it from the sample; this is a common colour much made use of now, and the other was made use of two or three years ago; here is another blue, which I do not recollect whether I knotted or not; I judge of it from the colour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you any threads there? - Here is a pound of thread which has my private mark upon it; it is a kind of mark that when goods come in, we tick them off from the invoice; there are two marks, one a kind of tick, and I believe I made a mark with a pen; it is my mark, I know it; I marked these that I might know them again; the two marks were both put at the same time; I put the mark on at the time I found the goods; this purple thread was found at Annand's house; here is also some twist that I cut a piece off, the twist I made up in balls and pinned it up again; here are the bits that match, and here is a very particular colour; that is what we call a quaker's brown; there are more goods which I found, but I did not mark them at Annand's house; I have nothing else that I speak to from pen-marks, but that purple thread.</p>
               <p>Where was it, and upon what occasion that you marked these things? - I cannot exactly tell; when the pound of thread was marked, there were seventeen pounds weight of thread taken at several times; I marked several, of which that is one; I marked them, in order that if they went out of the house I might know them again, if they were found; they were among the things in the cellar; I marked them in the cellar, and left them where I found them; here are a great number of buttons, but I cannot say any thing to the buttons, because they are not my marking.</p>
               <p>What marks are on the buttons? - The price marks.</p>
               <p>Who usually makes the price marks? - It is those that receive the goods into the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Welsford. They were marked by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090068"/>Mr. Goldsmith; I know his mark, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. About what hour in the day was it that you discovered these things in the cellar? - Sometimes in the forenoon, and sometimes in the afternoon; when I missed them in the evening it was about seven or eight; the prisoner Langford was a porter to Mr. Welsford; I missed one of the articles one night in particular, on a Saturday night; he went into Holborn with a parcel; I saw the goods before he went, and when he was gone, I missed the goods; it was the Saturday, or the Saturday but one before Mr. Welsford came to town; he carried out a parcel for Mr. Welsford, who was then on his journey, and was sent to the George and Blue Boar inn, in Holborn; Mr. Welsford lives No. 9, Lad-lane; he was sent out about seven; I followed him to see where he went to; he came back between eight and nine; he was gone about an hour and half; that Saturday was about eight or nine days before Mr. Welsford came to town; he came home on the Christmas eve, and this was the Saturday before that.</p>
               <p>Had you on that day, before he went seen any goods in that cellar, and marked them? - Yes, I am sure of that, not above half an hour before he went out.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what kind of goods those were? - I think they were threads and buttons; I am not clear; I followed him out, to see where he went to, but I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Have you any particular recollection applied to any other particular day? - No, none but that Saturday.</p>
               <p>You sent him? - I asked him who he had given the parcel to; He told me he had given it to the coachman who was on the box going off, and the bill was given back to have the parcel put in it; I did not ask him any thing about his staying, any further than that.</p>
               <p>Did you go down at any time when Langford was at home, to see if any of the goods in the cellar were missing? - When he was at home I saw the goods below; when he was gone out in the evening, the goods were gone; that was generally the case every other night, and that was the case on the Saturday I speak off; I cannot recollect the other days of the month.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Langford and Kimber together, after Kimber had left your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you see them together? - I have seen them in Lad-lane together, as I have been passing, but I did not take particular notice; Kimber has been at our house to match several times, since he left our house; I have seen them at different other places, in the course of my going backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You are a shopman to Mr. Welsford? - Warehouseman.</p>
               <p>He is a very capital warehouseman in Lad-lane? - We do a good deal of business.</p>
               <p>Who serves in the shop besides you? - There is one Mr. Goldsmith besides me, nobody else but Mr. Welsford, and the porter, he might reach an article by our orders.</p>
               <p>I suppose if I was to send to Mr. Welsford's shop, I could match this clue? - I cannot tell; you might find something near it; I do not know but you might match it to a shade; I do not know that you could match it any where else.</p>
               <p>Now as to the thread, when you tick off the number of the parcels, do you tick them from the invoice? - We do not mark them, they are wrapped up in a dozen at a time.</p>
               <p>So if I want a pound of thread, you would serve me with this? - Yes; if you had asked for a pound of thread, I should have given you that.</p>
               <p>With respect to this Saturday? - I believe it was the 15th.</p>
               <p>You have also been seen with Kimber, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He came there to match goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Welsford. I went to Annand's by virtue of a warrant; we looked for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090069"/>thread, and among a number of pounds of thread, we found this particular pound of thread; Jackson immediately said, this is one of the pounds of thread, which I found concealed in the lower warehouse; that was in the hearing of Annand; after that we asked to look at the silk, which Annand was very unwilling to produce, and we found the several heads which are here, which correspond with the patterns.</p>
               <p>Did Annand shew you them? - I believe at last he pulled out the papers himself; I believe so, but I am not sure; there we found this scarlet match, that is what we matched after we had matched the twist balls; we matched every one that we had patterns to look for; then I desired to see the button drawer, which he was very unwilling to pull out; I believe I pulled it out myself; then the first I saw was this No. 919; there was my mark on it, and the prisoner Annand being very near me tore it off; I wrote this at the time I saw him do it; I desired the marshalman to take him away, or else he would tear off the marks of all; I found all these buttons with my shop mark upon them; it is in Goldsmith's hand-writing, which I know clearly, and Goldsmith will prove it.</p>
               <p>Did Annand deal with you? - Never in my life to my knowledge; I have called upon him with goods, I have called upon him for orders, but he said I sold my goods too dear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe when you got Langford into custody you threatened him? - I do not recollect any such thing, nor any promise.</p>
               <p>Was that made by Mr. Welch in your presence? - I do not recollect any threat or promise made by Mr. Welch, I charged him with robbing me of these particular articles; I said, we are in possession of the knowledge of it; you may see by these banks of silk, these were taken off from the heads that were concealed in the lower warehouse; it was on Friday after Christmas-day; he denied the fact at that time; and Mr. Welch said, Mr. Welsford, you may as well call up the constable, which I was going to do; and as I opened the door, then he said I will confess.</p>
               <p>Had not you told him before he confessed that it would be more favourable if he told you? - I have no recollection of any such thing either one way nor the other.</p>
               <p>- WELCH sworn.</p>
               <p>I was present; I told the man there appeared very strong suspicions of his guilt, and also from what Annand said; and I told him he had better be candid, and tell the whole truth; and I believe, if I had not bid Mr. Welsford call up the constable, he would not have confessed at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Then after that I cannot hear what Langford said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you take up any body else? - I took up Kimber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe Kimber was examined, and committed for trial? - Yes, there was an application made to the Court to examine him as a witness.</p>
               <p>You buy your buttons to make a profit on them? - No doubt on it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, any other man who can buy them of the manufacturer, buys them cheaper than he can have them of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No. 919 means the size and quality of the buttons? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>If I was a button maker, I should have a like card of buttons, with a like number? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your shop-mark is the price-mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you sell a gross together, you sell them with the price marked upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I wanted to buy a gross of you, I should have them with the mark upon them, as well as 919? - In general you would; we found the thread first.</p>
               <p>Then the papers of silk were produced to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before the buttons were found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090070"/>Suppose you were to match them for me, would not you have done it? - Yes, there were many other balls there; I do not think I could have matched any of the patterns a second time.</p>
               <p>The buttons are the common sizes? - There are different sizes.</p>
               <p>Who is your manufacturer? - A man at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Did you tell him any thing more? - I did not say any thing more to him; he bought it without any questions; I do not recollect I told him any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell him any thing about Langford? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him where you lived? - No.</p>
               <p>Never at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he ever, at any time, ask you any questions how you came by them? - No.</p>
               <p>What were the goods you used to sell to him? - Silk, twist, thread and buttons.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you any questions who you were; or any thing of that sort? - No, Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>Did you go there frequently? - About twice a week.</p>
               <p>You lived with Mr. Welsford about four months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you, at that time, an opportunity of knowing the prices of these things? - Yes; he gave me 16 s. a pound for such silk as this.</p>
               <p>How much a gross for the buttons? - Three shillings, and four shillings.</p>
               <p>When did you sell the last parcel of goods to Annand? - I think it was Christmas Eve.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what that was? - Four pounds of thread.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other time in particular before Christmas Eve, of receiving any goods from Langford, or selling them? - Yes; on Friday, the week before, I received some.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect ever receiving any of a Saturday? - No, I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know, of your own knowledge, whether Langford ever went to Annand's himself? - No, Sir, I do not; he never went with me.</p>
               <p>Should you know any of the things that you sold; I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time of day did you generally go to Annand's? - About eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Jury. I wish the witness to be asked whether he sold the heavy dye and the light dye at the same price? - They were all sold at the same price, 16 s. altogether.</p>
               <p>Are the buttons all breast buttons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is an unexpected pleasure to you to get into this part of the Court? - It is.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in Newgate? - About a week.</p>
               <p>They talked of sending you to Botany for seven years; did not they? - I was afraid so.</p>
               <p>So you are swearing now to get yourself out of the scrape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now my honest friend, these articles are bought frequently in a piece-broker's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you use to go there to buy pins and needles? - I have bought needles.</p>
               <p>Did not you represent yourself to the prisoner Annand to be a distressed taylor? - Upon my oath I did not; I used sometimes to buy a halfpennyworth of needles; I never represented myself to this man to be a taylor; I used to buy needles because I used them myself in mending my own clothes and shirts, I never bought more than a half-pennyworth of needles in the whole.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you, that unless you could charge Annand, you would be hanged or transported? - No.</p>
               <p>You was a thief as long as you could, and then you turned receiver? - I never stole any thing.</p>
               <p>You did not tell your master what was going forwards? - No.</p>
               <p>You set this man on to rob him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you do not go this time, you will go soon? - I will take care not to do any thing to go.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care, if ever you are caught<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090072"/>tripping, you will certainly forfeit your life, and expect no favour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Welsford. What is the value of this silk? - These are twenty-six shillings, and the others thirty shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>What is the thread worth? - Two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>What are the buttons worth a gross? - Four shillings and sixpence they cost me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it is an article he dealt in? - Yes; the price of silk is varying; I suppose it was worth about 24 s. when I purchased.</p>

               <p>I am constable and patrol, of Dowgate-ward; a partner goes with me; we go on at dusk, and stay till nine; at half past six on Monday night, the 17th of December, we passed Mr. Lomas's door; just as we got to the compting-house, which is the house-door, I saw the shutters move backwards, towards the street; I went forwards a step, and they opened a little wider; half open; I saw the prisoner at the bar, withinside the window of the compting-house; he seemed very much flurried, and in a fright, in a great hurry; he came over the window, which was about as high as I could reach; and I caught him in my arms, and I threw him down; he said, do not stop me! do not stop me! I have not done any harm, I belong to the house, I said, I will stop you to know; I knocked at the door, and found he did not; I took him into the compting-house; I told the prosecutor's son, and we found the upper sash was pulled down, and there were marks of a person's feet on the desk, and on the floor; fresh dirt; and there were papers on the compting-house desk, that had been trod on by dirty feet; in looking further, Mr. Lomas's son picked up a bag; this is the bag, and there was a nest of drawers, containing three drawers that were close to the desk; this drawer (produced) was the middle drawer, and was out of its place, and lay on the compting-house door by this bag; I searched the prisoner; I found nothing upon him of any suspicion, but this; which is a thing, when you pull out the cork, it lights a match, and there are matches in it; it is in the same state, as when I pulled it out of his pocket; (a bottle of phosphorous produced) I asked the prisoner how he came there; he said, he had come from Bethnal-green, and that he called on his father in Wood-street; after that he took a walk from Wood-street for a little air down that way; and going past Mr. Lomas's house, a man pulled his hat off, and threw it into the compting-house, and he got up and leaned over to get his hat out; on his examination at Guildhall; he said, it was two coal-heavers that came by, and threw his hat in.

            . Was your father at home this evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was at home besides you and the servant-maid? - Mrs. Lomas, and a young man, and two children.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening is your compting-house window shut generally? - As soon as it is dark; it is my business to shut it up; I had been in the compting-house about twenty minutes or half as hour before this; I was there about six.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090074"/>What situation was it in then? - The shutter was not put to, and the sash was up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. Which of the sashes was up? - The top sash was up, and the bottom sash is nailed down.</p>
               <p>Was the top sash up or down? - It was shot; I looked to see if the shutters were to; I did not shut these; I went up to tea; I intended to shut them when I came back.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you quite sure that the top was up? - I am quite sure the sash was up.</p>
               <p>Where did these drawers belong to? - To a nest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Did you know whether that was in its place when you looked in the compting-house before? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with any certainty? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice, whether it was or not? - I did not take any notice.</p>
               <p>How came you not to shut the shutter? - I was coming down again.</p>
               <p>Had you any light with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you could not see whether the drawer was in its place or not? - No.</p>
               <p>How could you see the window was up? - By the lamps in the street.</p>
               <p>Are you clear that you saw that it was up? - Yes; somebody rung at the bell, and I went down to them, and I staid at the compting-house door, talking to them on the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the compting-house at all? - I was at the door on the outside; the compting-house door was open.</p>
               <p>In the room, or in the passage? - In the passage.</p>
               <p>Then you was not in the room? - No. at the door.</p>
               <p>Is that door opposite the windows? - It is on one side; I could see the side that the windows were on; the windows are to the right hand, and the door was where I am.</p>
               <p>You was not within the door? - I was part in, not quite.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell me before you found it to be material that you was part in the door? - I was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Could you standing in the passage, see the windows that are on the right hand-side of the door? - There is a window in the passage that looks into the compting-house from the passage; I could see it from there; I did see it through there, before I went in.</p>
               <p>Now, did you see it through the window or through the door? - I saw it through the window, and through the door too.</p>
               <p>Is the window on the same side with the door which looks into the passage? - Yes, it goes almost to the other window; so that standing in the passage, you can see through the window.</p>
               <p>How came you to look particularly at this time, when you was in the passage? - To see whether it was shut or no.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - If it was not to have shut it.</p>
               <p>Does that bag belong to any body in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Consider, you are upon your oath; you say that you went down upon a knock at the door to speak to some person about business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If the person had not come, you would have had your tea, and would not have taken care of your compting-house till after your tea? - No.</p>
               <p>You told us it is your general duty to take care of the compting-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe, that if this window had been discovered to have been left open by any neglect of your's, or want of care of yours; that you would have been very severely reprimanded, for exposing the house to be robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nothing else brought you down but to speak to this person about business? - No.</p>
               <p>It was business of some consequence to your father? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Then your attention was taken upon this business very much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not mean to look at all about the compting-house, till after you had finished your tea? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090075"/>This window in the passage is public to the street door and the compting-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You just let him in, I suppose; and he stood pretty near the street door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was conversing with him as near as you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any enquiry made of you by the family after this happened; whether you had left the window open or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After this happened, who spoke to you about it? - Mrs. Lomas.</p>
               <p>What did she say to you? - I do not rightly recollect.</p>
               <p>As near as you can? - She asked, why it was not shut.</p>
               <p>She was angry with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you tell her? - I told her I intended to have shut it after tea.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about the sash being shut or not shut, by either you or her? - No, I do not recollect whether there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Wainwright. Had you gone past that house that evening before? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my Counsel; I went to Wood-street, to the sign of the Magpye, to meet my father, between five and six; he was not there, my wife had lain in only three weeks; I was going to my wife's sister at the Old Swan, at the bottom of the bridge, and coming along two men insulted me, and used me very ill, and they took my hat and threw it away, and it happened to lodge on the window sill, and I got up and reached it down; and these two men came and asked me what I did there, and I told them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's witnesses called, but did not appear.</p>
               <p>Court to Lomas. At the time you went to speak to this man about business, where was you called from? - From up stairs.</p>
               <p>When had you gone up stairs? - About five.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Were there not plenty of people that saw him take the handkerchief off his neck to lend it to me to put it on my head? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that you did not lend her, or give her the handkerchief? - Not to my knowledge, I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say at the Cock you believed I was the person who had your money, but was not sure? - I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, if I would give you a guinea, you would go about your business? - I heard nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - I did not, to my knowledge; I never heard it.</p>
               <p>That will not do? - I did not say so; I told her, if I got my own money, I should be willing to be quiet, for I did not want to go to law with her at all; I was willing to drop her at the same time if I could.</p>
               <p>Was your purse and the other handkerchief ever found; that you know of? - No, Sir.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I saw her take a handkerchief out of the prisoner's pocket at the publick house; they went away together; she had it in her hand or a considerable time after she took it; they were not there a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell him that she was picking his pocket? - I told him of it; not long after they went away; it was the same day that I saw them going together; I did not mind it; I knew he did not know it at the time.</p>
               <p>Then why did not you tell him? - I cannot say; he was drunk; he was not very sober.</p>
               <p>Did not you come into the house with him, and was drinking with him all the morning? - No, it was after eight when I came there.</p>
               <p>What pocket did she take this out of? - Out of his jacket pocket; there was another man with his back turned to us as he was going out of the room door.</p>
               <p>Were not there a number of people drinking in the ale-house? - There were some women in the tap-room; we were in the parlour; he was a bricklayers labourer; I am a farmer in Essex, with Mrs. Fox; I came to an acquaintance in town.</p>
               <p>Do you live with Mrs. Fox now? - Yes, till this man came for me; I knew the prosecutor before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had the purse when I went into the house with her, because I took nine-pence out of it to give this young fellow to bring in beer, and this young fellow forgot to come back with the beer; he did not bring the beer nor the money.</p>

               <p>When the man came down to the office, he found the prisoner there; he said she had robbed him of a guinea and a crown, and half a crown and two handkerchiefs; and he thought that was his handkerchief round her head, and he said, if it was, it was torn down one side, and sewed up with brown thread; Mansfield took it off her head; he has the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>- MANSFIELD sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of this month I went into Litchfield-street office; the prisoner was there; she was very much in liquor; it was between twelve and one; the man said he was robbed; this is the handkerchief I took off her head, and he said it was his property, and according to his description, it proved to be what he said; she was very much in liquor; the Magistrates desired me to put her into St. Ann's watch-house to get her sober; when I went to take her out she was as much intoxicated as before; I took her to St. Giles's watch-house; there were three other girls that came with her; the prosecutor said at the Cock he only wanted his money back;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090079"/>he did not wish any prosecution; there were three girls; this man had been in bed with her, and there were two beds in one room; and six women in the two beds; the money was gone, and the prosecutor took the handkerchief off his neck, and lent it to her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief; here are the stitches of a needle that I put in it; I mended it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw any of his money; he said he would go to bed with me; there were two beds in the room, and five women, besides me and him; I went to look for the beer, and when I came back he said he was robbed; since that the landlady of the house gave him his purse last Monday, and said she found it underneath the door; Brine told me so at the prison.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She gave me a purse, but if she did I could not take it, because I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Was there any money in it? - No, there was not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Was it like the purse you had lost? - It was.</p>

               <p>When did you go on board this ship? - The 10th of November, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who commanded the vessel? - Captain Barnard; the defendant was the mate of that ship.</p>
               <p>Was there any custom-house officer on board her at the time you went? - There were two on board on the 28th of December, 1787; I was on board the Mermaid; there were things that were sent away; and three casks and two jars, which the custom-house officers delivered into wherries, and I found that they should not be sent away in that; I delivered these thirteen casks and two jarrs of pickles, as I supposed they might be; I said to the custom-house officer, have you an order to deliver them? they said they had, but they had no business with it; then they told me they was to have ten shillings, and they gave me three shillings; and one of the sailors on board the Mary gave me an information; the prisoner was standing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090083"/>on the deck, and he said, what a d - n'd rascal you must be to do such a thing for such a small quantity as this; so as you have been served on board this ship; at first I said it is not I; he said, damn you, I know it is; I said, suppose I did, what then? I was on the quarter deck; says he, I wish I had you some where else; says he, this should not be all; I will have a d - n'd blow up for this, if I am hanged for it; says he, damn your eyes, get off the quarter deck; says I, I shall not go off for you; that was the last word he spoke at that time; I was walking on the deck till evening; and sitting on the main deck I heard a knocking in the cabin, I walked towards that way, and the knocking ceased before I came to the cabouse; I staid some little time, it might be ten minutes; I heard somebody coming up, that was the prisoner, and some other man; the prisoner had something under his arm; he came out of the cabin, the other man up'd with a large piece of wood, what they call a handspike; and before I came to him, he up'd with it in his hand; the man that was with Mr. Mackey.</p>
               <p>How near was he to Mackey when he aimed this blow? - Mr. Mackey was not so far as you are from the other man; they both came out of the cabin; he aimed the blow at me, and I dodged to avoid the blow, and the man threw the instrument at me, and knocked me down, and hit me in the small of my back; I never spoke to Mr. Mackey from that time in the afternoon, till the evening, not a syllable; I made up to him before the man aimed the blow, about two steps from the quarter deck.</p>
               <p>Are you positive whether you did or did not utter a syllable to him of any sort? - I did not, I never spoke.</p>
               <p>How long do you think it was between the time that this handspike was thrown at you, and the time of the conversation with Mackey? - Some hours had clapsed.</p>
               <p>What immediately followed when you was laid on the deck in that way? - Mackey and the other man came and kicked me when I was knocked down on the deck; Mr. Mackey, and the other man both kicked me several times about my body and in my face, but I cannot say that Mackey kicked me in the face; they both kicked me in the body, one on one side, and one on the other; no other of the ships crew kicked me; I said, for God's sake do not use me ill; Mackey said, d - n his eyes, kick him; and I received two kicks after that.</p>
               <p>Did he strike you after that? - I received two kicks, but I do not know whether he kicked me or the other man.</p>
               <p>Was you rendered insensible? - No, but I do not know which of the men it was; they were close to me; as soon as they went away from me, I might lay there a minute or two, then I went into the lighter, and I called sculler seven or eight times, a boat came along; the gentleman is here now, and he came and took me to St. Catherine's; his name is Stephens; I said, I shall be obliged to you if you will put your boat close, for I am so beat I do not know how to get into it; there was blood on me to be perceived; I had given them no provocation, by language, or any other means, nor any one soul on board the ship; no man can say I gave them a miss word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington, prisoner's counsel. How long have you been an officer of excise? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been an officer before? - Never; I went on board this vessel, the 10th of December, when she came into the port of London; a day or two after, I was on board constantly every day.</p>
               <p>You do not like rum? - Yes, I like a little now and then.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any on board the ship? - I found a cag; I did not know who it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Was not there a few words between you and Mr. Mackey about some rum of his that you made free with? - Never; I never had.</p>
               <p>Aye, or no; had you? - I never had a miss word with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090084"/>What time of the day of this 28th of December did you come on board? - I have been there every day since the 10th.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you went on shore after being beat? - I do not think it was quite eight.</p>
               <p>How many men were on board this ship? - There were two or three, I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of the boatswain? - Yes; Mr. White, I believe.</p>
               <p>Then you do not quite recollect his name? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the boatswain in the course of that evening? - I did see him go on shore about half past six that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any time after that evening on board? - I did.</p>
               <p>What time? - It might be about half past twelve when he came on board the ship again.</p>
               <p>What part of the ship was you in then? - I sat on the cabouse.</p>
               <p>Was it in the cabouse that you saw the boatswain? - The boatswain came on board and asked me what I sat there for; the cabouse is the place where they make the fire; it is a thing built upon the deck; it is before the cabin.</p>
               <p>You always told this story in the same sort of way? - I said to him, I had been ill-used by the mate of the ship; he never asked me any more questions.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the boatswain that Mr. Mackey had knocked you down on the front of the face with a large piece of wood? - I did not.</p>
               <p>That you mean to swear? - I do.</p>
               <p>I am told it was a very light evening? - It was very dark; there was no moon at all.</p>
               <p>Being no moon at all; do you recollect who the other person was? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you know who was on board the ship besides Mackey? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body come on board? - I saw a mate of another ship come on board in the evening some time before; I did not see any more than one person come on board that evening; I know the mate of the Washington by person, but not his name.</p>
               <p>Was he in the cabin this evening? - I do not know whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to state now correctly how many men were on board the ship at this time? - I cannot say; there are about four belonging to the ship.</p>
               <p>After being beat, you called out loudly for scullers? - I did, as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>I look upon it they might have heard you from the next ship? - They might; for the next ship was close; every man on board the Mary might have heard me; I never went before Justice Staples; the Justice came to me.</p>
               <p>Did you give the same account to him then, that you have given us to-night? - I did, concerning Mr. Mackey's illusing me.</p>
               <p>Here is your information, and there is not a word of what passed between Mr. Mackey and you? - There is every word, if the gentleman speaks the truth.</p>
               <p>You went off before eight from the ship? - It was before eight; a little boy brought me back that used to attend the ship; he is a waterman's boy; I went back for fear our officers should come, and I should not be in the ship; the shore is not a stone's throw; I came back about nine; I cannot tell to a minute.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your duty on board at this time? - I was an excise officer on board of her, on an ullage of rum; I was on board for that, my duty was to see that nothing was carried out of the ship.</p>
               <p>What were you doing at the time that these two men attacked you? - I was sitting on the deck; it was past seven, I think; and I heard a knocking in the cabin; when they came up, I was sitting still on the main-deck; I saw Mr. Mackey had something under his arm, and I made up to him to see what he had under his arm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The boatswain, I understand, was the person to whom you spoke, after you had received this usage? - I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090085"/>not say three words to him; I said, I had been ill-used by Mr. Mackey.</p>
               <p>The Justice attended you? - He did; I think I gave him the same account as I have given here, pretty nearly.</p>

               <p>When you came on board, what part of the ship did you go to? - I sat in the stern of the ship, an hour and half, and then in the cabouse.</p>

               <p>Did you observe a lighter near this ship? - There was a lighter lay without the Mary, loading with staves.</p>
               <p>If any man was calling out for a boat loudly, should you have heard him then from that lighter? - I really cannot say; he must have called very loud if I had heard him; if there had been any disturbance on board the ship, on the ship's deck, I must have heard it; any cry, I must have heard it; I heard no cry; there were always two of us together.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that this man did not go out of the cabin with some things under his arm? - I will not undertake so far as that; he might go with a pot, he might go for a pot of water.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did he go out with a package under his arm of some sort; and do not you know it perfectly well? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be understood now, that Mr. Mackey never went out with something under his arm? - No, I will not swear that he did.</p>

               <p>What were you talking about? - We were talking about our girls, as we generally are.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, there was no talk about a seizure that had been made that day? - I will not swear; there was such a thing talked of; I knew, and saw the seizure.</p>
               <p>You knew there had been a seizure? - Yes, I knew that.</p>
               <p>Did not Mackey tell you, who had made that seizure, and given that information? - Yes, he did, at the time they were taking the things out of the ship; he said, it was this man that stands here.</p>
               <p>So he told you, that Duncan, the exciseman, had given this information and had seized all the chocolate, and the things in the provision casts? perhaps, at night tell you, he expected this officer to come again? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you, that they had got all, or something more? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you recommend it to the prisoner at the bar, to bring all his smuggled goods on board the Washington? - I did not upon my oath; I said, if you had brought these things, and put them on board the Washington before, they would have been all safe; I intended that the officers should hear me.</p>
               <p>How many evenings had you spent with your friend Mr. Mackey, when he was on board the Mary, in the port of London? - Several.</p>
               <p>How came you to go out of your ship before the captain came on board that night? - Because there were three of us.</p>
               <p>If this man had been beat by any body, and had cried out, you must have heard it? - I must have heard it; I do not believe he was beat upon my word, there was no complaint that I heard till the next morning; I did not see him since, till now.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Peter about all the time? - He is not here; I believe he is gone in the country; I have not seen him since that night he came on board to take his leave; he was going into the West-country.</p>
               <p>How long have you been from America? - About four or five months.</p>
               <p>And never been in any of the Courts of Justice in America in your life? - Never; nor no other Court till now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am not prepared to prove you was.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any disturbance on board the ship? - No; I think I must have heard if any body had been crying out; I did not see Dungate till the next morning; at the time the boatswain came on board, he sung out, who has been killing the officer? he told me, that somebody had been knocking him in the face, or head, with a billet of wood; the next morning I saw him going up the stage as I lay in my hammock; I only saw his backside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now when the boatswain came on board he sung out, who has been killing the officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the man was not hurt at all except knocking his own head against the mainmast? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>He did not mention that Mackey had kicked him while he was down; now upon your oath, did not the boatswain tell you that the officer had said to him, that Mackey had kicked him; - He did not mention Mackey's name, I am sure; but he said that somebody had knocked him on the head with a billet of wood; I was getting a little grog on board the Hermione.</p>
               <p>You was a little groggish, I suppose? - No, I was not; I could not get enough, or I suppose I should; I turned into my birth as soon as I came on board; I could not get enough to sleep sound.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mackey on board that night? - I heard him, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any knocking in the cabin? - No, there was no knocking, I was on board the whole time of the seizure.</p>
               <p>Who brought about that seizure; did you ever hear Mackey say who gave the information? - He said that one of the people who had left us, had informed the exciseman, he thought.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I do not recollect when.</p>
               <p>Was it before this officer was knocked about so? - Yes, it was that afternoon.</p>
               <p>You was not in company with the mate of course? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was not asleep you know, for you heard what passed in the cabin; I heard them some time.</p>
               <p>If any body had cried out you should have heard them? - I think I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester replied.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were there not some custom-house officers on board at the time? - They were on shore.</p>
               <p>To Dungate. Did they leave you on board alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned with a verdict,</p>

               <p>Was the door left open? - No, it was missed a quarter before ten in the evening; the reason for charging the prisoner is, I sent a servant to fetch a coach to take us home; the coach came before we had finished our supper; it was a very cold, disagreeable night, and my friend was so hospitable he requested the coachman to come in and have a glass of spirits, to refresh him; when we had finished our supper, we called for our great coats; all were there but mine, it could not be found; they said nobody had been there but the coachman; so I took two of my friends with me, and the constable, and the patrol, and examined the coach, and found it in the hind seat of the coach; it is my coat.</p>

               <p>How many other coats might there be there? - I think there were three or four more hanging on the same range.</p>
               <p>Who went for the coach? - A servant of mine, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Were there any questions asked about the coat before you began to search? - We looked all over the house for it.</p>
               <p>Were there any questions asked of the coachman? - No, we asked him no questions, but we looked in the coach, and there we found it; my servant that called the coach was sent home again, he knew nothing of this matter; he came back again with the coach, but he went off directly again; that was about half an hour before we had finished our supper.</p>
               <p>Should you have put on that great coat? - Most certainly; it was a very cold disagreeable night, and wetted very much.</p>
               <p>Do you usually wear your great coat of an evening? - Yes, I always wear it.</p>
               <p>How long has that servant lived with you? - Four years.</p>
               <p>I want to find out, if I can, whether there is any probability, that your servant might have taken your coat, and put it in the coach? - There was nothing of that to be thought of, for he went away before the coat was missed; this is the coat, it is my property.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have very little to say, I was quite dead asleep, I had been up all the night before, and that day, I know nothing of the coat; if there was a coat in my coach, I know nothing of it; whether the servant conveyed it in the coach, or how, I saw nothing of it till the next day, that the gentleman came and said that it was his coat.</p>
               <p>JAMES MACSALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the house about ten o'clock; Mr. Thompson's servant came with a coach to take his family; not having done supper, he said the coach must wait; they said it was very cold, and thought it was right to give the coachman a glass of something; he was called to know what he would have, and the gentleman of the house gave him a glass of brandy; when Mr. Thompson was going home, he looked for his great coat, and could not find it; he could not recollect any person had been in but the prisoner, and I went with him to examine the coach, and found the coat in the hind seat of the coach.</p>
               <p>Court. It would have been a satisfaction to the Jury, to have been told by the servant that he did not put it into the coach.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant LE BLANC sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known this man, I believe, twenty years; during that time I always understood him to bear a very good character; he lived, I believe eighteen years, or very near that time, as coachman to Mrs. Le Blanc, an old lady, an aunt of mine, where I was very often during the last part of her life; on her job horses being sent away, he went away; he left her in the course of the year 1784; since that I have frequently seen the man, he has been at my chambers, and I always understood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090090"/>him to bear a good character, and I believe his master thought so of him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five more witnesses who had known him many years, and gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Had he been knocked down? - Yes, then I turned round and said, the man is dead; the doctor came up, who was just by, and bled him, the man was taken out of the ground, and was carried to his own home; he died on the spot.</p>
               <p>Had there been any further provocation between the deceased and the prisoner than you speak of, of any kind? - None at all; the first proposal of fighting came from me; I said I would fight the prisoner; he said he would not fight me, he would fight the man with the pig-tail; I do not know that there had been any quarrel between them before.</p>

               <p>Was you there when the poor man was knocked down the last time? - Yes, I saw the deceased lay down, and I said to some person that was present, I believe it was the deceased's wife, that it was requisite the man should be taken care of, and carried home, I did not think he was able to stand; he seemed before he received this blow to be exceedingly agitated, in consequence of the preceding blow; when he stood up, the deceased and the prisoner made blows at one another; both the blows took place immediately, and at one time; the deceased fell and lay on the ground; I went up to him, and felt his pulse, and turned round and told the people that the man was certainly dead, in consequence of a violent blow he received on the jugular vein, under the right ear; I look upon it that was occasioned by the violence of the blow on the jugular vein, that caused a rupture that was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Was the jugular vein ruptured by the blow? - I think it was, I have not a doubt but the blow occasioned his death.</p>

               <p>Did you call watch, or how? - I was so much confused at the time, and the violence of the blow, I do not know whether I did or no; I was knocked down with a fist, they came on my left side; I did not see them till they had done it; they gave me two blows, and when I got up, I saw the gentlemen, they was both together.</p>
               <p>How long were they rifling your pockets? - Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>Are these the same men? - They have not the same dresses on, I should be glad to see them in the same dresses, I would not wish to swear to them in these dresses; I am quite sure the men I gave charge of were the men that stood by me; I would not say any thing to wrong my conscience.</p>
               <p>Were they searched at the watch-house? - Yes, partly searched.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Have you ever got your handkerchief or your key again? - No, none of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090092"/>I believe you forgot the handkerchief at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then this handkerchief you never swore you had lost till now? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you clear as to the time that this happened? - I am clear to the time, by a person passing by after I gave charge to the watchman.</p>
               <p>You say it was half past nine? - I am clear to the time by a person passing by, which I asked.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before this happened? - The last place I came from was the Crooked Billet, in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>How long had you been at the Crooked Billet? - About twenty minutes, I think.</p>
               <p>Where had you been on the morning of that day? - In the morning of that day I had been at Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I staid at Hicks's-hall, at the King's-head, while half after six, or seven.</p>
               <p>I believe all the business there finishes at four, does not it? - The indictment was thrown out between the hour of two and three; I quitted Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>Then from the hour of two and three till half past six, you was at the King's-head, amusing yourself with drinking? - I was in company.</p>
               <p>How much might you drink between two and half past six? - I did not drink much.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I will not swear that I drank none; I must own that I had been drinking, but not drinking so much, but was very sensible of what I did.</p>
               <p>Where did you go at half past six? - I went to the King's-head, in St. Martin's-le-grand; I am not clear it is the King's-head; but the person that was along with me kept the King's-head.</p>
               <p>That is directly the contrary way to going home? - He was an acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Then you had a wet with him? - Yes, we had; we left there about eight, or half past; I cannot be positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect where you went after you had been drinking till half past eight, the second wet? - Then we went to the Crooked Billet, in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>I should think, by this time, drinking more, you was not very sober? - I was not drunk; we had a shilling's-worth of rum and water among us.</p>
               <p>Is that all you drank? - I am not very clear.</p>
               <p>How much besides do you think you drank? - I am very positive we had not more than eighteen pennyworth.</p>
               <p>How long did it take you up drinking this eighteen pennyworth? - We did not stay there twenty minutes; we never sat down; all the company in the room drank along with us.</p>
               <p>Did not the landlord of the Crooked Billet advise you that you was too tipsy to venture yourself out any where else, and that you had better make the best of your way home? - No, I do not recollect that; there was there a broker.</p>
               <p>I believe he was pretty drunk too? - I believe he was; he was much drunker than me.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect, at this time, who you went out of the house with? - I do not know the person that I went out with; but I did not go with any body; there were three of us in company; two went one way, and me the other; they left me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the third man that was in your company? - Never, but that time, in my life.</p>
               <p>What kind of man was he? - A lusty man.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect where you parted? - I recollect we parted in the house; they went one way, and me the other; I went out of the street door, into Wych-street, and the others went up Holywell-street; I went alone from that house.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us what time it was you reached your own house after this charge at the watch-house? - I never went home that night; I was not kept in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090093"/>What time was it that you left the watch-house? - I cannot be very clear in that; about eleven, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Then I should think it is time for all sober people to go home about eleven; however, can you tell us, where you went to, now, at this hour of night? - I went to Piccadilly; I had two pints of porter there, and sat till between two and three in the morning; then I walked about; I went to no house.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - At three or four in the morning I walked about the streets; I was in such a condition, so bruised, I was ashamed to go home.</p>
               <p>Then you wished to shew to all the world, when they got up about their business, how bruised you was? - I did not shew any body.</p>
               <p>How many hours might you be walking about the streets? - I suppose about four or five hours.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you sent home to your own house to tell them what accident had happened to you? - Never, till the next night.</p>
               <p>Had not you recovered the evening walk, that you could not go home till the next night? - I got along with some gentlemen that were strangers to the business.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you go home then all the next day? - I went home the next day, about seven or eight in the evening; I sent word about two where I was, and a soldier came down to me in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You say this robbery was committed by two persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect now, at this time, who you first charged? - I only blame Andrews for robbing me; Phillips was in company.</p>
               <p>Did not you charge Phillips first, before you charged Andrews? - Never.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I dare swear that, I am very clear I never charged him with the robbery; I charged him with being in company.</p>
               <p>You charged no other man but this man? - No other.</p>
               <p>Which of these men is Andrews? - I do not wish to swear to them in these dresses.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of them is Andrews? - The man in the blue coat is Andrews, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He is wrong.</p>
               <p>What is your name in blue? - Phillips.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. After that I will not ask the man a question.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say you did not see the person that knocked you down at the time you was knocked down, or before it? - Never, but when I got up I saw two men; as I got up they were going about a yard or two from me; I charged Andrews for robbing me.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that? because, if you did not see either of the men before you was struck, or when you was struck, till you got up again, how could you tell which of the men it was that struck you? - Phillips was not close by me; he was a little before, and when I charged Andrews, Phillips came up very pert, and I said I would charge him for being in company; I was clear that I saw Andrews.</p>
               <p>You did not see him strike you? - I did not see him before I had the blow, till I was rising up; there was nobody passing so nigh hand them; and as I rose I saw them.</p>
               <p>They did not run away? - No, they did not seem to run, because I had them in my sight all the time.</p>
               <p>But they did not offer to run? - The watchman came up directly, and they were taken up immediately.</p>
               <p>How many people might be about you when you got up? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they as near you as Andrews? - There was nobody near me when I called out.</p>
               <p>Why, you said just now you did not know whether you called out or not? - I called out, and said it was Andrews robbed me; when I got up, I saw nobody near me but these two men.</p>

               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - He was worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he sober enough to know what he was about? - Yes, I think he was; he seemed positive in the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not he drunk enough, think you, not to know what he was about; whether he was not so drunk, at that time, no great reliance could he had on him? - He was very much in liquor, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been the watch-house-keeper? - Seven years.</p>
               <p>We have heard from Mr. Dale, that you searched these people partly? - I did not search them; the constable searched them.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Dale charge any body else? - No, only Andrews; the other was only standing by, in company.</p>

               <p>What happened in Russel-street? - At the Piazute there was a number of people; I asked what was the matter? and Dale answered, and said he was knocked down and robbed; I heard no calling out, but seeing a number of people, I went to see what was the matter, and Dale said he was knocked down, and robbed, and said, I give charge of this man, and another man; there was four or five, but he did not give a thorough charge.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by not giving a thorough charge? - He said he would give charge of this person, and the other person, but he could not recollect the real person that knocked him down, then he put his hand on my breast, and says, I give charge of you.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I think we need not go further.</p>

               <p>Court. Somebody has seen him drunk, and robbed him of his money, but there seems to be no more reason for charging these two men, than any others.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; the prosecutor applied to me, and said he had been robbed; I asked him if he was in liquor; he said he was a little in liquor, but not so much but not so much, but he knew what he was about; he gave me a description of the prisoner and her dress; I took her into custody; I found the prisoner and two more girls in bed, and a man with them; I ordered them to dress themselves, and asked the prosecutor to pick out the person, and he picked out the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I never saw the person before in my life, I sell cakes; when he came into the room, he was a full hour before he swore to me, and the constable said, going along, if you do not swear to her, you will look foolish at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Constable. That is not true; I said to him, do not you, if you was in liquor, go to take the girl up; he said he knew what he was about; it was nothing in my way to take her up.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was there any light in the room when you went up together? - There was candle-light and fire-light in the room; when she went down stairs, she came up with the candle the first time, but the second and last time she came up without the candle.</p>

               <p>In consequence of that credit which you understood belonged to Mr. Alvarez of Hackney, you sent some goods? - No, my partner did.</p>

               <p>Are you in partnership with the last witness? - Yes; I received this letter, I can hardly recollect whether it was by the post or not, but here is a post mark upon it; the post frequently delivers letters at our house, I might be at the door and take it in.</p>
               <p>In consequence of receiving this letter, what steps did you take? - In consequence of receiving this letter, I wrote a letter to Messrs. Storey and Alderson at London, to enquire the character of Mr. Alvarez of Hackney, who I conceived to have applied to us; in consequence of the letter I wrote the 19th, in consequence of the first letter; we received for answer this, which is now in my hand.</p>
               <p>What step did you take in consequence of having a good character of him? - We put in hand these orders that were sent us, and prepared these calimancoes which were sent for, and sent them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090097"/>Then you formed an opinion that Mr. Alvarez was a respectable person; to what amount did you send? - About one hundred and eighty-three pounds ten shillings; they were calimancoes, and some sattinets.</p>
               <p>Court. You sent goods in, conceiving Mr. Alvarez of Hackney to be a man of credit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you send these goods as to Mr. Alvarez of Hackney? - We meant to give credit to Mr. Alvarez of Hackney, conceiving him to be a man of credit.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. I take it for granted, in consequence of this desire for you to enquire, you very soon found there was a Mr. Alvarez, very well known, and of great reputation? - I did.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly well satisfied presently, you made no other enquiry? - None at all.</p>

               <p>I have resided in Mare-street, Hackney, all my life-time, but I certainly never had any engagement with Mr. Taylor, at Norwich, never heard of their name till this affair; I never wrote to them in my life; this is not my hand-writing; I never received any goods from Mr. Taylor of Norwich, nor any letter from them.</p>

               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - I cannot say I do, I have seen it.</p>

               <p>Did you happen to know whether that person resided at Hackney? - He took lodgings there.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - The now defendant; he, and he alone; as he had lodgings at Hackney, I took all the pains in my power to inform the public of it; I do not myself know when he took lodgings at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Is Mare-street, a long street, or a short street? - A long street.</p>
               <p>A vast number of houses there of course? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then you did not live there the 8th of March last? - We went on the 25th.</p>
               <p>You have not yet been a twelvemonth? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that gentleman with the handkerchief to his mouth? - Yes, very well; a woman that passed for his wife, came and took lodgings of me about the middle of April.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him? - About a week after the room was taken; it was a furnished back parlour.</p>
               <p>What rent did he pay you? - Six shillings a week; they slept there sometimes when they chose.</p>
               <p>Had he any ware-house there? - No.</p>
               <p>Any compting-house? - No; his compting-house was in Token-house-yard; he kept the lodging till after the many advertisements were out against him, that was either the 21st or 22d of July; July; but the last that I saw of him was at our house.</p>
               <p>Was he much there? - Yes, he came sometimes four or five nights in a week, and sometimes he did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at any time what he wanted that lodging for? - I never enquired; he paid me every week; I gave them warning, and he said, he should not quit it, for he meant to keep it on, and to pay his rent; I dare say it was two months before they went.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be a man of large property, that carried on a great trade in Mare-street? - No, the woman said, they carried on no trade, but lived on what they had.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with the woman while the man was by? - Not of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the woman say in his presence, whether they carried on any business? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for all the lodgings when he went away? - They paid all but one week, and came afterwards and paid that, but they took away the key, and have got it now; I may have seen the other gentleman, but I cannot be sure; I know the other Mr. Alvarez; he lives in the same street; I know the gentleman very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You had not the less respect for the man that came to lodge with you because he was of the same name? - The woman said their name was Alvarez, being a Christian name, I did not think he was a Jew.</p>

               <p>What was the nature of your engagement with him? - In the beginning of January, I was in want of 30 l. which was all the money that I recollect I owed in the world; it was in different debts; they kept coming to me for the money, and it was not in my power to pay them; I thought I would endeavour to apply to a friend of mine to get the money; I applied to Alvarez; I then desired him to step over the way to the public-house with Mr. Pearce, I went after; he said, if I would open my breast to him, undoubtedly he would supply any sum I wanted, for he was employed by a young gentleman just come from abroad with a great deal of money, to get in good tradesmens' bills, to put into a banker's hands; I told him, I only wanted thirty pounds; he asked me, if I did not want more; he said, I cannot take more than five per cent. but what you chuse to give me more; he drew on me two bills; one for fifteen pounds for six weeks, and the other, sixteen pounds for two months.</p>

               <p>Was you employed either by him or by Jones? - He told me, that he from his infancy was brought up in the mercantile line, and he could get goods and make cent. per cent. by them, and if I would attend him, and do business for him, to go to the coffee-house for letters, and so on, I should have shilling for shilling with him; I told him, I would consider of it, and let him know the next day; I met him the next day; he said, he would be bound in the course of four or five months to clear 2000 l. I said, I must neglect my business; says he, d - n your bu- business, never mind that; I told him, I would attend him; he said, there was an old clerk of his who had promised to meet him in the Minories; we went down to the Camel in the Minories.</p>
               <p>What day was this appointment to meet in the Minories? - It was in the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Had any thing material passed from January to March? - No, he asked, when he went into the Camel, if a Mr. Israel was there, as had formerly been his clerk, and they told him yes, there he was, pointing to the box; he introduced us, we sat down, and the first word was, Alvarez said, Israel, have you got any directions? says Israel, yes, I have, and he took out of his pocket three or four bits of paper, with writing upon them, such as names, very dirty, as if they had been in the pocket for a twelvemonth.</p>

            ; and the other was to go to France for indigo, to the best of my recollection; I will not be positive; then Israel he began writing; and on the conclusion of the letter he asked Alvarez what kind of direction, and to what coffee-house, and how he must refer himself to Mr. Taylor? Alvarez said, that we must consider on; Israel said, he was that day at the Antigallican coffee-house, and was there some days before; and that a very few Jews went there; says Alvarez, that is the very coffee-house that will do; then about referring himself to his character; he said, as to Mr. Alvarez, you know he is well known on the change; tell them to enquire there, or any where else where they like, and he said, that was the way he referred before; Alvarez said so, and to tell him my place of residence is Mare-street, Hackney; this was just at the conclusion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090103"/>of the first letter; Israel immediately made answer to it, then by God you must get a lodging there.</p>
               <p>Was his place of residence, at that time, in Mare-street, Hackney? - No, it was not; I think it was up at Goodge-street, Queen-Ann-street, not in Mare-street; Alvarez answered to it, you d - n'd fool, I intend it; I will go over there the first opportunity I can get to go; then the three letters were finished, and they were taken and put into the post-office.</p>
               <p>Who wrote them? - Israel wrote them, and Alvarez put his signature to them.</p>
               <p>Look at this, and tell us whether it is one of them? - This is one that was sent to Taylor.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing that happened as far as relates to Taylor's business? - About three days after I went to the Antigallican to look for the answer; I will not be sure whether the answer came on the third or fourth, but we had two letters; they both came from Norwich, with patterns; one was from Mr. Taylor; Alvarez was waiting at some public house, just by, while I went to the Antigallican; I took the letters to him; he opened them, and said, it was damned good luck; then he said he would go to Israel; he shewed me the letter, and he approved of the patterns very much; he said they were very fine; the evening drawing very near, and Alvarez requested Israel to meet him at the Crab-tree, the corner of Percy-street, Tottenham-court-road, the next afternoon, to dine there; I was to be there too; Israel came, and I met him; there were rump stakes for dinner, for Alvarez and me; Israel could not eat any flesh, so there was some fresh salmon for him; when dinner was over, Alvarez told Israel he should have a shilling down for every letter he would write, as many as he would, and he wrote three or four more the same evening, one of which was the order to Mr. Taylor; he wrote it, and Alvarez signed it; that is the letter that was sent by the post; he had not yet got any lodging in Mare-street; two or three days after that, Alvarez wanted me to go with him to Hackney, to endeavour to get a lodging for him; I went with him to Hackney; but before we came there, says he, I will shew you my cousin's house; there will be a house, when you come to see it, such a house as you have hardly ever seen; when we came quite upon it, says he, this is it, look! look! and it certainly is a very genteel house; says he, stand against me, that he may not see me as I go by, so I stood and he went by me, and held down his head; when we got past the house, says he, is not it a very fine house? yes, says I, a very fine house! says he, a d - n'd old rogue! that ought to be my house! I hear he is very ill with the gout, but d - n him, I hope he will not die; I am gone at once if he dies; then he came just beyond Mr. Alvarez's house, there he begged me to go down Mare-street to see if I could see any lodgings; this was after the order, near a week; because he did not like to be seen in the street, for fear his cousin should see him; I went up, and saw, at a tallow chandler's, lodgings to let, and it was furnished; that would not do, and we went up, as far as I thought Mare-street went; I could not see any; I came, and told him; God, says he, I must have one; he begged the favour of me to go up and down again, and look attentively, for I must have one; if it is at a public house I must have one; I went up and down again, and could see none but this; it was unfurnished; I informed him, and we left Hackney, and found none; some few days after that, Israel, Alvarez and me went down to Hackney again, and we missed Mr. Alvarez's house; and we came home; he said he would send his Bet that lived with him, for he would be d - n'd if Bet did not get him a lodging; Bet got him a lodging some weeks after; when the lodging was taken he seemed happy and easy; some time after that Mr. Robins wanted the apartments; and desired Alvarez to get other lodging; Alvarez was down there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090104"/>frequently some time after that; he desired me to attend him very closely, because business was at the heighth; I had seen Alvarez at Mr. Robins's frequently.</p>
               <p>Did Israel go down there at that time? - Israel went there sometimes; he wished me to take a lodging, because business was at the heighth, and required to be watched.</p>
               <p>When had he first the compting-house in Tokenhouse-yard? - That was after the order sent a good bit; it might be a month, the quarter would have been up the 16th or 17th of August; about the middle of May the place in Tokenhouse-yard was taken; he had been looking out some days for a compting-house, because he said he would have a better appearance; Mr. Cohen shewed him one, she did not like that; and he shewed him another, which was No. 19 in Token-house-yard, he went in and agreed for it; in the latter end of April, or the beginning of May, Mr. Taylor's goods came up; about the 25th of April they came to the Bull-inn, in Bishopsgate-street; we had the invoice of them, there were so many pieces to be up such a day by the London Carrier; the invoice came to the Antigalican Coffee-house; when Israel saw the letter, that the goods were come up, says he, I will go and look at the road-bill, and I can tell whether they are come up or not; Israel and me went to look at the road-bill; Alvarez did not go with us; we found the goods were coming, we went to the Bull-inn to know if they were come; and they said yes; they were taken to the Goldsmith's Porter's galley-key; then Israel gave me orders to go and receive them, they were for exportation, and the desire to Mr. Taylor was, that they might be sent there, they were going by another ship.</p>

               <p>This is a rough sketch of that letter; some of it is the hand-writing of Israel, and some of Alvarez; me and Alvarez went to Goldsmith's key, and got the goods delivered; Alvarez went to the public-house, I went to get the goods, and pay the man for the warehouse room; I told the man that Mr. Alvarez expected more; I followed him, Alvarez came out and saw them, and he said I am d - n'd glad you have got them, because he was a little afraid of not getting them; now says he, let the man not take them to your house, but the porter shall take them a little way, then we will put them into a coach; they asked me if I knew any body near there; I told them I knew a housekeeper in Newgate-street; they were taken there; we paid the porter two shillings, and they were carried to my house; some few days after that, or near a week, another parcel of goods came.</p>
               <p>None of these were carried to the compting-house? - No, we had no compting-house then, I rather think we had lodgings in Mare-street, but I am not sure; they did not go there, I believe the second parcel was carried to my house; then Alvarez<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090105"/>wanted to know how to sell them; he asked Israel if he knew any body; says Alvarez, sell them to any body, but do not sell them to the Jews; Alvarez took out a couple of pieces, one was a coarse piece, the other was a fine one; we came together to try to sell them, and the first house we came to, was Mr. Jones's, in Great St. Helen's; we went there with two pieces for patterns, and asked what he would give for them; Mr. Jones and he discoursed together for the best part of half an hour, in a kind of languge that I did not understand; they usually did talk English; then Israel came out to me; Mr. Jones was then in the compting-house; Israel came in and said he would not give any more than fifteen shillings a piece; Jones was not there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mention that conversation either to Jones or to Alvarez? - Jones himself told me, he came out into the front room, and said that they were not goods saleable in England; that he would not give more than fifteen shillings for the coarsest sort, and a couple of shillings a piece extra on the finer sort; or seventeen shillings or eighteen shillings, I cannot say which; I told Israel I did not think Alvarez would sell them at that reduced price; he said why you hear what the captain says, that is Jones; Israel said, as these were the first, Jones must give two guineas for them, which he did; we returned to Alvarez, and told him, that they were not goods saleable in England, and that we could not get any more than fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen for the fine, but had got two guineas; he said it was next door to throwing them away; but in two days after, Alvarez said he would take them down, and that the man should have them at the same price; he did not know where they were going that I know of; one of them them went with me, and the other was waiting for me to come with the remainder; he came to the Blue Anchor with a coach, and there was Israel or Alvarez, and a girl waiting, and Israel told me, as I knew where he went with the other, I should go to the same place, and I went to the captain's; Mr. Jones was not at home; I waited, Jones came home, looked at the goods, calculated them up, and to the best of my knowledge, they came to thirty pounds, at fifteen and seventeen or eighteen shillings, I cannot say which, at Jones's own price; it was then late in the evening; Jones said the bankers were shut up, he did not know where to get the money, begged I would call again in the morning; Alvarez d - nd me shockingly for leaving them without the money, and bid me go back for them, I went back.</p>
               <p>Did Alvarez know with whom they were left at that time? - No, to the best of my recollection he did not; Israel precautioned me not to tell Alvarez who had bought them; I went back again to Mr. Jones, and told him not to leave the goods without the money; then he said I must take the goods away; upon which I took them away; he said I might bring them again any time in the morning, and I should have the money; I took them in a coach to my own house; the next morning we got up pretty early, and I came to that public house, and I was to go with them as before; I went to Mr. Jones's with the goods; Jones counted them over to see if they were the same pieces, and paid me 30 l. 20 l. in two bank notes; I took the money to Alvarez and Israel, who were at the Blue Anchor; the next day Alvarez said to me, tell me who bought the goods; did not Captain Jones buy the goods? yes, says I, he did; he wrapped out a most precious oath against old Israel, and called him every thing but what was good, because he sold them to a Jew.</p>
               <p>What was the time that the goods were sold to Jones? - It was about the middle of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jones purchase any more of Taylor's goods after this? - Yes, after Alvarez knew that Captain Jones had bought the goods, he said he would be d - d if he would not go to him himself the next time; accordingly, the next parcel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090106"/>that came, Alvarez desired me to go to Jones's, and I went to him; that was about the middle of May; his original wife was there, in Skinner-street; Mr. Jones came to Skinner-street and agreed for one bale; Alvarez told him he thought he bought the goods too cheap; Jones told him they were not goods saleable in England, and he would not buy them if he had not others to send abroad; says Alvarez, I bought them for exportation, but as you are going to send them abroad, you shall have them, and send them; Jones bought them at the same price as before; one bale was carried into Skinner-street, and I think, to the best of my recollection, there was a bale of the goods carried from Jones's house to the quay; all the goods, excepting four or five pieces, which Alvarez had pawned (he sold the duplicates off to some body else) all the rest were sold to Jones.</p>
               <p>Tell us all the conversation that passed between Jones and Alvarez, at any of their meetings, either about the goods, or place of residence, or any thing of that sort? - When Mr. Roberts wanted Alvarez to leave his apartment, Alvarez came to the compting-house and told me of it, and by and by came Jones; that was in Tokenhouse yard; he informed Jones, Roberts wanted him to quit his apartment, but says he, I will be d - d if I do.</p>

               <p>In what words did Alvarez inform Jones of that fact? - He told Jones, Roberts wanted the apartments, but I will be d - d if I will; would you have me leave it and take another, or else I shall be blowed up; says Jones, no, to be sure not, for if you do, it will be a rank fraud, and if not, by keeping of it, as your name is Isaac Jesuran Alvarez, and living at Hackney, the Devil could not hurt him, or nothing could hurt him, or something of that sort; I think he said, Jones, would you advise me to quit that, or to take another? the Captain said, keep that to be sure, you d - nd fool.</p>
               <p>Was this conversation prior to the delivery of any of Taylor's goods to Jones? - I think some were delivered, and some after; I think they were some sattinetts.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that there were any goods that were delivered after that to Jones? - Yes, because it was shortly after Alvarez was at Mr. Roberts's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understood you to say, that all the goods that came to Mr. Taylor, with the exception of two or three pieces, which were pawned by Alvarez, were sold to Jones? - They were.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any other conversation of Jones with Alvarez, or any body? - I heard Alvarez ask Jones, if he could put him in any method, if in case Mr. Taylor was to find out that he sold the goods in this country, instead of exporting them, that he should tell him how he should conceal himself from any harm.</p>
               <p>Then Jones knew they came from Mr. Taylor? - Undoubtedly, towards the latter end he did, but not at first.</p>
               <p>Have you seen Mr. Jones lately? - I saw him this morning; Jones told Alvarez, to the best of my recollection, that there was no other way, unless Alvarez had a correspondent abroad, to send him a blank letter.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of a blank letter? - Alvarez said he had not any body, and asked Jones if he could procure him one; Jones said he would see about it, but I do not recollect that he did promise him he would.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a fraud that is not practised? - That letter was to be filled up according to Mr. Taylor's proceeding against him, to specify that the order was countermanded from abroad.</p>
               <p>That was the Captain's ingenuity? - Yes; I went to the coffee-house one day, and I brought back a letter; I took it to Alvarez, at the compting-house; as soon as I gave it him, I began scribbling on the desk, and Alvarez wrapped out a very bitter oath, why, G - d d - n your eyes, why, says he, they have sent me a blank letter, they might have had the politeness<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090107"/>to have put their names into it; I thought he was going to destroy the letter, then he said, G - d d - n me, it is that sweet fellow, Jones.</p>
               <p>When did you get that letter? - I cannot say exactly; I believe it was some time in April; Alvarez put up the letter, and by and by came Israel to the compting-house; he told Israel the captain had sent that letter, that it was a foreign letter; Israel looked at it it, and said, it was his son's writing, and it was well written; by-and-by Jones came, as he frequently did, came to enquire after some direction; he said, if any thing comes, there will be no dispute, and Alvarez would have one share, and

             another, and Hicks and Israel a third between them; Alvarez shewed him this blank letter, and Jones said, I am better than a father to you, but he did not say he sent the letter; I was arrested by Alvarez, when he was taken up with Jones for 50 l. Jones come to the spunging-house, and seemed surprized, and d - nd Alvarez for doing it; at that time, he asked me what I said at the Grand Jury; I said, I told them what price I gave for the things, he said, that was right, and he would go down to Alvarez and get my discharge the same day, which he did on the Thursday, and came there on the Monday, and said, he was sure nothing would have happened of this sort, had not the stockings at Leicester been traced to his warehouse; Jones was bail for me once before; I had no acquaintance with him, only knowing him while I was with Alvarez, and had been at his house several times.</p>
               <p>To what purpose did you to go to Jones's house? - Because the directions that Jones gave, Jones did not like them to be carried up to Alvarez to sign, and I went with them mostly; a great while after I had been to the Grand Jury, when Jones had been bail as above for me, he took me to the Oxford Tavern, and he asked for a private room; we went into a room, not a private one; says Jones, this is a rough draft of what I wish you to say on the trial, which you will see to be nothing but the truth; I told him, I would speak the truth for him as soon as for Taylor, and for Taylor as soon as for him; he read the paper to me and put it into his pocket; I desired him to let me have it to look over; he gave it me, and said, put it into your pocket; I drank some punch, and as we were going away, Jones said, now you can swear that with great safety, it must be done to night; says he, we will go into a public-house; we went into a public-house, but there were so many people, we could not get room to sit down; says he, swear it, and what you and I do not like afterward, you and I will go and scratch it out; and then afterwards he gave me a copy, and he was called out, and went away; this is the copy, I had it delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Court. What induced you to make discovery in July? - He was going on so very desperately, I thought it was of great consequence to myself; there was no quarrel between us.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright proved Alvarez taking a compting-house about the 20th of May; Hicks and another person was with him, and he referred her to Messrs. Jones and Co. at No. 17, in Great St. Helens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heward deposed, he saw Mr. Jones by the last witness's desire, who told him he knew Alvarez, and sold him goods, cochineal, to the amount of 70 l. 80 l. or 100 l. and believed him to be a man of credit, and would trust him with 10,000 l. and he gave him Alvarez's name on paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding spoke on the part of Jones, and Mr. Knowlys on the part of Alvarez.</p>

            : The second objection was, that receiving notes was not within any act of Parliament, which makes receivers accessaries after the fact. The case was reserved by Mr. Rose, and referred to all the Judges; and, on a conference had by them, on the first day of Term, they directed the counsel for the prisoner to be heard; and, on the 14th of November, the case was argued very much before ten Judges, by Mr. Knowlys: with respect to the first objection, the Judges thought, that the word chattles, in the count against the accessary, might be rejected as surplusage: With respect to the question, whether the receiving notes, knowing them to have been stolen, was, or was not, within any of the acts of Parliament &amp;c.? has occasioned a different opinion among the Judges; the receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, was only a misdemeanor at common law: A receiver of stolen goods makes not an accessary, unless he receives the thief himself, or takes a reward to favour his escape. This is laid down in a variety of authorities: in Hawk. 319. in Stamf. Pleas 41. Steel 91. 2d Institute 83. Crook

            688. in Hale's Pleas of the Crown 619 and 620, he says this: If A. has his goods stolen by B; and C. knowing they were stolen, receives them; this simply of itself makes not an accessary: and therefore it has been often ruled, if I. S. receives stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen, it is not actionable, because it imports not a felony, but only trespass and misdemeanors, &amp;c. and the bare receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, makes not an accessary, for he may receive them for the true owner. - Thus it stood at common law previous to the 3 &amp; 4

Croke 32. Elyerton 68. 1 Burrow 457. Lord Mansfield lays it down in the case of Millar and Rase, that banknotes are not to be considered as goods and chattles; they are to be taken, as money, and certainly are passed as money only; and until the beginning of the reign of his late Majesty, a felony must have been of goods and chattles; to remedy this, the statute of 2

               : The second objection was, that receiving notes was not within any act of Parliament, which makes receivers accessaries after the fact. The case was reserved by Mr. Rose, and referred to all the Judges; and, on a conference had by them, on the first day of Term, they directed the counsel for the prisoner to be heard; and, on the 14th of November, the case was argued very much before ten Judges, by Mr. Knowlys: with respect to the first objection, the Judges thought, that the word chattles, in the count against the accessary, might be rejected as surplusage: With respect to the question, whether the receiving notes, knowing them to have been stolen, was, or was not, within any of the acts of Parliament &amp;c.? has occasioned a different opinion among the Judges; the receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, was only a misdemeanor at common law: A receiver of stolen goods makes not an accessary, unless he receives the thief himself, or takes a reward to favour his escape. This is laid down in a variety of authorities: in Hawk. 319. in Stamf. Pleas 41. Steel 91. 2d Institute 83. Crook

               688. in Hale's Pleas of the Crown 619 and 620, he says this: If A. has his goods stolen by B; and C. knowing they were stolen, receives them; this simply of itself makes not an accessary: and therefore it has been often ruled, if I. S. receives stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen, it is not actionable, because it imports not a felony, but only trespass and misdemeanors, &amp;c. and the bare receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, makes not an accessary, for he may receive them for the true owner. - Thus it stood at common law previous to the 3 &amp; 4
