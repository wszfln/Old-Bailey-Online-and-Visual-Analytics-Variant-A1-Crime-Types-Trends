             in the Gate-house, upon the like Commitment, were tendred to the Court, and by the order of my Lord Chief Justice Pemberton publickly read, &amp;c. all of them tending to one and the same purport; shewing that the aforesaid Petitioners having been Committed for the heinous Crime of High Treason against his Majesty, as by the Warrants of their Commitments appears, and have been continued Prisoners without any manner of prosecution; notwithstanding some of them having twice Petitioned that Honourable Court to be brought thither by Habeas Corpus, to be Tryed or Bailed, therefore they again humbly besought their Lordships, that according to the Tenor of the Act, made and provided for the securing the Liberty of the Subject, they might then be brought by Habeas Corpus to receive the benefit of the said Act, according to the intent and meaning thereof. As to the Petitions of the Prisoners in the Tower, my Lord Chief Justice was pleased to return for answer, That it had been, and was the Opinion of all the Judges, That the Tower was a Prison not within the Jurisdiction of that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16811017a002"/>Court, and therefore, as he had formerly told them, so he did again declare, That it was not in their power to relieve them, but that they must the first week in the Term apply themselves to the Court of Kings-Bench; and if no prosecution was made, they might there receive the benefit of the Act for securing the Liberty of the Subject. As for the latter, viz. Mr. Wilson, his Lordship said, They sate only by a Commission of Goale-delivery; and he not being in the Goale of Newgate, the Court had not to do with him.</p>
               <p>Then the Grand-Jury for the City of London appearing, Mr. Jones and Mr. North, Counsels for the King, made objections against the returning of the Pannel: first, for that one and the same men were returned upon a Precept of Oyer and Terminer and Goale-delivery; but the Opinion of the Court being, that such Returns were usual, they prayed that they might be called over before they were Sworn, for as much as they had been informed, that some of them had been Returned at the nomination of persons that were not the Sheriffs sworn Ministers, which was contrary to the Statute of 3 Hen. 8. And farther, that they had been informed, they were not observers of the Kings Laws, in as much as they frequented Conventicles, and resort not to their respective Parish-Churches, and therefore prayed the Pannel might be reformed. To which Objection Mr. Sheriff Pilkinton answered, That he knew them to be all worthy Gentlemen, and men of unspotted Reputations; and that he had returned them at the nomination of no person, but upon his own certain knowledge of their being substancial Citizens. Then at the request of Mr. Sollicitor General, they being demanded whether they resorted to Church, my Lord Mayor was pleased to answer, That he was well satisfyed in several of them that they were good Churchmen; so that there was only two amongst them that seemed to scruple to give a positive answer to that demand, viz. Mr. Crisp and Mr. Loggan; whereupon (after a long debate, and the reading of the Statute of 3 Hen. 8.) twice or thrice over, the Sheriffs gave their consents to the racing out their Names, and inserting two others.</p>

After all the Witnesses had been publickly sworn in Court, the Grand-Jury withdrew: but the Court not allowing them to examine the Witnesses in private, they returned, and after a long debate of the Priviledges and usual Customs of Grand-Juries, they consented to hear the Witnesses over again in open Court, and to ask them such Questions as they should think convenient. Whereupon, the Witnesses were called one by one, and after a long and tedious Examination, the Jurors withdrew to debate the Evidence; and having held a private consultation for the space of three hours, they came into Court, and answering every man to his Name, returned the Bill IGNORAMUS; upon which, being demanded whether they did not believe the Witnesses, or that they thought the words expressed in the Indictment, and others that had been sworn to, were not Treasonable; the Court declaring, That if they scrupled the latter, they would resolve their doubts; but their answer was, That they were satisfied in their CONSCIENCES of what they had done; and farther added, That they could not believe what the Witnesses had Sworn.</p>
