               <p>Q. Were you in the shop. - A. I was; Blacksley stood with her back against some calico placed at the window with some wire before them; my attention was taken up with some customers that I had in the shop; when they were gone I missed Blacksley in a moment, and immediately I missed her I missed a piece of print out of the window. I asked Simmonds where she was gone, she said she did not know, I ran into the street and found her hiding herself at a gentleman's steps in St. Martin's lane; I told her she had stole a piece of print, she denied it, I brought her back to the shop, and I said to her you had better confess.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell what she said. - A. She had given the cotton to

Armstrong knocked at the door, it was opened by the man prisoner; we went in and we told him that we must search his place; we proceeded to search, and in the cupboard in the room, standing in a bag, was these implements of house breaking - three crows, one large one and the other two small ones, two large picklock keys, and five small picklock keys for boxes, and a dark lanthorn; these were found in that cupboard (producing them). In another cupboard we found this file, and another file with it, and in the same cupboard was this piece of putty, with an impression of a key upon it; that putty is used for the purpose when they get hold of a key of a gentleman's door, to take the impression. In the same room we found a silk handkerchief, which the woman prisoner said belonged to her, she said she bought it at some place which she mentioned; this was sworn to by the woman to the best of her belief.

The boxes in the front room and in the back room I have no doubt but they were broke open by these tools, we fitted them; this tool has a jagged edge, there is the impression of this tool on the box exactly, this tool was rusty, and on the box the rust was left, and it fitted the impression exactly, it was a strong elm box, it took some force to open it.</p>
               <p>Q. So that comparing the size of the tools with the impression on the box, and the rust that you found on the box, you think it was broken open by that tool. - A. Yes, and this other has a notch, a jagged edge, there is the mark of that jagged edge on the box. One of the boxes in this room is a stout deal box, it is painted, it had been broken open; that box belonged to

I saw the prisoner in the shop in the custody of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. He was a servant of mine, he had quitted my service I believe nine days. I saw a knife that was taken from him, it was my property, it was marked T. H. the letters were burnt in on the handle; it was a large cutting knife; the watchman informed me that he found my cellar door and my house door open. Adjoining the shop is the accompting house; there is an iron chest fixed in the accompting house, that had been attempted to be forced with a hook that is now in court, and likewise with three of my large choppers; the wall next to the stone work of the chest, had been cut through. There was nothing missing from the house but the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. That we shall hear, in fact you missed nothing out of the house. - A. Nothing at all that I know.</p>

             sworn. I am a coal merchant. I live in Union street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Early in the morning that has been mentioned, were you passing by Mr. Hembrow's door. - A. Yes, about two in the morning I saw the door open, I did not suspect any robbery; I supposed as butchers were early risers, they perhaps were going to market; I was going by the watchman came past, he looked in and said halloa, upon which I turned my head, I saw immediately afterwards a scuffle between the watchman and another person, they both fell on the ground, and the prisoner got up and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, whoever he was, ran away. - A. Yes; I turned back, I asked no questions of the watchman, I ran after the man and called stop thief; when he turned up Bond-street, I lost sight of him till I came to Vigo Lane, there I saw the watchman bringing him back, I said to the watchman I believed he was the man by the dirtiness of his stockings that had been down with the watchman at Mr. Hembrow's, let us take him to the house to see whether he is the man; when we came to the bottom of Bond-street, we met the watchman who had been down on the ground with him.</p>
               <p>Q. That watchman's name is Haydon. - A. Yes, He said this is the man, I have got a piece of his coat, he produced a piece of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that his coat was torn. - A. Not till the watchman mentioned it, and then I thought he was the person; the piece of coat which the watchman had, matched with his coat. We took him back to Mr. Hembrow's house; we asked him if he knew this man, he said yes, he had been his man; he took us into his accompting-house and there was a hole in the wall, it appeared as if they had been forcing the chest.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable. The next morning I was sent down to Mr. Hembrow's. I found that the catch of the cellar door was wrenched off; I went into Mr. Hembrow's accompting house and perceived the wood work round the iron chest was broken down, and on the outside of that, the stone and bricks were broken to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. The iron chest was not broken open. - A. No, I saw two cleavers that were bent, with mortar and brick dust upon them.</p>

Yes, says he, come in, I went in, he told me to shut the door, I pushed the door, but I did not shut it; I sat down on the block in the shop, and when I sat down I found something under me, which occasioned me to get off, I found it was a knife, I stood up and leaned upon the knife, I was very much in liquor; I fell down, I very well recollect my hat falling off; the watchman came to the door and asked who is there, I answered me, he said who are you, I made answer, I belong to here; he catched hold of the knife in my hand, I let the knife go, and he catched hold of my coat; I recollect no more of the business.</p>

The occasion of my knowing them to have been stolen, I was informed by an officer of Worship-street that they had taken one of my servants with some lead; I went with them to the dwelling house of the prisoner, they had a search warrant, and on searching the house I found in company with the officer, ninety five guineas in gold, in two paper boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not yours, you had not missed any gold. - A. We found a number of things in iron and brass that I recognised to be mine; part of them I have sworn to be my property, they came from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the articles you found. - A. Brass bosses, parts of brass door knockers, and what we call bell carriages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. These articles are not peculiar to your warehouse. - A. The bosses are old bosses taken out of a crane which I had taken out from Mr. Newman of Snowhill; strictly speaking they are Mr. Newman's property, but under my care till I had sent Mr. Newman my account, then I should have allowed for the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these articles that you have been speaking of in Mr. Newman's house. - A. I saw them upon the arms of the crane in which they were placed, and I saw them in my house after they were taken out; and I had missed them for two or three days, they were laying on his vice board.</p>
               <p>Q. This man you say had lived with you sixteen years, you must have had a good opinion of him. - A. So much so, his father who died in my service, after twenty years servitude, bound his wife's son apprentice to me; there was fifty pounds left. I made him a freeman, and made him a present of forty pounds odd, because the boy was to be instructed by him. He was a man that I should have been glad if this had not happened, I should have been pleased to have sacrificed five hundred pounds for him.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On Friday the 17th of October I was in company with Mason, a brother officer, going down Purl street, in the parish of Christ Church; I observed the prisoner in an old iron shop with a bag, and out of that bag he shot into a scale that was in the old iron shop, about seventy pounds of lead. I went in immediately with Mason, and asked the prisoner where he got that lead; he hesitated for some time, I informed him that I was an officer of Worship street; it was my duty to know. He at last informed me he was foreman to Mr. Marriott, and that it was his perquisite. I took him to the office; my brother officer went immediately to Mr. Marriott's, to know whether it was the truth. Mr. Marriott appeared at the office; I produce the lead.</p>
               <p>- BISHOP sworn. In consequence of a search warrant I went in company with Mr. Marriott, Mason, and Ray, to the apartments of the prisoner No. 5, Little Purl street. On searching his back room I found a quantity of brass articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the bosses that Mr. Marriott speaks of. - A. Yes, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriott. These are the bosses, they are those that have been worn by friction; these six bosses belonged to one frame, which composes the crane of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that they are those you took from Mr. Newman. - A. Yes, I saw them day by day; the prisoner put new iron ones in the crane for those he took out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give these bosses, or any other article, to this man, allowing them as perquisites. - A. Never in my life, nor ever heard of such a thing. I should have stated they were found concealed in the hole of a forge in a bag in a little shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It ways always a rule in the trade ever since I have been in it, that is almost nineteen years, to have the old brass and lead. If the right person had them they belong to Mr. Newman, Skinner street.</p>

               <p>Q. Then in a shop where there is a great deal of work done, it must be worth something to a foreman, the old brass and the old lead must be worth two or three hundred pounds a year. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. That was merely suspicion. - A. Merely suspicion; at his father's house I found some articles to which I had given to him to do what we call bell carriages and cranks; the officer searched him in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290009"/>my presence at the office. I saw some brass escutcheons taken from his breeches pocket, and a brass plate; he had them to work a day or two before.

Upon which you told him he had no right to take them without your leave, his answer was, he was sorry for taking them without your leave, and he was going to take them home to your house; what is the value of the whole of the articles found on him. - A.

             sworn. Q. You are a police constable. - A. I am. I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of this month in Worship street office. In his breeches pocket I found eight brass escutcheons, a piece of brass plate, and the key of a beer barrel; I asked him how he came by them, he said he was going to take them to be lackered, afterwards he said he was going to take them home, I went afterwards to the prisoner's apartment in company with Mason; in the prisoner's box, in his father in law's house, I found four small bags of gold and silver; the mother pointed out the box to me, the bags contained about seven pound in gold and silver; the the prisoner said that one bag containing two guineas, three half guineas, and three half crowns were his; the other bags he said he knew nothing about. I produce the articles in brass.</p>

On the 7th of October, about seven in the evening, the property was taken from my house; I had seen it about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before that at the further end of the counter, that comes into the passage of a night, in a place where we keep brooms and such things. I suspected some person in the house had thrown it there for the purpose of conveying it away. I went out and pulled the street door too, leaving my nephew, my shopman, and my porter, in the house; when I went out I waited about a quarter of an hour in sight of the door, at about thirty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to such a distance that you could see any body coming out. - A. The way I could see was by the opening of the door; when I saw the door open, I drew nearer. I saw him coming out, I saw it was the porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off were you then. - A. From ten to fifteen yards, I walked up to him, I asked him what he had got there, he said nothing; I then requested that he would go back with me to see what the bundle contained.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a bundle then. - A. Oh, yes, when I came up I could see him as well as at broad day. I saw a bundle, he went back with me as far as the door, and when I was in the act of ringing the bell he disentangled himself by twisting my arm, and gave me a blow across my breast; in the act of escaping his arm came across my chest, he then ran down Southampton-street towards the Strand; I pursued him and cried out stop thief, he was stopped in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up to him. - A. Yes; he had not the bundle with him when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you afterwards see the bundle. - A. I saw the bundle in my nephew's possession at the bottom of Southampton-street not a minute after. It contained a piece of our furniture cotton, about twenty-eight yards, it was worth two guineas to me.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that handkerchief yours. - A. It is a silk handkerchief, it is not mine, it was the covering that was on the bundle when I saw it under the man's arm. I saw the handkerchief by the light of a false hair shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And the contents is yours. - A. I can safely say it is the cotton I saw in the place under the counter; I know it is mine.</p>

On Saturday the 18th of October, about six in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop and asked to see some stockings; she was shewn a parcel containing three pair, she asked to look at some at a lower price; while the second parcel was getting she purloined a pair of the three pair of stockings that she had seen before. I charged her with taking them, she persisted in saying that she had not got them, that I might search her; I sent the lad for a constable, the constable came, she produced them, and asked me to forgive her; these are the stockings, they are men's ribbed worsted stockings, they are my property.</p>

On the night of the 19th of September I met him coming out of the house with a basket of wood. I made him take it back; on opening it I found some quartering cut in pieces, I selected the pieces, and joined them together, which made a piece of quartering and a deal board.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they call them chips. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Laurence was the master carpenter who did the work at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you did not superintend the work. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not be by when the wood was stolen. - A. How do you know that.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you was better employed; when the men first came to the house it was agreed they should have two pints of beer a day. - A. When you talk of agreements I must state to you, I will explain to you, because I must know more of it than you.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290011"/>Q. Had not you agreed to allow each of them men two pints of beer in a day. - A. I had no agreement with these men; I stated to the carpenter that I employed, that the men should not take away any wood; I had other buildings, I found that I had been robbed under the pretence of taking away wood; they took iron and lead. He said these men will be discontented unless you let them take some chips for firing, I said let them have what beer you like by way of encouraging them, but then they robbed me to a considerable extent. I do not say this man, it seemed to be a general system, they had cut pieces of oak and carried it away. When I found the men were carrying away the wood and iron, I said I will allow no more beer, I told the men that there was not a splinter in this house but what is my property, and the first man that took out any I will prosecute him. Now that is what you call an agreement.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell the men they must not take any thing out of the house. - A. Yes, I told them I would not suffer them to take any thing out of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In point of fact the beer was stopped. A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after the general allowance of beer was stopped you saw the prisoner carrying the basket. A. Yes, and he persisted he would do it. I believe the man thought he had a right; I told him I would put it in issue whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to work for Mr. Laurence, the first day I did not go to Mr. Fenton's; the next day I was sent about nine o'clock, Mr. Laurence says, Thomas, Mr. Fenton will allow you two pints of beer, take no chips; I said, very well. I did not take any during the time the beer was not stopped; after the beer was stopped the men began to take away the chips, and I took away the same; I met Mr. Fenton, he said where are you going with them, I said, to my lodgings, he said I must not have them, he threw the basket out in the entry; I said you must have them. I went to the public house and I had a pint of porter, I came back to the house again, at the the corner of the yard I met

             said he had taken his home to his lodgings. Accordingly they went together and saw this man's chips, they said it was old rotten stuff; Mr. Fenton said, as for your part, I shall make an example of you; I was taken into custody, I did not know what was in my basket, they were put in by the other men. When I was at the bar I saw the alderman and Mr. Fenton whispering together, they asked me what I had to say in my defence, and whether I was willing to serve my king and country; I told them I was not sit, I had been fourteen years in the service, and I had been in a French prison. I said I must take my trial for it.</p>

             sworn. I am a brass founder, I live at No. 8, Shoe-lane. This day week, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop between one and two o'clock in the day, he had two parcels of metal tied up in a handkerchief; he emptied one in the scale, I asked him who the metal belonged to, he said his father, he kept an old rag shop at the further end of Shoe-lane; I knew there was no such shop there; I asked him to tell the truth, for I knew the metal must be stolen; he then said that she lived in Shoe-lane but her shop was in Holborn; he said he could not tell me but he could shew me the house; I told him he must tell me, because I was very certain it came from some founder's shop. I went with him along Shoe-lane, till he came to Robin Hood court, he went up the steps into Dean-street; and then made a push to run away, I then seized hold of him and brought him back and repeatedly requested him to tell me whose metal it was, and I would send for his master to take him away, and the metal together. I sent for a constable, he searched him, and then he said he worked for Mr. Warner; he then said after his master came, that he took one part on the night before, and the other part on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember what day it was. - A. It was on the Tuesday; me and my wife went out to Sadler's Wells, we went off at four o'clock, when I went away I gave her particular care over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were the woman there washing for you. - A. Yes, I gave her the order before the women, I gave her an order not to open the door after nine o'clock, I told her not to open the door to any person after then; but to go up stairs and look out of the window as it would be late before I should get home; it was a long way from Brompton to Sadler's Wells.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return. - A. I returned at one o'clock in the morning of the 8th. When I came to the house the door was fast, I got a barrow and looked over the window, I saw a candle alight, the door was locked, I went to the back door as I found the key was gone, I went backwards, there was a window left open, and there was a candle left burning in the kitchen, the room that we always live in; the back window was open that laid over the washhouse, there is a board that we lift up to let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290013"/>the steam out, I thought of going in that way, and I got in directly. I was very much afraid, I saw the light, I came down the stairs as quick as possible I could to my wife to let her in. I took the candle, I says you take another candle and see if any person is there to knock me down, we went through the house and through every room, and looked under the beds, we went into the room that we sleep in, we found nobody but the dogs, one large one and one little one that we keep. One of the women is in court that left the house at nine o'clock, she says that the prisoner bolted the door after her, and that she did leave Margaret Rrice in the house; when we went into the room my wife looked in the drawers, she says some person has been to the drawers, I went into the room with one candle and she with another; she says I have missed the caps.</p>

I value them at ten shillings a piece, the three petticoats at four shillings a piece, there are two pair of cotton stockings, they are valued at sixpence the two pair, the bedgown I cannot say what it is worth, a pair of stays at eight shillings, a bonnet at one shilling.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The watch is mine, I had it new in January, I gave four pounds two shillings and sixpence for it, I valued it at two pounds, I have got the receipt in my pocket, and the particular marks it has in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before you went out in the afternoon. - A. When I came home again to town I gave she care of it to put it in the top drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when she was taken up Mr. Jones. - A. Yes; I traced her that night, I went in the morning to Bow street, at half after five to get an officer. I found her between nine and ten on the morning of the eighth coming out of No. 73, Great Peter street, Westminster; says I, there she is, with my wife's clothes on, she had got my wife's great coat on and gown and petticoat; she said master there is the watch, she took it out of her bosom. I said I have nothing to do with it, deliver it up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her, and find all the rest of your things. - A. Yes, they were found on her arm, she was coming out of the door, and going away with them, except one bonnet the officer found in the room afterwards that she came out of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Jones, what parish is your house in. - A. In the parish of Kensington, in Brompton division, the gentlemen collect the money for Kensington parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that it is in Kensington parish. A. I do not know any further.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) How came you to be so particular, did you examine where these things were before you went out. - A. I had taken things out of the drawers before I went out, I did not take the things out one by one.</p>
               <p>Q. You took other things out of the drawer, and that is the only reason you have for recollecting these things were in the drawer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them together, did you not separate them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) With respect to the watch, Mr. Jones, you gave her that to take care of. - A. I had broke the glass, it dropped down while we were at tea with the other women, I says, Peggy, take the watch up stairs, and put it on the top of the drawers, which she did. I went up stairs to take my hat, I saw it there then.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer found the bonnet afterwards in the room. - A. The bonnet was in the room, and he brought it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what the officer said, I believe you had a good character with this girl when she came to you. - A. Yes, I trusted her with a five pound note to take to a gentleman, I would have trusted her with any thing else in this world till this unhappy affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect her. - A. No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. If you call five hundred witnesses to her character, it cannot do away the fact, the girl goes out of the house, and the property is found on her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had it been been broke before you went to bed the night before. - A. No, the shutter was cut at the bottom, either with a knife or chisel; I had shut it up the night before myself, the window was cracked open, so that any body could put their hands in and draw the goods out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss. - A. Ten pair of velveteen corderoy breeches, twelve marsello waistcoats, eight swansdown waistcoats, twelve pair of boys small clothes, two pair of stockings and two women's shoes; I am sure they were there the night before. In the morning I went to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see this person. - A. About eleven o'clock he was produced to, me at the office. I had seen the prisoner about five months before, he called in the shop and I sold him a waistcoat; he had the same waistcoat on when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn. I am a watchman of Bunhill-row, I got out of my box directly as St. Paul's clock struck four; I beat round past four towards Chiswell-street; at the corner of Chiswell-street, I saw the prisoner come past, I asked the prisoner what he had got there, as he had a bundle under his arm, he made me no answer, he ran away directly, I ran after him and sprang my rattle and cried out stop thief, I told my partner at the corner of Grub-street to stop him, that there was a man with a bundle come down there.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Jones) What is the name of that watchman where the place was broken open. - A. I do not know, he is not here.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you have him here. - A. I forgot of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Williams) You sprang the rattle and called Stop thief, did you pursue him. - A. Yes, my partner said he did not come up his way; I said he has gone up Campden-court.</p>
               <p>Q. You had missed him then a little while. - A. Yes, for about a minute; we found him on a flight of steps that goes up one pairs of stairs in Campden-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him run up. - A. No, my partner being at the end of the next court, we knew that he could not get past, because he stands at the end of that court and I knew he run up Grub-street; when he found he was detected he was coming down the flight of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle. - A. I do not know, we could not find the bundle; we found a pair of shoes at the entry where he was at the top of the flight of steps, where he had been standing, we took him in custody to the watchhouse. I asked him directly I saw him on the stairs, what he had done with the bundle; he replied what, me the bundle, me the bundle; yes, I says, you are the man, I will swear; he said he knew nothing about the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shoes there. - A. Yes, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Jones) Can you swear to these shoes. - A. Yes, these are two odd shoes; one is lined with leather and the other with linen, the shoes lay within the reach of a man's arm at the window where the hole was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then produce them to him. - A. I did, and he identified them. I saw the shutter where is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290016"/>had been cut out of the groove, and a pane of glass broke.</p>

At the back of my own house in the mews, he came to me at the stable, he said he heard that I had a horse to sell, he bought a person with him whom I had some little knowledge of, who lived in the neighbourhood. He likewise recommended him to buy the horse, he agreed to give seven pounds for the horse, the horse was shewn him, I asked him for a shilling earnest, he borrowed a shilling of the person that was with him and gave it me; he told me he was about taking some stables in the neighbourhood, it would not be convenient to take him away then, if I would keep it two or three days he would satisfy me for the keep of it; I told him I would, he went away.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand from you that you had absolutely sold the horse. - A. Yes, when he had paid me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that you agreed with him for the price of seven pounds, and you desired a shilling earnest, which you had, and then you had stipulated for two or three days that you were to keep the horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have taken it away immediately if he pleased. - A. If he paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said then about his paying for it. - A. I do not know that there was, I considered the horse as sold, though I had not the money, and I considered that he would pay me the money when he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. You considered the shilling as binding the bargain. - A. Yes, he said he would fetch it away on the Monday, or Tuesday following, and pay me for it, this was on Saturday; on Tuesday he came and trimmed the horse, and took it away; he said he was going as far as Paddington, he thought he had got a customer for the horse, he would go and shew it to a gentleman, and he would bring it back, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he have sold it to that gentleman. A. I expected he would either bring me the horse or the money back. He brought the horse back at five o'clock, he said it would not suit the gentleman. On Thursday he came into my own shop about one o'clock in the day and asked me to lend him the horse, he had been and sold a horse for sixty guineas, and he wanted to go to Cornhill to get change for a check, he should not be gone above an hour, he would then return and pay for the horse and take it away; on that ground I went out with him and delivered him the horse to go into the city on the ground of him coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean, on the ground of supposing him to come back. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Q. Do you mean to come back with the horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what necessity there was for him riding to Cornhill. - A. He said if I would lend him the horse he might as well ride as walk.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you not say he might as well walk as ride. - A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did he ever return the horse. - A. He did not. About a quarter of an hour after he had been with me that day my boy saw a boy riding the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. That we shall hear from him, when did you see the horse again. - A. I saw the horse the next day, I saw a boy riding it about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw nothing of the prisoner then. - A. No, sir, I saw the prisoner about three or four days afterwards I saw him pass where I live, I followed him into a public house in the the neighbourhood, I asked him where my horse was, I told him I heard he had sold it, I told him I would go and take him away from the man that had got it, he said I could not do that, he said he would put another horse into my custody till such times he had paid me for the other; I told him it was very well, I hoped he would bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290017"/>me another horse or pay me the money; I told him I thought he wanted to swindle me out of the horse, he made some fair promises, and I expected to see him again the same day; he never came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I ask you upon your oath did you never part with this horse as a sale. - A. No, I never should have parted with the horse, except I had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday when he came, your apprentice was present in the shop. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the horse afterwards. - A. I went to the man that had bought the horse, and I asked him if he had bought such a horse, he is here, his name is Henderson; I saw the horse last night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On the 27th of August, about one o'clock in the day, he called at my house, I bought the horse of him, he said, Henderson, I see you were looking at this poney when I was buying it of Mr. Curtis (I was at Mr. Curtis's stables); he said I have bought him for a customer of mine, it does not suit him, and if you like to have him, I will sell him to you for seven guinear and a small dish of fish, whatever you like to give me; I bought the poney of him, I gave him seven guineas on that day, I have got the receipt in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse again. - A. I have seen him; I disposed of him afterwards, the next day after Mr. Purveiss was taken before Mr. Conant; the horse was of no use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Henderson whether he did not go to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18061029-19-person252">Curtis</persName>
             the day after I had bought the poney, and Mr. Curtis told him he had sold it to Mr. Purveiss - A. I did. On Monday before the 27th I went into Mr. Curtis's stable yard, he says to me, what, Henderson, you are come niggling, or something like that, after my horse again; I said, Curtis, I think the horse will suit me, I should wish to buy him, his reply to me was you are too late, for I have sold him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to that gentleman, meaning the prisoner at the bar, I made answer and said it is of no use of my saying any more about him; I went home and left them together.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you sold this horse the day after the prisoner was taken before a magistrate. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to dispose of him when you knew this enquiry was before a magistrate. - A. I went down to Marlborough-street when I heard Purveiss was taken up, to hear if Mr. Conant said any thing about horse stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at the examination of the prisoner. - A. Yes, and I did not hear any thing that inclined me to keep it, and I was tired of it, it was not worth a guinea instead of seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You say this horse was not worth a guinea to you, what did you sell him for. - A. He was restive and would not turn without backing him; I sold him for eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold this restive horse for eight guineas. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing at all said to you at Mr. Conant's office. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not told not to sell this horse. - A. Not at the office, there was a man came to me and said you must not part with this horse before we find Purveiss.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly Mr. Purveiss was taken up you parted with it. - A. Yes, because I thought I might do what I liked with it then, I am not used to any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Court. Who had. - A. Mr. Curtis; Mr. Curtis was not at home, we retired to a public house and waited till he came in. He then took me to the stable and shewed me the poney; I saw the poney out, then I requested him to let me ride it to Chapel-street, Lisson Green; he asked me how long I should be gone, I said ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; the person I went to see was not at home. I returned immediately, he asked me on my return<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290018"/>how I liked the poney, I told him not at all for its riding part, as to its drawing part I did not know; I wanted one to do both; he told me it been accustomed to ride a very little, but it was a very good one in harness; he asked me whether I would make a purchase of it or not; I told him as he had let it till Monday, that would be time enough to decide about it; he said if I thought it would suit me, I might as well decide then, as on Monday; I asked him the lowest price he would take for it, he said seven guineas; I told him I never bought for guineas, I would give him seven pounds for it on Monday if it came back safe; he requested me to give him earnest, I asked him whether he wished for a shilling or a guinea, he said a shilling would do; I having no silver, I borrowed a shilling of the person that took me to him, which I gave him; I called on the Monday at one o'clock, which was the time limited for the poney's return, but it was not returned till the evening; I then called on the Tuesday, the poney was in a very rough state, I trimmed it and made it look in the best state I could, to shew it to another person; I shewed it to the person that I intended to sell it at the time I made the first purchase; I had two or three places to go on business, and after I had gone I returned the poney, I requested him to keep the poney till the end of the week, and I would allow him any thing reasonable for the livery of it, he agreed that it should stand till the end of the week. On Thursday I had occasion to go to two or three places on business, I went to Curtis and asked him to lend me his saddle and bridle, which he did, he put the bridle on and led the poney out, he desired me to take care that he did not kick me and throw me down, he wished that I might not bring it back again; when I got into the adjoining street there was a green grocer wished to look at it, he tried to buy it of me, I let him ride it up and down the street; Mr. Henderson, whom I had previously promised the poney to, provided that he did not suit the person whom I had purchased it for in the first instance, he met me in the same street, he told me that he had got the money for the poney in his pocket if I would take it to his house, which I did, he paid me the money and I gave him a receipt, I requested him to take care of the saddle and the bridle till my return, which might be about five or six o'clock, I did not return that evening; the next morning I went down to Mr. Curtis's, who I saw at his door, I called him to me, we went to a public house to drink a pint of porter, I told him that I had sold the poney, and that I should call and pay him in the course of two or three days, he said he wished to have the money, as he wanted to go to Barnet fair, I told him I should endeavour in the course of the day to get the money, and I was sorry to disappoint him; when I got to the stables where I had two horses that stood at livery, there was a direction left at the stables for me, to a gentleman in the New Road; on my way I called on Curtis, to say that if I was lucky in selling that horse I should call and pay him, but I did not sell it; I told him rather than he should be afraid of his money I would leave him a mare that was worth forty guineas, instead of his poney he requested me to go to his stable to look at his horse's eye; I went to several places to raise the money, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him to look at the horse's eye. - A. I did go with him to the stable to look at the horse's eye; on the following day I went to two places in the country a little way, for money, when I returned I called in the adjoining street to the stables I had taken, where I was told that Mr. Curtis had been to look for me with three officers, to take me up for horse stealing, I said if that was the case I had got the principal part of the money to pay him, but I would not go near him, I turned my horses's head and went to Bayswater, where I live, and about nine o'clock in the evening he came down to my house with three or four men, I did not see him, I was apprised of it, I went out of the way; I was three weeks about the neighbourhood, I met with a friend of Curtis's, I desired him to send for him in order to settle the business, when he came he brought a constable along with him in order to take me into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did. - A. Mr. Curtis; I went before Mr. Conant in Marlborough-street, and Mr. Conant asked Curtis how long he had lost his horse, he said I had not stole it, he had taken earnest, a shilling earnest, he had sold it to me; Mr. Conant thought proper to commit me for it; I have another witness that I should be glad for your lordship to hear.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) I thought you said the agreement was made on the Saturday. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse engaged to go any where - A. A neighbour of mine wanted me to lend him the horse, to go a little way on Saturday, and he would be home on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend him. - A. I did, it did not return till the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say a word about that before; when Henderson was down there on the Monday the horse was not come back. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner on the Saturday following. - A. Yes, I was coming down the street where I live, he beckoned me and I followed him into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you there that he had sold the poney. - A. He did, I knew to whom he had sold it; I told him, as I had before, I would go and take it away, he said I could not, he would leave another horse in my custody, in case he did notpay me that afternoon; he never brought the horse. I certainly should have taken it if he had, till he paid me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did he accompany you with his advice about any horse's eye in your stable. - A. Yes, I asked him to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during this time you had an opportunity of securing him. - A. I had if I had choosed to do it. I did not think that he would have used me as he had.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that he had sold your horse, and you understood that he had deceived you in getting possession of it. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no thought of prosecuting him then for stealing it. - A. I had not; it was above a fortnight after that, he never came near me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see him again, you say this was on the Saturday. - A. I think it was the Tuesday following he came and saw the horse's eye, or the Wednesday, I am not sure which; it was in the following week he came, and rid up to the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290019"/>and said he would call and pay me for the horse in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this happened that you actually took him up. - A. It was three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the money had been brought to you it would have been all well. - A. Mr. Conant told him at the office that if he brought the money all would be well then.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have consented to that. - A. Yes. He told the magistrate he never intended to pay for it.</p>

            , having seen her at market before, being in the habit of resorting to Covent Garden to purchase fruit; she said she was going to purchase some articles of the prosecutor, and asked me if I would accompany her; I went with her only as an acquaintance, not having any knowledge of her having any intention to defraud; being perfectly assured of my innocence I stopped at the shop last, nor had I any thing of the kind, nor coveting any body's property without paying for it; nor in any part of this affair had I any knowledge, as I understood previous to pawning the handkerchief that she had purchased them of a duffer in the street; and this being my first time of being brought before any court, I hope you will take my unfortunate case into consideration.</p>
               <p>Daley's Defence. I was going to market, I met this young woman, and on going to market I met a duffer in the street that had some handkerchiefs, I took a liking to them and I bought them; coming from market I came up Long Acre, this gentleman followed me and took me a prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Page) Look at these handkerchiefs, can you swear to these having been the property of your master. - A. I cannot positively swear, they are of course the same, there is one of them I had, it is the same which was marked in the window, which is the one I have with me now; we had one that the lamp overflowed in the window and spoiled a great many things; I recollect a lamp that overflowed and the oil fell on some silk handkerchiefs, that handkerchief was put up and was not shewn to any other person after the young man came in and let me know it. I recollect having the pattern of this piece when I shewed it to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you said any thing before to the prisoner in the Strand. - A. Not a word; when the witness told me that my pocket was picked, I put my hand into my pocket and missed a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your pocket. - A. Behind, similar to this, and part of my handkerchief was laying out, I had just put it in my pocket, I had been wiping my face, being very warm, just before I had seen him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290021"/>I turned round and saw the prisoner running away, I immediately followed him, and I saw him throw the handkerchief from him in the street, by a cart; I got up to him, I accused him of stealing my handkerchief, he denied it, I immediately took him to Bow-street, he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief. - A. The handkerchief was picked up by a boy, who gave it me; I know nothing of the boy, I have not seen him since; I saw the boy pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the handkerchief which you saw the boy pick up was the same handkerchief that you saw the prisoner throw on the ground. - A. To the best of my knowledge it was, I cannot swear to the handkerchief because there is no mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the same handkerchief that you saw the prisoner throw on the ground was the same that you saw the boy pick up. - A. Yes, the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, that is what I ask you; did you perceive the prisoner push against you at that side of your coat. - A. I felt him some few minutes before I missed my handkerchief treading on my heels, I thought it was by accident; the people passing and repassing, I thought he could not avoid it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the handkerchief. - A. The handkerchief was given to me, I kept it in my hand all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that handkerchief that was picked up. - A. It has been to be washed with others, I cannot pretend to say it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How careless. - A. I did not know it was of any consequence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a new handkerchief, or had it been wore. - A. I had it some time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not sure the one you produce is the same. - A. No, I am not sure, because none of them that I have are marked; I did not know it was of consequence so I did not retain the particular one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all of the same age. - A. The handkerchiefs were all of the same age.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he ran before you over took him. - A. About fifteen or twenty paces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this handkerchief was an old one, you had it a long time, it would not fetch much if it was sold. - A. It would but fetch a trifle if it was sold.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the handkerchief into the side pocket of a new coat as they now make them, an handkerchief might easily fall out. - A. Certainly it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain that you had put it intirely in. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it might have fell, and this man might have picked it up. - A. I cannot say that he did not, the boy was just before me, stooping for the handkerchief, as I sprang to lay hold of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. However, it might have dropped down; if you had kept that handkerchief and looked at it now, you could not positively swear to the handkerchief - A. No, I could not, because I had no mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the handkerchief I see is a very common one. - A. It is a very common one.</p>
               <p>JOHN JOHNSON sworn. Q. On the 7th of October were you in the Strand. - A. I cannot ascertain the day of the month, it was the day of Lord Percy's election; I was coming up the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) This was the day of the election. - A. Yes, the people was standing at the duke of Northumberland's house as I came by.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Johnson.) Whereabouts was you then. - A. I think I was nearly opposite Covent Garden, of the opposite side of the way, I saw this gentleman, Mr. Pritchard, walk very fast on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at that time. - A. I saw a person following Mr. Pritchard very closely.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person that was following Mr. Pritchard very closely. - A. He was a total stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him. - A. I cannot say it was the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the man that was afterwards taken to the public office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean, you say you saw a person following him very closely, was that the same person that was afterwards laid hold off - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself went to the public office, did you not go to give your evidence. - A. Yes, I gave my evidence there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see this person do, whoever he was, that was taken to the public office. - A. This person, or Mr. Pritchard, run against me, and hit me on the shoulder, I saw Mr. Pritchard pass on with the handkerchief hanging out in this manner (a corner hanging out), it was visible to every body; I had not got above three or four yards when I saw Mr. Pritchard's pocket empty; I saw a man huddling a handkerchief up in this manner. (witness describing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing at the time it was taken from the pocket. - A. I only saw the handkerchief out of the pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man with the handkerchief in his hand, did you not see him draw it out of his pocket. - A. I cannot pretend to say directly that I saw him take it out of Mr. Pritchard's pocket, I saw it not a foot from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see him take it from Mr. Pritchard's pocket. - A. I did not, I only saw it in his hand, and at that time there was no handkerchief hanging out of Mr. Pritchard's pocket, and directly after I saw the handkerchief in the man's hand, I informed Mr. Pritchard of it, I tapped him on the shoulder, sir, says I, you have had your pocket picked, the man after that turned back and ran off as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the man to Mr. Pritchard when you tapped him on the shoulder. - A. About a couple of yards, I passed the man to tell Mr. Pritchard, and in the mean time the man drew back, and endeavoured to make his escape; when I turned to see what became of the man, I pointed to Mr. Pritchard, and said there goes the man, Mr. Pritchard pursued him and laid hold of him; I did not see the handkerchief again till it was in Mr. Pritchard's hand; I accompanied Mr. Pritchard and the young man to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Was the man that you stopped the same man that the witness had pointed out to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290022"/>you as having your handkerchief. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner. - A. That was the man, I never lost sight of him from the time he pointed him out to me till the time I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say who was the person that followed you so and trod on your heels. - A. I thought it was the same man, I cannot exactly say it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing more to say than I am a painter and glazier by trade; that on the day this affair took place I was so much intoxicated, in fact I cannot tell any thing what passed; I had been to work at six o'clock in the morning, I went home at eight o'clock in the morning to breakfast after getting some money of my master; I met a few friends, I got drinking till I got into the Strand, and whether I ran against this gentleman I do not know; as to the handkerchief being in my hand it was not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

He did, he came about seven o'clock, he said will you buy some small pieces of lead, I said let me see them; he with the assistance of a porter brought in an enormous piece of lead; the piece that came in first was from one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds weight, it caused me to suspect that it was not honestly come by. I told him that I could not very well weigh it, he must leave it; he said that he particularly came to town to get money for some clothes that he owed for, he said if you cannot weigh it guess at it; this of course made my suspicion stronger.</p>

I borrowed Chapman's house and cart on Tuesday evening, I turned the horse into the field till the morning, and then I brought the remainder of the lead to Mr. Robinson's, I drove the horse up to the door, he gave me half a guinea, I returned in half an hour, he was not within; I came presently after again to his house, this was the third time, I called, I might have gone away if I would, I immediately went to Robinson's house after having a pint of beer; they had a constable then aud detained me.</p>

I went down to Worship street, and there I asked the magistrate leave to publish some hand bills.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a city officer. - A. Yes. On the 14th of this month I was in Gracechurch-street; I am generally there every day; I was standing of the opposite side of the way, where the prisoner was and another man; I observed them for some time (half an hour before this happened); I watched them very narrowly, the prisoner and the man that was with him were very genteely dressed, and with boots on (not as he is now), and a clean white apron, rolled up; I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290024"/>have taken him to be a decent mechanic; I traced them from there to Cornhill, they went backwards and forwards into Cornhill, and then into Gracechurch-street; just as they came to a caricature shop opposite the Exchange, there was a number of people standing there, and a hackney coach, it was very inconvenient to pass, I thought then if he meant to do any thing he would do it at the time, as the prosecutor was going by the hind wheel of the coach, he kept from it as much as he could to keep it from dirting his clothes as I supposed; I see him lay hold of the handkerchief, of the side of it, the long end hung down and he throwed it up to catch the other end, that moment I put my hand upon him, I halloed lustily to the gentleman, he stopped; I was not able to manage his companion, for fear of letting go this. I produce the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it has my name on it in white silk letters.</p>

             sworn. I am clerk to Messrs. Bracken and Williams. On the 1st of this month, coming into Packer's court in the evening between six and seven o'clock, I turned round to make water, I saw two men at the upper end of the court, apparently making exchange of something from one to the other; they immediately came forward, I saw that one of them had a piece of flannel under his arm, I immediately turned round and asked them what they were going to do with it; I was answered it was nothing to me; I attempted to catch the man that had the flannel, he immediately throwed the flanuel across my legs, before me, so that I could not go forward till I had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. They attempted to make off. - A. Yes, as soon as I got the flannel up I called out Stop thief, almost immediately the man was brought back, and by the voice that I heard, it was the man that had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290025"/>spoke to me, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the man that had the flannel. - A. I am sure the prisoner is the man that answered me, by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing his person. - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure by his voice it is the same man that answered you, it is nothing to you when you asked them where they were going with it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot identify his person any otherwise. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he brought back to you. - A. One minute I presume, not more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>You say you had not an opportunity of knowing their persons. - A. I had not, it was too dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after the prisoner was brought back to you, will you undertake to swear that the prisoner was the person that passed you. - A. I will undertake to swear that it was him by the circumstance of his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before, or hear him speak before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You undertake to swear that the prisoner at the bar is the man, by these few words, having never heard his voice before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Then I will say no more to you, I will leave it to the jury to judge.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. I live in Warnford Court, Throgmorton street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion on the 15th instant to have a butt of sherry wine bottled. A. I had, the two prisoners at the bar were sent to my house for that purpose by Mr. Heathfield a wine merchant; they bottled the sherry wine in my cellar, and packed it in prickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wine so packed in prickets, and there was one pricket in which there was no wine. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct them to fill that pricket with any other wine. - A. Yes, with champagne.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in your cellar in Warnford-court. - A. I told them to put in four dozen of that in that pricket.</p>
               <p>Q. By which means, of course they had access to the champagne; did you see yourself the wine put in. - A. No, I cannot say that I saw them particularly put the champagne in with it; my direction was for them to go to my house at Hackney with it; I only ordered them to fill the pricket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the other basket there besides the pricket. - A. I cannot say whether I did or not, I might have seen them put that basket in the cart with the rest of the prickets; I did not know whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290026"/>there was any thing in it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did see the hamper put in. - A. I did, I had not ordered it to be put in.</p>
               <p>Q. When the wine arrived at your house at Hackney there were these two men and the carter there - A. They were there about a quarter of an hour before I arrived there; I set them to work in the cellar; I opened the inner cellar for them to get some saw-dust.</p>
               <p>Q. What wine did that inner cellar contain. - A. It contained some port, maderia, mountain, and other wines; I believe I shewed them the place where they were to put the wine, and then I went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the cellars open when they were at work. - A. They were; when I came out from dinner I observed the cart at the door with two or three prickets in it, I put my hand into one of the prickets, to see whether they were full or empty, I felt a bottle, I put my hand in the straw and felt another bottle; I went into the parlour and told the gentleman in the parlour the circumstance, he came out with me, we found these two bottles were corked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue your examination any further. - A. I did not at that time, I went below in the cellar to see how they were coming on, I saw them at dinner with my servants; on my coming out again I saw the pricket overset and the straw loose about the cart, that made me think it was intentionally done to be carried away.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not see how the oversetting the pricket would make you suspect. - A. I suspected the carman had seen me feel these prickets, and that he himself had been in the mean time and taken them out; I then called for a candle to see what was become of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. You perceived nothing more than two bottles, do you know what the quality of that wine was. - A. No, on a candle being brought me by my stable boy, who is by me, I observed a small basket underneath the cart; I said Charles take the candle and see what is underneath in that basket, upon that he brought out nine bottles, I saw that myself.</p>
               <p>Q. He took nine bottles out of a basket flung underneath the cart. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what that wine was. - A. I supposed it was sherry, I cannot say, then I called the coachman up, in the mean time the carman was by, took it off the ground and carried it down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other two put on the ground at the same time that you saw before. - A. I did not see them taken out of the pricket at all, they were taken out in the interval that I went down in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever ascertained what wine it was - A. Not till it was taken down into the cellar, I then asked the prisoners how they could do such an act as that, they laid the charge upon the carman; upon that the carman laughed and seemed very careless about what he had done; I then told the servant to go for a constable; in the mean time they told the carman he ought to be ashamed for laughing so, and to say he was sorry for it, and they dare say I would forgive him; the two prisoners, after I had sent for the constable for them, they went into the cellar and stowed the remainder of the wine, and when they had finished the nine bottles that they had brought down from the cart, which were put upon the rest of the wine to shew me that the quantity was right, I think it was forty eight dozen and ten bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these nine bottles prove to be sherry. - A. I thought they were, I did not look at them then. On the Saturday following Mr. Heathfield came to me, I went down the cellar to shew him the wine, the nine bottles were set apart, he then observed that two of the bottles were not his bottles, which he brought up stairs, and drawed the cork, one proved to be a bottle of madeira, and the other a bottle of port, which madeira must have been taken out of the cellar behind the door; there was madeira there, and there was port in the next bin; when they had done binning the whole of the wine I told my coachman I would have all them prickets brought out of the cart, upon which the prisoners said they had forgot one hamper, which hamper was taken out of the basket under the cart, and it proved to be this small hamper of champagne in it; there were four prickets of champagne in the cellar in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. What did this hamper contain. - A. ten or twelve bottles, I did not take them out, there is a person that can prove it; the small hamper of champagne was emptied in my cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be the same fort of wine that you had in the cellar. - A. To the best of my knowledge it was, they were champagne bottles.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether this was part of the champagne that was brought from the hoard, or whether it was taken out of the cellar, that you do not know, there were the same fort in both. - A. Yes, and the same fort of bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they claim it. - A. No, they said it was left behind in a mistake, they had forgot that small hamper; I told them only to fill the prickel, they had that hamper over and above what they brought in the prickel.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STRANGE sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. You are a servant to Mr. Le Mesurier, do you recollect this cart coming to your master's, and the prisoners at the bar coming with it. - A. Yes, My master came out with a candle, he told me to look into the hay basket, I looked in and pulled out nine bottles, I put them on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took them in afterwards. - A. No, I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>HENRY - sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. Q. You are coachman, do you recollect this cart being there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners dine in the kitchen. - A. Yes, and the carman came to dinner in about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect your master calling you to the cart. - A. Yes, I saw the lad take five bottles out of the basket, and afterwards four more; my master told me to take the empty prickets out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men hear your master order you to search the cart. - A. They might have heard it, he spoke loud enough; as soon as I saw the men they said there was a small hamper in the cart, which they had forgot, I found the hamper and took it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290027"/>Q. The carman did not come for ten minutes after these men, might not he have taken them nine bottles in at that time. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity for taking away the nine bottles if he had been so inclined. - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this hamper of wine, you heard the men ask for this small hamper of wine and say they had forgot it, you cannot tell whether it was before or after your master ordered you to search the cart. - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed to carry any load from Mr. Le Mesurier's Warnford court, on the 15th of October. - A. Yes, I cannot say exactly the day of the month, it was a fortnight yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. There were thirteen prickets I believe, and a one dozen hamper, who put that hamper in. - A. One of Mr. Heathfield's men, one of the prisoners at the bar, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Court. They put it in at Warnford court. - A. Yes; when we came to Hackney we unloaded the prickets, they told me that the one dozen pricket was to be left in the cart, but it was not, one of them took it down in the cellar; then they began to put the wine away, and after they put part of the wine away, I cannot say how much, they told me that the one dozen hamper was to come back, they told me to put it in the cart, I did, and I brought it up stairs by their order; some considerable time after that they said there was some bottles in one of the prickets, and they told me to take them out and put it in the hay basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you to put them in the hay basket. - A. I cannot say whether they did or did not.</p>

               <p>Q. I dare say you thought that two men had better be hung than one man, than you; when did you first tell this story. - A. When I had my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken in custody, and then you told this story. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And not before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were doing an honest thing. - A. I cannot say, I was only the carman, I spoke the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. You must know they were full bottles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must know that you were carrying away a quantity of wine belonging to Mr. Le Mesurier. - A. I cannot say what they meant to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know they were carrying away Mr. Le Mesurier's wine. - A. I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATHFIELD sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. You are a wine merchant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course a judge of wine. - A. Yes; when I was at Mr. Le Mesurier's, Mr. Le Mesurier pointed out nine bottles of wine in a bin, he said that sherry had been put into them; on examining them I found two bottles which I said had not been mine, we took them out of the cellar, 
               <persName id="t18061029-31-person354">drew</persName>
             the cork of one and tasted it, it was Madeira, we did not draw the cork of the other; I examined the bottle with the candle, it appeared to be red port; the other seven bottles were the bottles that I had sent to him to be applied to the sherry and the same fort of wine appeared to be in them.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to see these men in prison. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold out any threat, or promise them any favour to induce them to say to you what they did. - A. None, they asked me to be as lenient as possible with them; I told them they could not possibly have any favour from me. I then left them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they deny all knowledge of the transaction. - A. No, not to me.</p>

On Wednesday the 15th of August I observed a bottle of gin up the chimney in the back washhouse; the same evening I found a bottle of rum in a cupboard in the beer cellar; on Saturday I found another bottle of rum in that cupboard. I missed the first bottle of rum on Wednesday night; when I went to bed it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the gin that you found up the chimney. - A. I missed that on Thursday morning. In consequence of some advice, a friend of mine marked fourteen empty bottles with a file at the bottom of them; we put them in the cupboard where the rum had been; this was on Saturday. On Sunday morning I got a friend to place himself in the coal cellar a little after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that coal cellar situated. - A. It is opposite the spirit cellar; the spirit cellar is on the side of it, there is a kind of a lattice work or railing; I observed on the Sunday morning a nail drawn from one of the rails, and there were only twelve bottles remaining in the cupboard, and I saw the officer take two marked bottles out of the kitchen; they were behind some washing tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did these two bottles contain. - A. One rum and the other gin, they were full.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you rum and gin in that cellar that you are speaking of - A. Yes, in casks.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are an acquaintance of Mr. Smart's. - A. Yes, he applied to me on the Saturday night respecting some liquor. In consequence of what he and I agreed on, on Sunday morning about five minutes before six in the evening I concealed myself in his coal cellar, in a way so as not to be seen by any person coming down the stairs; about a quarter after six the prisoner at the bar came down the cellar stairs, he had a lighted candle in his hand, he placed it upon one of the ale barrels next to the liquor cellar; he got two quart bottles and a pint pot, he placed them on the barrel where the candle stood, he then got over the liquor cellar door, he stepped one foot on the ale barrel, and them climbed over; I saw him go over the door, the door is about four foot high; he then took the two bottles and the candle through the lattice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lattice open. - A. It was open enough for him to take an empty bottle through, he was then within the cellar, I saw him fill the bottles with liquor; where I was placed I could see all over the liquor cellar by the light, I saw him fill the two bottles, he filled them out of different casks, he took the pot and drew near a pint of gin from the barrel into the pot; having so done, he knocked down one of the bars of the lattice work, and put the two bottles out upon the ale barrel, he then put out the pint of liquor and the candle; he then got over the door the way that he got in. Having done that he took the bottles away, and afterwards took the pint of liquor and the candle, and went up stairs: Where he took the liquor to I cannot say.</p>

               <p>DANIEL BISHOP sworn. I am an officer. On Sunday morning the 19th of this month I took the prisoner into custody at Mr. Smart's, and in the wash-house behind a washing tub I found these two bottles, one containing rum and the other gin. I produce them.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDERSON sworn. Q. Did you assist in marking the bottles on Saturday. - A. I did, I marked fourteen between twelve and one o'clock, I marked them with a three square file at the bottom.</p>
               <p>(The bottles identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I did, I weighed out a parcel of Piedmont silk, ten pounds; I am quite certain as to the weight, I put some silk at the bottom of the bag, as I usually do; I called he prisoner to take the bag to the markers, which he did, he took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcel of silk brought back by Mr. Deboos. - A. I did, in the space of twenty minutes; I weighed it and there was a pound deficient, of Piedmont silk.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you always so attentive. - A. I generally am.</p>
               <p>Q. Then sometimes you are not. - A. I am always as particular as I can be, I was told to be more particular with that parcel than any other.</p>
               <p>Q. You have made a mistake before, did it not occur to you that the men accused you of making a mistake. - A. I have made a mistake at times.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the men said they were wrongfully accused you found that you was wrong, you found that you was mistaken; was not there a case of three pound of silk that you miscalculated. - A. There was once, that was three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Supposing you had made such a mistake before, was the silk found in the men's lodgings. - A. No; I am certain I was accurate with this.</p>

I went to the prisoner's lodgings, where I found Mr. Evans; in a back room, on a bed, I found this largest parcel of silk in a handkerchief; under the bedstead, on the floor, I found this small parcel; I found the prisoner at the public house, next door to the office with Mr. Deboos; I took the silk to the public house, and there I saw Mr. Deboos and the prisoner, and I believe the brother of Mr. Deboos; I then produced these two parcels of silk, addressing myself to the prisoner this way, I have found this at your apartment, how did you come by it; I think his words were, Is a man to convict himself, I said I did not ask you that, how did you come by it; he then said he found it in Paul-street the day before, but it was not his master's.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this on. - A. On Friday the 19th of September. I produce the silk.</p>

               <p>Q. What house does your brother sleep in. - A. We both sleep in one bed; my brother ran down stairs and then he and I pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you take. - A. I took this man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is one of the men that you saw at the privy. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the privy when you took him. - A. About two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running. - A. He was running when we pursued him, but when we got up to him he got up to a corner as if to hide himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other men run. - A. Yes, they were running on when he stood at the corner; I took the prisoner up into Lower-street, Islington, and there I saw Austin, the watchman; I being in my shirt, I insisted on him taking this man to the watchhouse, he and my brother took him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290030"/>watchhouse, in the mean time he was taken to the watchhouse, I went home and I saw I had missed three ducks and a drake.</p>
               <p>Q. They had no bag with them when they went off. - A. No, they stuck the bag in the privy, when they run off; in the mean time I was going up to the watchhouse to tell him what I had lost; the watchman came down to see what I had lost, and my brother found I had lost three ducks and a drake, they were stuck in the privy.</p>

               <p>- DORRINGTON sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. Q. Do you recollect at any time on the 11th of September last, being in Cumberland-street. - A. Yes, at about a quarter to nine in the evening, a man passed me with a copper; I took little notice of his passing me the first time, but he passed me the second time; he was going to go over some fields, but there was some paling prevented him, he turned back and went across Berkley-street. Upon seeing him with this large copper, I suspected it was stolen, and I told the watchman and he pursued him; I was walking slowly along towards the way the watchman went, I heard then a very great sound, as though it was a copper falling upon the pavement in the direction the prisoner had walked in. I rather then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290031"/>hastened towards the spot, and in less than half a minute after the noise of the copper, a man came running along as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that. - A. The prisoner at the bar, with his hat in his hand; I made a catch at him, and he said which way is he gone? what is the matter, or what is it; says I, my friend you know what is the matter; he seemed very much fatigued, I had hold of him by the coat, he just got himself losened from me, but two people coming along, one of them catched him in his arms, or else he would have made his escape; he said I was mistaken in the man, he was going to his father's, instead of that, he was going contrary way to his fathers, he went the Edgeware Road way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I know no further of him than what the neighbours told me where his father lived, and he said he was going to his father's, but according to the account I had, he was going the contrary way, he was stopped and taken to the watchouse; I went with him, I saw the copper at the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the man that you stopped, being the man that passed you with the copper, I ask you as to your belief. - A. I saw but the front part of him as he went past; I did not see the face of the man that passed me with the copper.</p>
               <p>Court. Neither the first nor the second time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot form any judgment whether it was the person or not. - A. I only go from seeing what fatigue he was in; he had his head in the copper when he was carrying it, it covered all his face.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. On the night this happened I was in Berkley street towards Cumberland Place, I heard a tremendous crash, I thought that something had fell down, I hastened toward the spot where it had fell, the watchman sprang his rattle as I came to the corner of Cumberland Place; I heard the cry of Stop thief, I saw this man running, the prisoner at the bar was running towards me, I secured him and took him to the watchhouse; when I stopped him he said it is not me, do not stop me; he seemed to be rather warmish, and he was running very fast.</p>

             sworn. Q. Were you on duty on this night, on the 11th of September last. - A. I was. After Mr. Dorrington spoke to me I went as soon as I could up to the prisoner in Cumberland Place, I said to him my friend what have you got, he made me no answer as I could understand; he had this large copper on his head, he hastened the copper off his head as soon as possible, and threw it on the ground; he turned round and ran towards Berkley street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that towards Mr. Dorrington. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he threw it off his head and ran, did you see his person. - A. I saw his person plainly by two lamps that stood at a gentleman's door; I made towards him, he got away about ten yards from me, he was not out of my sight from the time he threw the copper down till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him taken. - Yes, I saw him at the time he was taken at the corner of the place going into Berkley street, they brought him by me to take him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. You remained with the copper till somebody came to help you to take the copper. - A. Yes, I went to the watchhouse as soon as I could, and the copper was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that copper afterwards shewn in your presence to Mr. Willet and Leach. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Williams you have lately recollected this story, do you recollect going to Marlborough street. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you refuse to identify his person there. A. No, after I saw his face again at the watch-house, I knew him again; I swore to him the first time at Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw this man with the copper, was there any man in company with him. A. There was one walking on his left hand side; as soon as I come nigh that man ran away, which gave me a great suspicion that it was a stolen thing.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Dorrington) Did you observe any body with the man that had the copper. - A, I did not, I was busy talking to a friend of mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my father, he lives in Berkley street; as I got to Cumberland Place the watchman sprang his rattle, I ran to see what was the matter, I passed the watchman while he was springing the rattle, and several people more, there were three or four more people running, and I ran with them, and just as I came to the corner of Berkley street bar, then Dorrington came up and laid hold of me and knocked my hat off and cut my eye; they laid hold of me and took me to the watchhouse, I told them I was going to my father, that he lived within twenty yards where he stopped me; about a quarter of an hour after I had been in the watchhouse the watchman came in with the copper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290032"/>and some more with him, he enquired of the watchhouse keeper which was the prisoner; I was sitting along with four or five more people round me; he says which is the man that you stopped, one pointed me out and says, that is him; he said that is him and I will swear to him.</p>
               <p>Williams. When I came in the watchhouse the prisoner was surrounded, I suppose, by near a score people, he was sitting down on a bench; not seeing the prisoner, so many people being around him, I immediately enquired where the prisoner was, I went up to him, I says that is the very man, I knew him immediately when I saw him; I will swear that he is the same man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any red pocket book about her. A. No, not on her person; there were various other articles found about her, and two duplicates.</p>
               <p>- ATKINS sworn. You went with Mr. Harrison to take up the prisoner in Hare-street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her in custody. - A. Yes. When I went to the top of the stairs and asked the woman that I saw in the room for the prisoner, she pretended not to know any such person; I saw the prisoner sitting near the door, and when I mentioned the name of Mrs. Clements, I saw her moving herself as if to hide herself behind the door. Mr. Harrison went into the room first, and said here she is; I went in and laid hold of her arm; I said I am an officer, I shall take you in custody on suspicion of robbing a gentleman at your master's house, and I told her I should search her, which I did, and in her right-hand pocket, I found in a black pocket book, nine one pound notes; and in her left hand pocket I found three half guineas, two seven shillings pieces, and fourteen shillings and sixpence. I found in her pocket, a silver thimble, and a new gold ring, and in her bundle, I found a new cloak, new stockings, and some new ribbons. I asked her how she came by that money, she said her husband had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290033"/>sent it her.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Harrison) When she hired herself to you did she say that she was married or single. - A. She was married, but he died before she came, after she was hired; her daughter lives at our place now, she is bar maid.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I told her I did not believe it, I believed that she had taken the gentleman's pocket book and money, she burst out crying, and said, hang me if you please, I have robbed nobody, I have picked it up in the gentleman's room, all except two pound, which my husband sent me; she cried very much and said she would not go when Mr. Harrison was gone after the coach, he arrived and we went in the coach; when were we in the coach I asked her what she had done with the pocket book, she said, in the coach, in the presence of Mr. Harrison, that she found it on the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The pocket book. - A. No, the notes; she said she found all the notes, except two pounds, at the top of the stairs, she repeated it several times going to the office; when I went to Mr. Harrison's Mr. Harrison had got the pocket book, which was found on the leads under the window where this woman slept, there is a person here to speak to that. I produce the pocket book, I had it of Mrs. Harrison, she is not here; the boy is here who took it off the leads.</p>

             sworn. I am a carpenter; in the morning as I came to work at six o'clock, passing by the window of Mr. Thorn, I perceived the shutter and the sash open, I knocked at the door, and the servant girl opened the door to let me have the tools, I told her that the window was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go down and see how they came in. - A. I went in for my tools, they lay in the same room which had been broken open; I work on the premises.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) How was the window opened. - A. It was opened by the man that took the things, I suppose.</p>

I suppose it was opened at the time I heard the noise, and I suppose they had raised the bolt of the shutter and shook the window, and I supposed that was the noise that I heard in the night, it is a ground floor window.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He must have got over some palings to get at the window, it is a trafalgar building, they are all enclosed, and there is no garden at all to it. When he got over the railing he could then very easily get into the house, by opening the shutter.</p>
               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn. I am a farmer. On Sunday the 19th of October, I was walking about my ground, in the middle of my ground I have a wood.</p>

Going through the wood I turned my head round, and saw something white; I immediately made up to it, and when I got within twenty yards of it I saw the prisoner sitting and apparently picking marks out of a sheet; he appeared to be in that position. I went up to him and saw there was a large quantity around him, and he was in the middle of it, I said to him my friend, what do you do here, he said I am drying some clothes, I then laid hold of a part of it and it was wet; I said to him you scoundrel you have stole it; his answer was that he had found it; I then took him by the collar and secured his hands behind him; I told him I thought that if he had found it he had no occasion to come to so secret a place as that to dry it; I took him to a neighbourr's house, a constable, but he was not at home; I then took him to a Mr. Horner's, and he committed him to the cage, being Sunday, he was a new magistrate and almost the first time of acting; I then brought him to Bow-street and took care of the linen; it is here.</p>

             sworn. I am a smith, I live at Islington. Last Monday I saw the three prisoners go by where I went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. What time. - A. About half past three in the afternoon, Arthur and Gray went into the cook's-shop, and Williams stood looking in at the window; I went and did my job, and when I came back, it was about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I went into the shop and asked Mrs. Perrot if she had lost any weights, I had one or two chaps for stealing of weights, and I thought they had been stealing of weights. I found a two pound weight, a one pound weight, a half pound and ounce weight upon Arthur; the pound, half pound and ounce weight belonged to the prosecutrix, but this weight, I never found an owner to. I made the best of my way to the City Gardens, I looked over the fields on the bank, I saw Arthur and Williams tossing up in the fields; Gray, the little one, was standing looking on. I went up and told them they must go along with me, I tied Arthur and Williams together and searched them. On 
               <persName id="t18061029-45-person463">Arthur</persName>
             I found a two pound weight in his left pocket; a one pound, half pound, and an ounce weight I found in his right hand pocket, two shillings and seven pence halfpenny in money. On Williams I found sixpence in halfpence. On 
               <persName id="t18061029-45-person464">Gray</persName>
             I found nothing.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Arthur's Defence. As I was coming along I met these two boys, they said they were going a little way, I went along with them; they went in for a pennyworth of pudding, and I went in for another pennyworth of pudding.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. I never was in that shop, I know nothing of the shop.</p>
               <p>Gray's Defence. Please you, my lord, he took the weights out of the scale and put them in his pocket; I asked him what they were, he said nothing. I did not know what it was till the constable searched him.</p>

             sworn. I live in Baker's row, Whitechapel. This man stopped me at East Smithfield, he asked me if I would buy the glass, I told him yes, and I would give him a good price for them; he took me to the Black Horse, where this glass lay; I says to him here is two pence half-penny for you, go in doors and get a pint of beer while I go and get change for a ten pound note; through that I went up and acquainted the gentlemen of the factory. He asked me twenty shillings for them, I left him in doors while I went; I returned, I pulled out a guinea, I told him I would give him a guinea, a shilling was no object, and just as I was going to pay him the guinea, Mr. Lee and Mr. Carter came in and laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Israel) Are these the glasses the prisoner offered you. - A.Yes, they are worth forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And he would have sold them to you for twenty. - A. For less, I suppose, if I would have bought them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, not called any witnesses to character.</p>

On the 3d of October I left my counting house, and from thence I went to Doctors' Commons about six o'clock in the evening; I left Doctors' Commons about nine in the evening, and was going towards home. In Bunhill row two women accosted me, they asked me to give them something to drink; I consented. After some few words had passed, we went into the White Swan, Bunhill row, nearly opposite the Artillery gate; we had two glasses of gin and water there. After I had paid for it I went lower down with them to an adjoining passage (I beg leave to observe in the mean time, had I not taken a glass of liquor I certainly should not have submitted to have gone); I went to an apartment in <placeName id="t18061029-47-crimeloc266">Blue Anchor Alley</placeName>

I was then solicited very strongly to stop all night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay. - A. Not above an hour and a half from the time I entered the room to the time that I left the house, I had then twelve one pound bank notes, which I changed a check for at Smith's, a gold broach, and several other things. I even went to bed there; I had not been in bed long before my coat fell from a line where it was hung, I found my small memorandum book absent immediately, it was inside of my coat pocket, I made my alarm to the parties, the prisoner at the bar was present, there was a second person in the room, I heard her rush out immediately, I then searched for my umbrella, I found it absent, I repaired immediately into the street, and called for assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your property again. - A. None, I could not get the watch; immediately I went to the watchhouse in Bunhill Row, to obtain a constable, when I returned to her apartment she was absent and a padlock was on the door; I continued my searching until one o'clock in the morning, without effect; the next morning early I repaired to the house, and was informed that she had not been home all night, I then found by difficult search that she was gone to her mother's (whom I did not know) at Brick Lane, I accordingly went in search of her, and met her walking down the lane with her mother, I recognized her immediately, I took her by the arm and told her she must go with me, she went with me and stood in the street some time while I got a constable; the constable secured her and brought her before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women had you spoke to that night as you were walking along. - A. I do not believe that I had spoken to any person previous.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a little fresh. - A. It brought me to my recollection afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you stopped by any other women. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your book. - A. In my side coat pocket, outside; I rather suspected that the prisoner at the bar took it and gave to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to accuse her taking it, the other woman might as well as her. - A. I admit it in one sense, but I do not believe it; I cannot swear that the prisoner took it, I do not think that the other woman took it, she was on the reverse side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were upon the bed; you never found the other woman. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, I searched her, I found nothing at all upon her.</p>

On the 20th of this month I received information, I went to the last witnesses' house and I enquired for the prisoners; she denied for a long time, at last I found there was a box sent down to St. Alban's to be left at the Peacock; there I found the box, they had not come down, I left word with a friend when they came, to apprehend them; in consequence of that, they were apprehended; I received a letter from the magistrate of St Alban's. I went down and took them coming up, the woman confessed where she had pledged them; I found them at two pawnbroker's, the man said they never should have done it if it was not for Mrs. Lea; we found no tickets upon them, nor should we have found them out if the woman had not confessed.</p>

There is a side gate to the shop, I went to see if he had gone out that way, I then had a view of both my master's gate at the end of the street where I stood; I stopped there a short time, I could not see him, I went back again, and as I was going down my master's yard, I saw him again in Long Acre, turning down Charles-street, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, come back to Mr.

             have been missing iron a long while, and I was watching to see who did it. I told him I saw him take it, he begged me not to bring him back to Mr. Holditch to prosecute him, I told him he should come back, that Mr. Holditch might see who took the things out of the place. I brought him back to Mr. Holditch, I told Mr. Holditch that I detected him taking the iron out of the shop, I said here it is at his breast; I took out these two pieces from his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they. - A. They are spring steel; some we sell for old steel and some me work up; some that runs long and good we can work it into new steel; the four pieces of steel are worth one shilling. Mr. Holditch went and got an officer, the officer searched him and took the other iron from his person in my presence. I saw him take up two of the pieces of iron, and one of the pieces that was taken from him I was working of the night before.</p>

               <p>SIR, - You will do me the favour to call upon Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co. to receive two thousand five hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>I told him that we had no order from the house at Manchester to pay the money; he expressed his disappointment, saying that he had fifteen thousand pounds in their hands, he said it would be very inconvenient to him, as he had made some engagements in Oxford road; I then asked him if he knew any body in the neighbourhood that could identify him, he said no, he was a stranger, having come from Brighton the day before. I told him it was impossible for me to let him have the money without he could bring some person to vouch the truth of what he said. I begged he would call again, when my partners would be in, I would keep open till near eight o'clock for him; he went away, leaving the letter he had produced in my possession.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you ever shew him the letter that you received on the 24th. - A. I did not, I told him I was sorry I was not at home the day before when he called; I asked him to walk in, which he did, I said it was a little extraordinary that our house had not apprised us of the money that he wanted, he said he was surprised at it, he had fifteen thousand pounds in their hands; he told me that he had written to them and they had sent him that letter.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you look at its contents. - A. Yes, it has the same contents as that which was produced to me, I believe it to be the same hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say for what purpose he produced it to you. - A. He did not say for what purpose, he applied for a letter of administration.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced that as something verifying his claim, that he was the right person. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He presented this to you in order to make you think that it was correct. - A. Yes, I asked him what relation he was, he said he was the brother.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say what Neason, what did he describe him, as a private in the army. - A. To the best of my recollection he said he was a corporal, and that he shared as a private.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are sure that he mentioned the word corporal. - A. I believe he did, I am pretty positive. I then asked him if the deceased died a bachelor, he said he did; I asked him if had left either father or mother alive, he said no; I asked him if there were any other relations in equal degree with him, or any other brother or sister, he said that he did not know that there were any alive, he believed they were all dead; in consequence of which I prepared the usual warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that. - A. A warrant which is drawn, leaving the administration; I then described to him what he was to swear, I told him to swear that he believed the deceased died a bachelor intestate, without a parent, that he was the natural brother and next of kin; he accompanied me before the surrogate, the surrogate is the officer who administers the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290040"/>oath.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Mr. Ward) Is that letter your hand writing. It is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Smith.) Upon his producing this to you what did you direct to be done. - A. I then told him that I had not heard from Dublin; as it appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290041"/>to be a question to come before the board of directors, and not to be decided by myself, I desired him to write a petition to go before the board; (the petition read in court) I saw him sign it, after he had signed it, I told him that he must wait a few days longer, that he had better come the next Saturday, as I had directed him first to do, in order to receive an answer from my letter. On Saturday the 24th of May he came and produced a duplicate of the letter of administration, on that day, the 24th, I told him that I had received an answer from Dublin to my letter, by which it appeared that the person he had referred to knew nothing of his family or person.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these persons. - A. Mr. M'Gennis, (our agent to whom I wrote to did not think it necessary to apply to Mr. Curran,) he did not know any such person as James Neason, or any of the family. He affected much surprise, and said that Mr. M'Gennis knew his family very well, for that he had worked for him a long time, he then gave me other references to persons in Dublin, one of the name of Figgeny, a mealman, and one Flood, that kept an eating house in Dublin; I told him that I would write to Dublin again, that he might attend in a few days, but as I had every reason to believe him an impostor, I referred him to a board that is put up in my office, stating part of the act of parliament, and several persons annexed to it who had been convicted under it; I told him if he was not sure that he was the real brother of Mr. Neason not to let me see him again; he persisted in it still that he was the real brother, and asked me if I thought he would come so often if he was an impostor; he then went away, I told him to come again some day, he came again afterwards; at that time I had another letter from Dublin, I told him the contents of that letter.</p>
               <p>Court. What time did he come afterwards. - A. I do not know exactly the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it time enough for the return of the post. - A. It must be in the beginning of June I think, I then told him I had another letter from Dublin; that one of the men he had referred me to, Mr. Figgeny, the mealman, had been dead six years (he had told me that he had left Dublin six weeks); he described Mr. Figgeny as a person then living, and had referred me to him for his character; I told him that Mr. Flood, the other person that kept the eating house, was dead near ten months, and the widow kept the house still, never heard such a name as his; he seemed to be surprised as before, and begged that I would write again to Mr. Curran. After that he came twice upon the business, once with a letter from an attorney, requesting to know why the money was not paid, and the second letter was to know why the letter was not answered; the first letter came by the post, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q.At either of the times that he came did he see the secretary. - A. He did, one Mr. Dyer; I took him down to the board, in course the secretary, Mr. Dyer, spoke to him, I was with him all the time he was before Mr. Dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner when he was taken in custody. - A. I saw him in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promise or any threat to make him confess. - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person. - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then tell you whether he was the person that he represented himself to be. - A. He told me that he was not; he said that he was not the brother of

               <p>Court. What day did he call. - A. On the 10th of April last, he said he was entitled to prize money. I then asked him if he was the nearest relation of the deceased, and whether the deceased died without a father or a mother; he said that he had died a bachelor, without a father or a mother, and he described himself to be the brother and next of kin; I am sure that he described himself as brother. In consequence of this I prepared the usual warrant, leaving the administration; having so done, I informed him the nature of the oath that he was to take, and then I accompanied him before the surrogate, Dr. Coote.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you explain to him the terms of the oath. - A. It is my general custom so to do, and I believe I did; I went with him before Dr. Coote, the surrogate, and the oath was administered to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any hope held out to him to confess that, and that he should be made use of as a witness against others. - A. Certainly not, he appeared himself extremely anxious, and desired to disclose every thing that he knew of the transaction; he would frequently appeal to his maker to what he was saying, with extreme sorrow and contrition for what he had done and he attributed it to a man of the name of Gibbons. He said he was resigned to his fate, and he hoped it would be a warning to others, that he came of a respectable family in Ireland, and he was very sorry for the disgrace he had brought upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he sworn to that examination. - A. No he was not sworn at all.</p>
               <p>- DORRINGTON sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Did you take up the prisoner. - A. I took him into custody; I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you yourself or any other person to your knowledge made use of any promise or any threat to induce him to confess. - A. I did not, I do not know that any other person did.</p>

             at Monk's, a little before Christmas last, Smith came to me at Woolwich, where I was then one of the keepers of the convicts, he then said do not you know Smith that you have been in company with at Monk's; I then immediately recollected him, we went to drink together at a public-house, Smith then said you can give me the names of some of the 87th regiment that were on board the Eurus frigate. I did not think there was any harm in mentioning them. I told Smith several names, I have forgot them now, I paid for what we had to drink. Sometime after Christmas, I was discharged from Woolwich, I met Smith and Gibbons, Smith professed a great deal of kindness to me, as well as Gibbons, they invited me into a public-house, Smith asked me for some more names, saying that the names I had given him before were of no use, he did not find they had been on board, I gave him some more names, Gibbons asked me for some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290044"/>names, Smith seemed unwilling to let him have any names; after some words had passed then Gibbons began to ask me a great many questions about them, what sort of men they were, whether they were short or tall, and what complexion, and many other questions; after drinking some time we parted and I went home to my lodging. Sometime in the month of March Smith came to my lodging, and I and Smith went to Monk's lodging; Monk took a roll out of his trunk, Smith wrote the names down and put them in his pocket; we all went to a public house and had some conversation over some beer, nothing particular passed, nor did they say what they wanted their names for. A few days afterwards we stopped close to the commissaries office, a little way down Charing Cross; I had there met Smith and Gibbons, Smith said he would do something for me if I would be a good boy, his wife had gone out and brought a true search of Thomas - . The next day I called upon Smith, Gibbons was there, and Smith said he was not able to find any thing out of the Eurus frigate, I told him then that captain White was major, and that he lived in the Edgware Road. The next time I saw Smith he told me that he had seen major White, that he told him he was

On the 30th of September, about half after six, a gentleman came in the shop and informed us that a person passing by took something from a horse at the door; I missed a pelisse from the horse, I pursued the prisoner, and in Rider's court, Cranbourn-street, I saw the prisoner drop the pelisse from her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is this woman. - A. Yes, I took up the pelisse; it is my master's property.</p>

               <p>Court. He charges you with dropping it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was standing by the image shop when he catched hold of me, it is a false oath that he has taken.</p>

On Monday the 29th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, a young man that I had seen before in company with my husband, came to my house to enquire for my husband, he told me that he had left a man and a woman at the Cape of Good Hope, he came to my husband to know if he could give him any employment; I went with this young man that came to my husband, to shew him where my husband was; as we went along we met the prisoner at the bar and her husband in Ann-street; we all went to the Five Bells at Limehouse, where my husband was, and my husband asked the two men in; I asked the woman if she would go home and sit at my house till her husband knew whether he could have employment or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What line of life is your husband in. - A. He is a foreman in the West India Docks. The woman went home with me and sat down, in the mean time I was called out to go to a gentleman that I have attended at Limehouse for three years; when I was going out I took the candle from the table and looked at the silver watch that hung over the fire place in the front room where I had been sitting with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room when you looked at the watch. - A. Yes, it was half past six by the watch, but it was half past seven by the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this watch did not go well. - A. No, it had lost some time in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. It had lost an hour by the day. - A. Yes, I went out at that time, I desired the prisoner not to leave the place till I returned, I left my little girl with her, her name is

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, my husband went down to this man after some work. The man with my husband went to this woman's husband, and asked this woman where her husband was; this woman went to the public house with my husband, this woman asked me to go home with her; when I went home with this woman there was a woman in the house who was cooking a supper. I had not been there long before a man came in, he took great liberties with the woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What woman do you mean. - A. Mrs. Schofield. After this man had been gone out about five minutes, Mrs. Schofield followed this man, my lord, she asked me to stay until she came back, I told her if she was gone long I would not stay until the came back. After this woman had been cooking supper she went in next door and left me and the little girl alone; I asked this little girl to be so good as to give me a bit of candle, as I wanted to go into the back yard. I came in and bolted the door after me, I gave the little girl the candle and thanked her, then I set down by the side of the door in the same seat that I was in before, I told the little girl I must go when the clock struck eight. I went to the public house and staid till ten o'clock, and Mr. Schofield was with me; when I came from there me and my husband went into Whitechapel to the Blue Boar tap, there we staid, it might be two hours, my husband and me came together into Newgate street; when I came to my lodgings Mrs. Schofield was at my lodgings, Mr. Schofield said that he had lost his watch, I told him that I did not see the watch, he sent for the officer to search me, and when the officer had searched me he told the officer to take me to the watchhouse and strip me; when he searched me, I told him he might do as he pleased. I never took a pinsworth from any body in my life, I had not been long out of the country.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us how you lost it, and what time of the day was it. - A.Between three and five in the afternoon; I was eating my dinner there, I had occasion to draw out my purse to get a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You dined there did you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at that time. - A. Yes, I was both hungry and dry, I went in and dined there; this happened after dinner, I was preparing to go away, I had been there perhaps an hour and a half, I had drank two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking any thing else in the day. - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know. - A. I cannot know.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not drank that day before to be intoxicated. - A. No, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the landlord close by when you took out the purse. - A. Yes, he saw that I had gold and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you miss your notes at last. - A. If you remember, I told you I was in the act of getting change; I laid the notes down while I was looking at the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you took the notes out of your purse. - A. I am certain of that, because I put them in my teeth, and I laid them on the table or dropped them on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you put them on the table or dropped them, you are not certain. - A. I am not certain as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the house before you missed the notes. - A. Almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you change for the seven shilling piece. - A. He did, and I looked at the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you had left the house you had not missed the notes. - A. No, I had not missed them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you be sure that you did not take them out of the house and dropped them, as you do not know whether you had them on the table or dropped them on the floor. - A. I recollect that I forgot putting them up in the purse.</p>

               <p>Q. You recollect that you forgot is an odd thing, how could you recollect afterwards, when you tell me you do not recollect whether you put them on the table or dropped them on the floor. - A. The next morning I drawed the purse out and not till then.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time in the morning. - A.As near as I can guess it might be about midday.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought at that time they were in your purse. - A. I looked to be certain that I had got the money ready for the payment of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took out the purse and perceived that the notes were not there. - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be certain at that time that you had left them on the table. - A. I recollected that I put them down from my hand while I was looking at the silver; I put the silver in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you spend the evening after you had been to the public house. - A. I went home directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the five pound note since. A. I have, I think it was on the 21st or the 22nd of October, I saw it at Mr. Frith's.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that it was the same five pound note that you had lost on that day. - A. What do you ask me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290047"/>Q. Are you sober now; the question I ask you is, how are you certain that it is the same five pound note that you lost at the prisoner's house. - A. If you will hear me I will tell you, Mr. Frith sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was the same note. - A. Yes, I knew the note, I had made a mark upon it, there was an endorsement of J. Dewry. I saw Mr. Dewry endorse it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that endorsement upon it when you lost it. - A. Yes, certainly, I never parted with it till I lost it, I wore it always. When I saw it in the possession of Mr. Frith I claimed it, I said it was my note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time between the 13th and the 21st and 22nd, speak to the landlord about it. - A. I did; as soon as I missed it the next day I went to Mr. Hughes, and told him that I had lost it at his house, and I told him the endorsement upon it; I told him over and over, because I went to him several days about it, he denied having seen them. After I had seen it at Mr. Frith's I went into the prisoner's house, he said he heard what happened, he said, Mitchell, I have heard that you have come to the knowledge of one of your notes; I told him yes, that I had seen it, and I said that I hoped to see the other ten pound note again, as I think I am sure they were rolled together; I said if you have found them I will not mind being something handsome for a dinner; he still denied knowing any thing about them.</p>

On the next morning he said she had lost the bank notes, I said I was very sorry; he said that he had been in the city to pay the bank notes away, the man was so very busy he could not receive the money, he must go again; he told me to look if I had got a note of the name of J. Dewry, which I had not. The night that he lost them. I did not refer to the two five pound notes I had taken on that day.</p>

               <p>Q. You examined this boat. - A. I did; on the 18th of September, I went on board the boat, the three prisoners were on board the boat, I went into the cabin, we had a suspicion, I looked into the cupboard under the side bed, I found this dozen pair of worsted stockings, I asked them how they came there, I said it is a very improper place to put this parcel, they said they did not know how they came there; they were among loose ropes; I said I was positive they must know something of their coming there; there was tarpaulin tied over the cargo, it would have been impossible for any body to untie the tarpaulin and get at the cargo without their knowledge; they said themselves there were no passengers on board. I had them taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent Mr. Wallworth to Mr. Lewis, to make inquiry. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Mr. Wright) You had not an opportunity of seeing the packages when you detected the stockings. - A. I saw the package, we were in a greathurry of business, I did not know of any truss being broken open, there might be two dozen pair taken out, I should not have observed them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is your house. - A. No. 15, York street, Westminster, she said there was a dispute between her landlord and the landlord's landlord, her landlord owed a twelvemonths rent; I gave her leave to leave them there a few minutes, as I knew the woman; in about a couple of hours afterwards I heard that Pointer had robbed a soldier of a bundle, I employed an officer to bring Mrs. Pointer to my place, to take the bundle away; when she came I asked her what she brought that bundle there for, she said it belonged to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bundle afterwards delivered to Renny and Gillmore. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. I am a shoemaker, I live at No. 68, York-street. On Monday, the 22nd of September, about five o'clock in the afternon, Mrs. Pointer brought a bundle into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lodge in your house. - A. Yes, and her husband lived with her, she asked me if I would take care of this bundle for her, I told her I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the husband afterwards. - A. No, I heard him go into his own room about three quarters of an hour before the bundle was brought into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. What regiment is the prisoner in. - A. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290049"/>Coldstream guards. She gave me strict charge not to let any one have it, come who would, but herself; I suspected from her own words that the bundle was not her own, I gave the bundle back again to her; the next morning I saw the bundle afterwards, I believe it was the same bundle that Mrs. Pointer left with me; when I was telling my landlord of it at the lower part of the house where the lodgers fetch their water from, I put my hand in between the ceiling and the floor, and I took out a brush, the prosecutor said it was his. The prisoner Pointer, and every lodger in the house, had the use of that kitchen.</p>

             sworn. I am the landlord of the White Horse. On the 22nd of September, the prosecutor came into my house to ask for lodgings, it was between three and four in the afternoon, I saw him bring the bundle in and lay it down on the bench in the tap room; directly after that the prisoner came in with two of his comrades, he sat close to where the bundle was, and he and his comrades drank to the amount of three pots of beer, and then they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they went away, had Theodore left the room. - A. Yes, he had left it a great while, he went to the cook's shop to get his dinner, with nine recruits; I saw him leave the bundle behind him when he went to dinner, but I did not see the prisoner take the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour of the day did Pointer leave the room. - A.About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Pointer's wife come into the tap-room while he was there. - A. No, I had not seen her all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Theodore's bundle before he found it out the next morning. - A. No, about eight o'clock he missed the bundle; then I had a strong suspicion that it was Pointer that took the bundle. I sent for two officers from Queen square, and the prosecutor and the officers, together with myself, went to the house where the prisoner lived, and there the brush was found, as has been described while I was there.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a patrol to the public office, Bow street. - A. Yes; on the 17th of October I went into a public house in the Strand, I cannot recollect what day of the week it was, it was about seven o'clock in the evening; on the 17th of October I apprehended him at the Blackmoor's Head, Exeter-street, Strand, I received information from Price the landlord; I found all the property here; he had got the hat upon his head, he was wearing the coat, waistcoat, shirt, small clothes, and stockings; I found another shirt tied up with the gloves and the braces; I produce them, I have had them ever since, except the small clothes, those he wore when he went to Tothil fields bridewell; he has made away with them by some means.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor). Jenkins, look at these articles, you have examined these articles. - A. Yes, they were the things that were in my bundle, I know them all, I know the hat by the stamp.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did he make any application to you to borrow your clothes. - A. No, not a word of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent from the Cobham's Head, Clerkenwell, for a pail of yeast, when I got into Bloomsbury Square I met a journeyman baker, he had got a quartern loaf in his hand, he says will you have any thing to drink; I said I cannot stop, I have another pail of yeast to get, he says you can stop to have part of a pint of beer, my basket stands there, fetch me two quartern loaves of bread, I am only going to take this loaf into Southampton-street, accordingly I went and turned the basket down; as I took the bread out, he mentioned the journeyman baker's name that belonged to the basked, I said it is the journeyman that sent me for the bread, if you will hold the bread I will go and fetch the man, I run down Southampton-street, I could not see the man; I put the pail of of yeast on my shoulder and went on.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer belonging the Thames police office. I know nothing further than apprehending the prisoner on the 18th of October. He knew me perfectly well, he saw me very early in the morning out of the window, he asked me if I had got a warrant against him, I told him I had, he immediately bid his wife open the door and let me in, I was so far satisfied of his innocence, that I took his word and his attorney's for his appearance, he knew the charge was for stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no right to take his word for his appearance, you did very wrong, we are not trying the prisoner by your opinion of him, have you the watch. - A. No, the watch was brought to the office by Strong, and claimed at the office by Languist.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH KING sworn. I live in Cinnamon street, Wapping, I keep the sign of the White-hart, Languist lodged with me, on the 10th of October about four o'clock, he drank tea with me.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he left your house, do you know whether he had a watch or not. - A. I am quite sure that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he drank tea with you, was he sober or not. - A. Yes, he was as sober as I am at this minute, I heard that he was arrested at seven o'clock, I went then to the lock-up house, I was then informed that he had lost his watch, he said he supposed it was taken from him by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know any thing about the watch, I never saw the lame man in my life, (Henry Strong) they they have got a spite to me and that is they reason the have done it; I came of a respectable family, I think myself better than to do such things as them. The prosecutor said when I was down along with him for that you show me to the officer, I shall do you a spite again; I do not think that he could do any more spite to me than he has done.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JENN sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. You are a sheriff's officer for Middlesex. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand the prisoner accompanied you and pointed out the prosecutor for you to arrest him - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in the street it was about five o'clock, what distance was it from the public house that you found the prisoner at your house. - A, About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite daylight. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing the conduct of the prisoner during the time that you were on the journey to your house. - A. I was close behind him, arm in-arm with the attorney's clerk. I think he could not have robbed the man without my seeing of him.</p>

               <p>Q.When you went into the public house, how many women were there. - A. Eight or ten, or more than that; the moment that Ammers shook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290053"/>hands with him, a number of women got around him and he was arrested by Ammers. I said no, it is Johnson, I dare say there was forty women and sailors in the house together. I never heard that the watch was lost till after he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he was not certain where he lost it. - A. Yes, sometimes he said he did not know, but he might have lost it among the sailors, and the women that were there; he said many times that when he got out he would be revenged of the prisoner one way or the other for showing him to the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day had you seen these thing - A. I had seen them on the fourteenth.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been absent from home between the 14th and the 20th. - A. Yes; to put my furniture in. On the 20th, about six or seven o'clock in the evening I entered the room, I found the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have your room door locked. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the padlock been forced or picked. - A. The door was not forced, I found they were both locked; when I come I cannot say, whether he got in at the door or at the window, it was in the front garret.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the window fastened. - A. The window had no fastening at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things again. - A. The next day.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know nothing of your own knowledge, that this man took them. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DONALDSON sworn. Q. You are a constable of St. Martin's in the Fields, did you apprehend the prisoner. - A. I went with a search warrant to No. 45, Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives there - A. Mr. Genou; the prisoner's mother is the house keeper.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Is that the house that you had the room in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I searched the prisoner's bed room as I supposed; I found nothing in that room, I then went down to the landlady, Mrs. Genou, to enquire where her son worked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner. - A. Yes, I told him that I wanted him to go home with me to be present when I searched his bed room; in the shop where I took him, I asked him if he had any keys, with that he pulled out these keys, he said these are all the keys I have; he went home to his bed room with me; I searched his person, I found these two duplicates, one of a table spoon, and six tea spoons; the other duplicates is two sheets, and two table cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any thing by these duplicates. - A. Yes, the prosecutrix, as soon as I got the duplicates, she was very much alarmed indeed; the pawnbroker has got the spoons and all the property. I then told the prosecutrix to bring me the padlock; I tried these keys, they would not open it; I said to the prisoner where is the key you opened the padlock with, he said I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny it.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I am quite sure that he said that, my brother officer is here that heard the same; this other key is the key of the bed room door, and this key will open the room where the prosecutrix's things are; it opens the front, and the back garret, this key was in the back garret door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Can you solmnly swear that I told you that I had lost the key that opened the padlock. - A. You did, you told me that you had lost the key, that I swear to.</p>

He is the person from whom I took the things in; I know him perfectly well, I took these things on him, on the 20th of October; there are six tea spoons, a table spoon, two sheets, and two table cloths. I advanced him two pound ten shilling on them. The property produced and identified by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day that these things were missing, I came home on the latter part of the afternoon in liquor. I was going up to bed, I tumbled against the prosecutor's door; on tumbling down I felt my head soft upon something, I got up with it, and went down the street, I went to this pawnbroker's and pawned them for two pound ten shillings, I was very much intoxicated in liquor at the time.</p>

On the 1st of August I called at the Duke of Clarence's Head, Charing-cross; Mr. Delare had two pair of braces which I knew, from thence I went to Bow-street, I got an officer and went to the prisoner's lodgings, Of-alley, Buckingham-street, and after taking him in custody, I found among his duplicates, one respecting a nankeen pair of trowsers pledged in Chandos-street. The trowsers and the braces are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He has been my journeyman eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>How much did you happen to owe this man at the time. - A. Properly, not one penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you arrested by this man because he could not get his money of you. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much. - A. I think he swore to eleven pound.</p>
               <p>Q. The day after you was arrested by this man, you made this complaint against this man and proceeded as you have stated. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was arrested at this man's suit. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the officer say to you, are you sure that there are no money matters between you. - A. I do not deny it direct, there was some trifling mention of it, I said there was some the day before he had arrested me.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a house keeper. - A. No. On the 15th of October, about seven o'clock at night the prisoners called where I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them. - A. I know Wilson. I took them into my house to shew them a jack; I lit a candle, and put it down on the dresser; they took the candle and blowed it out. I had no fire, we went out after that; when I came home again, I went to look what o'clock it was by my watch; it hung by the dresser, just by where he stood; it was gone. I had locked the door, and had got the key of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent. - A. About an hour and a quarter, or thereabouts, when I returned my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the only reason that you accuse these men. - A. Yes, because there was nobody in the house, when these men were in, and while they were there I looked to see what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Wilson call upon you after you had accused him of stealing the watch; did he not tell you that he would bring an action against you for defamation of character. - A. I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after that, that you went to Hatton Garden. - A. I thought he had taken it in a joke, and would return it again; he came and offered me a guinea and a half if I would make it up with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel.</p>
               <p>Wilson called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hughes called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes, she asked me for a twopenny loaf , then she asked me for a stale half quartern, I put one down to her, that came to sixpence halfpenny , she put down a shilling, I was going to give her change in copper, she asked me to give her sixpence in silver; I gave her sixpence out of my right hand and with my left hand I picked up the shilling from the counter, instantly as I picked the shilling up Mr. Ankers and Mr. Jenkins came in, they asked me what money I had taken of the woman (she was present), I told them that shilling that I had in my hand, Mr. Ankers said look at it, I looked at it and refused it, I said it was not a good one; Mr. Ankers looked at the shilling, saying, that he had one before, he had rubbed it, he said that is not the shilling, she has that shilling upon her now he believed; Mr. Ankers then ordered the constable to search her, she put her hand in her pocket and laid half a guinea on the table, she said she had no other money, they believed that to be a good half guinea; the officer turned her pockets out and found six sixpences and thirteen or fourteen pennyworth of halfpence; she took the half guinea from the counter and put it into her mouth, the officer forced it out, and then three shillings came out of her mouth; they appeared equally as bad as the other shillings .</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening that we have been speaking of the prisoner came to your house. - A. Yes, she asked for a glass o gin, she tendered me a shilling, which I discovered to be a bad one, I laid it on the floor and rubbed it with my foot and spoiled it, then she offered me half a guinea, I told her I I could not change it; she told me she had taken the shilling of a butcher in Leadenhall Market, she would carry it back and get it changed; I followed her into London Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. In going there did you see Jenkins, the constable. - A. I desired him to go with me, I followed her into Mr. Newbury's, I saw Spall, I asked what she gave him, he said a shilling, he sounded it on the counter, he pronounced it a bad one, I then immediately gave her in charge to the officer; he searched her and produced some halfpence and six sixpences out of her pocket; the sixpences that were taken from her were good.</p>
